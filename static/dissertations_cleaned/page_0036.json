The instability of the swirling flow may lead to the formation of a helical precessing vortex called the \u201cvortex rope\u201d. The vortex rope causes efficiency reduction, severe pressure fluctuation, and even structural vibration. \nThe primary objectives of the present study are to model and analyze the vortex rope formation using high fidelity numerical simulations. In particular, this work aims to understand the fundamental physical processes governing the formation of the vortex rope, and to investigate the capability of turbulence models to simulate this complex flow. Furthermore, mitigation of the vortex rope formation is addressed. Specifically, a vortex rope control technique, which includes injection of water from the runner crown tip to the inlet of the draft tube, is numerically studied. \nA systematic approach is considered in this study starting from the simplest and advancing towards the most complicated test case. First, steady simulations are carried out for axisymmetric and three-dimensional grids in a simplified axisymmetric geometry. It is shown that steady simulations with Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models cannot resolve the vortex rope, and give identical symmetric results for both the axisymmetric and three-dimensional flow geometries. These RANS simulations underpredict the axial velocity by at least 14%, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) by at least 40%, near the center of the draft tube even quite close to the design condition. Moving farther from the design point, models fail in giving the correct levels of the axial velocity in the draft tube. This is attributed to the underprediction of TKE production and diffusion near the center of the draft tube where the vortex rope forms. Hence, a new RANS model taking into account the extra production and diffusion of TKE due to vortex rope formation is developed, which can successfully predict the mean flow velocity with as much as 37% improvements in comparison with the realizable k-\u03b5 model.  \nThen, unsteady simulations are performed, where it is concluded that Unsteady RANS (URANS) models cannot capture the self-induced unsteadiness of the vortex rope, but instead give steady solutions. The hybrid URANS/large eddy simulation (LES) models are proposed to be used in unsteady simulations of the vortex rope. Specifically, a new hybrid URANS/LES model in the framework of partially-averaged Navier-Stokes (PANS) modeling is developed. This new model is one of the main contributions of the present study. The newly developed PANS model is used in unsteady numerical simulations of two turbulent swirling flows containing vortex rope formation and breakdown, namely swirling flow through an abrupt expansion and the flow in the FLINDT draft tube, a model-scale draft tube of a Francis turbine. The present PANS model accurately predicts time-averaged and root-mean-square (rms) velocities in the case of the abrupt expansion, while it is shown to be superior to the delayed detached eddy simulation (DDES) and shear stress transport (SST) k-\u03c9 models. Predictions of the reattachment length using the present model shows 14% and 23% improvements compared to the DDES and the SST k-\u03c9 models, respectively. For the case of the FLINDT draft tube, four test cases covering a wide range of operating conditions from 70% to 110% of the flow rate at the best efficiency point (BEP) are considered, and numerical results of PANS simulations are compared with those from RANS/URANS simulations and experimental data. It is shown that RANS and PANS both can predict the flow behavior close to the BEP operating condition. However, RANS results deviate considerably from the experimental data as the operating condition moves away from the BEP. The pressure recovery factor predicted by the RANS model shows more than 13% and 58% overprediction when the flow rate decreases to 91% and 70% of the flow rate at BEP respectively. Predictions can be improved dramatically using the present unsteady PANS simulations. Specifically, the pressure recovery factor is predicted by less than 4% and 6% deviation for these two operating conditions. Furthermore, transient features of the flow that cannot be resolved using RANS/URANS simulations, e.g., vortex rope formation and precession, is well captured using PANS simulations. The frequency of the vortex rope precession, which causes severe fluctuations and vibrations, is well predicted by only about 2.7% deviation from the experimental data. \nFinally, the physical mechanism behind the formation of the vortex rope is analyzed, and it is confirmed that the development of the vortex rope is associated with formation of a stagnant region at the center of the draft tube. Based on this observation, a vortex rope elimination method consisting of water jet injection to the draft tube is introduced and numerically assessed. It is shown that a small fraction of water (a few percent of the total flow rate) centrally injected to the inlet of the draft tube can eliminate the stagnant region and mitigate the formation of the vortex rope. This results in improvement of the draft tube performance and reduction of hydraulic losses. Specifically in the case of the simplified FLINDT draft tube, the loss coefficient can be reduced by as much as 50% and 14% when the turbine operates with 91% and 70% of the BEP flow rate, respectively. In addition, reduction (by about 1/3 in the case with 70% of BEP flow rate) of strong pressure fluctuations leads to more reliable operation of the turbine.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10451], "author_name_tesi": "Foroutan, Hosein ", "last_name_ssi": "Foroutan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hosein", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Savas Yavuzkurt", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "John Michael Cimbala", "Gita Talmage", "Cengiz Camci", "Eric Paterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Savas Yavuzkurt, Dissertation Advisor", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Chair", "John Michael Cimbala, Committee Member", "Gita Talmage, Committee Member", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Member", "Eric Paterson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vortex Rope", "Draft Tube", "Computational Fluid Dynamics", "Turbulence Modeling", "Hydaulic Turbine", "Hydropower", "Renewable Energy"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Health Monitoring Applications for Small Wind Turbines\n", "id": "11907", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "772", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Costly failures have plagued industrial-scale wind turbines in recent years, and these failures have spawned the development of systems designed to provide continuous data on the health of these machines.  Though they vary in implementation, the common goal of these systems is to detect potential faults before they lead to catastrophic failures and extended downtime of the turbine.  The most basic condition monitoring systems typically employ vibration sensors placed at key locations in the machine that can detect faults that develop within the main bearings.  Torsion and bending sensors on the tower are also used to identify and distinguish various types of blade imbalances, be they aerodynamic or mechanical in nature.  The purpose of this investigation was to develop methods for fault detection on a residential-scale wind turbine.  Two separate fault detection experiments are presented in this thesis.  \nThe purpose of the first experiment was to detect and qualify the severity of an inertial imbalance seeded on a Whisper 500 turbine in the field.  Such imbalances are typically the result of ice buildup during normal operation.  Through the observation of passive vibration spectra from a tower-mounted accelerometer, two separate imbalance cases were able to be successfully detected and differentiated from the baseline case.\nA second test was conducted on a dynamometer with the purpose of detecting a seeded fault within one of the wind turbine\u2019s main bearings.  It was shown through the use of envelope analysis that lab-grade accelerometers could successfully detect vibration frequencies that indicated the presence of a seeded outer race fault in the Whisper 500\u2019s rearmost bearing.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [766], "author_name_tesi": "Forshey, Brenton Ross", "last_name_ssi": "Forshey", "middle_name_ssi": "Ross", "first_name_ssi": "Brenton", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis K Mc Laughlin", "Dennis K Mclaughlin", "Karl Martin Reichard", "Susan W Stewart"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Dennis K Mclaughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Martin Reichard, Thesis Advisor", "Susan W Stewart, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["bearing", "detection", "fault", "condition", "monitoring", "health", "energy", "wind", "imbalance", "structural health monitoring"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "OCEANIC ANOXIA EVENT 2 (93.9 MA) IN THE U.S. WESTERN INTERIOR  SEAWAY: HIGH RESOLUTION CALCAREOUS NANNOFOSSIL RECORD OF THE  TROPIC SHALE FORMATION", "id": "14863vxf909", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14863", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Oceanic Anoxia Event 2 (OAE2) occurred at the Cenomanian/Turonian Boundary \n(CTB; 93.9 MA) and had a duration of < 1 m.y..

This longitudinal study examined how children\u2019s temperamental characteristics and maternal parenting qualities were associated with stable and dampening (i.e., cortisol reactivity to stressors in infancy but not toddlerhood) patterns in children\u2019s cortisol reactivity and recovery. The sample (n=547 mother-infant dyads) was ethnically diverse and included predominantly, low-income families from rural communities. Children\u2019s saliva was sampled before and after emotion eliciting, challenge tasks. The children\u2019s behavioral reactivity was coded and saliva was assayed for cortisol. Results revealed that children who exhibited frustration during infancy and fearfulness during toddlerhood were more likely to show dampening cortisol reactivity than no reactivity or hyporeactivity (consistent NON-reactivity) across early childhood. Alternatively, children who showed fearfulness during infancy and toddlerhood were more likely to demonstrate consistent cortisol reactivity than dampening reactivity and consistent NON-reactivity. Furthermore, infants who had highly engaged mothers had a greater tendency to exhibit dampening cortisol reactivity than consistent cortisol reactivity and NON-reactivity. Finally, children with positively engaging mothers at infancy and toddlerhood were more likely to demonstrate consistent HPA reactivity with immediate versus delayed cortisol recovery. In contrast, toddlers with negatively engaging mothers were more likely to have delayed versus immediate cortisol recovery. The findings are consistent with the theory of allostatic load (e.g., McEwen, 1998), and suggest that our understanding of how HPA reactivity and recovery influences child development may be advanced by differentiating inter- and intra-individual differences across time.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1018], "author_name_tesi": "Fortunato, Christine Karen", "last_name_ssi": "Fortunato", "middle_name_ssi": "Karen", "first_name_ssi": "Christine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Drs Lisa Gatzke Kopp & Douglas Granger", "Douglas Michael Teti", "Douglas A Granger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Drs Lisa Gatzke Kopp & Douglas Granger, Thesis Advisor", "Douglas Michael Teti, Thesis Advisor", "Douglas A Granger, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["temperament", "infant", "cortisol", "maternal sensitivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "UNLOCKING THE HETEROGENEITY OF EXTERNALIZING PROBLEMS ACROSS EARLY CHILDHOOD:UNITING NEUROBIOLOGICAL, PARENTING, AND DEVELOPMENTAL PERSPECTIVES \n\n", "id": "12639", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13228", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Heterogeneity in externalizing behaviors such as conduct problems impedes the elucidation of underlying developmental mechanisms. Recent studies suggest that individuals exhibiting conduct problems may show entirely discrepant patterns of biological vulnerabilities depending on whether they have comorbid internalizing problems or not.

The current study examines theoretically derived hypotheses regarding the developmental risk pathways that differentiate children with conduct problems who do and do not manifest comorbid anxiety.

In contrast, children with comorbid internalizing problems were typified by the interrelationship of heightened stress responsivity and high behavioral approach tendencies at 15 months of age. While both children with and without comorbid anxiety displayed exacerbated stress responsivity with greater exposure to intrusive parenting, the developmental time points that this biological sensitivity to context became apparent was different.\n\nThe present study provides a better understand of the developmental mechanisms in that undergird distinct externalizing problems phenotypes with and without comorbid internalizing problems in early childhood.

Monoclonal antibodies are designed to fill these gaps by engineering antigen binding regions capable of targeting and eliminating dangerous molecules. The monoclonal antibodies can function when isolated and able to travel through the blood stream. However, immunoglobulin efficiency decreases upon self-association for two reasons. First, the immune system may recognize the associated molecules and eliminate them depending on the size of the aggregates. Second, if the molecules associate in such a way that the antigen binding regions are no longer accessible they will be unable to function.\nThis thesis discusses molecular simulation techniques that can be used to study the structural changes that occur due to intrinsic molecular flexibility in immunoglobulin molecules as well as the structure of small aggregates that form through self-association. One solvated immunoglobulin molecule was studied by explicitly representing every atom however coarse-graining techniques were required in order to study multiple molecules in the same system.\nThe role of terminal galactose residues in the carbohydrate attached to the Fc domain in an atomisitc model of an antibody molecule was studied in this work. Carbohydrate mobility as well as the protein\u2013carbohydrate hydrogen bonding interactions were compared between simulations with and without terminal galactose residues. It was shown that one of the two biantennary terminal galactose residues preferentially interacts with the protein when both were present; however, when both were removed the carbohydrate structure changed such that new protein\u2013carbohydrate interactions formed. This change in solvent accessible protein surfaces will be an important area of study to both increase effector functions and decrease self-association involving the Fc domain.\nUnderstanding through which residues immunoglobulin molecules interact will lead to better designed monoclonal antibodies with increased aggregation resistance. To aid in this understanding, a previously developed residue level coarse-grained model was employed using the same model molecule from the previous atomistic studies. The residues most often involved in self-association\nof the antibody were individually mutated to alanine and the resulting association frequencies were compared to the \u201cnative\u201d immunoglobulin results to determine the residues most important in self-association. Because of the asymmetry in the three-dimensional structure of the model immunoglobulin\nmolecule used in this work, differences in aggregation behavior between two domains with identical amino acid sequence indicated that molecular structure can play a significant role in self-association.\nThese simulation techniques were shown to be effective at studying molecular flexibility and protein\u2013carbohydrate interactions with great chemical detail as well as the self-association with resolution at the residue level.

Populations of Brook Trout, which are native to Pennsylvania, predominated at\npH<7.0 (mostly headwaters), while Brown Trout, an introduced species that has become\nnaturalized in much of Pennsylvania, predominated at pH>7.0 (lower reaches). The decline of\nhistoric Brook Trout populations has been linked in part to competition with Brown Trout (Hudy\n2005). The relationship between the segregation pattern observed and pH is significant because\nlow pH may be acting as a barrier that prevents further invasion of Brown Trout into the\nheadwaters, where Brook Trout populations remain strong.\nThe overall goal of this study was to examine the influence of pH and species interactions on the\ndistribution of Brook Trout and Brown Trout in Pennsylvania streams. The first study examined\nshifts in Brook Trout and Brown Trout pH preference/avoidance after exposure to different pH\nconditions. Adaptation to pH is important because the results of behavioral studies may differ\ndepending on pH exposure history. Adaptation to pH is particularly important for Brook Trout\nand Brown Trout because these species are often segregated in streams with a pH gradient,\nsuggesting that behavioral responses to pH differ between the two species. In order to study how\nthe behavioral response differed between the two species, it was necessary to determine if pH\nexposure history altered behavioral response. Thus, hatchery-reared Brook Trout and Brown\nTrout were exposed to different holding pH treatments for seven days prior to determining their\nbehavioral response to pH. Preference was determined in a long trough where a gradient of pH\n(4.0-7.0) was presented to fish. Steep gradient choice tanks were used to determine avoidance.\niv\nI found that hatchery-reared Brook Trout and Brown Trout pH preference was not influenced by\nholding pH. Results of pH avoidance trials were similar to that of preference studies, in that\nholding pH did not alter pH avoidance of either species. This study suggested that individuals of\nthese species can be held in the laboratory at a pH different from the source waterbody for a\nshort period of time without altering preference or avoidance behavior. Thus, the pH of the\nlaboratory source water was not adjusted for the purposes of examining preference and\navoidance behavior of wild fish.\nThe second study investigated the pH preference and avoidance of wild, adult Brook Trout and\nBrown Trout using the same methodology applied in the first study. The behavioral response of\nBrook Trout and Brown Trout to low pH is one of factor that may lead to the observed\nsegregation pattern of the two species in Pennsylvania streams. The observed segregation\npattern and behavioral responses to episodic events suggest that differences in the pH preferred\nor avoided may exist. Although pH preference and avoidance of juveniles have been established,\nthe preference and avoidance of adults have not been examined.\nWild, adult Brown Trout showed a preference for pH 4.0 while wild, adult Brook Trout did not\nprefer any pH within the range tested (pH 4.0 \u2013 7.0). Adult Brown Trout displayed a lack of\navoidance at pH below 5.0, which is similar to that reported for juvenile Brown Trout. The\navoidance pH of wild, adult Brook Trout (between pH 5.5 and 6.0) and Brown Trout (between\npH 6.5 and 7.0) did not differ appreciably from earlier study results for the avoidance pH of\njuvenile Brook Trout and Brown Trout. A comparison of confidence intervals around these\navoidance estimates indicates avoidance pH is similar among adult Brook Trout and Brown\nTrout in this study. However, the limited overlap of confidence intervals for avoidance pH\nvalues for the two species suggests that some Brown Trout will display avoidance at a higher pH\nv\nwhen Brook Trout will not. The results of this laboratory study indicate that adult Brook Trout \u2013\nBrown Trout segregation patterns in Pennsylvania streams could be related to pH and that\ncompetition with Brown Trout could be mediating the occurrence of Brook Trout at some pH\nlevels. The preference and avoidance pH results from this study were used to design field\nexperiments involving species interactions and pH.\nThe final study examined the effects of acidification and species interactions on the distribution\nof Brook Trout and Brown Trout. Although pH appeared to be correlated with the observed\ndistribution patterns of Brook Trout and Brown Trout in Pennsylvania streams, our laboratory\nstudies examining the avoidance pH of wild, adult Brook Trout and Brown Trout did not\nconclusively find that avoidance pH differs between these species. The lack of conclusive\ndifference in the pH avoidance threshold did not rule out pH as a mediating factor. Interactions\nbetween Brook Trout and Brown Trout could lead to habitat partitioning in a stream. Brown\nTrout are considered superior competitors, but a physiological advantage may allow Brook Trout\nto dominate Brown Trout in headwaters, particularly if pH is lower. Thus, the behavior of wild,\nadult Brook Trout and Brown Trout (alone and in combination) was observed in study reaches\nthat were manipulated to vary the level of acidity and CO2.\nIn the artificial stream channel, the majority of indwelling fish (fish that spent greater than 0\nseconds on the treatment side during the control observation period) responded to acidification\nby moving to more neutral conditions (62% of Brook Trout and 68% of Brown Trout).\nIndwelling Brook Trout spent less time in acidic conditions during the acid treatment (41 \u00b1 5%)\nthan during the control period (94 \u00b1 2%). However, elevated levels of CO2 may have caused\ntheir avoidance at a higher pH. Indwelling Brown Trout spent less time in the acid conditions\nduring the acid treatment (44 \u00b1 4%) than during a control period (98 \u00b1 1%). The proportion of\nvi\ntime spent in the acid water by indwelling trout decreased as negative interactions with other fish\n(such as chasing) increased. Presence of the opposite species did not influence the proportion of\ntime spent in the acidic conditions. The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that\nacidification mediates the segregation of Brook Trout and Brown Trout in Pennsylvania streams.\nConfounding factors, relating to changes in CO2 associated with the acid manipulation, and\nissues relating to stocking density need further investigation to identify what role these may have\nplayed.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14068], "author_name_tesi": "Fost, Brooks Ashley", "last_name_ssi": "Fost", "middle_name_ssi": "Ashley", "first_name_ssi": "Brooks", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C.

Based on Creek ethnohistoric sources, I characterized resource utility as agricultural productivity and fuel wood availability.   I quantified fuel wood availability and forest resources from federal public land surveys and agricultural productivity from William Baden\u2019s (1987) model of crop yield depletion among Mississippian agricultural systems.\n\tI found that fuel wood is not the most significant and limiting variable contributing to town abandonment among late historic Creek Indians.  Consequently, I applied the marginal value theorem (1976) test solely to agricultural productivity.  These analyses were consistent with the proposition that Creek Indians were optimizing the productivity of land surrounding their towns.  They abandoned towns when agricultural productivity surrounding the town decreased to the average optimum yield for the entire region.  \n\tIn two cases, however, Creek towns were not abandoned at the time of optimal instantaneous resources gain.

The method involves prediction of the mean flow field by solving the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver that employs high-order discretization on overlapping (overset) grid systems.  The method dramatically reduces the artificial dissipation and dispersion of vortical flow features that would ordinarily be lost or degraded with the use of current methods. Complex domains are discretized using an overset grid strategy that allows for the use of multiple high quality structured meshes. The high-order method is developed and incorporated into a generalized overset grid assembly scheme, which allows high-order spatial accuracy of the NSE solutions to be maintained across overset grid boundaries.  Comparisons are made to calculations that do not preserve high-order accuracy at overset boundaries, and insight is obtained into the effects and sensitivities of different treatments of overlapping boundaries.\nA nested block adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method has also been developed, within the context of the overset paradigm.  The method is shown to significantly improve accuracy for a given computational cell count by tracking dynamic vortical features using appropriate dynamic refinement and coarsening,  and its implementation in the context of the high-order overset method is presented.\nThe computational procedures presented herein are tested against analytic and canonical cases (slightly compressible, M\u22640.5, and incompressible mean flows) in order to characterize the accuracy of flow field calculations using high-order discretization and overset schemes across overlapping grid boundaries.  The methods are also extended to far more complex systems including the transport of rotorcraft hub vorticity to distances relevant to interactions with vehicle fuselage and tail empennages.

Drainage was no different in double cropping, single cropping and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) rotations except on a few dates when drainage in alfalfa was lower than in single cropping.

Bilingualism research over the past several decades has explored this interaction in various populations in order to better understand precisely how and when languages interact at different levels of processing. The current dissertation project seeks to add to this body of research by extending what we know about cross-language interaction at the grammatical level during language production.\nThis dissertation presents the results of two picture naming experiments designed to measure the amount of cross-language interaction at the grammatical level in highly proficient L1 German-L2 Italian bilinguals from three different populations. To do this, grammatical gender congruency (i.e., whether a noun belongs to the same gender category in each of the bilingual\u2019s languages or not) of the images to be named was manipulated and naming times were recorded in order to see to what extent the L1 and L2 gender systems influence each other during production. In addition, experimental design and population selection were chosen specifically to directly investigate the influence that speaker-internal and speaker-external factors like language environment, age of L2 acquisition, and experimental context, have on the amount of cross-language interaction experienced by bilinguals under different circumstances. \nResults showed that not all populations of L1 German-L2 Italian bilinguals experience cross-language interaction at the grammatical level, but those that do, do so regardless of language environment or language context (i.e., whether images were named in isolation or embedded in sentences). Critically, some speaker-external factors, such as language environment and predictability of the image to be named, had no influence on cross-language interaction at the grammatical level, but did influence lexical access within the same tasks with the same speakers. This finding highlights the fact that various levels of processing are not all equally sensitive to the same factors during language production. Additionally, this dissertation underscores the importance of collecting and considering all characteristics, both speaker internal and external, of bilingual speakers when conducting research on cross-language interaction, as different combinations of factors may have a critical impact on whether interaction is present or absent.

As foundries seek to meet ever-more stringent environmental regulation, new production technologies must empower foundry operators to meet their environmental permit limits.  Cores are an essential molding component for iron foundries, yet cores produce solid waste and air pollution.  The sand used in cores contributes to the overall solid waste stream from a foundry, whereas core binder degradation during metalcasting is a significant contributor to air emissions.  Thus, the focus of the work herein focuses on process technology to reduce solid waste and a material technology to prevent air pollution generated from iron foundry cores.\n\nThe wet reclamation of waste foundry green sand for use as core sand has been demonstrated with applied ultrasonics, cavitation, settling (UCS) and advanced oxidants (AO).  This technique reclaims sand, clay and coal from waste green sand while operating at near ambient temperature.  The research presented herein evaluated a pilot-scale system that reclaimed waste green sand.  AO treatments have been established as an effective way to diminish VOC emissions during mold cooling and shakeout.  The sand reclaimed by this pilot system was the aggregate in cores that were utilized in full-scale production at Neenah Foundry, Neenah, WI.\n\nFoundry core binders are conventionally petroleum based.  These petroleum based binders are major contributors to air emissions during the casting process.  The research herein conceptualized a novel collagen/alkali silicate core binder.  This core binder demonstrated favorable thermal characteristics, while also resisting core distortion at high temperatures better than conventional foundry binders.  During pyrolysis emission characterization using thermal gravimetric analysis with mass spectrometry (TGA-MS), this core binder did not form many of the compounds attributed to emissions from conventional core binders.  Through FTIR and XPS analysis, there is carboxyl stretching that occurs between collagen and alkali silicates.  The carboxyls present in collagen are converted to carboxylates in the presence of alkali silicates, as demonstrated by XPS with a sub-peak appearing at 289 eV (for carboxylate) and a subdued sup-peak appearing at 288 eV (for carboxyl).  \n\nFurther, this novel core binder was appraised during full-scale tests at Hitachi Metals Automotive Components (HMAC), Lawrenceville, PA; and could make good castings.  When using 0.98% solid binder content of collagen-with-alkali silicates, the cores obtained a tensile strength of nearly 300 psi, which is 80 psi greater than 1.1% phenolic urethane cores.  Also, this novel collagen and alkali silicate binder can produce castings without veining, without the use of anti-veining additives.  These cores also exhibited excellent shake-out properties as the cores were removed in one-half the shake-out time as the conventional shake-out process at HMAC.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12800], "author_name_tesi": "Fox, John Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Fox", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Frederick S.

Diabetic retinopathy is a multifactoral disease that affects multiple cell types within the retina resulting in changes in glial function, the vasculature and neuronal apoptosis. However, the fundamental mechanisms contributing to vision loss remain undefined.\n\nProtein Kinase C (PKC) has been identified as a putative contributor to diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, we sought to explore PKC isotype function within the retina further. In R28 cells, an in vitro model of retinal neurons, activation of PKCs through exogenous application of diglycerides or phorbol esters impairs insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt, identifying a possible role of PKCs in causing insulin resistance in retinal neurons. By immunohistochemistry, PKC isoforms demonstrate discrete immunolocalization within multiple layers of the retina, suggesting that PKCs may be involved in pathological features other than that proposed for the retinal vasculature. However, in examining the translocation and lipid microdomain localization of PKC isotypes from control and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, no significant alterations were observed. Furthermore, analysis of phosphorylation sites on PKCs that can be regulated by upstream kinases or a major downstream target of PKCs revealed no significant alterations. Therefore, we observed no global evidence of PKC activation and if PKCs are involved in diabetic complications it may be in discrete subpopulations of retinal cells. Alternatively, the pathological role of increased diglyceride concentration in diabetes may be independent of PKC.\n\nDespite these negative data, diglyceride metabolism, a regulator of PKCs, may still be involved in diabetic complications. In fact, inhibition of diglyceride metabolism and resultant decrease in phosphatidic acid (PA) formation has been demonstrated to recapitulate some diabetic complications within the retina. We showed previously that mTOR-p70 S6K prosurvival signaling is diminished in the diabetic rat retina and that mTOR signaling is involved in insulin-mediated retinal neuronal survival. Therefore, further understanding of the mechanisms by which mTOR is regulated could have therapeutic implications for retinal neuronal cell death in diabetes. We show that insulin is able to activate p70 S6K in R28 retinal neurons. Furthermore, insulin and PKC activation synergize to further augment p70 S6K. To begin to understand the mechanisms responsible for this synergy, we investigated the role of lipid and non-lipid mediators to negatively regulate the tuberin/hamartin complex, an inhibitor of mTOR. We demonstrate that insulin and PKC differentially phosphorylate and inactivate tuberin. In addition, our data suggests that PKC, but not insulin, activation of mTOR is regulated by MAPK signaling cascade as well as phosphatidic acid, a metabolite of diacylglyceride.  This dichotomy between insulin and PKC/phosphatidic acid activation of mTOR signaling is also a function of intact cholesterol-enriched microdomains. As the retina in diabetes is in an inflamed state, we determined that phosphatidic acid and insulin synergistically inhibited interleukin-1beta-induced apoptosis in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. These results demonstrate that phosphatidic acid and insulin differentially and synergistically activate mTOR signaling to promote retinal neuronal survival. In addition, these data suggest that therapeutic modalities that elevate endogenous phosphatidic acid concentrations may be effective in circumventing insulin resistance in diabetic retinopathy.\n\nTo further explore implications of altered lipid metabolism, sphingolipids were also analyzed. Dysregulated sphingolipid metabolism has been associated with insulin resistance and cellular death in many model systems and diseases. It is thus hypothesized that diabetes alters sphingolipid metabolism contributing to neuronal pathologies in diabetic retinopathy. Ceramide content as well as ceramide metabolites were measured after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of streptozotocin (stz)-diabetes by ESI/MS/MS. After 4 and 8 weeks of diabetes a ~30% decrease in total ceramide content was observed, concomitant with a significant ~30% increase in monohexosylceramides (cerebrosides) levels in fed diabetic rats compared to their age-matched controls. Acute insulin therapy as well as a short-term lowering of glucose via fasting did not affect the augmented flux through the glycosphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. This altered sphingolipid metabolism in diabetic retinas occurred without any significant changes of fatty acid composition from total lipid extracts, as assessed by gas chromatography. Interestingly, the retina contains a unique fatty acid profile that is enriched in palmitic and stearic acid compared to other tissues. As a positive control, we observed decreases in 16:1 and 18:1 fatty acids in lipid extracts from diabetic livers. \n\nTo assess the putative biological consequences of altered glycosphingolipid flux, we treated R28 retinal neurons with glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors. This led to increased insulin activation of p70 S6K. Inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis also suppressed glucosamine- and IL-1beta-induced death. Consistent with these inhibitor studies, glycosphingolipid metabolism may regulate stress responses associated with cell death. It is speculated that an increase in cerebrosides, and possibly higher order glycosphingolipids could contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy by contributing to insulin resistance resulting in neuronal cell death. \n\nTaken together, this body of work supports the contention that altered lipid flux (sphingolipid, phospholipid) may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Thus, dysfunctional lipid flux may be a contributor to metabolic stress in diabetes and therapeutic strategies to restore homeostatic lipid flux may be a viable approach for treatment of diabetic retinopathy.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6157], "author_name_tesi": "Fox, Todd ", "last_name_ssi": "Fox", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Todd", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Kester", "Thomas Wright Gardner", "Patrick G Quinn", "Sarah Bronson", "Stanley J Naides"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Kester, Committee Chair", "Thomas Wright Gardner, Committee Chair", "Patrick G Quinn, Committee Member", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Stanley J Naides, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["diabetic retinopathy"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Low-Energy Ionization Yield in Liquid Argon for a Coherent Neutrino-Nucleus Scatter Detector", "id": "17610", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8356", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, antineutrinos have been used to track the power output and isotopic content of nuclear reactors, as the flux of emitted antineutrinos normalized to reactor thermal power varies over the course of the fuel cycle with the change of fuel composition. Since antineutrinos interact weakly with matter, they cannot be shielded and their flux is not appreciably attenuated as they leave the reactor core and structure. As a result, antineutrino detectors can be placed outside of containment and used to track the reactor power and isotopic content within the core. The current generation of antineutrino detectors used for nuclear reactor monitoring utilize the inverse \u03b2-decay detection mechanism, in which the antineutrino interacts with a proton, producing a neutron and a positron, which are subsequently detected in coincidence.\nAnother mode of interaction predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics, but not yet observed, is coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CNNS). CNNS results from the neutrino (or antineutrino) scattering coherently with the entire nucleus rather than a single nucleon. When the wavelength of the neutrino is on the order of the size of the target nucleus or greater (E\u03bd < 50 MeV), the neutrino can scatter coherently off of the entire nucleus. CNNS is of significant scientific interest because its observation would represent another confirmation of the Standard Model. Additionally, the cross section for CNNS scales with the square of the number of neutrons within the nucleus, resulting in a \u223c 100\u00d7 greater per-atom interaction probability when compared to inverse \u03b2-decay. This offers a prospect for CNNS-based nuclear reactor monitoring using detectors with considerably lower active masses.\nThe leading challenge in detecting CNNS is the resulting sub-keV nuclear recoil energies, producing little ionization in the detector medium. In order to detect the CNNS interaction, it is beneficial to first measure the nuclear ionization yield for the chosen detector medium. The ionization yield represents the expected number of electrons produced by a nuclear recoil, and it depends both on the recoil energy and on the detector medium in which the recoil occurs. Additionally, the ionization yield depends on the applied electron drift electric field, and for this reason it should be measured directly in the detector type anticipated for future CNNS measurements. This dissertation is focused on making the prediction and measurement of the ionization yield in LAr using a dual-phase Ar detector.\nDue to the complexity of measuring the ionization yield at various energies, it is beneficial to also construct a predictive model for the ionization yield. In this dissertation, the prediction of the ionization yield is made on the basis of a simulation of a two-stage process. The number of ionizations generated from Ar recoil of a given energy is simulated using a Monte Carlo atomic collision model, along with the cross sections for ionization and excitation in Ar + Ar collisions. After the electrons are generated, a fraction of them recombine with the initially generated ion cloud. The electron recombination fraction is simulated by assigning the emitted electrons either 1 or 10 eV of initial kinetic energy and transporting the electrons under the influence of Coulomb forces of the ion cloud and an applied external electric field. The simulation predicts the energy dependent ionization yield, with a value of \u223c 4e\u2212 per keVr at 8 keVr. For gaseous Ar, the nuclear ionization quench factor is predicted to be \u223c 0.13 at 10 keVr, which is the upper limit on this quantity obtained from the atomic collision model.\nIn order to confidently apply the predictions of the ionization yield model, several experiments have been carried out for its validation. A single-phase Ar detector is used to both understand the processes occurring in the amplification region of a dual-phase Ar detector and to measure the nuclear ionization quench factor (ratio of the ionization signal produced in a nuclear recoil compared to that produced in an electron recoil of equal energy) in gaseous Ar. Using a portable neutron generator based on the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction, the nuclear ionization quench factor at 13 keVr was measured in gaseous Ar to be 0.138\u00b10.012, which is in good agreement with the predictions of the ionization yield model. The absolute ionization yield was not measurable in gaseous Ar, because single ionization electron sensitivity has not been achieved in the single-phase Ar detector.\nThe Gamma or Neutron Argon Recoils Resulting in Liquid Ionization (G/NARRLI) detector is a dual-phase Ar detector, which was developed to measure the ionization yield at energies below 10 keVr. While operating the G/NARRLI detector, high purity was achieved, extending the electron lifetime to \u2248 100 \u2212 200 \u03bcs. The ultimate sensitivity was achieved by detecting the single ionization electron peak. Detection of the single electron peak allowed absolutely calibrated spectroscopy to be performed using 55Fe to produce a 6 keV peak and 37Ar to produce a peak at 2.822 keV and a low-energy peak at 270 eV. Spectroscopic detection of the 270 eV peak represents the lowest energy measured to date in a dual-phase Ar detector. The electron yields for the 55Fe and 37Ar sources were used for the validation of the electron transport code, which was in good agreement with the modeling results. An effort was made to measure the ionization yield at energies below \u223c8 keVr, using neutrons generated from the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction in a similar manner as that performed with the gaseous Ar detector. Unfortunately, the Li target had degraded due to the diffusion of Ag into the Li, and the neutron production rates were \u223c 10\u00d7 lower than expected, which resulted in a low signal-to-background ratio for this measurement. Therefore, the ionization yield model was used alone to predict the detector response to elastic neutron scatters.\nUsing the ionization yield model, the expected signal from the CNNS interaction with an Ar detector 25 m from a nuclear reactor was calculated. It is expected that 70% of all Ar recoils produced by CNNS result in no electrons generated, 14% of the events are predicted to generate a single electron, and 16% of the events are expected to produce two or more electrons. With the addition of 1% Xe to facilitate the Penning ionization mechanism, these values change to 63%, 17%, and 20%, respectively. CNNS is thus predicted to be a viable detection technique for close proximity monitoring of nuclear reactors, but due to its sensitivity to the solar neutrino background, it is not suitable for long range (> 1 km) detection.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8270], "author_name_tesi": "Foxe, Michael Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Foxe", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Igor Jovanovic", "Kenan Unlu", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Professor Tyce De Young", "Dr Kareem Kazkaz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Igor Jovanovic, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Member", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member", "Professor Tyce De Young, Committee Member", "Dr Kareem Kazkaz, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Neutrino", "Liquid Argon", "Ionization Yield", "Nuclear Quenching", "Coherent Neutrino-Nucleus Scatter", "Dark Matter"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Direct Investigation of Collective Phenomena In Patterned Ising-like Arrays Using High-Resolution Kerr Microscopy", "id": "41687h449", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13149", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Magnetic systems with interacting ferromagnetic single-domain elements are a useful landscape to explore a wide range of fundamental and technological phenomena.\nIn this dissertation, we consider a system of interacting ferromagnetic islands with\nperpendicular anisotropy.

The tilted independent column approximation (TICA) is adopted for use in the ARPS model because the existing method of parameterized radiative transfer, the independent column approximation (ICA), permits only the vertical transfer of shortwave radiation. The computed radiative fluxes from both the TICA and ICA are compared to output from a three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer solver and it is determined that the TICA fluxes more closely match those from the Monte Carlo model than do those from the ICA. Additionally, the TICA is able to capture the extensions of shadows that occur when the solar zenith angle deviates significantly from zero, which cannot be captured by the ICA.\n\nThe maximum low-level air temperature deficits within the modeled cloud shadows is 1.5 to 2.0 K, which is only about half that previously observed. The loss of strong solar heating of the model surface within the shaded regions cools the surface temperatures, and changes the sign of the sensible heat flux near the edge of the shadow. This stabilizes the model surface layer and suppresses vertical mixing at low levels within the shaded area. This reduction in vertical mixing means that higher momentum air from aloft is prevented from mixing with air near the surface that has lost momentum to surface friction. The net result of this is a shallower, but more intense vertically-sheared layer near the surface. As the supercell's rear-flank gust front propagates into this modified shear layer, the layer of cold outflow air becomes shallower and it accelerates eastward. In the case of a stationary storm, the cold outflow undercuts the updraft and mesocyclone, depriving them of warm and moist inflow, and ultimately weakening the storm. These results are not likely applicable to all simulations of supercells with radiation because varying surface characteristics alter the amount of frictional drag experienced by the low-level flow. Additionally, the propagation of the rear-flank gust front is heavily modulated by both the strength and the location of the outflow, which are influenced by the choice of the storm-relative wind profile and the microphysics package. If shortwave radiation is excluded from the model, a shallow stable layer forms over the entire domain and the storm becomes elevated and weakens. The direct absorption and emission of radiation by clouds does not significantly affect the simulated supercells.\n\nThe base-state environment is changed to see under which conditions cloud shading and friction combine to force the undercutting of the updraft. Neither a morning model initialization nor a cold season model initialization prevent this from occurring in any of the simulations which produce an anvil shadow. The ground-relative wind is also varied because the surface fluxes of both heat and momentum are not Galilean invariant. A storm in which both the rear-flank gust front and updraft slowly move along the major axis of the anvil shadow becomes undercut, much like the stationary storm. A fast moving storm, however, does not become undercut because less time exists to cool the model surface and to decouple the surface layer if the storm moves faster. If the gust front moves into the anvil shadow and the updraft moves normal to the shadow (i.e., the northward movement of the updraft for an eastward-extending anvil), cyclic behavior can result, although this is highly dependent on storm motion. If the gust front propagates into the full sun (i.e., southward movement), the storm is relatively unaffected by the presence of radiation because the dynamics that govern gust front propagation remain relatively unchanged.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3122], "author_name_tesi": "Frame, Jeffrey William", "last_name_ssi": "Frame", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Markowski", "Paul Markowski", "Yvette Pamela Richardson", "Jerry Y Harrington", "William Menaul Frank", "Andrew Mark Carleton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Markowski, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Markowski, Committee Chair", "Yvette Pamela Richardson, Committee Member", "Jerry Y Harrington, Committee Member", "William Menaul Frank, Committee Member", "Andrew Mark Carleton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["numerical modeling", "convection", "radiative transfer", "supercells"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Transfer Trials on Independent Responding\n", "id": "10773", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3847", "abstract_tesi": "Errorless learning refers to a teaching methods, which eliminates or minimizes high rates of error responding.

There is a large body of evidence that SphK1 levels are elevated in hyperproliferative diseases, such as cancer and atherosclerosis, making SphK1 a novel therapeutic target for limiting aberrant cellular proliferation.  Development of pharmacological inhibitors of SphK1 has been limited by the lack of understanding of the mechanisms of enzymatic activation of SphK1, which has been shown to occur in a biphasic manner.  Early phase activation takes place in a matter of minutes.  It is believed that following stimulation, basally active cytosolic SphK1 translocates to the plasma membrane, where it is further activated by lipid and/or protein cofactors, resulting in a transiently inducible SphK1 activation.  Late phase activation occurs over the course of hours through transcriptional and translational upregulation of SphK1 expression.  The goal of this study is to investigate mechanisms of early and late phase activation of SphK1.  \n     We demonstrate that growth factor stimulation results in a transient accumulation of highly active SphK1 in a distinct plasma membrane microdomain, the membrane raft.  We show that a pool of SphK1 as well as its substrate, sphingosine, reside in membrane rafts by using differential centrifugation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation techniques.  This population of SphK1 exhibited a high specific catalytic activity and was depleted from membrane rafts in cells that had been treated with cholesterol binding agents that disrupt membrane raft integrity.  We further show that following FBS stimulation, SphK1 protein levels at the membrane raft are increased.  This increase coincided with a decrease in membrane raft sphingosine levels and an increase in sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) in the intracellular and extracellular space.  We observed a colocalization of SphK1 with the membrane raft marker GM-1 by confocal microscopy, particularly at the leading edge of HEK293 cells.  Together, these data provide strong evidence that membrane rafts are sites for temporally and spatially controlled induction of SphK1 activity, which has implications in compartmentalization of S-1-P signaling at particular cellular locales, such as the leading edge of a migrating cell. \n\tWe demonstrate that SphK1 is necessary for proliferation of human coronary artery smooth muscle (HCASM) cells.  Our results demonstrate that PDGF stimulation results in increased SphK1 mRNA levels within 3 h, followed by an increase in SphK1 protein synthesis and enzymatic activity that is observed 8 - 24 h later.  Using a panel of pharmacological inhibitors, we identified the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway as a key regulator of late phase SphK1 activation involving transcriptional/translational upregulation.  Utilizing isoform-specific siRNA for each isoform of AKT (AKT1, AKT2, AKT3), we identified that AKT2 was necessary for an increase in SphK1 mRNA, protein, and activity levels following PDGF stimulation.  In contrast, depleting AKT1 or AKT3 levels did not have an effect on abrogating the response to PDGF.  These data imply that inhibition of AKT2 could limit the level of SphK1 protein produced, thus controlling cell growth rates.  \n\tSeveral lines of evidence suggest that SphK1 activation is downstream of protein kinase C (PKC) signaling.  It has been reported that SphK1 is phosphorylated in vivo by ERK1/2 and also an unidentified kinase [1].  We show evidence that the additional kinase that phosphorylates SphK1 is PKC.  We show that PMA, a direct stimulator of PKC, activates SphK1.  It has previously been demonstrated that specific inhibitors of PKC (bisindolylmaleimide, calphostin C, g\u00f6 6976) inhibit SphK1 activation.  We show that the PKC&#61537; isoform phosphorylates SphK1 in vitro as well as increases SphK1 activity in a dose-dependent manner.  Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified Ser371 as the most likely site of phosphorylation of SphK1 by PKC.  Additional studies, including phosphoprotein analysis and kinetic analysis further suggest that Ser371 may be phosphorylated.  Collectively, our data provide mechanisms that can be exploited in the development of therapeutics for hyperproliferative disease that are able to target both the acute and the transcriptional and translational phases of SphK1 activation.

One of the first steps scientists look along this timeline is how potentially important molecules, such as early forms of peptides, lipids, and nucleic acids, could have formed. In some cases, it seems plausible that these molecules could have been created on Earth through a sequence of reactions with simple precursors, including methane and cyanide, catalyzed by an electric shock. In other cases, it is proposed that meteors that hit the Earth\u2019s surface brought a menagerie of early molecules that could have acted as precursors for the biomolecules that are pertinent in modern biology today.\t\nA second step along this timeline that scientists are particularly interested in is how these newly formed molecules could have been concentrated to form some of the first protocells. Environmental conditions such as warm little ponds, which circuitously evaporate and refill, and porous rock, which would attract various charged molecules to their surface, are examples where potentially important molecules could concentrate, interact, and form the first non-membranous compartments. These highly concentrated environments could have facilitated some of the first autocatalyzed reactions, such as ligation, polymerization, and cleavage. RNA was thought to play a key role in some of these initial pertinent reactions, for its dual functionality to autocatalyze self-cleavage/self-ligation reactions and store genetic information.\nA third step represents a progression from the second, through the cultivation of more advanced self-catalytic systems. One of the biggest challenges in the origins of life is the ability for a system to self-replicate. Under most RNA systems, RNA replication uses a template strand to build a complementary strand off of, one nucleotide at a time. One limitation for early replication methods is strand dissociation of the product-template complex in order to promote turnover of the template. Again, the earliest primordial systems could have used environmental changes such as temperature and pH to denature template-product complexed to allow for turnover to occur. \nIt is important to note that these steps are relatively arbitrary and most likely did not happen sequentially. It is more than possible that many of these events could have occurred at the same time. Moreover, there are many other steps not included herein, and it is almost certainly the case that the number of steps to reach the earliest organisms may be countless. This thesis, however, lies right at the cusp of steps two and three, as it focuses on the compartmentalization and catalysis of RNA molecules. \nOne key obstacle to forming longer polymers of progenitor molecules would be to concentrate precursor molecules into compartments. In Chapter Two, I characterize the compartmentalization of nucleotides in the presence of a long polyamine. The combination of these two charged molecules spontaneously formed liquid phase droplets in solution, which are referred to as complex coacervates. I find that these coacervate droplets could strongly partition these nucleotides and metal ions, reaching concentrations in the molar regime. Having non-membranous protocells, rich in these types of molecules would may have been important for the generation of primitive polymers.\nIt seems unlikely that earliest forms of RNA would have catalyzed self-cleavage reactions using only one mechanistic pathway. In Chapter Three, we investigate one small RNA enzyme, the hammerhead ribozyme, which uses different methods to activate the general base for catalysis, depending on the environmental conditions. It explicitly reveals RNA\u2019s adaptability to efficiently auto-catalyze reactions no matter the conditions, by means of perturbing nucleobase pKa\u2019s. This theme is carried out into Chapter Four, which broadens the scope of pKa shifting into a platform that can be utilized by RNA and protein scientists. Often pKa shifting can significantly increase catalytic efficiency, yet is seldom observed in experiments. This chapter uses thermodynamics to probe pH dependent interactions that would otherwise be undetected by traditional experimental methods.\nThe thesis merges into the third step in Chapter Five with the evidence of multiple turnover in the hammerhead ribozyme. Under these scenarios, we find that the turnover of the enzyme strand can be easily facilitated by simple changes to environmental conditions. In solutions of high pH and high temperature, the ribozyme can readily turnover nearly 200 times without loss of integrity or degradation. This is quite insightful for drawing some conclusions on how Earth\u2019s environment could have accelerated the generation of more advanced catalytic molecules.\nIn summary, my thesis supports some of the hypotheses leading to the earliest forms of life on Earth. Moreover, some of the phenomena described herein, including the formation of RNA rich non-membranous compartments and pKa shifting, are all found in extant cells, bridging the gap between the earliest primordial chemistry and modern cellular biology.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15589], "author_name_tesi": "Frankel, Erica Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Frankel", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Erica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

One of the main pathways that PPCPs reach the environment is by discharge of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent directly into natural waterways. Although concern of overt toxicity is low, pharmaceuticals are designed to elicit highly specific physiological responses. Release into the environment may result in unexpected biological and ecological responses in target and non-target organisms that permanently alter the dynamics within an ecological system. Antibiotics, in particular, are an area of rising concern, especially for human health, due to selection and development of drug-resistant bacteria that limit the drugs available to fight infections. As cases of resistance increase, the integrity and efficacy of antibiotics comes into question, especially with the development of human pathogens with multidrug resistance. Although, historically, environmental and clinical antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have been viewed as discrete entities, recently, environmental resistance genes have been linked to human pathogens. Scenarios for shared resistance between human pathogens and the environment are becoming more feasible given the influxes of anthropogenic antibiotics into the environment creating selective pressures for environmental bacteria to evolve cross-resistance to commonly prescribed antibiotics. \nCurrently, sewage systems are not equipped to completely remove antibiotics. A main concern about this uncontrolled release of anthropogenic antibiotics into waterways is the conduit created for intimate interactions of environmental bacteria with synthetic antibiotics that may alter microbial communities and negatively impact ecological systems. Due to the nature of wastewater reuse, the presence of anthropogenic antibiotics in effluent and subsequent aquatic environments may allow antibiotics and antibiotic resistance to cycle through ecosystems and eventually impact ecological and human health. One possible approach to mediate the release of anthropogenic antibiotics into waterways is tertiary treatment of effluent in soil, which will not only potentially remove contaminants, but also conserve water resources. Recent research has shown that anthropogenic antibiotics released into the environment have variable impacts on antibiotic resistance in bacteria depending on the system: water, soil or sediment. Of note, the level of antibiotic resistance in effluent impacted soil systems appears to be significantly lower than waterways and sediments. Therefore, tertiary treatment of effluent may effectively remove antibiotics and limit the development of antibiotic resistance throughout ecosystems. \nThe Pennsylvania State University has a unique wastewater renovation system known as the Living Filter where WWTP effluent is spray irrigated on cropped, grassed and forested lands. This site has been in full operation since the 1980\u2019s, is continuously spray irrigated year-round and receives on average 2\u201d of effluent per week. Given the continuous application of WWTP effluent, this site offers a unique opportunity to analyze the potential for soil to tertiary treat the effluent and remove antibiotics as well as analyze the potential impact of low concentrations of antibiotics within the soil and water environment. \nThe purpose of this thesis was to (i) develop and optimize chemical analytical methodology to isolate and analyze concentrations of four antibiotics in soil and water systems, (ii) examine the behavior of these four antibiotics in different soil types, (iii) monitor the presence of these antibiotics in influent, effluent and groundwater at the Living Filter, and (iv) perform preliminary analysis of antibiotic resistance in impacted soil systems at the Living Filter. The antibiotics that were analyzed were sulfamethoxazole (SMX), trimethoprim (TMP), ofloxacin (OFL), and lincomycin (LIN). These antibiotics were selected based on presence in local and national waterways, average annual prescription rates (nationally and locally), presence in the WWTP effluent, potential environmental toxicity, as well as overall public health impact if resistance to these particular antibiotics increased. \nFor the development of protocols for the simultaneous extraction of SMX, TMP, OFL, and LIN from water and soil matrices in Chapter 2, one procedure for either type of extraction did not result in ideal extraction efficiencies for all antibiotics. Therefore, the methods selected were based on the best overall recoveries that could be obtained with one procedure. For water extraction, the Oasis HLB Plus cartridge without a pH adjustment of the aqueous sample was the best method and resulted in recoveries of 118\u00b15.2%, 86\u00b14.0%, 83\u00b15.4%, and 31\u00b11.5% for SMX, TMP, LIN, and OFL, respectively. For appreciable recoveries of OFL (75\u00b11.3%), a pH adjustment was necessary using the HLB Plus cartridge. The soil extraction procedure selected for the simultaneous recovery of antibiotics was the Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE) method with an extraction solution of acetonitrile/water (v/v, 50:50, pH 2.8). Although this method resulted in recoveries of 92\u00b15.5%, 35\u00b17%, and 31\u00b15% for SMX, TMP, and LIN, respectively, OFL was not recoverable during preliminary methodology development with any method. When soils were ground before extraction, the recoveries of TMP, LIN and OFL increased compared to not grinding the soil; however, for SMX recoveries decreased. When ground soils were freeze-dried before extraction, the recoveries of TMP and SMX increased significantly, OFL recoveries only increased marginally, and the recoveries of LIN decreased when compared to ground soils not freeze-dried. The extractability of these compounds was primarily influenced by the pH of the soil or water system and the pKa of the compound. \nThe sorption and desorption behavior of the antibiotics determined in Chapter 3 demonstrated that the type of soil will influence the behavior of the antibiotics. Once ofloxacin entered the soil profile, it was essentially unrecoverable with >99.9% of the original compound adsorbing to the soil profile, as a result adsorption coefficients could not be calculated; however, literature Kd values range from 40,000 \u2013 71,000. For TMP, SMX and LIN, the average Log Kf values determined were 2.8\u00b10.4, 0.92\u00b10.6, and 0.89\u00b10.3 and Kfoc values were 4.8\u00b10.76, 2.96\u00b10.13, and 2.93\u00b10.87, respectively. Trimethoprim exhibited stronger interactions with the soil profile, while SMX and LIN had weaker interactions, as seen by the adsorption coefficients obtained. For TMP the major factor that correlated with its sorption was cation-exchange capacity. Even though when comparing adsorption coefficients the behavior of SMX and LIN appear similar, the key factors that were associated with their sorption were quite different with organic carbon content being correlated with SMX and pH being correlated with LIN. The driving force behind these sorption interactions appeared to be linked to the ionic state of the compound, which would be determined by the pH of the system and pKa of the compound. Based on the sorption analysis of these four compounds, OFL and TMP are expected to be tightly bound to the soil profile and less mobile, whereas SMX and LIN are predicted to have fewer interactions with the soil profile and have higher mobility. Sulfamethoxazole and LIN are the two antibiotic compounds that may have the potential for ecological impacts due to their increased mobility. \nIn Chapter 4, analysis of the concentrations of SMX, TMP, OFL and LIN in the WWTP influent and effluent as well as groundwater at Penn State\u2019s Living Filter during Summer 2013, Spring 2014 and Fall 2014 showed that these four antibiotics are found in the water throughout the year. The highest overall concentrations of these compounds occurred during the spring when the local population and prescription rates of antibiotics would be highest. Concentrations of antibiotics were significantly higher in influent and effluent than in the groundwater. Although, in general, the concentrations in the influent for each antibiotic were higher than the effluent with average annual concentrations of 1.4\u00b12.1 \u03bcg L-1 and 2.4\u00b16.2 \u03bcg L-1, respectively, in certain instances the effluent concentration was higher than the influent.  Yearly average of the antibiotics in groundwater were 37\u00b160 ng L-1. It was notable that the standard deviations were larger than the annual means indicating great variability in concentrations throughout the year. \nSulfamethoxazole was the antibiotic found in all samples at the highest concentrations throughout the year with yearly averages of 1.6\u00b12.1 \u03bcg L-1, 8.0\u00b112.1 \u03bcg L-1, and 72\u00b180 ng L-1 in the influent, effluent, and groundwater, respectively. The other antibiotics while present consistently in the influent and effluent were found variably in the groundwater. Given the low concentrations of antibiotics found in the groundwater, percolation of the effluent through the soil profile appears to remove the compounds and possibly limit the potential ecological impacts. Analysis of the concentrations of these antibiotics in the soil profile would create a more comprehensive picture of the exact fate and transport of these compounds in the Living Filter system as well as provide insight with regard to the potential ecological impacts. \nFor the microbial analyses performed in Chapter 5, optimal culture methods for soil bacteria were determined and preliminary analysis of antibiotic resistance in systems impacted by the application of WWTP effluent with low concentrations of antibiotic compounds was assessed. VL-55 medium with gellan and 0.05% xylan provided adequate total heterotrophic plate counts of bacteria cultured from cropped and forested soils at Penn State\u2019s Living Filter. Additionally, MacConkey and CNA with 5% sheep blood agar for selective culturing of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria provided appreciable plate counts. \nThe preliminary antibiotic resistance analysis showed trends where exposure to low concentrations of antibiotics appeared to alter the incidence of antibiotic resistance compared to a control soil that had not received effluent application or manure application. For the analysis of bacterial isolates, ampicillin resistance was present in all samples and served as a positive control of natural resistance expected in the environment. Ciprofloxacin resistance was not present in any samples and could serve as an indicator of impacts in the future. Resistance to SMX and TMP was present in the soil bacteria previously exposed to low levels of antibiotics, but not present in the bacteria from the control site for Gram-negative bacteria. However, for Gram-positive bacteria, resistance to SMX and TMP was present predominately in control samples. When two SMX resistance genes, SulI and SulII, were quantified, the general trend was for the soil samples that were exposed to WWTP effluent to have higher numbers of the genes compared to the control site. Although this preliminary work demonstrates some trends concerning impacts of exposure to antibiotics, additional work is necessary to fully explain the effects. \nThis thesis work provides adequate methods for the analysis of four antibiotics (SMX, TMP, LIN, and OFL) in soil and water environments. In addition, the behaviors of these antibiotics were analyzed in four different types of soil to determine adsorption coefficients so that sorption and desorption behavior can be estimated for soil environments based on soil characteristics. Understanding sorption and desorption behavior of these compounds will allow estimation of the fate and transport of these antibiotics once they enter a specific soil environment. Quantification of these antibiotics in influent, effluent and groundwater at the Astronomy Site of the Living Filter provided a greater understanding of what is entering the soil system and what compounds reach the groundwater system. Preliminary microbial analysis began to assess the possible ecological impacts of low-level concentrations of antibiotic mixtures on exposed microbial communities and demonstrates that additional work is necessary to fully elucidate the potential effects.

The study consists of in-depth interviews conducted with a sample of women from six counties in North-Central Maryland. A snowball method of sampling was employed to gather participants for the study. The sample is comprised of women who own land that they operate as farms, although they may share the title and operate it in conjunction with others.

Interviews were conducted over a period of four months, and were semi-structured in nature. A phenomenological method of analysis was then employed to draw out themes and make more explicit the experiences of women on their land. This study finds that land holds more than a monetary value to women farmers, serving as a tool of empowerment, a burden, and a physical and emotional connection to family. In addition, social processes also impact the meaning of land ownership, with gender roles and relationships with family members mitigating women\u2019s power on their land.

This thesis examines the relationship between decoding a person's mental state based on facial cues and the ability to remember that person's face. To examine this relationship, I first tested whether differences in the extent to which faces elicit mental state reasoning are associated with corresponding improvements in face memory. I predicted that the more a face elicited more complex mental state reasoning, the better it would be remembered. Additionally, I predicted that the better participants were at decoding mental states from others, the better they would also remember new faces in a separate memory test. Study 1 supported both of these hypotheses. Secondly, I examined whether face memory mediates the common ingroup bias found in face memory. Ingroup bias is defined as better memory for faces one perceives as belonging to their own group. I observed mixed evidence in support of this. Surprisingly, this study failed to replicate an ingroup bias in face memory using the surprise memory test. However, when I used a memory test in which participants were explicitly told to remember faces for a subsequent memory test, I then replicated the own-group bias and found a trend toward mentalizing as a mediator of this relationship. This incidental finding suggests that the own-race bias is in some ways a distinct phenomenon compared to the more general own-group bias, and explanations for how this may be the case are discussed.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5152], "author_name_tesi": "Franklin, Robert Gene", "last_name_ssi": "Franklin", "middle_name_ssi": "Gene", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Reginald Adams Jr.", "Reginald Adams Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Reginald Adams Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Reginald Adams Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["theory of mind", "social psychology", "memory", "face processing", "mentalizing"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Mentalizing and its influence on face memory: A social cognitive and neural investigation\n", "id": "14068", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7219", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mentalizing, or determining what another is thinking or feeling, and face memory are two critical skills for social interaction.

Efforts to understand the impacts of integrated forms of delivery on project success have led to the development of high-performance metrics heavily focused on using project-level metrics and indicators to predict outcomes; however, specialty contractors at the building system-level have an increasingly important role in the design of sustainable buildings.

The owner\u2019s project delivery strategy had a significant impact on team integration.  Strategies that involved construction managers and specialty contractor trades before schematic design achieved higher levels of integration and were more equipped to control project schedule growth.  Cohesive teams reported higher chemistry, goal commitment and timeliness of communication.  Project delivery strategies that required cost transparency with open book contracts generally resulted in a more cohesive teams and a lower average project cost growth.  Additionally, the owner\u2019s perception of turnover experience and building system quality was consistently rated higher for cohesive teams.  \n\nUnderstanding these relationships will make building owners more aware of how early project delivery decisions influence the development of their project teams.  Based on their specific goals, owners may select a project delivery strategy that creates the appropriate team environment for the project.

We understand that dynamic techniques are required to optimize computation in this environment and propose model-driven techniques to first understand performance inefficiencies, then respond with online and adaptive mechanisms. In this thesis, we recognize that the parallelism employed creates contention within and throughout the memory hierarchy, and we therefore focus our analysis in this domain.\n\nThe memory hierarchy extends from on-chip caches through persistent storage in I/O subsystems, and we analyze and develop models of shared data and cache use to understand how parallel applications interact with hardware and why parallel scalability is often poor. Through this lens of these memory models, we develop dynamic optimization techniques for disparate layers of the memory hierarchy. For on-chip multi-core caches, we seek to improve data sharing characteristics for sparse high performance algorithms. Our approach leverages model-driven insight to dynamically change inter-thread access behavior so that it efficiently maps to the given hardware topology. In the I/O subspace, we target the interference caused by concurrent applications accessing a shared storage caches. We design model-driven techniques to both isolate application behavior and dynamically alter inefficient caching policies. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7606], "author_name_tesi": "Frasca, Michael Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Frasca", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Padma Raghavan", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Jia Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Padma Raghavan, Dissertation Advisor", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Member", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Committee Member", "Jia Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["High Performance Computing", "Performance Optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A multi-method investigation of infant behavioral states and weight status\n", "id": "12098", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5651", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions; one way to address this problem before obesogenic behaviors and obese phenotypes emerge is to intervene in infancy.  The goal of this dissertation was to examine infant behavioral states associated with subsequent obesity risk.  Multiple methods were used to study these behaviors in three empirical studies, all in the context of a pilot childhood obesity intervention, with a final sample of 110 well-educated, predominantly White, primiparous mother-infant dyads intending to breastfeed at infant birth.\n\nThe goal of the first empirical study (Chapter 2) was to describe changes over time in and relationships among infant behavioral states and to test a model where effects of a \"Soothe/Sleep\" intervention on weight are explained by increases in total daily sleep duration and decreases in feeding time.  Overall, total sleep, nighttime awake/calm time, total and nighttime fussing/crying, and total and nighttime feeding time decreased, and nighttime sleep and total awake/calm time increased over the first four months of infancy.  Cross-sectional analysis of relationships between behavioral states at each time point revealed that sleeping and feeding were negatively related at 3 weeks, and these inverse relations strengthened over time for the nighttime period but not over 24-hour periods.  The hypothesis that increases in total daily sleep and decreases in feeding time contributed to Soothe/Sleep intervention effects on weight status was supported in breastfeeding dyads but not in formula-feeding dyads.  \n\nThe second study (Chapter 3) examined infants' behavioral transitions using Markov models, demonstrating fewer transitions out of sleep at 16 weeks compared to 3 weeks, as well as substantial individual differences in the likelihood of transitioning out of a fussing/crying state at both time points.  Transitions out of fussing/crying were malleable and predictive of weight outcomes: the likelihood of transitioning from fussing/crying to feeding was positively associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and with subsequent infant weight status.  Additionally, the pilot intervention focused on infant soothing and sleeping increased the likelihood of transitioning from fussing/crying to awake/calm at 16 weeks.  There was evidence that transitions out of fussing had different implications depending on the average duration of a fussing episode preceding a transition to feeding. \n\nIn the third study (Chapter 5), infant temperament was explored as an outcome, a predictor, and a moderator, and results highlighted the importance of a comprehensive investigation of the role of temperament in behavioral intervention studies.  The Soothe/Sleep intervention increased mothers' reports of infant negativity; infants in the intervention group also had higher observed infant self-regulation at 1 year.  Infants with greater observed negativity at 1 year whose mothers were low on initial parenting self-efficacy demonstrated the greatest weight gain from 1 to 3 years, suggesting that promoting early maternal self-efficacy could be protective against increased obesity risk in highly negative infants.  Infant regulation was inversely associated with weight status but was not related to weight gain over time.  Initial infant negativity moderated the effects of the Soothe/Sleep intervention on some, but not all, outcomes.  Negative infants who participated in the Soothe/Sleep intervention showed the least weight gain from birth to age 3, and their mothers showed improved parenting satisfaction.\n\nThese studies confirm that early infancy is a promising time to intervene on a behavioral level to promote healthy behaviors and decreased obesity risk, and results elucidated some of the mechanisms through which a pilot intervention focused on infant soothing and sleeping had its effects, including increased sleep duration, decreased feeding time, and increased transitions from a fussing state to awake/calm.  Weight status data from the current study showed upward BMI-for-age percentile crossing by age 1 on average, suggesting that early interventions are currently needed even in \"low-risk\" samples.  The findings related to infant temperament support the idea that a consideration of individual differences is crucial in behavioral interventions.  Given the homogeneity of the current sample, this point will be particularly relevant in subsequent testing of similar interventions in the broader population.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5648], "author_name_tesi": "Frasca, Stephanie Anzman", "last_name_ssi": "Frasca", "middle_name_ssi": "Anzman", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leann L Birch", "Leann L Birch", "Cynthia Stifter", "Michael J Rovine", "Ian M Paul", "Douglas Michael Teti"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leann L Birch, Dissertation Advisor", "Leann L Birch, Committee Chair", "Cynthia Stifter, Committee Member", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member", "Ian M Paul, Committee Member", "Douglas Michael Teti, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["temperament", "infant behavior", "childhood obesity prevention", "fussing", "sleep", "feeding"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "A Phenomenological Study of Systemic Literacy Change\n", "id": "7858", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1760", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This is a phenomenological study that set out to understand the experiences of school personnel who worked in a poor, rural Pennsylvania school district and participated in Reading First, the early literacy initiative that originated in The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001.

We argue that similarities in vocal learning and neurophysiology between humans and songbirds offer compelling evidence that the two develop vocalization under similar constraints.  A general constraint of motor learning tasks in animals is the requirement of the neurotransmitter dopamine.  In mammals dopamine has been shown to encode reward information that is subsequently used to reinforce motor activity.  We use simplified binary neurons and synaptic plasticity rules to model activity in critical nuclei that are involved in zebra finch song learning.  The model generates exploration in the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) to guide the song trajectory to a stored tutor song.  More specifically, random activity in the lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium (LMAN) drives random exploration of HVC (proper name) projections to area X.  When the model's juvenile song moves towards the memorized tutor template a reward is generated.  The reward is represented by activity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) which globally projects dopamine to area X.  The reinforcement of area X activity is permanently mapped onto the premotor projection from HVC to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA).  The reward activity is delayed by 100 ms for biological reasons creating a temporal difference problem between activity and its corresponding reward.  We resolve this issue using sustained area X activity and a plastic excitatory projection from area X to the VTA.   The model is able to guide song development to the tutor song template by using biologically reasonable connectivity and synaptic learning rules.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1408], "author_name_tesi": "Fraser, David Jeffrey", "last_name_ssi": "Fraser", "middle_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dezge Jin", "Dezhe Jin", "Michael Wenger", "John Collins", "Jayanth R Banavar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dezge Jin, Dissertation Advisor", "Dezhe Jin, Committee Chair", "Michael Wenger, Committee Member", "John Collins, Committee Member", "Jayanth R Banavar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["songbird learning", "Zebra Finch", "Anterior Forebrain Pathway", "biophysics", "neural network", "birdsong", "HVC", "RA", "AFP", "Area X", "Computational neuroscience"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Understanding Use of Social Media for Dissemination of Transportation Information", "id": "24970", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10892", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research explores how agencies use social media and how helpful these technologies are from both the agency and social media-using public perspectives. The impetus for this is the increased use of social media among transportation agencies to reach publics using these technologies. Surveys administered to both transportation agencies and the general public, as well as information collected directly from social media accounts, are used to statistically analyze (negative binomial, logit, ordered logit) how agencies utilize social media.\n \nSocial media content analysis indicates that the content posted by agencies and the mode of the agency (e.g. transit or highway) are particularly important to the popularity of agency Twitter and Facebook accounts. Analysis of the agency survey found greater participation and engagement in social media activities leads to more successful outreach. These activities include events such as monitoring social media for service-impacting events, developing a formal system for collecting content, and establishing a formal social media strategy. Analysis of the general public survey found that those more engaged with technology and less engaged with traditional media have more specific preferences and critiques of agency use of social media.\n\nComparing the results of the surveys, agencies and the general public have a mismatch both in how they perceive success in social media outreach and how information is best communicated. Agencies evaluated their success with social media better than the public did. The agencies also generally thought social media was a better platform for sharing more types of information than the public did.\n\nFrom comparing the results between the two sets of surveys and the content analyses, it is clear that evaluation and guidance tools for social media use for dissemination of transportation information could be helpful to improve the consistency of information shared, a critical weakness identified by the public, because social media are viewed as an increasingly authoritative and legitimate transportation information source.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10483], "author_name_tesi": "Fraser, Janet Lynne", "last_name_ssi": "Fraser", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynne", "first_name_ssi": "Janet", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Peter Jovanis", "Eric Todd Donnell", "Kurt David Johnson", "Martin T Pietrucha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Peter Jovanis, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Todd Donnell, Committee Member", "Kurt David Johnson, Committee Member", "Martin T Pietrucha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transportation", "social media", "communications", "Twitter", "Facebook", "Department of Transportation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The influence of the OECD's governance mechanisms on teachers' responsibilities for curriculum and assessment", "id": "26223", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11463", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My thesis dissertation explores the relationship between the governance mechanisms of the Organization for Economic Development and Co-operation (OECD) and the school levels of teachers\u2019 responsibility for curriculum and assessment.

Several individuals assigned to a new taxon, <i>Homo floresiensis</i>, have been recovered, the most complete dating to only 18,000 years ago.  This remarkable individual\u2014the type specimen, LB1\u2014is represented by the skull and skeleton of an adult hominin which stood just over a meter high, with a cranial capacity of ~400 cc.  One hypothesis about the origin of this controversial material is that this creature evolved from a larger, known hominin that dwarfed over thousands of generations while in isolation on Flores.  In this thesis, I seek to illuminate the debate over <i>Homo floresiensis</i> by informing our understanding of the cranial size and shape changes that accompany species-level dwarfing in non-human primates.  To do this, I quantitatively compare the cranial morphology of three primate species that have evolved smaller bodies than their closest living relatives.  Crania from a total of six species\u2014three dwarfs and three relatives\u2014were measured from museum skeletal collections.  Cranial form, shape, and allometry were analyzed using an array of morphometric techniques, including traditional approaches as well as more recent innovations in quantitative morphology.  I tested the null hypothesis that the dwarf primate species exhibit paedomorphic cranial features, as has been shown in some dwarf mammals (e.g., elephants and sloths), but not others (e.g., goats and hippos).   My results reveal a unique pattern of cranial size and shape evolution in each of the three species.  The dwarf guenon (<i>Miopithecus ogouensis</i>) exhibits stereotypical ontogenetic scaling of the cranium.  The simakobu monkey (<i>Simias concolor</i>) of the Mentawai archipelago in Indonesia is paedomorphic in its large orbits, but its cranium has otherwise typically \u201cadult\u201d proportions.  Finally, shape and cranial proportions in the small-bodied Natuna Island leaf monkey (<i>Presbytis natunae</i>) are essentially isometric relative to larger <i>Presbytis</i>.  This research demonstrates the variety of possible outcomes of evolutionary dwarfing events.  Based on these three case studies, I hypothesize two global models for dwarfing in primates which represent extremes along a spectrum of possible outcomes.  The position of any given species along this spectrum is determined by its own unique natural history.  In considering human and non-human primates alike, these results encourage thoughtful skepticism of some common assumptions about evolutionary processes, particularly with regard to encephalization.

Cells interact with their environments principally through the cell membrane, where lipids, proteins, and other receptors transmit mechanical and chemical signals to the cell interior. More recently, research has shown that as the lipid bilayer membrane bends or stretches, protein activation can occur as areal changes can induce protein conformational changes or changes in protein clustering. Critically, therefore, understanding the energies and forces that determine membrane bending will help understand the nature of mechanotransduction and its associated cell signaling. The erythrocyte membrane is a popular model membrane of study due to the known flexibility of erythrocytes as they flow through the vasculature. In this thesis, a novel method is presented of determining membrane bending modulus and area-per-lipid using lifetime fluctuations of embedded fluorophores. As the membrane bends and flexes, the area around individual lipids or fluorescent lipid analogs is reduced or expanded due to compression or tension, respectively. Because the fluorescence lifetime of many fluorophores is strongly regulated by the immediate local environment of the fluorophore, these areal changes lead to detectable lifetime changes. Using this method, it is shown that the bending modulus of healthy erythrocytes is approximately 55.60 kBT, in good agreement with commonly obtained literature values, and the area per lipid is approximately 44.22 \u00c52, a previously unreported value because it is inaccessible with currently available techniques. These values were also experimentally validated against a novel, low power optical trapping method for detecting membrane mechanics.

These chambers provide an internal environment completely independent of external influences of irradiance, temperature, and humidity. Operators can program a multitude of settings to obtain the desired internal environment. Researchers can investigate a diverse range of plant reactions in growth chambers, including those of light-mediated photochemicals, or pigments. Specialty crop producers can create a stable environment for high value plant material. But regardless of the operator or plant material, one of the largest challenges experienced when using growth chambers is the electrical demands imposed by the lighting technology. \nLighting in growth chambers is often a combination of fluorescent and incandescent lamps. This arrangement emits considerable quantities of heat while also consuming significant quantities of electricity. To remove the heat and maintain the stable internal environment, compressors, humidifiers, and other components also command large quantities of electricity.  A quickly developing lighting technology, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), holds the potential to greatly reduce electrical consumption in growth chambers. The objective of this research was to investigate the impacts LED lighting has on energy and mechanical demands of a chamber, and to evaluate whether plant material responds as it does under conventional lighting sources. \nTwo growth chambers were utilized over two runs of experiments. During each run, a chamber was retrofitted with two bi-spectral LED units, and the other chamber retained the factory installed lighting of fluorescent and incandescent lamps. Plant samples included Phaseolus vulgaris \u2018Fresh Pick\u2019 (bush beans), Raphanus sativus \u2018D\u2019Avignon\u2019 (long French radish), and Lolium perrenne \u2018Double Eagle\u2019\u2122 (perennial ryegrass). Growth inputs, internal chamber environments, and electrical loads were recorded over 21 days. Overall, plant material responded favorably to both lighting treatments, with a slight advantage in dry weight going to beans germinated in the CONTROL chamber. While under LEDs, plant material experienced more stable PAR, air temperature and humidity, and soil temperature and moisture levels.  Lighting in the LED chamber consumed 85% less electricity than lighting in the CONTROL chamber, a 40% decrease in overall electrical consumption of the chamber. The low heat in the LED chamber resulted in lower mechanical stresses on growth chamber components responsible for maintaining the programmed optimal internal environment. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1339], "author_name_tesi": "Frechen, Daniel Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Frechen", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "M AGR", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Agriculture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Berghage Jr.", "Robert Berghage Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Berghage Jr., Thesis Advisor", "Robert Berghage Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy", "fluorescent", "growth chamber", "LED"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of Limit Design for Earthquake-Resistant Masonry Walls", "id": "22724", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9552", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A Limit Design methodology is presented and evaluated for the design of reinforced masonry walls subjected to in-plane seismic forces.

Music is functional as a transmitter of messages and ideas.  Music is meaningful as a ritual and serves as a form of community maintenance. Sacred music in particular was crucial in maintaining culture because it was often through religion that enslaved Africans were able to practice modified African rituals under the guise of Christianity.\nBlack American sacred music has historically been a medium that has functioned as an outlet for the frustration against the dominant ideology of racial oppression in the United States.  This dissertation examines the intersection between Black American sacred music, cultural production, and social protest during an emerging civil rights awareness from 1945 to 1960. As a crucial part of the trajectory of sacred music in the 20th century, gospel music during the 1940s and 1950s captured the collective sentiment of Black Americans.  \n\tThe popularity of gospel music after World War II coincided with civil rights awareness.  This dissertation, based on oral history of gospel musicians, examines how the music created and reinforced social awareness at a time when Black Americans had limited access to mass media.  It argues that, contrary to the view that sacred music served as an escape from the mundane world of politics and social issues, gospel music and performance functioned as an outlet for messages of social awareness.  \nThis time frame is significant for two reasons.  First, this period is widely considered the Golden Age of Gospel. Gospel music was able to reach a mass Black American audience largely through the influx of independent recording companies and radio stations that focused on the Black American community as a viable niche market.  Radio served as an important means of dissemination of gospel music and messages of social awareness. Second, this period is significant because it overlaps a period of early civil rights victories, tragedies, and protests. Social relevancy did not stop with the spirituals. Gospel music in 1930s also reflected the Black experience and addressed worldly issues and even more so 1940s and 1950s, while coinciding with an emerging civil rights awareness.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4769], "author_name_tesi": "Frederick II, Nathaniel ", "last_name_ssi": "Frederick II", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nathaniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ford Risley", "Dr Ford Risley And Dr Matthew Jordan", "Matthew Frank Jordan", "C Michael Elavsky", "Deborah Frances Atwater", "Joseph Jerome Zolten"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ford Risley, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Ford Risley And Dr Matthew Jordan, Committee Chair", "Matthew Frank Jordan, Committee Chair", "C Michael Elavsky, Committee Member", "Deborah Frances Atwater, Committee Member", "Joseph Jerome Zolten, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Black church", "gospel music", "African American history", "civil right movement", "radio", "media history"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Fungal parasites that manipulate ant behavior: toward a mechanistic understanding of an extended phenotype", "id": "nk322d32h", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12852", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parasite manipulation of host behavior represents an extended phenotype of a parasite\u2019s genes through a host\u2019s body. Studying the proximate mechanisms by which a parasite induces abnormal behavior in its host can help us understand how behavior in general is regulated and how such specialized symbioses evolve. Fungi from the species complex Ophiocordyceps unilateralis manipulate ants to die in elevated locations that are suitable for the fungus to transmit to new hosts. This association provides a promising system to discover mechanisms of manipulation using new molecular tools. However, current progress in this system is limited because we lack a cellular context with which to interpret \u2013omics data, and research so far has focused on only a handful of the hundreds of species that exist in nature. \n\nIn this thesis, I use two approaches to explore this fungal parasite\u2019s exploitation strategies and their effects on ant behavior. In Chapter 2 I provide a context for molecular studies by characterizing the cell-level interactions between parasite and host during manipulated host biting behavior. Using three-dimensional microscopy and automated image-segmentation techniques, I demonstrate that the fungus invades host muscle fibers and joins together to form extensive fungal networks throughout the ant\u2019s body. In Chapter 3 I expand our current knowledge on the diversity of the manipulation by comparing transmission strategies of several fungal species. I reveal that infected ants in the Brazilian Amazon display species-specific patterns in biting behavior, and I show that the fungi infecting these ants exhibit periodic patterns of spore release. These findings serve as parameters for future studies to discover the processes underlying these patterns. Overall, the results from this thesis advance the field toward a mechanistic understanding of behavioral manipulation by parasites.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12045], "author_name_tesi": "Fredericksen, Maridel A", "last_name_ssi": "Fredericksen", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Maridel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Peter Hughes", "Christina M Grozinger", "Thomas Charles Baker", "Istvan Miko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Peter Hughes, Thesis Advisor", "Christina M Grozinger, Committee Member", "Thomas Charles Baker, Committee Member", "Istvan Miko, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["parasite", "Ophiocordyceps", "behavioral manipulation", "Camponotus", "extended phenotype", "scanning electron microscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Preservice Secondary Mathematics Teachers' Learning of Purposeful Questioning and Judicious Telling for Promoting Students' Mathematical Thinking", "id": "26237", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11476", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The field of teacher education is currently experiencing a shift towards curricula focused on practices for teaching and professional coursework designed around different pedagogies of practice (e.g., decomposition of, representations of, and approximations of practice).

Large-scale and long-term disturbances such as the construction of dams and commercial dredging operations can affect the hydrodynamics and nutrient flow within rivers.  Habitat heterogeneity is decreased as the natural riffle-pool-run sequences are lost to continuous pools and, as a consequence, lotic species are displaced by lentic species, while generalist and invasive species displace native riverine habitat-specialists.  Sediment and organic detritus accumulate in deep, dredged reaches and behind dams, disrupting nutrient flow and destroying habitat for lithophilic (\u201crock-loving\u201d) species.  I used standard ecological metrics such as species richness and diversity, as well as stable isotope analysis of &#948;13C and &#948;15N, to quantify differences in fish assemblages among dredged and non-dredged sites, and dam-influenced and free-flowing sites, in the Allegheny River, Pennsylvania.  I also examined logperch darters (Percina caprodes) to see whether the reduction of water velocity due to navigation and flood-control dams is correlated with morphological changes in this species.      \n\nDredged sites had the lowest species diversity, while undredged sites had the highest diversity.  Species abundance and diversity were negatively correlated with depth of individual benthic trawl samples, although near-shore shallow water trawls at dredged sites had lower diversity than those similar depths at undredged sites.  These differences were largely driven by the virtual absence of species in lithophilic reproductive guilds at dredged sites.  Stable isotope analysis revealed shifts from periphyton-derived nutrients at free-flowing and undredged sites to primary reliance on phytoplankton and terrestrial detritus at deep-water dredged sites, suggesting a loss of benthic nutrient pathways.   This is consistent with my observations while SCUBA diving that there was effectively no light penetration deeper than 8 to10 m, while dredged areas can be more than 20 m deep.  Larger caudal peduncles are beneficial for swimming in faster-flowing habitats.  Consistent with this expectation, logperch darters from sites in streams and free-flowing rivers with faster water velocities had deeper and thicker caudal peduncles and bodies than those from dam-influenced sites where water velocities are slower.  \n\nThe primary objectives of my dissertation were to investigate fish assemblages in large-river habitats of the Ohio River Drainage of Pennsylvania.  In particular, I evaluated the putative impacts of anthropogenic disturbances (large-scale commercial gravel dredging, and navigation and flood-control dams) on fishes at several ecological scales, while focusing on benthic and lithophilic species.  I accomplished this by examining the effects of these ecological perturbations on fish morphology, populations, and assemblages.  I also fulfilled my secondary objectives by using the knowledge and understanding gained about these large-river fish communities to inform management strategies and provide suggestions for mitigation and minimization of the ecological effects from dams and dredging. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2489], "author_name_tesi": "Freedman, Jonathan Adam", "last_name_ssi": "Freedman", "middle_name_ssi": "Adam", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr.", "Jay Richard Stauffer Jr.", "Robert F Carline", "C Paola Ferreri", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Jay Richard Stauffer Jr., Committee Chair", "Robert F Carline, Committee Member", "C Paola Ferreri, Committee Member", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stable isotope analysis", "multivariate analysis", "benthic trawl"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF SCHOOL READINESS ON SUSPENSION IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL", "id": "15199bnf5", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15199", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThere is an increasing interest in the importance of social-emotional skills and school readiness for youth and a growing concern about the frequent use of exclusionary discipline in schools, yet there has been no systematic investigation of the relationship between social-emotional and academic school readiness and suspension.

These factors included Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) math scores, calculus preparation level as identified through the Penn State First-Year Testing, Counseling and Advising Program (FTCAP) score, high school grade point average (GPA), and the community economic index (CEI) which indicated the percentage of students qualifying for free or reduced cost lunch at a given student\u2019s high school.

Math preparation was positively correlated with the likelihood of graduation in engineering. Non-graduation (as compared to graduation in engineering) is positively correlated with the CEI, although the CEI is not significantly correlated with high school GPA. A multinomial logistic regression showed that the combined effect of the GPA, FTCAP, SAT and CEI does explain 75.6% of the variance in graduation outcome. \nIn summary, access and admission for all engineering college students is determined by pre-college math preparation. High school math preparation is determined by the degree of funding available to high schools which, in turn, is affected by the local tax base or income level of local residents (partially indicated through the CEI). This would suggest that engineering access is not only a result of social and academic conditions, but also of economic conditions that could conceivably have a tangible economic solution. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [218], "author_name_tesi": "Freeman, Amy Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Freeman", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William J Rothwell", "William J Rothwell", "Judith Ann Kolb", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Kenneth Carter Gray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William J Rothwell, Dissertation Advisor", "William J Rothwell, Committee Chair", "Judith Ann Kolb, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Kenneth Carter Gray, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["prediction", "recruitment", "math programs", "minority engineering program", "STEM", "poverty", "race", "retention", "money", "precollege", "underrepresented", "minority engineering", "minority", "math preparation", "summer bridge", "high school funding", "MEP", "diversity", "graduation", "engineering", "multicultural", "funding", "high school", "engineering shortage", "Penn State"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "MAGNETOELECTRIC AND OPTO-MECHANICAL MAGNETIC SENSING", "id": "14692exf181", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "14692", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Magnetic sensors are of ever increasing relevance to modern society.

However, the most sensitive magnetic \ufb01elds emitted from the brain can only be detected by superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which require cryogenic cooling to maintain a superconducting state and require magnetic shielding. An inexpensive room temperature magnetometer technology capable of magnetoencephalography (MEG) and other biomagnetic signals is an active area of research.\n\nThis dissertation provides three signi\ufb01cant contributions to this problem. First, a detailed and comprehensive set of methods are explored and demonstrated in an effort to optimize the magnetoelectric magnetometer, a promising magnetometer technology that may replace SQUIDs in some applications. Second, a novel chip-scale whispering gallery mode magnetometer is proposed, modeled using a \ufb01nite element simulator and\nexperimentally demonstrated with a 6 \u00d7 10\u22128 T/\u221aHz limit of detection (LOD) and the potential for much lower LOD is demonstrated. Third, a novel passively-powered micromachined quartz magneto\ufb02exoelastic magnetometer is experimentally demonstrated and the effect of separation distance from a coupling antenna is quanti\ufb01ed and modeled using a modi\ufb01ed Butterworth-van Dyke model. This device has the potential to be a wireless implantable sensor that is much closer to the biomagnetic signal source.\n\nVia optimization of the mechanical coupling, \ufb02ux concentration, alignment of Metglas magnetic domains, and a (1-x)[Pb(Mg 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 ]-x[PbTiO 3 ] (PMN-PT) d 33 macro \ufb01ber composite to improve piezoelectric response; resulting in a magnetic \ufb01eld sensitivity of 50 pT at 20 Hz for a d33 Metglas/PMN-PT laminate. Mechanical coupling is improved by reducing the thickness and porosity of the epoxy. The Metglas residual stress reduction and easy axis alignment is accomplished by a 30 minute 400 \u25e6C anneal under a 160 mT magnetic \ufb01eld in an oxygen free environment. Resulting in the highest reported magnetostriction coef\ufb01cient of 79.3 \u00b5m/m\u00b7mT. Finally, different piezoelectric materials and con\ufb01gurations such as single crystal PMN-PT and macro \ufb01ber composite PMN-PT are explored.\n\nA novel magnetometer consisting of chip-scale whispering gallery mode resonators with high-Q factors (>10 7 ) are realized using MEMs fabrication techniques. A permanent magnet is elastically coupled to a whispering gallery mode borosilicate microbubble. Magnetic forces from applied external magnetic \ufb01elds induce deformation in the microbubble which can be sensitively monitored through changes in the optical resonance characteristics. The force is calculated and the the resultant deformation is simulated in the microbubble. The effect of different permanent magnet orientations and microbubble shell thickness is experimentally investigated and modeled. A sensitivity of 1.9 GHz/mT on a microbubble with 1.1 \u00b5m shell thickness is experimentally demonstrated along with a limit of detection of 6 \u00d7 10\u22128 T/\u221aHz at 30 Hz, which was limited by a noisy laser system.\n\nFinally, this dissertation demonstrates the passively-powered wireless operation of a magneto\ufb02exoelastic magnetometer. The wireless coupling is achieved using coupled near-\ufb01eld resonant loop antennas, which excite the high Q-factor (\u223c6000) micromachined quartz resonator. Magnetostrictive curves are acquired both wired and wirelessly at distances up to 45 mm to con\ufb01rm the phenomenon is magneto\ufb02exoelastic in nature. A\n49.1 Hz/Oe sensitivity was achieved in wireless operation and the ultimate detectable limit was 7 \u00b5T at 0.5 Hz.

Among the various candidates are high speed and abrupt metal insulator transition based switches. \n\nThe metal insulator transition in vanadium dioxide is sub 100 fs and abrupt. Vanadium dioxide has a low mobility and thus is a poor choice as a channel replacement material. However, modulation of its 0.6 eV bandgap offers a promising method to enable realization of a high speed, metal insulator tunnel field effect transistor. \n\nIn this thesis the mechanism for a metal insulator based tunnel junction is proposed. An experimental demonstration of a two order of magnitude change in tunneling conductance in nanoscale vanadium dioxide tunnel junctions is shown as a proof of concept of the proposed device. The large conductance change is modeled using direct tunneling and Poole-Frenkel conduction.\n\nThere exists significant debate on the exact switching mechanism in vanadium dioxide. The structural evolution of tensile strained vanadium dioxide undergoing an electrically induced insulator to metal transition is investigated using hard X-ray diffraction. A metallic rutile filament is found to be the dominant source of conduction after an electronically driven transition, while the majority of the channel area remains in the monoclinic M1 phase. Further analysis revealed that the width of the R filament can be tuned externally using resistive loads in series, enabling tunability of the M1/R phase ratio. Additionally, time resolved X-ray diffraction performed on vanadium dioxide oscillators shows that the oscillations are a result of repeatedly reforming and breaking of an R filament and structural phase transition from M1 to R and back to M1 plays an integral role in the oscillations.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9295], "author_name_tesi": "Freeman, Eugene ", "last_name_ssi": "Freeman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Eugene", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suman Datta", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suman Datta, Thesis Advisor", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vanadium dioxide", "VO2", "Metal Insulator Transition", "X-ray", "Tunneling"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Case Study of Mentor and Intern Relationships in a Professional Development School Context at the Secondary Level", "id": "6849", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2245", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\n\tThe purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the  mentor and intern relationships within a Professional Development School collaborative at the high school level.

The performance of the proposed adaptive dual control for insulin delivery is evaluated via simulations using various performance indices widely adopted in existing literature. Compared to the clinical data (which include clinical measurement of glucose level, clinically-administered insulin delivery, and carbohydrate intake) collected from several patients over 72 hours, the simulation results show that the adaptive dual controllers developed in this thesis provide lower occurrence of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.\n\nIn simulations, a virtual patient in the form of a linear time-varying input-output model was built based on clinical data using Kalman-filter based recursive parameter estimation. This virtual patient is then used in the simulations to evaluate the proposed adaptive dual controller for insulin delivery. The clinical data include measurement of glucose level, estimated carbohydrate intake and insulin delivery rate for five patients over 72 hours in 5-minutes intervals.  Due to temporary interruptions in the data, the longest stretch of uninterrupted data was used, of which 49 hours was the minimum. Each of the patients was diagnosed with type-1 diabetes and under continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion plus bolus treatment. The virtual patient model takes into account the absorption and transport time delays existed in the subcutaneous insulin injection and carbohydrate intake in its design of the finite impulse filters for the system inputs. In evaluation of the virtual patient model, model correlation coefficients which are generated between half-hour future blood glucose prediction and clinical data glucose measurement, ranged from 0.84 to 0.96, showing sufficient model accuracy.\n\nBased on Kalman-filter estimation of system parameters from the virtual patient (the algorithm itself does not depend on the model of the virtual patient, and hence can be applied to any simulation environments as well as real clinical environments), an adaptive dual controller is designed to determine the insulin injection based on the feedback information of the glucose measurement, together with the estimated carb intake.\n\nThe adaptive dual control algorithm minimizes two cost functions in the calculation of the control input in an attempt to cautiously track the target value while simultaneously providing persistent excitation required for accurate parameter estimation.  Simulations show that the adaptive dual controller developed in this thesis has better control of type-1 diabetes with statistical significance when compared with the clinical treatment used during data acquisition. The results show that the adaptive approach based on real-time model estimation coupled with dual control could be a potentially very promising tool for closing the loop in blood glucose control in those with type-1 diabetes.\n \nCompared to the conventional approaches based on compartmental models and non-adaptive control designs (either classical PID controllers or modern optimal control designs) in the current literature, the proposed empirical modeling based on online recursive parameter estimation, together with adaptive control design has several advantages. First, the modeling and control designs can be used for patients in a natural living condition, with meal intake and exercises, noting the lack of a good meal model in the existing compartmental-model based control designs. Second, the proposed adaptive control approach provides the ability to track the time-varying behavior in a diabetic patient and react fast. Finally, the proposed framework allows easy extension to taking into account various factors that could affect patient\u2019s diabetic control such as exercises, stress levels, etc in the future study.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3304], "author_name_tesi": "Freeman, Kenneth Allan", "last_name_ssi": "Freeman", "middle_name_ssi": "Allan", "first_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Qian Wang", "Dr Qian Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Qian Wang, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Qian Wang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adaptive Dual Control", "Type-1 Diabetes", "Artificial Pancreas", "Automatic Control"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Comparative Study Of Health Literacy \nand How Rural Communities Understand Hypertension Information in Uganda And Tanzania\n", "id": "24823", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11031", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This comparative dissertation examines health literacy and how rural communities understand hypertension information in Kabale, Uganda and Moshi, Tanzania. Commonly defined as an individual\u2019s ability to access, understand, and use information to promote and maintain positive health and well-being, health literacy as it relates to hypertension has yet to be problematized and compared within an African context. Often described as a silent killer due to a lack of physical symptoms, hypertension afflicts more than one-fourth of the world\u2019s adult population. In Africa, hypertension is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease on the continent and is expected to outnumber deaths attributed to more well-known infectious diseases by the year 2030. Based on the analysis of interviews, focus groups, as well as direct and indirect observation, the results of this comparative research study revealed significant barriers to access, understanding, and use of hypertension information for research participants diagnosed with hypertension. These barriers led to a low utilization of health services and reinforcement of cultural perceptions of the supernatural. Additionally, behavior modification messages targeting food choice were met with frustration and confusion as support and resources for implementing such plans were limited. \nCurrent top-down, population-based health literacy initiatives developed by Western agencies that target infectious diseases are ubiquitous but have had a limited effect.  They are often devoid of context, full of technical medical jargon, and situate health literacy within a Western paradigm of behavioral psychology. This further promotes Western hegemonic ideologies and denies African identity and ways of knowing.  This comparative research study undergirds the need to examine current discourses that inform health literacies and take a Freirean approach to the co-creation of knowledge. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10608], "author_name_tesi": "Freer, Robert J", "last_name_ssi": "Freer", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ladislaus M Semali", "Adnan A Qayyum", "Jamie Myers", "Sinfree Bullock Makoni"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ladislaus M Semali, Dissertation Advisor", "Adnan A Qayyum, Committee Chair", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Sinfree Bullock Makoni, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Health", "Literacy", "Education", "Hypertension", "Africa"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Sensitivity to absolute and relative properties of natural rewards and drugs of abuse as a function of strain in rats and mice", "id": "9981", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1139", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Addiction is a major problem in the United States. In addition to the numerous economic and legal repercussions on society, drugs of abuse also produce devastating effects in the individual. One such consequence of continued drug use is a devaluation of the natural rewards encountered in the environment. For example, people with a history of cocaine use and even smokers who are expecting a chance to smoke in the immediate future have been found to be less sensitive to monetary reward (Goldstein et al., 2008; Wilson et al., 2008). Similarly, drug addicts tend to develop a generalized insensitivity to food and social relationships and it has been shown that addicts are more likely to weigh less, to lose their jobs, and to have their children removed from their home due to neglect (Jones et al., 1995; Santolaria-Fernandez et al., 1995; Nair et al., 1997). \nA contributing factor in the devaluation of natural rewards by drugs of abuse is the principle of incentive relativity. Incentive relativity states that rewards are not evaluated in a vacuum (i.e., the value of a given reward is not determined only by its intrinsic value), but also by its relative value in comparison with other rewards. Such comparisons, however, normally occur between natural rewards found in the environment in a relatively plastic manner. When natural rewards are evaluated against artificially intense drugs of abuse, these lesser natural rewards can become devalued and are subsequently avoided.\n Given that this effect of drugs of abuse on natural rewards is influenced by the comparison of rewards, individual or group differences in reward preference and/or sensitivity, both innate and relative, may play an important role in the devaluation of natural rewards observed in drug addiction. To date, however, this aspect of drug addiction has remained largely unexplored. The goal of the current thesis was to use rat and mouse strains with differential preference for rewards to evaluate the effect of differences in sensitivity to rewards in a rodent model of drug-induced devaluation of natural rewards. Although increased reward preference was found to facilitate drug-induced suppression of a reward cue in rats in Chapter 2, and this facilitation extended to comparisons between disparate natural sweet rewards in Chapter 3, the suppressive effect of drug on reward intake was attenuated in reward-preferring mice in Chapter 4. This attenuated effect in \u2018reward sensitive\u2019 strains of mice was not due to differences in impulsivity and was shown, with the use of transgenic &#916;FosB mice in Chapter 5, to be associated with an increased sensitivity to not only drug, but also to the natural reward cue. Indeed, when the natural reward cue was switched from sweet to bitter in Chapter 6, the strain effect was eliminated. Taken together, the data in this dissertation suggest that a single substrate, ultimately, can mediate sensitivity to drugs of abuse and natural rewards. Thus, while natural reward cues can predict drug availability and can, in so doing, be devalued, strong natural rewards also can blunt the rewarding impact of a drug of abuse and, thereby, responding for a drug of abuse and the ensuing development of addiction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1127], "author_name_tesi": "Freet, Christopher Samuel", "last_name_ssi": "Freet", "middle_name_ssi": "Samuel", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson", "Patricia Sue Grigson", "Ralph Norgren", "Andras Hajnal", "Ian Alexander Simpson", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Eric Nestler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Sue Grigson, Committee Chair", "Ralph Norgren, Committee Member", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Eric Nestler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["addiction", "reward comparison", "drug CTA"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Design of a transcriptional repressor-based biosensor in E. coli\n\n\n", "id": "11442", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1138", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The development of in vivo high-throughput screening techniques for the detection of polyketides is essential to alleviate our dependence of expensive synthetic and time consuming methods for the production these industrial bioactive molecules. Nature provides a vast array of polyketides in a myriad of organisms, produced from highly malleable biosynthetic pathways. Protein transcriptional regulators offer a gateway to mitigate the current processes of polyketide extraction and/or chemical synthesis. By naturally having an affinity for molecules such as polyketides and with the genetic tools available today, transcriptional regulators can be evolved to detect other industrially significant ligands and novel bioactive compounds through directed evolution. This will allow for the design of inexpensive high yield processes when expressed in a genetically manipulative host such as Escherchia coli. In this study, we describe the design of transcriptional repressor-based biosensor for the in vivo detection of polyketides in E. coli. The biosensor was engineered with ActR, a TetR-like transcriptional repressor protein, controlling expression of the gfp reporter gene which produces a green fluorescent protein (GFP). The incorporation of a GFP reporter allows for high-throughput screening of ActR and polyketide biosynthetic pathway combinatorial libraries using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The ActR mutants will be screened based on their affinity and selectivity for a specific product produced through an engineered polyketide biosynthetic pathway, which the pathway can then be screened for increased yields. The broad range of genetic techniques available for manipulation of E. coli combined with the ActR-based biosensor engineered in E. coli, a new window of opportunity has been presented for engineering more efficient microbial production of polyketide compounds.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1126], "author_name_tesi": "Frei, Christopher Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Frei", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick Cirino", "Patrick C Cirino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick Cirino, Thesis Advisor", "Patrick C Cirino, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["polyketide", "ActR", "transcriptional repressor", "Biosensor"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Exploring the Impact of the Antiviral Drug Ribavirin on RNA Viruses in Honey Bees and the Presence of RNA Viruses in Bees in Brazil", "id": "14038", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7379", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Honey bees, Apis mellifera L., are essential pollinators worldwide and have an enormous economic impact.  Unfortunately, however, honey bee health is declining.  Honey bee viruses represent a significant threat to honey bee health and are associated with a variety of pathologies such as dead brood, deformed wings, and general colony mortality.  Several viruses have even been associated with the recent mass die-off of honey bees reported in North America called Colony Collapse Disorder.  Despite the threat posed by honey bee viruses, there are no chemotherapeutic agents currently in use to treat these viruses and so treatment remains limited to management techniques which are largely ineffective.  Beekeepers are thus often forced to destroy infected colonies in order to prevent the spread of viral diseases.  I explored the broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin for its potential as an antiviral treatment in honey bees.  I present evidence that ribavirin was active against Deformed wing virus (DWV), Black queen cell virus (BQCV), and Sacbrood virus (SBV).  I also explored the mutagenic effect of ribavirin on viral genomes.  Although further study is required to determine if ribavirin is safe and can improve colony survival, this study serves as an important step in the development of an antiviral treatment for viral infections in honey bees and may also provide insight into the ecology and epidemiology of these viruses.\n\nIn addition to this study on ribavirin, I explored the prevalence of honey bee viruses in Brazil, both in honey bees and native stingless bees (Apidae; Meliponini).  In North America, honey bee viruses have been found in native bees such as the bumble bees (Apidae; Bombus) where they have been shown to cause disease.  Transmission can occur through pollen between honey bees and native bees if both species are foraging on the same flowers.  The potential for this cross-species transmission poses a health risk to native bees which are likely foraging on the same flowers as infected honey bees.

With embodiment emerging as an \ninterest area within these discourses, the primary purpose of this study was to explore \nrevaluing embodiment as a way of knowing by examining how it was conceived of,experienced, and applied as new knowledge in a higher education classroom. It addressed a need to bridge the gap between the traditional rational paradigm of teaching and learning and integrated pedagogies that reconnect the whole person. \n   This study was a qualitative investigation of embodiment through a case study action research project in a higher education B.S.N. class of practicing registered nurses where a direct attempt was made to incorporate attention to the body in learning through five experiential sessions drawn from various conceptualizations of embodiment. Experiences of embodiment were examined among 13 participants with data collected through interviews, observation, and documents. Theoretical framing was established from cognitive science, situated cognition and social theory. \n    Several process findings were revealed as part of the action research process from participation in activities of embodied awareness. First, participants developed a \ndeeper understanding of embodied awareness from initial physiological and emotive responses through the body by clarifying ineffable aspects of embodiment through experiential engagement and by relating conceptualizations of embodiment to prior experiences.

For those that do have 3G access, normal internet usage and web browsing may cause the 3G interface to incur significant delay and unnecessary energy consumption, degrading the user experience and shortening the battery life of the smartphone. To address these issues, nearby smartphones can be leveraged through ad hoc communication to work together to access data more energy and delay efficiently. Two hybrid data access schemes are proposed; in the first scheme, smartphones without 3G leverage cooperative cache-based ad hoc networking to request data from nearby smartphones that can access 3G. Not only can they access data without an active internet connection, but the data access delay is reduced through cooperative caching. In the second scheme, data requests of nearby 3G-enabled smartphones are forwarded to a single smartphone that performs the requests over its own 3G interface. By aggregating requests, this approach significantly reduces the average access delay and energy consumption among the smartphones in the cluster by reducing unnecessary tail energies and 3G network connection delays.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8982], "author_name_tesi": "Freilich, Max Adam", "last_name_ssi": "Freilich", "middle_name_ssi": "Adam", "first_name_ssi": "Max", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "John Joseph Hannan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Thesis Advisor", "John Joseph Hannan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["mobile computing", "smartphones", "ad hoc networks", "data access", "cooperative cache", "3G"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE HYDROARCHAEOLOGICAL APPROACH: UNDERSTANDING THE ANCIENT MAYA IMPACT ON THE PALENQUE WATERSHED\n", "id": "10258", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3374", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Palenque, one of the best known Classic Maya centers, has what is arguably the most unique and intricate system of water management known anywhere in the Maya Lowlands. Years of archaeological research, including intensive mapping between 1997 and 2000, reveal that this major center, situated on a narrow escarpment at the base of a high mountain range in northern Chiapas, Mexico, began as a modest settlement about AD 100. Then, during the seventh and eighth centuries, Palenque experienced explosive growth, mushrooming into the second most densely populated Classic Maya center. This process of \u201curban\u201d growth led to obvious changes in landcover.\n\nIn order to better understand the effects that landcover and climate change have on the availability of water for an ancient city a new approach is required. In this dissertation I introduce the hydroarchaeological approach, a new cross-disciplinary method that utilizes simulated daily paleoclimate data, watershed modeling, and traditional archaeology to view the response of the Palenque watershed to varying degrees of ancient human impact. There is great potential for watershed-climate modeling in developing plausible scenarios of water use and supply, and the effect of extreme conditions (flood and drought), all of which cannot be fully represented by atmosphere-based climate and weather projections.\n\nOne objective of this dissertation is to test the hypothesis that drought was a major cause for Palenque\u2019s collapse. Did the Maya abandon Palenque in search of water? Secondly, evaluate the hydraulic design of the water management features at Palenque against extreme meteorological events. How successful was the hydraulic engineering of the Maya in coping with droughts and floods?\n\nThe archaeological implications for this non-invasive \u201cvirtual\u201d method are many, including detecting periods of stress within a community, estimating population limits based on the availability of water, understanding settlement patterns, as well as assisting present local populations in understanding the water cycle of Palenque.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3362], "author_name_tesi": "French, Kirk Dow", "last_name_ssi": "French", "middle_name_ssi": "Dow", "first_name_ssi": "Kirk", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Lee Webster", "David Lee Webster", "George Robert Milner", "Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Christopher J Duffy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Lee Webster, Dissertation Advisor", "David Lee Webster, Committee Chair", "George Robert Milner, Committee Member", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Drought", "Hydrology", "Human Impact", "Palenque", "Maya"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Nisei Achitects: Challenges and Achievements", "id": "13926kbf5095", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13926", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Japanese-Americans and their culture have been perceived very ambivalently in the United States in the middle of the twentieth century; while they mostly faced discrimination for their ethnicity by the white majority in the United States, there has also been a consistent group of admirers of the Japanese art and architecture. Nisei (Japanese-Americans of the second generation) architects inherited the racial stigma of the Japanese minority but increasingly benefited from the new aesthetic light that was cast, in both pre- and post-war years, on Japanese art and architecture. This thesis aims to clarify how Nisei architects dealt with this ambivalence and how it was mirrored in their professional lives and their built designs.\nHow did architects, operating in the United States, perceive Japanese architecture? How did these perceptions affect their designs? I aim to clarify these influences through case studies that will include such general issues as (1) Japanese-Americans\u2019 general cultural evolution, (2) architects operating in the United States and their relation to Japanese architecture, and (3) biographies of three Nisei architects: George Nakashima, Minoru Yamasaki, and George Matsumoto.

Caffeine, an antagonist of this receptor has been shown to have a protective effect on the development of PD.\nInteracting proteins of GPCRs assist in their signaling and regulation. In this work, the yeast two-hybrid assay was used to screen for novel interacting proteins for the A2aR, in order to discover a means of regulating the receptor\u2019s signaling. Several candidate interacting proteins for the A2aR tail were identified. This work characterizes the interaction between the A2aR and one interactor, Ran Binding Protein 9 (RBP9). \nRBP9 has been described as a scaffolding protein which interacts with at least three (GPCRs). The functional role of RBP9 is still under investigation, but several regulatory roles have been described for its interaction with GPCRs, including mediating internalization, phosphorylation, and receptor expression. \nHere, the A2aR- RBP9 interaction is confirmed through GST-pulldown and Co-immunoprecipitation experiments conducted in A2aR- transfected HEK-293 cells and SHSY5Y cells. Furthermore, the two proteins are shown to co-localize in both cell lines. \nThe possibility that RBP9 is a promiscuous interactor of GPCR proteins was also investigated. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate an interaction between RBP9 and the D2 dopamine receptor (D2R), mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors (MOR, KOR, and DOR). Because RBP9 interacts with several prominent GPCRs, it is possible that it holds a common function in regulation of these receptors. \nThrough RBP9 siRNA knockdown experiments, a regulatory role for RBP9 in the overall expression of three GPCRs, namely the A2aR, MOR, and D2R in stably-tranfected HEK-293 cells is demonstrated. Specifically, knockdown of RBP9 results in a down-regulation of the A2aR, and an up-regulation of the D2R and MOR. RBP9-dependent up-regulation of D2R expression is confirmed in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells.\nIt appears evident that RBP9 is a promiscuous interactor of GPCRs, and has a regulatory role in their overall expression levels. Further studies may expand our understanding of RBP9\u2019s function, and the mechanism by which it regulates GPCR expression, providing a novel pharmaceutical target in GPCR signal regulation. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1062], "author_name_tesi": "Frey, Colleen Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Frey", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Colleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson", "Robert G Levenson", "Victor Alan Canfield", "Robert J Milner", "Zachary Simmons"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Chair", "Victor Alan Canfield, Committee Member", "Robert J Milner, Committee Member", "Zachary Simmons, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["A2aR", "GPCR", "RBP9"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Hazards, Landscape, and Place: Staten Island and Hurricane Sandy", "id": "13148nlf147", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13148", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hurricane Sandy, like most costly U.S. hurricane disasters, was fundamentally urban in character. Staten Island, New York, one of the five boroughs of New York City, received disproportionate damages in the storm, and recovery has been slow. The borough receives limited attention in academic and popular literature relative to the other four boroughs, despite a large population and a rich history dating to the colonial era. This study extends the idea that places are historically contingent and constantly evolving to place-based hazards research. It focuses on the historical development of places across Staten Island landscapes, on the ways in which those developments created and failed to mitigate coastal flood risk, and on the role of residents\u2019 attachment to places in influencing their recovery from Sandy. It employs a mixed methods approach, relying on tools and concepts from the urban geography, urban sociology, historical geography, demography, and natural hazards literatures. The dissertation first explores the historical development of landscapes across Staten Island from the colonial era to the present day, noting the ways in which modern landscapes bear the traces of their historical antecedents. It next investigates the growth of flood risk over the course of the twentieth century in the island\u2019s East Shore neighborhoods, pointing to prior storm events that foreshadowed Sandy. Post-Sandy policy initiatives are then examined in the light of these prior events. This study finds that many lessons have been learned from the failures of prior proposals, and that these lessons are reflected in the present-day proposals. The evolution of the study area\u2019s demographic composition over the past 50 years is then examined within the broader context of other Sandy-affected areas to determine similarities and differences. Finally, the study examines the relationship between place attachment and recovery from Sandy, finding that one measure of place attachment, neighborhood satisfaction, is linked with recovery, but that another measure, duration of residence, is less clearly linked with recovery. Overall, this dissertation enhances the integration of place and history in geographic hazard risk research and reiterates the critical role that understandings of both place and history must play in establishing effective hazard mitigation, recovery, and resilience policies.

Meanwhile, these gay representations are presumed to sensitize straight viewers to gay people, but little study has focused on the responses of gay viewers to portrayals of fictional gay characters. This project consists of two studies that explore portrayals of, and gay viewer responses to, gay television characters. The studies are guided by the communication theory of identity and its tenet of identity as consisting of several interrelated dimensions including personal, relational, and communal. The first study investigates three notable television texts featuring gay and lesbian characters and analyzes how the characters are constructed on various identity dimensions. Analysis finds that gay characters are portrayed as struggling with integrating gay identity into their personhood (Six Feet Under), as committed but strained in their relationships with other gay as well as straight characters (Will & Grace), and as experiencing tensions between gay and straight community as well as within their own community (Queer as Folk). The second study involves interviews with 22 self-identifying gay, lesbian, and bisexual participants to assess their responses to portrayals of gay characters on the different identity dimensions. Results find that some respondents find television portrayals to be varied and relatable, while others find them limited and compromised. The second study also explores how interviewees sense that media portrayals have influenced their own identity formation, and finds that interviewees frequently identify an actual or possible media influence. The studies conclude that gay characters on television do have complex identities, but that more is possible in terms of varied portrayals, and also that the interaction between media portrayals of gay identity and the lived experience of gay identity could be usefully explored with people struggling with sexual identity.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3746], "author_name_tesi": "Freymiller, Lyn J.", "last_name_ssi": "Freymiller", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Lyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle E Day", "Thomas Walter Benson", "Ronald Ward Jackson", "Stephanie A Shields"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle E Day, Committee Chair", "Thomas Walter Benson, Committee Member", "Ronald Ward Jackson, Committee Member", "Stephanie A Shields, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["media effects", "interviews", "gays on television", "gay identity", "rhetorical criticism"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Ecological Physiology and Biochemistry of Sulfide Acquisition by  Two Hydrocarbon Seep Vestimentiferans, Lamellibrachia luymesi and Seepiophila jonesi", "id": "6168", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2755", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two species of vestimentiferan tubeworm, Lamellibrachia luymesi and Seepiophila jonesi, co-occur in aggregations at northern Gulf of Mexico cold hydrocarbon seep sites.  Like all vestimentiferans, L. luymesi and S. jonesi obtain nutrition from sulfide-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacterial endosymbionts that must be supplied with sulfide, oxygen, and carbon dioxide.  Results from previous studies that examined the environmental sulfide chemistry of northern Gulf of Mexico hydrocarbon seeps suggested that the ecological physiology of seep tubeworms was not analogous to that of the hydrothermal vent tubeworm, Riftia pachyptila, which obtains sulfide, oxygen, and carbon dioxide across the anterior plume portion of its body.  The focus of this study was to better understand the physiological ecology of environmental sulfide acquisition of L. luymesi and S. jonesi.  Whole animal respiration studies were conducted using split-vessel respiration chambers built specifically for this series of experiments.  Methods for sulfide equilibrium dialysis experiments were determined and utilized to estimate the sulfide-binding characteristics of the intact fluids and component hemoglobins of L. luymesi and S. jonesi. \nL. luymesi and S. jonesi grow a posterior extension of their tube and tissue, termed a \u201croot,\u201d down into sulfidic sediments below the point of original attachment.  Preliminary blood sulfide uptake experiments confirmed that sulfide uptake across the posterior portions of live L. luymesi can occur.  Sulfide was not detectable in the blood of any control animals that did not have their roots exposed to sulfide (detection limit of 3.0 \u00b5M) but was present in the blood of experimental animals that had their roots exposed to 500 \u00b5M sulfide (152 and 170 \u00b5M).  Split-vessel respiration experiments which exposed the root portions of L. luymesi to sulfide concentrations between 51 and 561 \u00b5M demonstrated that L. luymesi can utilize their roots as a respiratory surface to acquire sulfide at an average rate of 4.1 \u00b5moles*g-1*h-1.  Net dissolved inorganic carbon uptake across the plume of the tubeworms was shown to occur in response to exposure of the posterior, root portion of the worms to sulfide, demonstrating that sulfide acquisition by roots of the seep vestimentiferan L. luymesi can be sufficient to fuel net autotrophic total dissolved inorganic carbon uptake.  \nVestimentiferan vascular blood and coelomic fluid contain giant extracellular hemoglobins (Hbs; a 3,500 kDa and a 400 kDa Hb in the vascular blood, and a different 400 kDa Hb in coelomic fluid) that reversibly and simultaneously bind large quantities of hydrogen sulfide and oxygen at binding sites unique for each chemical species.  These Hbs are fundamental to the uptake, accumulation, transportation, and delivery of both sulfide and oxygen to their endosymbionts.  Sulfide-binding dialysis experiments were conducted in order to estimate the sulfide-binding affinity and capacity for the purified R. pachyptila 3,500 kDa Hb and a mixture of 400 kDa Hbs from vascular and coelomic fluids.  Under experimental conditions, the 3,500 kDa Hb bound 2.2 moles sulfide per mole of heme when saturated.  Half-saturation occurred at 5.2\u00b5M SH2S (the sum of H2S, HS-, and S2- ) for this Hb.  The 400 kDa Hbs were able to bind 0.47 moles sulfide per mole of heme when saturated, and 50% saturation occurred at 5.4\u00b5M SH2S.  The very similar sulfide affinities of the 3,500 kDa and 400 kDa Hb fractions would allow bi-directional exchange and storage of sulfide in both fluid compartments and is consistent with the proposed role of the coelomic fluid as a temporary storage reservoir for sulfide.  During this series of experiments, significant limitations in the methods commonly used in sulfide-binding studies were found.  At equilibrium, sulfide concentrations inside small volume dialysis bags were not equal to external dialysate concentrations, and the effect varied with the bag volume.  Sulfide-binding by purified 3,500 kDa and 400 kDa Riftia pachyptila Hb fractions was also positively correlated to heme concentration.  Sulfide binding per heme did not increase significantly above concentrations of 0.4 mM heme in the experiments with the 400 kDa Hbs.  However, sulfide bound per heme by the 3,500 kDa Hb increased significantly over the full range of heme concentrations tested (0.15 to 1.8 mM).  The mechanism for increased sulfide-binding at increased heme concentrations has not been determined.\nUtilizing an improved methodology resulting from the sulfide-binding experiments with R. pachyptila fluid and hemoglobins, experiments were conducted to estimate the sulfide-binding affinity and capacity for purified 3,500 kDa Hbs and mixtures of 400 kDa Hbs from the vascular and coelomic fluids of L. luymesi and S. jonesi.  In addition, the heme concentrations and relative Hb abundance of intact vascular blood and coelomic fluids and the sulfide-binding characteristics of the component Hbs were determined for both L. luymesi and S. jonesi.  Results from sulfide-binding experiments show that the 3,500 kDa Hb from the fluids of S. jonesi has a high affinity for sulfide (C50 value of 8.8\u00b5M) while the 3,500 kDa Hb from the fluids of L. luymesi has only a moderate affinity for sulfide (C50 value of 96\u00b5M).  S. jonesi has elevated fluid heme concentrations that may facilitate the survival of individuals in environments where they are exposed to low concentrations of oxygen and/or short periods without any oxygen.  The high affinity of the predominant hemoglobin in the vascular fluid of S. jonesi for sulfide suggests that large S. jonesi may be capable of acquiring sulfide with the anterior plume portion of its body from low concentration pools found just above the sediment-water interface.  The low affinity of the most prevalent hemoglobin in the vascular fluid of L. luymesi for sulfide suggests that large L. luymesi are not likely able to use their plumes for sulfide uptake and likely depend upon the root portion of the body and tube for sulfide acquisition.  The sulfide-binding data for the L. luymesi 3,500 kDa Hb suggests that L. luymesi may have a 3,500 kDa Hb with multiple sulfide-binding mechanisms that have different sulfide capacity and C50 values (one lower and one higher) or express two different 3,500 kDa Hbs with different sulfide-binding characteristics.\nTogether these data have fundamentally changed our model for the ecological physiology of seep vestimentiferans.  Although closely related to hydrothermal vent tubeworms, L. luymesi and S. jonesi do not acquire metabolites from the environment in the same way as R. pachyptila.  We are now beginning to understand how sulfide, carbon dioxide, and oxygen can be acquired by L. luymesi and S. jonesi.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2750], "author_name_tesi": "Freytag, John Karl", "last_name_ssi": "Freytag", "middle_name_ssi": "Karl", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "James Harold Marden", "Roger Tai Koide", "Michael Allan Arthur", "James J Childress"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Chair", "James Harold Marden, Committee Member", "Roger Tai Koide, Committee Member", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member", "James J Childress, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sulfide", "vestimentiferan", "hemoglobin", "Riftia", "Lamellibrachia", "Seepiophila"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "An empirical investigation of secondary principals' perspectives on \"the best interests of the student\" as a viable professional ethic for educational leadership\n", "id": "7311", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6495", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     This study examined secondary principals\u2019 perspectives about the expression \u201cthe best interests of the student\u201d as a viable professional ethic for educational leadership.

One proposed overarching component within the PCK model for science teaching is teaching orientations, defined as teachers' knowledge and beliefs about the purposes and goals for teaching science at a particular grade level.  Nine different orientations to teaching science have been identified in the science education literature, yet there are few empirical studies specifically examining science teachers' orientations.  This qualitative case study re-examines science teaching orientations using grounded theory methods.  The study focused on the nature and sources of the science teaching orientations held by four highly-regarded secondary biology teachers.  Data collection consisted of a card-sorting task, semi-structured interviews, and classroom observations.  Inductive data analysis led to the construction of a substantive-level theory of science teaching orientations.  \nIn regard to the nature of science teaching orientations, the use of central and peripheral goals, as well as the means of achieving these goals, better represents the complex nature of science teaching orientations.  Although the participants were secondary biology teachers, they held more general teaching orientations than science-specific orientations.  The participants held goals in the affective domain, e.g., the development of positive attitudes toward biology, as well as general schooling goals, including preparing students for college and the development of life skills.  Although each participant held science content goals, these goals were not always a central component of their teaching orientation.  In addition, goals and purposes shape the means that a teacher chooses, but a limited repertoire of means can also restrict the teacher\u2019s purposes and goals.\nIn regard to the sources of teaching orientations, participants were influenced by a multitude of factors, including prior work experiences and professional development.  Professional development served as a feedback loop, as participants selected professional development that re-enforced their teaching orientation.  The school context, with its perceived time constraints, was another contributing factor.  The participants\u2019 teaching orientations were strongly influenced by their daily interactions with students. The teachers\u2019 beliefs about learners and learning were major sources of their teaching orientations.

This new industry will demand substantial amounts of vegetable oil feedstock, primarily from soybean.  Spring canola could be an alternative feedstock because its oil content is double that of soybean and canola meal by-product is a high protein livestock feed, especially for dairy cows.  As a new crop, the yield potential of spring canola is not well documented in Pennsylvania.  To assess its performance, spring canola was evaluated in Centre, Lancaster and Tioga Counties in 2007.   Spring canola yields have averaged about 40% less than winter canola, but spring canola may fit crop rotations better.  In 2007, spring canola yields averaged 1,436 kg ha -1 in Lancaster County, 1,931 kg ha-1 in Centre County and  2,459 kg ha-1 in Tioga County.  However, the best spring varieties in these trials yielded about 20% more than the average in Centre and Tioga Counties.  Temperatures above 32o C during pod filling were an important factor in the low yields in Lancaster County.  Despite climatic variation among locations, four of the 12 varieties evaluated were consistently high yielding across locations.\nEconomic opportunity exists for on-farm, mechanical pressing of oilseed to oil and meal co-products; but the oil should meet industrial specifications for biodiesel and biofluid (biohydraulic, biolubricant) applications for the best value.  In biodiesel production, the free fatty acid (FFA) and phosphorous contents are important quality indicators.  In biofluid applications, the oxidative stability and viscosity are important.  These characteristics result primarily from the fatty acid profile of the oil but may be affected by the oil extraction method and the quality of the oilseed growing location in some varieties.  \nIn the 2007 spring canola trial, four of the highest yielding varieties, Hyola Magnum 357, IS7145, Crosby and DKL 38-25, at each of three locations, Rock Springs, Landisville and Wellsboro, were evaluated for FFA and phosphorous contents and functionally evaluated for their viscosity and oxidative stability.  Results were compared with a sample biodiesel industry specification maximum for crude, non-degummed feedstock oils and also with commercially available refined and crude oils.  The average FFA content of the oils was above specification at 0.81%; however, there were significant differences by location and variety.  Specimen oils from the least favorable environments are more likely to exceed the specification maximum compared to those from more favorable environments.  Phosphorous content in these oils averaged lower than the industry specification maximum of 1,000 ppm, with no significant difference by location.  However, the Magnum 357 variety was significantly higher than the other varieties.  Viscosity averaged 35.8 Cst at 40o C, with no significant variation by either location or variety; these viscosities are typical for vegetable oils.   Using the Penn State Mini-Oxidation Test to evaluate oxidative stability, the rate of volatiles driven off by hot air at 200o C averaged 14.1% of the sample weight after 60 minutes of treatment. The percentage of insoluble deposits left after 60 minutes of hot air treatment was typical for vegetable oils at an average of 82.1 % of the original sample weight over all varieties tested.  Although oxidative stability by location was not significantly different, the Magnum 357 variety was significantly lower in both volatiles and insoluble deposits after 60 minutes of exposure compared to the other varieties tested. This evaluation of industrial quality in mechanically pressed spring canola suggests that the on-farm production of crude, non-degummed oil can meet industry specifications for biodiesel and biofluids, especially when grown under favorable conditions.  Additional analysis is needed to determine the rate of degradation of these oilseeds from harvest to pressing, under differing growing and storage environments.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4455], "author_name_tesi": "Frier, Mary Carol ", "last_name_ssi": "Frier", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mary Carol", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gregory Wayne Roth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gregory Wayne Roth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["biofuels", "oilseed", "biodiesel", "canola"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Effectiveness of Mastering Math Facts on Second- and Third-grade Students with Specific Learning Disabilities in Mathematics", "id": "18702", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8885", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Students with specific learning disabilities (SLD) in mathematics can typically experience long-lasting problems when developing fluency with basic math facts despite the use of evidence-based practices.

Since robust, reliable construction methods for bilayer dye-sensitized solar cells (bi-DSSCs) fosters consistency in performance from cell to cell and a higher signal-to-noise ratio during photovoltaic action, which in turn aids in examining the single variable of interest, robust and experiment-tailored fabrication methods for producing bilayer dye-sensitized solar cell evolved into the main focus of this study. \nThree different bi-DSSC fabrication categories were pursued: 1) decal transfer of one layer onto the other; 2) build inverse opal (IO) directly on top of a mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 (meso ncTiO2) film; and, 3) build the meso ncTiO2 layer directly on top of an IO layer.   Experimental observations of morphology, spectral responses and light-to-energy responses were made on all attempts to construct bi-DSSCs but none of the attempted methods proved successful for joining these two layers. An ncTiO2 particle infiltration into colloidal crystal template infiltration method is believed to be the most consistent and flexible IO layer fabrication method for bi-DSSCs. Isolation of the majority of pores within a meso nc-TiO2 film by way of atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 onto the meso nc-TiO2 film\u2019s outer surface followed by ion mill leveling is believed to be an effective method for bi-DSSC fabrication systems 1 and 2, above. It appears most useful for direct deposition of a colloidal crystal and subsequent infiltration with nc-TiO2 particles and/or a decal technique involving a milled IO layer attached to the Al2O3 protected meso nc-TiO2 using a newly developed TiO2 sol-gel that can form a meso film within submicron confined spaces and thus \u201cglue\u201d the two separately prepared films together.\nDue to a noticeable lack of easily accessible, easy-to-follow and complete guides to understanding and fabricating moderately efficient, ~6.5%, DSSCs, one was developed.  It provides a quicker initiation into laboratory-grade DSSC building and testing without cumbersome steps such as dye purification, light scattering layer addition or ncTiO2 sol pretreatment of FTO or post treatment of the photoanode.  Since DSSCs are relatively easy to fabricate, morphologies are easily altered and involve much less lab equipment than do other solar cells, providing this guide will be very useful for solar cell research in general at the undergraduate level as it facilitates less of an investment of time to get started. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8884], "author_name_tesi": "Friesen, Stuart Aaron", "last_name_ssi": "Friesen", "middle_name_ssi": "Aaron", "first_name_ssi": "Stuart", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk", "Karl Todd Mueller", "Raymond Edward Schaak"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Todd Mueller, Thesis Advisor", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["robust fabrication process", "inverse opal", "stop band", "Wood's anomalies"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Essays in Applied Microeconomics", "id": "14713", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7471", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "CHAPTER 1: Signaling Creditworthiness in Peruvian Microfinance Markets: The Role of Information Sharing\n\nUsing borrower-level data from FINCA, one of the leading microfinance institutions (MFI) in Peru, I evaluate the effect of FINCA\u2019s decision to share information on individual outstanding debt records (positive information), in addition to group default records (negative information), on borrowers' access to credit. Since all borrowers were exposed to the same policy, I develop a creative identification strategy that relies on the exogenous variation of the opening and closing dates of loan cycles across lending groups.

This system sets very high standards to get into college and competition for a seat is extremely fierce. The placement rate in college is as low as 30% and it is partly explained by the large proportion of repeat takers each year. Using a unique dataset on a random sample of 115,000 students who took the OSS in 2002 we investigate if a system like the Turkish one is conducive to learning over multiple attempts. We estimate the cumulative learning gains (in terms of score improvement) between the first and the nth attempt. Even though we only have a cross section of students, we show how to use information on repeat takers to estimate learning across attempts while controlling for selection into retaking in terms of observed and unobserved characteristics. Our\nmain assumptions are: i) students know their own ability, ii) performance is a function of observables, unobservables, randomness, and learning, iii) learning is a draw from a distribution that may vary with observables and/or unobservables, and iv) steady state. We identify important learning gains among repeat takers, especially for students from less advantaged backgrounds. If less privileged students learn more than the more privileged upon retrying then allowing students to take the entrance exam as many times as they want may reduce the effects of background inequalities on college admission.\n\n\nCHAPTER 3 (with Sean Dougherty and Kala Krishna): Employment Protection Legislation and Plant-Level Productivity in India \n\nUsing plant-level data from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for all the fiscal years between 1998-99 and 2007-08, this study provides plant-level cross-state/time-series evidence of the impact of employment protection legislation (EPL) on total factor productivity (TFP) and labor productivity in India. Identification of the effect of EPL follows from a difference-in-difference estimator that takes advantage of the state-level variation in labor regulation and heterogeneous industry characteristics. The fundamental identification assumption is that EPL is more likely to restrict firms operating in industries with higher labor intensity and/or higher sales volatility. Our results show that firms in labor intensive or more volatile industries benefited the most from labor reforms at the state level, suggesting that the high labor costs and rigidities imposed through Indian federal labour laws may be limited by labor market reforms at the state level.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7417], "author_name_tesi": "Frisancho Robles, Veronica Cecilia", "last_name_ssi": "Frisancho Robles", "middle_name_ssi": "Cecilia", "first_name_ssi": "Veronica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kala Krishna", "Bee Yan Roberts", "Mark John Roberts", "John Raymond Moran Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kala Krishna, Dissertation Advisor", "Bee Yan Roberts, Committee Member", "Mark John Roberts, Committee Member", "John Raymond Moran Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Access to Credit", "Credit Bureaus", "Microfinance", "Learning gains", "Higher education", "Selection", "Labor regulation", "Productivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "UNSTRUCTURED NASCENT-CHAIN SEGMENTS GENERATE PICONEWTONS OF FORCE THAT ARE TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE PEPTIDE BACKBONE TO THE RIBOSOME P-SITE ", "id": "13805brf141", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13805", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mechanical forces acting on the ribosome can alter the speed of protein \nsynthesis.

Although known instances of hydrocephalus date back to the time of Hippocrates, the process by which hydrocephalus develops is still not well understood. In order to better understand the mechanisms of hydrocephalus we need to design novel mathematical and computational models capable of correctly predicting the brain response to mechanical loading induced by hydrocephalus, which in turn will help design superior diagnostic and treatment protocols. In this thesis, we propose novel numerical simulations for hyrdocephalus using medical images and available finite element software.\n\nIn our first model, we studied the changes in the brain geometry due to the ventricular deformations caused by the pulsatile ventricular pressure. We used the real geometry of the brain taken from MR images and we assumed that the brain parenchyma behaves as a nonlinear hyperelastic solid. Our finite element simulations show that this model is able to correctly predict the large displacements seen in hydrocephalic brains and that once a pressure threshold of 1960Pa has been reached, any further pressure increase due to the natural pulsations of the brain will induce hydrocephalus. \n\nWe also formulate the first neuro-mechanical model of the brain that will couple the electro-chemical and mechanical properties of the brain. We assume that the brain tissue is a charged hydrated soft tissue made of a solid phase, an interstitial fluid phase and an ion phase with two monovalent ion species. This model is able to predict the onset of normal pressure hydrocephalus due to a change in the ionic concentrations of the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid in the absence of an elevated intracranial pressure. This opens the possibility of treating hyrdocephalus noninvasively through the use of pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nFinally, we developed a process for taking medical images and turning them into meshes that could be imported into finite element software. This process allowed us to create geometrically accurate meshes, therefore increasing the accuracy of our simulations. Using these meshes, we perform elastic models simulating an endoscopic third ventriculostomy surgery and brain tumor growth, using the deal.II finite element library.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2993], "author_name_tesi": "Fritz, Jason Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Fritz", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Corina Stefania Drapaca", "Corina Stefania Drapaca", "Francesco Costanzo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Corina Stefania Drapaca, Thesis Advisor", "Corina Stefania Drapaca, Thesis Advisor", "Francesco Costanzo, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["finite element", "brain biomechanics", "hydrocephalus", "triphasic model"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Computer Aided Design, Simulation and Transmission Error Analysis of a Face Gear Pair\n", "id": "19037", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9114", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, there has been significant interest in the development of new and innovative rotorcraft gearboxes. Future helicopter transmissions aim to reduce overall gear train weight while maintaining efficiency and reliability. The Pericyclic Mechanical Transmission (PMT) is one of the compelling candidates that can achieve these goals. It consists of a high reduction ratio, high tooth contact ratio, and nutating/rotating mechanism which incorporates meshing conjugate face gear (FG) pairs. The use of a FG pair is novel for aerospace applications, and represents a new area of research. Accordingly, there is a distinct knowledge gap that must be bridged for this technology to become a reality. With the intention of supporting that effort, this investigation consisted of three key areas: 1) applying commercial modeling and simulation software; 2) conducting transmission error (TE) analysis, and; 3) exploring the performance of a FG pair. The first objective was achieved by generating the FG models with SolidWorks 2012-2013 and then introducing them to the commercial simulation package Abaqus 6.12-2 to evaluate static transmission error (TE). A novel three-dimensional expression of TE was specifically developed for use in a FG pair. When the simulation data was post processed it showed that the FG pair is capable of a peak-to-peak static TE of 0.382 \u03bcm. This result is significantly less than typical values found in industry, which bodes well for future applications. In addition, the physics of the system were well represented, with fluctuations in TE corresponding to teeth entering and leaving the FG mesh, stress concentrations on the inner tooth radius, and clearly visible contact lines (as a function of contact pressure) along a plane of contact. All of these behaviors were predicted by previous literature, and helped build confidence in the simulation. Lastly, the entire process was documented, providing a complete evaluation package for the future.

In an acute or chronic model of experimental IBD, vitamin D or vitamin D deficiency led to a lethal form of intestinal inflammation.  Each model used provided insight into the intricate mechanism of interplay between vitamin D and mucosal inflammation.  At the level of the innate immune response in IBD, characterized broadly by the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) model, vitamin D protected the epithelial barrier by increasing epithelial\u2019 cells resistance to pathogenic aggressors and by decreasing the cytokine and chemokine production by innate immune cells in response to normally harmless antigens.  At the level of adaptive the immune response, which is represented by the T cell transfer model in immunocompromised recipients and IL-10 KO mice, vitamin D decreased the pathogenic potential of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in a manner that seemed to be independent of bacterial microflora.  Lastly at the regulatory level, T cell transfer experiments revealed that vitamin D, rather than modulating regulatory T cell development, influenced their function during intestinal inflammation.  While defects in one of the above mentioned compartments can disturb the fine immune balance and can lead to loss of tolerance for mucosal antigens and thus intestinal inflammation, vitamin D has modulatory capacities in more than one compartment.  This thesis advocates for a protective role of vitamin D in establishing and maintaining immunological self tolerance in the intestinal tract.

Unlike the shallow gas extraction of western Pennsylvania, Marcellus shale development uses much greater quantities of land, water, and other resources. Marcellus shale development is concentrated in two areas within Pennsylvania, the north-central and south-west regions of the state. In the heavily forested north-central part of the state, forest habitat is being cleared and fragmented due to Marcellus shale exploration. North-central Pennsylvania holds the majority of core forest within Pennsylvania and many area-sensitive Neotropical migrant bird species depend on these forests for breeding habitat. Shale gas development in north-central Pennsylvania is of particular concern because of the importance of these forests to a variety of forest specialists. Marcellus shale gas development has created increased levels of fragmentation and edge habitat throughout the region through the creation of pipelines, well pads, and other Marcellus related infrastructure.  In order to investigate the effects of Marcellus shale development on bird species, we used a Before-After Control-Impact study design using the newly completed 2nd Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas (PBBA) as before data and as a sampling framework. During the PBBA (2004-2008) the state was divided into BBA blocks measuring ~2,500 hectares per block. Eight point count bird surveys were completed in each block to estimate bird abundance. During the 2011 and 2012 field seasons, points were resurveyed in 37 PBBA blocks, which served as the after data. Additionally, we compared current bird abundance with differing levels of Marcellus shale development at the BBA block (2488.9 ha) level. We created three species habitat guilds to aid in our analysis; synanthropic (or human-associated) species, early successional species, and forest interior species. The synanthropic species showed a significant positive response to Marcellus shale development in the Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) study and had a positive relationship with increasing levels of Marcellus shale development at the block level. The forest interior species guild exhibited a negative response to Marcellus shale development in the BACI analysis and had a weak negative relationship with increasing levels of well pads at the block level. The early successional species guild exhibited no relationship to Marcellus shale development. These results suggest that Marcellus shale development has caused changes in community structure. The initial response of birds to Marcellus development is an increase in human-associated or synanthropic species, which tend to be generalists, which can utilize newly created disturbances. Forest specialists have not shown extensive declines yet. This is most like due to the short time interval since shale development was initiated and the predominately forested landscape, which still persists. Declines in specialist species and an increase in generalist species will result in biotic homogenization throughout the region. \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8875], "author_name_tesi": "Fronk, Nathan R", "last_name_ssi": "Fronk", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Nathan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham", "Matthew Marshall", "William David Walter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew Marshall, Thesis Advisor", "William David Walter, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Marcellus shale", "well pads", "forest interior", "synanthropic", "core forest"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A Computational Study of Gaseous Jets Submerged in a Liquid Co-flow", "id": "14386maf5524", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14386", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this thesis is to apply Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to multiphase flows to develop an understanding of the underlying flow mechanisms in artificially ventilated cavities and submerged gas jets. These studies are motivated by the need to better characterize these flows by understanding internal pressure and producing predictive regime mapping.  The CFD is utilized to capture effects that are difficult to visualize experimentally.\nFirst, a study on the internal pressure of artificially ventilated cavities is displayed. Investigation into both twin and toroidal vortex closure modes indicates that several pressure regions develop within the cavities. These regions are found to correlate to cavity expansion and contraction that are a function of the closure mode. It is found that the constant pressure assumption within the cavity, used within semi-empirical theory and prediction, is only accurate to a certain degree. \nThis thesis also contains several studies focused on multiphase submerged jets. First we examine the flow structure in the interaction of a gaseous jet with the ambient fluid tested at multiple densities. The main physical finding, consistent with previous observations, is that instabilities develop more rapidly at the gas-liquid interface with increased ambient fluid density. The dynamic response of the interface, partially driven by Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, drives other trends with increasing fluid density such as shorter Mach penetration and faster return to the ambient pressure. A breakdown of the jet spread and development is presented, along with the ambient fluid density effect on characteristics such as the size and spread of the mixing layer.\nLastly, submerged gaseous jets in a liquid co-flow at varying freestream velocities and mass flow rates of the jet, the controlling parameters, are studied. The results show that there are several distinct regimes that form with respect to the controlling parameters. These regimes are classified based on their shared time-averaged and dynamic characteristics, after which a regime map, similar to those used in multiphase pipe flow, is constructed.

Gender gaps in education depress economic growth in the region, and scholars and practitioners alike assert that the amelioration of gender inequality in Africa is critical for further development on the continent. Because the preponderance of research on gender in sub-Saharan Africa examines women\u2019s perspectives, we do not know the full extent to which African men endorse gender equity, or the best approaches to gaining men\u2019s support for greater equality. In the discourse, men are often treated as homogenously problematic and resistant, rather than as a potential source of support for gender equality and gender-focused policies. \n\nThrough a mixed methods approach, this study utilizes 33 in-depth interviews with gender-equitable Ghanaian men and the 2003 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (2003 GDHS), to identify the processes through which some Ghanaian men develop gender-equitable attitudes within this male-dominant context. Using social cognitive theory as a framework to investigate the life course experiences that shape men\u2019s gender-equitable attitudes, an exploratory analysis of the 2003 GDHS reveals that men\u2019s gender attitudes differ by men\u2019s individual, family and environmental characteristics. In-depth interviews with gender-equitable Ghanaian men reveal that natal families, schooling environments, and peer relationships influence the emergence of gender-equitable attitudes. Additionally, men can develop more gender-equitable attitudes in adulthood through experiences that replicate familial, peer, and schooling socialization. As specified by social cognitive theory, men\u2019s personality characteristics are also important, as these influence how individuals understand and interact with their environments. Life course experiences work cumulatively to cultivate the emergence of gender-equitable attitudes among Ghanaian men. \n\nThis study also explores the nature of gender-equitable attitudes among Ghanaian men. Specifically, it identifies how Ghanaian men embody their gender-equitable attitudes, and the social costs and benefits of living out these attitudes. Respondents share a set of core beliefs that guide their gender-equitable perspectives, and a commitment to exhibit these values in their daily lives. Gender-equitable Ghanaian men experience a number of social costs as a result of their gender-equitable perspectives, but respondents agree that the personal benefits of their gender attitudes outweigh these costs. \n\nThis study provides guidance as to where crucial intervention points exist for shaping greater gender-equitable attitudes among men, and offers a constructive commentary on current gender-related policy and programmatic interventions in the region. Also, these findings expand empirical and theoretical understanding of men and masculinities in sub-Saharan Africa, and contribute to the deconstruction of the pervasive assumption that all African men are barriers to gender equity.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [92], "author_name_tesi": "Frost, Ashley Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Frost", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Ashley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["F Nii Amoo Dodoo", "F Nii Amoo Dodoo", "Paul Richard Amato", "Gordon F De Jong", "Michael Paul Johnson", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["F Nii Amoo Dodoo, Dissertation Advisor", "F Nii Amoo Dodoo, Committee Chair", "Paul Richard Amato, Committee Member", "Gordon F De Jong, Committee Member", "Michael Paul Johnson, Committee Member", "Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sub-Saharan Africa", "Ghana", "men", "gender attitudes"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "MECHANISMS OF SINTERING AND SECOND PHASE FORMATION IN BAYER ALUMINA", "id": "14659txf25", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14659", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The vast majority of industrial Al2O3 applications use powders derived from Bayer feedstocks with purity levels of 99.0 - 99.9%. This dissertation explores how the extrinsic powder chemistry of Bayer alumina influences densification, microstructure evolution, and fundamental sintering mechanisms.\nTo determine how grain-boundary composition affects the sintering of MgO-free Bayer Al2O3 dilatometry and sintering kinetics experiments of samples with Na2O and SiO2 concentrations up to 1029 ppm and 603 ppm, respectively, were performed. It was shown that Na2O and SiO2 form a nanometer thick siliceous grain boundary film. The estimated viscosities (20 - 400 Pa\u00b7s) indicate that diffusion greatly depends on the composition of the liquid grain-boundary phase, and densification strongly depends on the Na2O/SiO2 ratio in the samples. For low Na2O/SiO2 ratios, densification of Bayer Al2O3 at 1525\u00b0C is controlled by diffusion of Al3+ through the grain-boundary liquid, whereas for high Na2O/SiO2 ratios, densification can be governed by either the interface reaction of Al2O3 or diffusion of Al3+. Increasing Na2O in SiO2-doped samples increases diffusion of Al3+ and Al2O3 solubility in the liquid, and thus densification increases by 1-2.5%. Based on these findings, it is concluded that Bayer Al2O3 densification is controlled by the Na2O to SiO2 ratio. \nThe stages at which MgO influences densification of Al2O3 were identified by comparing dilatometry measurements and sintering kinetics of MgO-free and 380 ppm MgO-doped Bayer Al2O3 powder. Using high-resolution TEM it was shown that MgO reduces the grain boundary thickness during final stage sintering. It was shown by EDS that MgO increases the solubility of SiO2 in Al2O3 grains near the boundaries. First-principles DFT calculations demonstrated that the co-dissolution of MgO and SiO2 in Al2O3 is thermodynamically favored over the dissolution of MgO or SiO2 individually in Al2O3. For the first time, it was experimentally demonstrated that removal of SiO2 from the grain boundary during final stage sintering is a key process by which MgO enhances the sintering of Al2O3. \nA physical model that describes the dynamic development of grain boundary chemistry and thickness from initial to final stage sintering as a function of chemical and physical powder parameters was developed. The liquid glass phase initially accumulates in the particle contacts due to capillarity and during densification the glass phase distribution changes due to the formation of grain boundaries and grain growth, leading to a dynamic change in grain boundary thickness during densification. Grain boundary thicknesses measured from high-resolution TEM images agree well with predicted film thicknesses. The model shows that the grain boundary thickness is determined by either the concentration of the glass phase in the sample or by an equilibrium film thickness, which is controlled by a balance between attractive and repulsive interparticle forces. Variations in powder chemistry, such as changing the Na2O/SiO2 ratio or changing the MgO concentration, can affect the grain boundary thickness by influencing the interparticle force balance or by changing the amount of glass phase in the grain boundaries. \nThe formation of beta-Al2O3 (Na2O\u00b711Al2O3) is sometimes observed during sintering of Bayer Al2O3, and the conditions and mechanisms of formation were investigated. Formation kinetics showed that the majority of beta-Al2O3 grains form between 0 and 1 hour at 1525\u00b0C, at densities >90%. The amount of beta-Al2O3 increases with increasing Na2O and MgO concentrations, and decreases with increasing SiO2 concentration. SiO2 increases the solubility of Na2O in the grain boundaries by forming a glassy film, and thereby counteracts the formation of beta-Al2O3. At final sintering stage SiO2 is removed from the grain boundaries because SiO2 and MgO form a solid solution in alpha-Al2O3, which leads to the supersaturation of grain boundaries and the nucleation and growth of beta-Al2O3.\nThe Master Sintering Curve (MSC) approach and the factors affecting its accuracy were explored for analyzing the complete sintering profile of Bayer Al2O3. MSC analysis is sensitive to shrinkage anisotropy, which can be accounted for by directional shrinkage measurements, and to powder chemistry and forming technique effects that result in mechanistic changes that cannot be sufficiently described by MSC analysis. It is concluded that Q should not be interpreted as the sintering activation energy, or used to interpret mechanistic differences between powders since Q includes several mechanisms that influence densification throughout the sintering cycle. Despite these limitations, the MSC approach is a useful and practical tool for predicting the effects of thermal load (i.e. time and temperature) on densification of a specific powder and forming process.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15833], "author_name_tesi": "Frueh, Tobias ", "last_name_ssi": "Frueh", "first_name_ssi": "Tobias", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Lynn Messing", "Gary Lynn Messing", "James Hansell Adair", "John Richard Hellmann Jr.", "Douglas Edward Wolfe", "Charles E.

This thesis addresses the lack of generalizability in past research regarding the parameterization of the wavelet feature space.  Specifically, we aim to identify trends in the four parameters in wavelet feature extraction: the wavelet basis function, the number of levels of decomposition, the specific detail spaces from which statistical features are calculated, and the types of statistical features.  Identifying these trends is crucial for the design of complex, automated imagery analysis systems.  This research ultimately impacts many areas, especially biomedical research and medical diagnostics in regards to high throughput imagery analysis.\nWe have experimented on a wide variety of publically available 2D microscope imagery datasets, representative of different modalities of microscope imaging, including phase contrast, fluorescence, brightfield, and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. These datasets represent many common classification tasks, such as identification of subcellular organelles, age, gender, and diet classification, cancer type classification, and genotype-from-phenotype classification in gene knockout cells.  We have also experimented on MR imagery of the human brain for Alzheimer\u2019s disease to contrast the 2D and 3D imaging modalities.  This presents the currently challenging classification problem of differentiating normal individuals from individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  In total, we have selected 10 datasets consisting of more than 5000 images total, allowing us to use 13 independent multiclass classification experiments to explore the wavelet feature space.\nTo complete our research goal, we have created a feature extraction pipeline that sweeps across the four critical wavelet feature parameters.  Each dataset is converted into a wavelet feature representation, and evaluated using a feature ranking, feature subset selection, and classification pipeline.  The classification performance and feature subset selection rates govern our evaluation of the wavelet feature parameter space.\nThis work has identified several key results regarding the parameterization of wavelet feature extraction.  First, many imagery classification problems can favor one (or two) wavelet basis function(s).  The follow-on to this is that the selection of a wavelet basis function is both dataset specific, and task specific within the same dataset, and there is no \u201cmagic bullet\u201d wavelet basis as has been suggested in previous research.  We have identified four univariate statistics (variance, kurtosis, entropy, and channel energy) that are relevant across many different classification problems with many combinations of other parameters.  We have noted the \u201cclustering\u201d selection of gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) statistics, a tendency for a particular classification experiment to favor all orientations of a particular GLCM statistic.  We have noted the significance in terms of selection frequency of the highest and lowest levels of wavelet decomposition.  We have significantly improved performance on image classification problems involving common model organisms, such as mice (95% for age classification, and 98% for gender classification, as compared to 51% and 69% in literature) and the C. elegans worm (78.5% for age classification as compared to 60% in literature).  We have identified sequential forward feature selection as an excellent feature space compression method for wavelet features, achieving feature space compression ratios as high as 10-4.

Research has focused on systems built around compliance to mandated accountability models but often not based on the conviction of school administrators in support of a culture of continual learning and growth. Under ESSA, how will DDDM be viewed and utilized by school administrators? \nThis qualitative research study focuses on the concept of DDDM and school administrators' perceptions of this concept in their school district. 24 school administrators from nine distinct school districts were interviewed for their reactions regarding DDDM. Is DDDM supporting student centered school improvement work based on conviction, or has the concept supported the distortion of a compliance driven educational process?

Additionally, the Rose Run formation is overlain by a thick Huron shale cap rock (>300 m) that has low porosity (<0.10%) and low permeability (<10 mD), which is also laterally continuous. Considering storage potential through mineral trapping and immobilization of CO2 in the pore space, our target reservoir can hold between 10.42 and 20.21 million tons of CO2.\n\nOver the course of 35 years, 1.58 million tons of CO2 will be produced at the Samuel Carlson Generating Station (SCGS) [located in Jamestown, NY] and emitted to the atmosphere if the power output continues at present day rates. Viewed from the reservoir capacity perspective, the Rose Run target reservoir could hold 6.65 times the mass (Mt CO2) of emissions produced at the SCGS during the 35-year period. From our stated formation properties, it is determined that our reservoir has a total mass of 9.3 x 1012 kilograms, with sandstone mass > mixed mass > carbonate mass. \n\nIn considering the potential leakage rate of carbon dioxide out of our injection reservoir, we assume that 0.01% of the total CO2 that is injected into the reservoir is available for migration out of the injection reservoir or 1.58 kilotons could potentially leak out of the target reservoir. To generate CO2 partial pressures high enough to impact water quality, flux rates between 5 and 25 m2 y-1 suggest that total leakage of mobile carbon dioxide could occur between 316 and 63 years, respectively. \n\nTwelve column experiments suggest that even moderate reductions in system pH as related to CO2 saturated water can impact cadmium desorption rates. It further appears that there is a linear relationship associated with cadmium removal from which we can use to infer leaching rates as analogues for the Lake Erie system. An average desorption rate of 25.1% is observed. The influence of calcite and its natural abundance in Lake Erie sediments suggest that desorption rates in the field may be lower than those observed in the laboratory. Experimental results suggest that somewhere between 0.00008 and 0.004 ppm per minute of cadmium is removed from the illite mineral surface after the introduction of an acidic solution to the system\n\nFrom relationship of pCO2 and pH, we can determine carbon dioxide partial pressures that need to be achieved in the laboratory to create CO2 saturated at specific pH values. Levels of risk from aforementioned heavy metal concentrations are produced through the assumption that 20-25% of the available heavy metals desorbs from clay materials as a result of an influx of CO2 at a pCO2 between 0.01 and 2.5 atm.  From these desorption rates, impacts to human health and increases in wastewater treatment costs have been determined. This risk occurs when water consumption exceeds 3.0 liters per day and fish consumption exceeds 0.2 kilograms per week. Because sorption rates suggest only minor increases in aqueous heavy metal concentrations (20-25%), risks associated from Lake Erie water consumption are low. \n\nIt is determined that Cleveland Water currently treats influent Lake Erie water with a heavy metal concentration of 0.211 mg/L. Cleveland Water annually produces over 64,095 kilograms of heavy metal sludge. It is revealed that if 25% of the heavy metals in Lake Erie sediments are mobilized into lake water, annual treatment costs for low, medium, and high concentrations will increase by 135, 355, and 62,500 percent at the municipal level, respectively. \n\nIn considering the volume of information presented, the Rose Run formation can hold sufficient quantities of carbon dioxide produced at the nearby Samuel Carlson Generating Station for 35 years. The selected site of injection lacks any vectors of migration for mobile CO2 and as a result, impacts to water quality do no exceed levels that are harmful to humans or the environment and there is no merit in wastewater treatment retrofitting. Therefore, employing geologic carbon sequestration within the Rose Run formation at our injection is feasible and poses little or no economic or heath threat to humans or the environment.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1767], "author_name_tesi": "Frye, Evan James", "last_name_ssi": "Frye", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Evan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Li Li", "Li Li", "Seth Adam Blumsack"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Li Li, Thesis Advisor", "Li Li, Thesis Advisor", "Seth Adam Blumsack, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lake Erie", "wastewater treatment", "heavy metal", "geologic carbon sequestration"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SECURITY-SCREENING PORTAL FOR HUMAN AERODYNAMIC WAKE SAMPLING\n\n\n", "id": "9985", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5735", "abstract_tesi": "In an effort to increase the throughput of explosive trace sampling in airport security, a trace sampling portal was designed based upon the recirculation region found in the human aerodynamic wake.

Through the prism of its intellectual community of Cheng-Zhu Confucian scholars, this dissertation provides insights into the relationship between the literati elite and the locale which they helped to construct and they represented. It argues that the Quanzhou scholars had a dual-identity: as scholar-officials and as scholar-gentries. As the former, they attempted to associate the local and themselves with the imperial state through elevating the cultural status of Quanzhou. Accordingly, Zhu Xi\u2019s intellectual legacy in the area and the later Cheng-Zhu Confucian scholars were transformed into cultural and symbolic capitals with which the Quanzhou scholars propelled their hometown into a center of learning of national repute. These intangible capitals found concrete manifestations in architectural monuments that became sites of collective memory, which in turn and eventually helped to forge a unique local identity shared by literati and commoners alike. In their capacity as local gentries, their intellectual allegiance to Cheng-Zhu orthodox learning did not prevent them from changing with the times. While their steadfast intellectual faith found expression in their antagonism against Buddhism and the religious syncretic trend popular in Fujian, in an effort to safeguard the welfare and livelihood, they went so far as to defy the imperial ban on maritime trade and actively endorsed the legitimacy and necessity of trade, embracing and promoting a mercantile ethos. In broad terms, this study of the Quanzhou Confucian scholars engages with the historiography of local history in late imperial China while reflecting on question of the scope and nature of the intellectual and social changes that might be construed as a sort of early modernity. \t\t\t\t\t\t", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14774], "author_name_tesi": "Fu, Courtney Rong", "last_name_ssi": "Fu", "middle_name_ssi": "Rong", "first_name_ssi": "Courtney", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["On-Cho Ng", "On-Cho Ng", "Kathlene T Baldanza", "Ronnie Po-Chia Hsia", "Charlotte Diane Eubanks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["On-Cho Ng, Dissertation Advisor", "On-Cho Ng, Committee Chair", "Kathlene T Baldanza, Committee Member", "Ronnie Po-Chia Hsia, Committee Member", "Charlotte Diane Eubanks, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Quanzhou", "Local History", "Literati", "Cultural and Symbolic Capital", "Local Memory", "Local Identity", "Cheng-Zhu Scholars"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Statistical Models for Mapping Genes that Contribute to Shape Variation", "id": "15374", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7807", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Living things come in all shapes and sizes, from bacteria, plants, and animals to humans. Knowledge about the genetic mechanisms for biological shape has far-reaching implications for a range of spectrum of scientific disciplines including anthropology, agriculture, developmental biology, evolution and biomedicine. Despite the fundamental importance of morphological shape, the difficulty in quantifying the shape and modeling the ultra-high dimension of the image data make the task of genetic mapping on it increasingly difficult.\n\nIn this dissertation, we derived several statistical models for mapping specific genes or quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that govern the variation of morphological shape. We are pioneer in the functional shape genetics area and able to detect several significant genes that control the static allometry of the leaf shape traits by incorporating image analysis, statistical model and marker-based linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis.\n\nAfter quantifying the morphological shapes numerically through RCC (Radius Centroid Contour) skills, each phenotype, as a datum, is in the form of samples of functional curves or trajectories with high dimension. In the first model, we decreased the dimension by PCA and illustrated the shape variation piece by piece. In the second model, we developed a nonparametric method to model the mean curve by GEE (Generalized Estimating Equation) local polynomial kernel and model the covariance matrix by functional PCA (Principal Component Analysis. Through functional PCA, we characterized the dominant modes of variation around the overall mean trend function and avoided facing directly the extremely huge dimensional covariance matrix. The models are formulated within the mixture framework, in which different types of shape are thought to result from genotypic discrepancies at a QTL. The EM algorithm was implemented to estimate QTL genotype-specific shapes based on a shape correspondence analysis.\n\nThrough incorporating these procedures into the LD based mapping framework, our model led to the detection of several individual significant QTLs responsible for global and local shape variability, addressed many questions in the genetic control of biological shape, and simultaneously estimated QTL allele frequency and marker-QTL linkage disequilibrium. The statistical behavior of the model and its utilization were verified by both real data analysis on the leaf data from China, and computer simulated data.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7736], "author_name_tesi": "Fu, Guifang ", "last_name_ssi": "Fu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Guifang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rongling Wu", "Dr Runze Li", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli", "Dr Jia Li", "Qiang Du"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rongling Wu, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Runze Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Committee Member", "Dr Jia Li, Committee Member", "Qiang Du, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["QTL", "Statistical Genetics", "Shape Analysis", "Plant", "Functional Data Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Image Restoration and Reconstruction: Beyond Least Squares\n\n", "id": "6563", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2329", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Systems of linear equations with ill conditioned coefficient matrices arise very often in signal and image processing. The most commonly used method for solving such systems is the Regularized Least Squares method, in which the unknown parameters are computed by minimizing a cost function that consists of quadratic data-fitting and regularization terms. We consider techniques\nother than the Regularized Least Squares for solving such systems. Our focus is on image processing problems.\n\nOne implicit assumption behind the least squares solution is that exact information of the coefficient matrix is available. When error exists in both the right hand side and the coefficient matrix, the Total Least Squares method gives better results than the ordinary Least Squares \nmethod. We present algorithms for the\nRegularized Total Least Squares (RTLS) problem. \n\nIn many image and signal processing problems, the coefficient matrices have certain useful structure. For example, in the problems of image restoration and high resolution image reconstruction, the resulting blurring matrices have a Block Toeplitz Toeplitz Block (BTTB) like structure. In the problem of color image restoration, the blurring matrix consists\nof BTTB blocks. However, traditional Total Least\nSquares methods do not preserve the structure in the coefficient matrix. Therefore it is more appropriate to apply Structured Total Least Squares (STLS). This thesis presents Regularized Structured Total Least Squares (RSTLS) algorithms for the problems of high resolution image reconstruction and color image restoration. The major cost at each iteration of our RSTLS algorithms is in solving large sparse and  structured linear least squares systems. We propose to use preconditioned CGLS or LSQR method to solve these systems. We show that Discrete Cosine Transform or Fast Fourier Transform based preconditioners are very effective for these systems.\n\nOther assumptions behind the regularized least squares solution include Gaussian prior distribution of the unknown parameters and the additive noise. When these assumptions are violated, we consider the Least Mixed Norm (LMN) or the Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) solution. \nFor the LAD solution, both the data-fitting and the regularization terms are in the l1 norm.\nFor the LMN solution, the regularization term is in the l1 norm but the data-fitting term is in the l2 norm. Both solutions are formulated as the solution to a convex programming problem, and solved by interior point methods. At each iteration of the interior point method, a structured linear system must be solved. The preconditioned conjugate gradient method with factorized sparse inverse preconditioners is employed to such structured inner systems.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2314], "author_name_tesi": "Fu, Haoying ", "last_name_ssi": "Fu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Haoying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jesse Louis Barlow", "Nirmal Bose", "Michael Ng", "Paul Plassmann", "Hongyuan Zha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jesse Louis Barlow, Committee Chair", "Nirmal Bose, Committee Member", "Michael Ng, Committee Member", "Paul Plassmann, Committee Member", "Hongyuan Zha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["image restoration", "total least squares", "least absolute deviation", "high resolution image reconstruction", "color image restoration"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "THE ROLE OF INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN IN COMPETENCY-BASED EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES: A QUALITATIVE INQUIRY IN THREE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS", "id": "dr26xx36k", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12795", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In response to emerging needs for competency-based education (CBE), the U.S. Department of Education defined the direct assessment program on March 19, 2013 and provided guidelines in the Higher Education Act 34 CFR 668.10 for higher education institutions that planned to seek approval to offer CBE programs that met Direct Assessment regulations.

Findings showed that future CBE programming should be adapted so that: 1) instructional design staff or teams are included in higher-level planning and the decision-making process; 2) it prepares students for workforce needs; and 3) ensures strong student support so that students are retained in either CBE or traditional programs.

However, the interactions of keV gallium ions used in FIB with water ice as the target are still not well understood, impeding the development of this technique for routine use. In this research, FIB milling was investigated in a cryogenic environment to explore the engineering issues for sectioning frozen samples. Thin film samples of amorphous water ice were prepared in the temperature range of 83 to 123 K. Based on different system settings and process parameters, micrometer size features were milled by FIB, and the corresponding sputtering rates were measured by volume loss method. Analytical models, originally limited to astrophysics, were derived to predict the sputtering yield of water ice by FIB. The parameters for gallium ions at keV range were estimated and validated based on the experimental data. Furthermore, the process characteristics of FIB milled water ice were also explored. Different surface morphologies with submicron features that developed during ion bombardment were confirmed using SEM imaging and texture analysis. Experimental results also indicated that the redeposition effect is significant for milling high aspect ratio features on water ice. Results from the experiments were included in a geometric simulation model developed to simulate the milled topology.

The validity of the conjecture in the first two cases implies exactly the partition-theoretical interpretation for the Rogers-Ramanujan identities.

While the number of smokers is still increasing worldwide, the regional disparities of this epidemic between developed and developing countries keep enlarging in recent decades, which shifts the major burden of anti-smoking campaigns to low- and middle-income countries. Education has a lasting significant effect on reducing individuals\u2019 tobacco use. Consisting of three separate but substantially interrelated research papers, this dissertation examines the relationship between education and individuals\u2019 smoking behaviors in China and 17 other East and Southeast Asian countries, most of which are underdeveloped and plagued severely by the tobacco epidemic.\n\nThe first paper investigates the association between educational attainment and individual tobacco consumption patterns across different age-cohorts in China. By analyzing cross-sectional data from the 2010 Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS) in China, I employ cohort-analysis and multivariate logistic regression to examine how educational attainment is related to two crucial indicators of individuals\u2019 tobacco use: their current smoking status, and tobacco-related behavioral change. Then, structural equation modeling (SEM) technique is used to examine two underlying crucial pathways of such education-smoking relationship: individuals\u2019 knowledge about tobacco use, and their attitudes toward smoking behaviors.\n\nThe second paper analyzes the causality in the education-smoking relationship in China. By using data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), I employ two-stage least square (2SLS) technique to draw the causal inference between educational attainment and individuals\u2019 smoking behaviors. The first Compulsory Education Law in China enacted in early 1986 is used as the instrumental variable in this study.\n\nThe third paper extends the research scope from China to 17 East and Southeast Asian countries, investigating how adolescents\u2019 smoking status is associated with the smoking-related factors in different social ecological environments they are frequently exposed to, including families, friends, schools, communities and societies. Multiple logistic regression technique is applied to analyze data from Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) in those 17 countries separately.\n\nIn sum, the results show that the negative relationship between educational attainment and tobacco use is robust and persistent in current China. Meanwhile, the strength of the education effect on individuals\u2019 tobacco-related behavioral change is weaker in middle-age cohort than in both young and old cohorts. Individuals\u2019 tobacco knowledge plays a more significant role in mediating the education effect than their attitude toward smoking, and there is no causality found in the sample in the relationship between people\u2019s years of schooling and smoking behaviors in China. Cross-national analysis on the 17 East and Southeast Asian countries shows that the strongest predictors of adolescents\u2019 smoking behaviors, including peer influence, lack of tobacco knowledge and the quality of health class, are all associated with health education in school. Therefore, improving anti-tobacco education or prevention programs in school could be an effective strategy to control the tobacco prevalence among adolescents in East and Southeast Asia. Furthermore, it is highly necessary to carry out strict anti-smoking laws and regulations to reduce the tobacco epidemic in such regions. More accurate information and knowledge about tobacco use should also be dispersed to the population, especially how harmful smoking tobacco could be to human health.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11097], "author_name_tesi": "Fu, Tian ", "last_name_ssi": "Fu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David P Baker", "Liang Zhang", "Katerina Bodovski", "Duane Francis Alwin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David P Baker, Dissertation Advisor", "Liang Zhang, Committee Chair", "Katerina Bodovski, Committee Member", "Duane Francis Alwin, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["education effect", "tobacco use", "China", "Asia"]}]
