Disparities are known to be linked to multiple individual characteristics, but can also be influenced by the context in which an individual is situated. This dissertation is comprised of three empirical studies that examine the impact of context on women\u2019s breast cancer screening and the unique lived experience of young breast cancer survivors.  \n\nThe first paper examines whether family structure impacts a women\u2019s self-reported mammography utilization using data from the National Health Interview Survey. This study found a significant association between family structure and guideline-concordant mammography screening behaviors. Women living with a partner and no children were most likely to report mammography receipt. \n\nThe second study examines the lived experiences of younger women with breast cancer. During qualitative interviews, participants mentioned the uniqueness of their individual experience, that surviving breast cancer means different things to each survivor, and that they wished additional resources were available for their children. \n\nThe third study of this dissertation explores the feasibility of using a breast cancer risk screening tool as part of an existing mHealth tool in rural Kenya. The increasing rates of breast cancer in low resource countries increases the need for breast cancer screening and treatment. While this study identified challenges for implementing a breast cancer risk metric in a rural Kenyan community, the results of this study can inform the design of additional interventions. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15649], "author_name_tesi": "Holmes, Katelyn R", "last_name_ssi": "Holmes", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Katelyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Marianne Hillemeier ", "Dr. Marianne Hillemeier ", "Dr. Eugene Lengerich", "Dr. Rhonda BeLue ", "Dr. Valarie King"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Marianne Hillemeier , Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Marianne Hillemeier , Committee Chair", "Dr. Eugene Lengerich, Committee Member", "Dr. Rhonda BeLue , Committee Member", "Dr. Valarie King, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["health disparities", "social context", "breast cancer screening", "breast cancer", "mHealth", "Kenya"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "VISION-BASED RELATIVE DECK STATE ESTIMATION USED WITH TAU BASED LANDINGS", "id": "13999wkh110", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13999", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Landing a helicopter on a moving deck is a daunting task for even the most skilled pilot.

Modern radioglaciology uses both the travel times and reflection amplitudes to make inferences about the englacial and subglacial environments; however, non-uniqueness in geophysical data, combined with the large number of physical parameters that control reflection amplitude, have led to significant uncertainties in this type of analysis.\n\nIn this set of studies, I improve on data collection, processing, and assimilation methods, with a focus on radar reflection amplitudes and internal layers. The first two studies are devoted to radar survey methods, in which I examine the impact of reflector geometry on amplitude (2), and investigate an independent measure of radar attenuation using variable-offset data, in an effort to eliminate the effects of ice chemistry and temperature on reflection amplitudes (3). These studies emphasize the fact that radar data are a product of both the physical system and the imaging process, and caution glaciologists from over-interpreting processing artifacts common in radar data collected in areas of complex glacial flow.\n\nIn the following two chapters, I go on to provide glaciological applications of processed radar data, interpreting the record of complex flow left behind in englacial reflector slopes (4), and applying improved boundary conditions to better predict the maximum extent of West Antarctic collapse (5). These studies use geometric information from the bed reflector and englacial reflectors to describe the flow regime present in Antarctica today. Chapter 4 examines how boundary conditions that are difficult to observe directly (the geothermal heat flux, as well as the frictional and deformation characteristics of the ice-sheet substrate) manifest through internal layer deformation. Chapter 5 focuses on Marie Byrd Land (MBL), where historically sparse data coverage hindered our ability to project future ice-sheet behavior. I developed a new basal topography for the region, and modeled the collapse state of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet in an effort to determine how much ice can evacuate from the MBL highlands.

The Judy Chicago Art Education Collection is a living archive of materials on feminist art pedagogy. Teaching Conversations is a feminist orientation to archives that is ongoing and involves participatory engagement and transdisciplinary dialogue to support teaching and using the collection for creating living curricula. The professors are situated in different disciplines and, differ in their teaching and research foci. \nUsing theories of archival experience (Ellsworth, 2005; Latham, 2007; 2011), I analyze conversational interviews for the purpose of understanding archival user experiences of feminist Teaching Conversations with the Judy Chicago Art Education Collection. From conversations with the participants in this study, I present insights on dialogic, feminist, archival orientations that enhance access to archives for teaching and learning. My study reveals the use and engagement with archives as a social practice, where outreach, both on a personal and public level is vital to creating and sustaining a living archive. Through the exploration of three individual journeys with the Judy Chicago Art Education Collection, the study reveals the impact of the invitation to an archive as a sustaining and transformative force for teaching, learning, and community around collections. \nThe participants\u2019 accounts reflect the complexities in the way information, ideas, and ways of approaching a subject in archives can be put into practice. As the three participants engage and meaningfully learn about the Judy Chicago Art Education Collection in different ways, they prove that there are many ways of being in archives and many ways of using and engaging with archives. In the case of one participant (Ginny), her attraction to the Judy Chicago Art Education Collection and the feminist Teaching Conversations project is for the purposes of finding a community for feminist dialogue about teaching and intersecting disciplines to see new possibilities in teaching and in promoting social change. Her archival process is a social process as she learns about and engages with the collection through dialogue with her faculty peers and through her students. She contributes to the living archive by setting up the opportunity for students to be teachers with the materials. Another participant (Margo) comes to the collection looking for opportunities for scholarly activity with others, and to explore what feminist pedagogy is in practice. In Teaching Conversations, she seeks answers to the question of how best to apply the collection to her own practice and has difficulty finding direction. However, when she turns this process around and meaningfully applies herself to the collection from the standpoint of her own personal interests, she comes to a deep appreciation of the Judy Chicago Art Education Collection and Chicago\u2019s feminist work. Through combined social and personal archival processes, she finds her own contribution to the living archive and the added bonus of a potential opportunity to create work with another colleague outside her discipline. The third participant (Rebecca), is a story of transformation through feminist Teaching Conversations, where she slowly finds a sense of empowerment as a teacher and renewed vision for her work. Through her experience of working on her own, to then sharing curriculum, and dialoguing with other teachers also interested in the collection, she discovers her own potential\u2014that her work is a valuable contribution to teaching the Judy Chicago Art Education Collection, and a valuable contribution to the teaching profession that even transcends her own discipline.    \nOverall, this study broadens understanding about using art education archival records for transdisciplinary purposes and demonstrates the value of art education archives. It also contributes to current archival scholarship that seeks to expand on notions of art education archival materials as forms of information and things to experience (Latham, 2007; 2011), and archives as spaces for experiential pedagogy (Ellsworth, 2005), feminist scholarship, and activism (Eichorn, 2010; 2013). Based on the participants\u2019 individual perspectives of the living archive, I suggest emerging qualities of a feminist archival orientation and a feminist archival sensibility. A feminist archival orientation involves flexible, iterative, dialogic, comprehensive, user-centered, and inviting methods, and frames the archive as living, participatory, and transdisciplinary.

The first study reviews and integrates the empirical literature on the influence of organizational factors on hospital financial performance. The second study assesses the impact of hospital physician joint venture activity on hospital performance using a resource dependence and institutional theory framework.    The third and final study assesses the impact of hospital readmissions on the financial performance of hospitals.  \n\nThe purpose of the first study was to examine five categories of organizational characteristics that research has addressed influence hospital financial performance: ownership, governance, integration, management strategy, and quality.  Based on this review I was able to identify a general lack of consistency and conclusiveness across studies in each area. Exceptions were found in the areas of governance (e.g., physician participation and board processes) and integration (e.g., horizontal system centralization). The findings indicate that substantial opportunities for future work, including opportunities for qualitative and exploratory work.\n\nThe purpose of the second study was to assess the impact of hospital physician joint venture activity on hospital performance using a resource dependence and institutional theory framework.     Hospital performance is measured in general acute care facilities from 2004 through 2006 in the state of Pennsylvania using data from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council, the American Hospital Association Annual Survey, and the Area Resource File.  I use cross-sectional ordinary least squares regression models to assess the relationship of joint ventures on performance and occupancy.  I also focus on the moderating influence of hospital size and teaching status on occupancy and financial performance measurements.  Results indicate that hospital physician joint venture activity significantly impacts occupancy and financial performance.  Size moderates the positive association between joint ventures and performance.  Specifically, smaller hospitals experience increases in total occupancy and stronger financial performance at a higher rate than larger hospitals.  \n\nThe goal of the third study was to study assesses the impact of hospital readmissions on the financial performance of hospitals.  I use financial and hospital readmission data from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council for years 2003 through 2009.  Market and organizational variables are from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey Database.  Hospital Case-mix data is from Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  The study combines exploratory factor analysis and multiple regression with random effects and clustering.  I use a risk adjusted composite score of hospital readmissions in the multiple regression model as the independent variable.  Results indicate hospital readmissions for complications or infections have a negative impact on financial performance. \n\nThe findings of these studies taken together address a gap in the hospital performance literature.  First, this research synthesizes the empirical scholarship examining the relationship between organizational factors on hospital financial performance.  It provides suggestions regarding the substantial opportunities for future work, including opportunities for qualitative and exploratory work.  Second, provides new insights into the moderating influence of hospital size on the positive association between hospital physician joint ventures and performance.  Third, it is the first known study to assess the relationship between hospital financial performance and readmissions due to complications and infections.  It provides insights for managers in simultaneously improving quality and reducing unplanned readmissions within a framework of future reimbursement changes that reward performance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7243], "author_name_tesi": "Holt, Harry David", "last_name_ssi": "Holt", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Harry", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Diane Brannon", "Susan Diane Brannon", "Jonathan Rogers Clark", "Deirdre Mccaughey", "James Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Diane Brannon, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Diane Brannon, Committee Chair", "Jonathan Rogers Clark, Committee Member", "Deirdre Mccaughey, Committee Member", "James Thomas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["financial performance", "hospital performance", "joint ventures", "hospital readmission", "resource dependence", "institutional theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Honey bees and intestinal disease: molecular, physiological and behavioral responses of honey bees (Apis mellifera) to infection with microsporidian parasites", "id": "26415", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11712", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Pollinators are integral to modern agricultural productivity and the continued survival and vitality of natural ecosystems.  However, recent declines in pollinator populations and species diversity threaten both food security and the architecture of natural habitats.  Due to their vital role in agriculture, honey bees (Apis mellifera) have served as a model organism for investigating the alarming and widespread diminution of pollinator populations.  Indeed, surveys from both North America and Europe report large annual colony losses.  Parasites along with chemical exposure, poor nutrition, climate change and habitat destruction are frequently cited as leading causes of colony loss.  Honey bee colonies are assaulted by a battery of bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens in addition to other parasitic arthropods including mites and beetles.  Novel, cost-effective disease management practices are desperately needed to preserve colony health.  Basic studies investigating honey bee immunity and disease pathology lay the groundwork for developing efficacious diagnostic tools and treatments.  Here, we present a series of studies characterizing honey bee immunity and the molecular, physiological and behavioral responses of honey bees to two important fungal pathogens, Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae. Chapter 1 reviews the current state of research on these prevalent and destructive disease agents and highlights future studies that are needed to develop effective management practices.  Chapter 2 investigates worker honey bee genomic responses to general immune stimulation.  Findings from these experiments provide a contextual framework for Chapter 3\u2019s studies, which characterize worker honey bee genomic responses to infection with Nosema parasites and offer a molecular model for explaining previously documented disease symptoms.  Chapter 4 investigates drone (male) honey bee molecular, physiological and behavioral responses to Nosema infection and underscores potential caste-specific responses to infection that have larger implications for colony fitness.

The aroma impact compound rotundone was recently identified as the main contributor to the spicy, black pepper aroma in many grapes, wines, herbs, and spices. While the mechanism of rotundone formation remains unknown, it has been determined that mesoclimate plays an important role. Knowing this, studies have suggested that viticultural practices which alter canopy microclimate, such as fruit zone leaf removal, may be useful tools for manipulating rotundone concentrations in the fruit and therefore black pepper character in wines. \n      This two-year study sought to identify the presence of rotundone in the Noiret (interspecific hybrid of Vitis) variety and to determine if and how the timing and duration of cluster sunlight exposure affect rotundone concentration in the fruit, and black pepper aroma intensity in the vinified wines. The timing of sunlight exposure was evaluated through comparison of pre-veraison (LR) and post-veraison (PVLR) single event leaf removal treatments, while the duration was assessed through comparison of a maintained 100% sunlight exposure (MSE) treatment with an undefoliated control (CON). Enhanced point quadrat analysis (EPQA) was used to evaluate the impact of each treatment on vine canopy density and light availability in the fruiting zone. Stable isotope dilution analysis, solid phase extraction and microextraction, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques were used in combination to assess rotundone concentration and the dynamics of its development in the fruit. Descriptive analysis was used to evaluate the black pepper aroma intensities in wines vinified from the vineyard treatments, and these ratings were plotted against wine rotundone concentrations to determine if a correlation exists.\n      This study successfully identified the presence of rotundone in the Noiret variety for the first time. During both seasons, the MSE treatment reduced canopy density and increased fruit light availability as compared to the CON. The leaf removal treatments did not result in differences in canopy characteristics at any time during 2014. In 2015, however, fruit sunlight exposure was increased in the leaf removal treatments, albeit only temporarily. Rotundone was not detectable in fruit sampled before or at veraison. No significant differences in rotundone concentration for either treatment comparison were observed in the 2014 fruit at harvest; however, rotundone concentrations after veraison were significantly (p < 0.10) higher in MSE (1.982 \u00b5g/kg, harvest) as compared to the CON (1.278 \u00b5g/kg, harvest) in 2015. Black pepper aroma intensity scores showed a positive linear correlation (r = 0.7906) with rotundone concentrations in the wines.

Using the Antelope Environmental Data Collection Software Suite, P-wave arrivals were picked using 1-5 Hz bandpass filtered vertical component seismograms.  Initial hypocenters were determined using the IASP91 velocity model.  P-wave arrival times were subsequently used with the HYPOELLIPSE code (Lahr, 1989) and a velocity model developed for Pennsylvania to relocate the events.  The catalog consists of 1355 events in Pennsylvania and is complete to a M_L of 2.0.  Magnitudes were computed using Richter\u2019s (1935) method for determining local magnitude (M_L).  Most events occurred between 12:00 and 22:00 UTC during week days.  The Gutenberg-Richter plot yielded a b-value of 2.63 for the catalog. \nEvents were classified based on criteria used by the United States Geological Survey and others for determining mining-related seismicity.  The results of event classification showed that the catalog predominantly consists of mining-related seismicity.  Through the classification process, 11 of the 1355 events in the catalog were found to be unrelated to mining activity.  P-wave and S-wave arrival times for these events were repicked using 1-10 Hz bandpass filtered data and relocated using the Pennsylvania velocity model and HYPOELLIPSE.  Event locations and origin times were examined to determine if there was a spatial and temporal correlation with natural gas extraction activity.  No correlation was found and therefore there appears to be little, if any, evidence for seismic events in the catalog caused by hydraulic fracturing or wastewater injection.  The 11 non-mining related events all occurred in areas of known faults.  \nA cross correlation match and locate technique was applied to a cluster of events near Williamsport, PA using a template event that occurred on September 25, 2013.  Upon locating the cross correlation detections relative to the template event, and then moving the locations to the centroid of the cluster, it was determined that the cluster is a result of mining-activity at the Thomas Coal Mine. \nThe findings of this study are important for future monitoring of seismicity in Pennsylvania.  The natural gas production region and the bituminous coal region in the Commonwealth overlap spatially.  Accurate event locations, magnitude estimates, and origin times are required to discriminate between mining events and possible seismicity induced by natural gas production.  To obtain that information, a large, permanent seismic network is required.  The amount of mining-related seismicity generated from both coal and industrial mineral mines also creates challenges for detecting and locating small tectonic events in both known and possibly unknown areas of earthquake activity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11534], "author_name_tesi": "Homman, Kyle A", "last_name_ssi": "Homman", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["seismic", "seismicity", "induced seismicity", "earthquakes", "Pennsylvania", "mining", "cross correlation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "REWRITING OF THE PAST AND PARADIGM OF THE FEMININE IN THE QUADROONS OF NEW ORLEANS BY SIDONIE DE LA HOUSSAYE", "id": "8663", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1293", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Les Quarteronnes de la Nouvelle-Orl\u017dans is a novel written by a Creole women of the white francophone aristocracy, and appeard as a serial in a Louisianan newspaper from 1894 to 1898. The action is set in a mythical immoral New Orleans of the early 19th century, and tells the story of multiple characters who belong to different social spheres, yet each linked in some way to quadroons. The Quadroons of New Orleans draws upon different literary genres and traditions, both French and English, to tell stories of love and seduction, but distinguishes itself from other romance novels by the progressive attention the novel gives to the condition of women. Stereotypical tales of seduction give way to complex tales of friendship, personal conflicts and love where quadroons and white heroines alike become less typified, hence permitting the gradual deconstruction of the categories, social class and race assigned to the characters at the start of the novel. In my dissertation, I analyse the substitution of a phallocentric point of view (male gaze) for a gynocentric one (female gaze), through the theoretical framework of narratology and semiotics. The adoption of a gynocentric point of view can be seen everywhere, in the narration of the narrator, but also in the numerous dialogues of the female characters. Women stand out and speak out. My analysis is not limited to the story but also considers the agency of the character of the quadroon (her use of power, knowledge, desire, etc.) and how that shifts throughout the novel. My dissertation concludes by suggesting that those shifts in agency serve as a critique of a male-run society and the moral disorder produced by it.

In the design of any antenna, a significant amount of time and resources is spent on impedance matching. There are two widely used approaches to impedance matching. The first is to modify the antenna geometry by identifying the appropriate degree of freedom within the structure. The second is the lumped element approach, which modifies the antenna with a passive network consisting of inductors and capacitors to the impedance mismatch between the source and the antenna load. In the second approach, different types of circuits can be used in order to obtain the best results, such as a two lumped elements L network, a T network, a three lumped elements Pi network, or a network with more lumped elements. In order to achieve the desired results from these circuits, we must choose the optimal values of inductor, capacitor, and transducer elements. \nTo optimize parameters in impedance matching network design, two of the most promising approaches are those of the nature-inspired genetic algorithm (GA) and swarm intelligence algorithms. Examples of these swarm algorithms are particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), and firefly algorithm (FA). Nature-inspired optimization methods have been used in antenna design for decades in the form of GA and PSO. However, many other algorithms are relatively new to the antenna design problems, even though, these algorithms have already been successfully applied to many other problems and have gained interest in numerous engineering and scientific research fields.\nThis dissertation compares the described optimization methods by using them to minimize the maximum VSWR over the frequencies 3.5-3.85MHz of the impedance matching network that connects to a high-frequency dipole antenna. In order to satisfy the match over a finite bandwidth, lumped elements were used to construct the matching network, and then adjusting the values of L and C elements. Starting with the global optimization toolbox from MATLAB, which uses pattern-search, simulated annealing and genetic algorithm, and then compared with the four newer nature-inspired algorithms listed above. \n\tTo enhance the nature-inspired algorithms, a new modification of the firefly algorithm (MFA) is proposed. The traditional FA is modified to take into account both the light intensity of and distance between each firefly. This modification results in a more realistic movement of the dimmer firefly towards brighter ones. The proposed algorithm is tested on the traditional FA with eleven standard benchmark functions and on impedance matching network design problems, including both lossless and lossy networks. \n\tThe future work for this dissertation is to improve the new MFA by using other techniques such as a hybrid technique with other algorithms. Other more complicated optimization problems can be used to test the MFA.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13100], "author_name_tesi": "Homsup, Nathawut ", "last_name_ssi": "Homsup", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nathawut", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James K.

Furthermore, we must develop such pictures in systems that are optimal rather than convenient.  We must continue to strive towards single-cell resolution analyses, the ability to harvest these cells non-invasively and classification and quantification of all biomolecules with minimal bias.  To that end, the work presented here represents steps to help us explore the tissue and cell specific transcriptomes of select members of the Orobanchaceae, a plant family containing members that span the range of parasitic plant lifestyles, none of which have a sequenced genome.  The first step was a detailed comparison of tools for de novo transcriptome assembly by referencing the 10th generation genome of the premiere plant model system, Arabidopsis thaliana. The results of this comparison reveal de novo assembly is reassuringly good and identifies superior de novo assembly tools.  \n\tConcurrently, a workflow was developed that allows high spatial resolution sampling of cryopreserved plant tissues followed by deep transcriptome sequencing with second generation sequencing technology.  This workflow was applied to a generalist parasite member of the Orobanchaceae, Triphysaria, and was combined with a high performance transcriptome assembler to reveal that this generalist parasite expresses genes in a host specific manner at the host-parasite interface. The sample set was expanded to include two other economically important (i.e. weedy) members of Orobanchaceae, Striga and Orobanche (syn. Phelipanche).  The comparison of these three members of Orobanchaceae, representing lifestyles with increasing dependence upon their hosts, revealed that the host parasite interface in each case is enriched for genes of unknown function.  Excluding gene families detected in shoots, the interface transcriptomes share 11 parasite gene families and many members of these gene families are differentially expressed in tissues and life stages critical to parasitism.  The differentially expressed genes that belong to these shared families are excellent candidates for focused studies that will shed light on the largely unknown molecular dialogue between parasitic plants and their host plants.  These insights represent steps towards understanding the evolution of parasitism in plants and development of novel control strategies for the weedy Orobanchaceae.

The first chapter studies elections in non-democracies. Authoritarian rule requires teamwork of political elites. However, elite class members may lack incentive for the contribution of their efforts. We developed a model to study the decision of authoritarian rulers to introduce elections. Our model suggests that elections can motivate the ruling class to devote more effort to public good provision. Excessive electoral control hinders the introduction of elections, but mild electoral control facilitates it. Our findings offer a new perspective on understanding authoritarian elections and explain many stylized facts in authoritarian regimes. \nThe second chapter studies the impact of observability of a government's action on its optimal strategy and expected payoff in handling protests. In a two-period model, short-lived citizens simultaneously decide whether to participate in a protest. The government can either be a repressive type which always represses protesters, or a rational type which chooses between repressing and making concessions with protesters. Citizens in the second period update their belief about the government's type if they can observe the government\u2019s action in the last period. I showed the condition under which the rational government has a lower expected payoff when its action is observable. Moreover, under the same condition, the government\u2019s expected payoff becomes even lower when its repression cost is also observable. \nThe third chapter studies how a government can use information suppression to prevent protest. In each period of an infinite horizon model, short-lived citizens simultaneously decide whether to participate in a protest against the government. The government represses protesters if the repression cost is low, and makes concessions with protesters if the repression cost is high. Citizens can receive multiple private signals about the government's repression cost. The government, however, can choose to suppress information so that each citizen can only receive one signal. Introducing information suppression gives rise to multiple equilibria. In one class of equilibria, the government suppresses information when its repression cost is neither too strong nor too weak.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11753], "author_name_tesi": "Hong, Hao ", "last_name_ssi": "Hong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Edward James Green", "Barry William Ickes", "Joseph Wright"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Dissertation Advisor", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "Barry William Ickes, Committee Member", "Joseph Wright, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["authoritarian election", "electoral control", "protest", "repression", "reputation", "information suppression"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "NONPARAMETRIC IDENTIFICATION AND ESTIMATION OF PRODUCTION FUNCTIONS USING CONTROL FUNCTION APPROACHES TO ENDOGENEITY\n", "id": "8728", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3270", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Endogeneity and misspecification of models are two main concerns in structural estimation, which usually involves the optimal choices of economic agents with unobservable characteristics. In estimating production functions, input variables are endogenous because input decisions depend on unobservable productivity shocks. Economic theory rarely suggests functional forms for either production functions or the distribution of productivity.\n\nUsing control function approaches to endogeneity, nonparametric identification is established for production functions under weak conditions. The distribution of productivity is also recovered nonparametrically. Instead of \"inverting out\" productivity shocks, the control functions \"smooth out\" the unobserved shocks. Controls are constructed using lagged levels of inputs as instruments, and the\ncontrol function condition is justified by a Markov property of productivity shocks along with interim uncertainty of productivity faced by firms.\n\nNonparametric estimation of production functions then closely follows the identification strategy without imposing extra modelling assumptions. A kernel estimator is proposed for nonparametric regressions with endogeneity. If the preliminary estimators of controls converge sufficiently fast, the estimator achieves the optimal rate of uniform convergence and the asymptotic variance is unaffected by preliminary estimators.\n\nThe same strategy also applies to parametric identification.

A well designed and well planned network benefits social needs in terms of better security, healthier environment, and reduced economic costs due to crashes and congestion related lost productivity time. The study of pedestrian exposure analysis as it relates to pedestrian dynamics in the network, aimed at improving network security and efficiency is still at a very nascent stage. In the past, studies related to pedestrian exposure have been limited to understanding pedestrian flow on a macroscopic level. Thus, studies on the influence of network topology on the concentration of paths at a spatial-temporal level are deficient. \nSpace-time analysis of network topology and pedestrian exposure can provide a framework for integrated safety assessment in dense urban environments, especially in the emerging domain of connected infrastructure. This dissertation\u2019s original contribution is in the area of spatio-temporal methods for micro-scale analysis of pedestrian exposure, with respect to network topology. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of network topology on area-level, and potentially higher-level pedestrian density. Area-density is a reliable measure of space-time exposure that is an outcome of a pedestrian\u2019s origin-destination paths. Higher-level analysis such as at the area-group level can also provide a hyper-level insight into the impact of network topology on pedestrian community density. By knowing the relative contribution of network topology accounting for pedestrian flow and destination attractiveness, insights on network design that minimizes exposure while also optimizing travel time can be gained. In this dissertation, pedestrian exposure is estimated by area-level and higher-level pedestrian densities, utilizing advanced methodologies that integrate area evaluation based on pedestrian dynamics from social-force based micro simulation, and network properties from a fine resolution topological network model.\nThe scope of the study area is set to downtown Seattle in Washington State and the immediate surrounding areas. The network in the study area includes 11 corridors with 33 sub-networks, selected as being critical areas based on high spatial density, high pedestrian travel activity, and the potential for high pedestrian outflow onto the network in the event of an emergency. The data for the study are created using VISSIM and GEPHI, and analyzed at 5 minute intervals during the 3 peak periods (AM, MD, and PM peak).  The parameters for the area evaluation generated by the micro-simulation tool VISSIM are obtained from the dynamic behavior of pedestrians in certain areas, such as, the number of pedestrians, pedestrian area density, dwell time, and delay time. Parameters for dynamic network analysis, and metrics such as degree of node, clustering coefficients, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality, are produced through dynamic and hierarchical graphs using the network analysis tool GEPHI. \nThe objectives of this study require the integration of the spatial-temporal aspects of pedestrian exposure on the network. A spatial perspective on the impact of network topology as it relates to space-time concentration of pedestrians is developed. Spatial Autoregressive models with spatial-autoregressive disturbances and additional endogenous variables (SARAR) are developed for the study, allowing the estimation of spatial dependency, spatial heterogeneity and endogeneity in an integrated manner, while providing insights on the highest density estimates of network effects. As key parameters to estimate pedestrian exposure, pedestrian area density and time occupancy are employed, and these parameters are estimated from the variables of building volume generation, network topology measures along with area dynamics as unobserved effects. Selectivity bias being in the modeling process is captured through a recursive system, with this recursive spatial modeling process accounting for selectivity and endogenous network topologies, while incorporating spatial correlation and heteroskedasticity. Network topology measures influence density endogenously, and affect time occupancy in a recursive manner. \nThe key findings of this study can be summarized as follows. 1) Block level building generation has a significant size effect, with high average total impact and unit elasticity. 2) Community structure appears to matter as being affected by attributes of adjacent areal units; and centrality and connectivity within a network are also significant. 3) The SARAR model appears to be a very plausible end-user model for efficient pedestrian exposure prediction and it can be claimed that constructing the network topology of a grid, and developing a facility level trip generation inventory, is sufficient to estimated pedestrian exposure.\nThe spatial-temporal perspective on the impact of network topology and area dynamics measures for pedestrian exposure analysis makes this study unique. This proposed approach could offer a more robust understanding of the complexities of pedestrian behavior and network dynamics, and can be expected to provide improved insights relating to security along the network, and contingency planning. Furthermore, the identification of areas with high pedestrian exposure or high area-level density in the network can aid in the planning and development of a more efficient walking environment, transit systems (bus routes or operation interval alteration); and possibly the installation of eco-friendly transportation facilities such as bicycle or Segway rentals, and walker or bicycle paths.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10975], "author_name_tesi": "Hong, Jung Yeol", "last_name_ssi": "Hong", "middle_name_ssi": "Yeol", "first_name_ssi": "Jung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar", "Venkataraman Shankar", "Swagata Banerjee Basu", "Jeremy Joseph Blum", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar, Dissertation Advisor", "Venkataraman Shankar, Committee Chair", "Swagata Banerjee Basu, Committee Member", "Jeremy Joseph Blum, Committee Member", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pedestrian exposure", "network topology", "spatial model", "vulnerability", "crosswalk", "safety", "network analysis", "micro-simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "All-optical Image Processing with Nonlinear Liquid Crystals", "id": "18707", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8843", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Liquid crystals are fascinating materials because of several advantages such as large optical birefringence, dielectric anisotropic, and easily compatible to most kinds of materials.

Motor variability has been known to be context-dependent, and thus, the structure of motor variability, as characterized by its probability distributions has been shown to change under different task and environmental constraints.  This raises the possibility that the uncertainty or unpredictability contained within motor variability and at the level of the task and environment can be represented as entropies.  This dissertation examined human motor adaptation to different task and environmental contexts with a view that this adaptive process can be represented as a process of entropy conservation through compensation.  Three experiments were conducted to investigate the hypothesis that human motor adaptation reflects the process of entropy conservation.  The first experiment examined the compensatory effects of spatial and temporal properties of visual feedback from the environment on the entropy of isometric force output.  In this experiment, the entropy of the fluctuations of an index finger isometric force output under various levels of feedback frequencies (temporal) and visual gain (spatial).  Increasing the entropy of the environment through reduced spatial and temporal information resulted in a decrease in the entropy of the force output, as indexed by a decrease Approximate Entropy (ApEn).  This finding reflects a compensatory tradeoff between the effects of spatial and temporal entropy of the environment on the force output dynamics.  Thus, at a constant level of task constraint, a decrease in entropy in the force output is noted when the entropy of the environment is increased.  Experiments 2 and 3 were designed to examine the effects of the task constraint on unimanual and bimanual isometric force production in conjunction with that of the environment.  Here, the entropy of the environment was manipulated through feedback frequency, while the task entropy was altered via the ratio of the required force to the error tolerance.  In Experiment 2, the entropy of the isometric force signal was measured with ApEn; in Experiment 3 the entropy of the motor output was assessed using the information entropy of the relative phase of the isometric forces generated by the index fingers of the left and right hand.  As conservation processes are based on idealized cases, both entropy calculations were made conditional upon the probability of achieving the goal of the action, that is, remaining within the error tolerance bands.  In both experiments, nonlinear decreases in the entropy of the force output were observed as the entropies of the task and environment were increased.  Compensatory effects of the task and environmental entropies on the entropy of force dynamics were found, and these entropy tradeoffs were represented with a quadratic surface that captured a majority of the variance.  These findings show that the context-dependent changes in motor variability in accordance with task and environmental contexts can be characterized through the compensation of entropy across the task, organism, and environment.

All organisms ranging from bacteria to human contain a wealth of small regulatory RNAs that function in a variety of cellular processes. The small regulatory RNAs are involved in regulation of gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, by modifying chromatin structure, modulating transcription factor activity, and influencing mRNA stability, processing, and translation.\nOne of the most interesting of these small regulatory RNAs is SsrA RNA. SsrA with properties of both a tRNA and an mRNA carries out an extraordinary trans-translation reaction that is ubiquitous in bacteria. In cases where a ribosome is arrested on a selected mRNA, SsrA is recruited to the A site of the ribosome. By an unknown mechanism, SsrA causes the ribosome to release the mRNA and resume translation using a short open reading frame encoded within SsrA. This process serves to release the stalled ribosome and adds a peptide tag to the end of the nascent polypeptide marking it for degradation. This unique activity is required for such cellular processes as growth and development, pathogenesis, symbiosis, and stress tolerance.\nThis study focuses on the regulation and physiological function of SsrA using Caulobacter crescentus as a model organism. Asymmetric cell division and differentiation of C. crescentus and the extensive knowledge of the molecular events associated with the cell cycle provide an unique opportunity to study the influence of SsrA activity on cell physiology. In C. crescentus, the initiation of chromosomal replication is delayed during G1-S transition in the absence of SsrA activity. SsrA is also required for plasmid replication. The steady-state levels of SsrA is cell cycle regulated such that its expression is high in both G1 and G2 phases but low in S phase.\nThrough detailed analysis of effects of two highly conserved proteins, RNase R and SmpB, on the regulation of the abundance of SsrA, it has been demonstrated that SsrA is specifically degraded by RNase R at a specific point in the cell cycle and this timing may be regulated by SmpB. Proteomic studies of cellular substrates of SsrA reveal that proteins in diverse functional categories are tagged by SsrA and at least one consensus DNA motif exists that may activate the SsrA system. Genetic and proteomic analyses suggest that SsrA may control plasmid replication by regulating the replication initiation protein, Rep. Taken together, this study establishes a foundation for a more comprehensive understanding of the regulation and physiological role of the small regulatory RNA, SsrA.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5944], "author_name_tesi": "Hong, Sue-Jean ", "last_name_ssi": "Hong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sue-Jean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Charles Keiler", "Philip C.

ANPs have been considered \u201cenergetic materials\u201d due to their high enthalpy of oxidation and potentially applicable to rocket propellant formulations. In addition, there is a growing interest in using the Ge-based semiconductors to replace conventional Si-based semiconductors. However, a quantitative and comprehensive understanding of kinetic mechanisms associated with the above-mentioned systems has not yet been fully achieved, primarily due to complexities of their reaction processes in nature. Given this, the present work is motivated by two research questions: (1) What are the dominant factors that give a higher degree of energy efficiency during the oxidation process of ANPs, and (2) What is the optimal guidance for manufacturing Ge-based semiconductors? As such, this study aims to gain atomistic-scale insights into growth kinetics of passivation layers on ANPs and Ge surfaces using the ReaxFF reactive force field method. To achieve these aims, research strategies included: (a) application of the ReaxFF potential for Al/O system being chosen as a means of understanding the mechanism of the oxidation of ANPs; (b) development and application of a ReaxFF reactive force field for Al/C/H/O interactions to study the effects of surface modification on the oxidation kinetics of the ANPs; and (c) extension of the ReaxFF potential to Ge/Al/C/H/O systems to directly model an Al2O3 atomic layer deposition (ALD) process on Ge surfaces, and comparing computational results with experimental work. Our findings from combined ReaxFF and experimental studies offer very promising options and systematic strategies for the ANPs and the Ge-based semiconductors to be used in the combustion and the ALD applications, respectively.

To facilitate protein annotation, we created a new computational framework, called Adaptive BLASTing, to infer the structure, function, and evolution of proteins from their amino acid sequences. The aims of this framework are to (i) detect particular characteristics of proteins that one is interested from their amino acid sequences, (ii) identity distant relationships among proteins in the twilight zone of sequence similarity (i.e., <25% pairwise sequence identity), and (iii) present the measured information in various formats to facilitate the analysis of proteins from different perspectives. In Adaptive BLASTing, position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) libraries are generated for specific protein characteristics. By using low-identity alignments to compare query sequences with the PSSM libraries, the sequences are represented by vectors of the scores for each PSSM library. Then, distant relationships among proteins are identified based on the correlation (distance) between their vectors. In addition, we developed methods to detect conserved signals that represent a particular characteristic, which can be used to identify the characteristic in proteins. We tested Adaptive BLASTing on three different protein analyses, such as evolutionary analysis of highly divergent proteins, protein fold recognition, and characterization of protein structures. In each of these studies, our method outperforms other benchmarking methods. Taken together, we suggest that Adaptive BLASTing is a promising method for protein annotation. For example, by using multiple PSSMs to represent a single protein family, our method can detect relationships among proteins in highly divergent families more sensitively than traditional profile-based sequence analysis methods. Adaptive BLASTing also enables evolutionary studies to be performed without multiple sequence alignment (MSA) algorithms. The performance of MSA algorithms drops with low sequence similarities and large numbers of protein sequences. As a result, Adaptive BLASTing allows evolutionary relationships to be identified in large sets of highly divergent protein sequences. Finally, this method is applicable to study proteins for any characteristics of proteins, because a PSSM library can be built for any characteristics in theory. Although no existing sequence analysis method is perfect, Adaptive BLASTing can be a promising method to quickly and accurately annotate protein sequences.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6754], "author_name_tesi": "Hong, Yoojin ", "last_name_ssi": "Hong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yoojin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Webb Colby Miller", "Webb Colby Miller", "Randen L Patterson", "Padma Raghavan", "Jayanth R Banavar", "Damian B Van Rossum", "Raj Acharya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Webb Colby Miller, Dissertation Advisor", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Chair", "Randen L Patterson, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Jayanth R Banavar, Committee Member", "Damian B Van Rossum, Committee Member", "Raj Acharya, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Proteins", "Sequence Alignments", "Twilight zone of Sequence Similarity", "Position Specific Scoring Matrix"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Optimal control problems on stratified domains:\nApplication to single-station multiclass queueing systems with finite buffers and overflow costs", "id": "7852", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6899", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We study a class of optimal control problems on stratified domains (OCPSD) and apply the results to an optimal\ncontrol problem for a single-station multiclass queueing system with finite buffers and overflow costs.\n\nIn the optimal control problems on stratified domains, we assume that the state space $mathbb{R}^N$ admits a\nstratification as a disjoint union of finitely many embedded submanifolds ${mathcal M}_i$.

Ferromagnetic topological structures such as vortex and skyrmion are known to be stabilized by the antisymmetric chiral interaction (e.g., Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction). Without such interaction, ferroelectric topological structures (i.e., vortex, flux-closure, skyrmions, and merons) have been studied only recently with other designing strategies, such as reducing the dimension of the ferroelectrics.

The domain structure of PZT tetragonal/rhombohedral (T/R) bilayer is investigated. Strong interfacial coupling is shown, with large polarization rotation to a lower symmetry phase near the T/R interface. Interlayer domain growth can also be captured, with T-domains in the R layer and R-domains in the T layer. For thin PZT bilayer with 5nm of T-layer and 20 nm of R-layer, the a1/a2 twin domain structure is formed in the top T layer, which could be fully switched to R domains under applied bias. While a unique flux-closure pattern is observed both theoretically and experimentally in the thick bilayer film with 50 nm of thickness for both T and R layers. It is revealed that the bilayer system could facilitate the motion of the ferroelastic a-domain in the top T-layer since the a-domain is not directly embedded in the substrate with high density of defects which can pin the domain wall. Excellent dielectric and piezoelectric responses are demonstrated due to the large polarization rotation and the highly mobile domain walls in both the thick and thin bilayer systems.\nThe long-range ordered polar vortex array is observed in the (PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n (PTOn/STOn with n=10~20) superlattices with combined experimental and theoretical studies. Phase-field simulations reveal the three-dimensional textures of the polar vortex arrays. The neighboring vortices rotate in the opposite directions, which extended into tube-like vortex lines perpendicular to the vortex plane. The thickness-dependent phase diagram is predicted and verified by experimental observations. The energetics (the contributions from elastic, electrostatic, gradient and Landau chemical energies) accompanying the phase transitions are analyzed in details. The dominating depolarization energy at short periodicity (n<10) favors a1/ a2 twin domain, while the large elastic relaxation and Landau energy reduction at large periodicity (n>20) leads to the formation of flux-closure domain with both 90o a/c domain walls and 180o c+/c- domain walls, counterbalancing of the individual energies at intermediate periodicities (n=10~20) gives rise to the formation of exotic vortex structure with continuous polarization rotation surrounding a singularity-like vortex core. Analytical calculations are performed, showing that the stability of the polar vortex structure is directly related to the length of Pi times bulk domain wall width, where vortex structure can be expected when the geometric length scale of the ferroelectrics is close to this value. The role of insulating STO is further revealed, which shows that a rich phase diagram can be formed by simply tuning the thickness of this layer.  \nWave-like polar spiral phase is simulated by substituting part of the PTO with BiFeO3 (BFO) in the PTO/STO superlattice (i.e., in a (PTO)4/(BFO)4/(PTO)4/(STO)12 tricolor system) which has demonstrate ordered polar vortex lattice. This spiral phase is made up of semi-vortex cores that are floating up-down in the ferroelectric PTO layers, giving rise to a net in-plane polarization. An increase of Curie temperature and topological to regular domain transition temperature (over 200 K) is observed, due to the higher Curie temperature and larger spontaneous polarization in BFO layers. This unidirectional spiral state can be reversibly switched by experimentally feasible in-plane field, which evolves into a metastable vortex structure in-between two spiral phases with opposite in-plane directions.\nThe switching of polar vortex lattice under capacitor field for the (PTO)16/(STO)16 superlattice is studied, which reveals the existence of polar skyrmion state at intermediate applied bias. This is akin to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability in the fluid mechanics. A similar phenomenon is experimentally observed in the ferromagnetic system recently. The skyrmion-like structure will shrink with the further increasing of applied bias after saturation and eventually disappear given sufficiently large bias, leading to the formation of ferroelectric/ferroelastic twin domains with distinct 90o domain walls. Dimensionality cross-over is demonstrated, where a 1-D vortex core structure can be switched to the 2-D domain wall by the joint of two vortices with opposite curls. Electric-field phase diagram is plotted, showing a wide electric field region which could stabilize the metastable polar skyrmion state. This could serve as a road map for the experimental observation of the ferroelectric skyrmion state.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14669], "author_name_tesi": "Hong, Zijian ", "last_name_ssi": "Hong", "first_name_ssi": "Zijian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Long-Qing Chen", "Long-Qing Chen", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Clive A Randall", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Long-Qing Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Long-Qing Chen, Committee Chair", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Phase-field simulation", "Ferroelectrics", "Topological structure and topological phase transition", "Oxide thin films and superlattices", "Materials by design"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Use of Indigenous Knowledge in Environmental Decision Making by Communities in the Kumoan Himalayas\n\n", "id": "10424", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5898", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study is designed to find out how people in rural communities residing in the middle Himalayas use indigenous knowledge to support environmental decisions while addressing water\u2013 and land use\u2013related concerns.

Unrestricted by runway access and the ability to hover on location for extended periods of time allow the vehicle to complete missions impossible for fixed-wing aircraft.  In general, helicopters have filled this role, but new aircraft are continuously analyzed in search of an improved alternative aircraft.\n\tRecently, a class of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) has utilized a single-ducted fan to provide lift and propulsion.  Compared to the isolated rotor of a helicopter, placing a duct around the rotor increases the total thrust of a vehicle, allowing for the vehicle size to decrease while increasing payload capacity.  The vehicle safety is also improved when operating in close quarters by shielding the rotors from strikes.  There is also potential for reduced noise with the proper acoustic shielding applied to the duct.  However, undesirable aerodynamic characteristics are also associated with the addition of the duct when the vehicle enters forward flight.\n\tHigh drag and large nose-up pitching moments are the two leading aerodynamic flaws experienced by a ducted lift fan as it enters forward flight and encounters edge-wise flow.  A ducted fan wind tunnel model was designed and fabricated for the purpose of quantifying these unfavorable aerodynamic characteristics.  Instead of a single-ducted fan vehicle, this research explores the unique concept of a tandem dual-ducted lift fan vehicle, which would greatly expand the payload capabilities over a single-fan.\n\tMeasurements were first obtained from the dual-ducted fan model while operating in hover.  Rough profiles of the velocity magnitudes above and below the forward and aft fans were obtained through measurements made with a mini-vane anemometer.  The velocities were shown to be more ideal in the aft duct.  The flow in the forward duct was further examined with a five-hole pitot probe above and below the rotor, allowing for measurement of the velocity magnitude and the three velocity components.  The axial velocity was found to be the dominating velocity component above and below the rotor, while the down-stream and cross-stream components related to the slipstream contraction above and below the rotor.  The total thrust of the model was measured with the use of a force balance and the max thrust coefficient was found to be 0.022.\n\tWith the use of Penn State\u2019s wind tunnel facilities, forward flight was simulated.  Flow visualization performed with a single, vertical smoke wire revealed flow separation over the leading edge radius.  Velocity magnitude measurements from a five-hole probe and kiel probe also recorded flow separation in the front half of the forward duct.  The five-hole pitot probe also measured highly angled flow through the duct.  A force and moment balance measured the aerodynamic lift, drag, and pitching moment in several forward flight configurations.  \n\tThe need for a computation tool for the design and analysis of these vehicles was recognized.  Working with Dr. James Dreyer of the Applied Research Lab at Penn State, two types of simulations were designed and validated.  The first model was a steady state simulation which used a momentum source in place of each rotor to simulate rotor thrust.  While this proved capable of rapid-turnaround times, it was unreliable at higher forward flight velocities.  The second model was an unsteady, time-dependent simulation which resolved the rotating rotors.  This fully-resolved model returned lift and drag forces within 5% of the experimental values but demanded greater time resources in order to reach a steady state.\n\tA streamlined nose was fitted over the blunt nose of the original dual-ducted fan wind tunnel model in an attempt to reduce overall drag and flow separation off the leading edge radius.\t  Flow around the streamlined model was analyzed with the use of smoke wire flow visualization and five-hole probe and kiel probe measurements within the forward duct.  Decreased flow separation in the forward duct was made evident by the probe measurements due to increased flow velocities near the leading edge radius.  Compared to the baseline blunt model, the drag was decreased by 4% in some cases and nose-up pitching moment was increased for most conditions.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5148], "author_name_tesi": "Hook, Ryan Franklin", "last_name_ssi": "Hook", "middle_name_ssi": "Franklin", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Dennis Mc Laughlin", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Dennis Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Computational Fluid Dynamics", "Aerodynamics", "Experimental", "Ducted Fan / Rotor / Propeller", "Shrouded Fan / Rotor / Propeller", "Dual Duct", "Tandem", "Wind Tunnel"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "\u201cIF YOU USE YOUR AAC FROM THE BEGINNING OF A RELATIONSHIP, IT WILL BE NORMAL FOR YOU AND YOUR PARTNER, EVEN DURING SEX\u201d: PEOPLE WHO USE AAC AND SEXUALITY", "id": "13729mqh5595", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13729", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Existing research within the field of augmentative and alternative communication documents aspects of sexuality such as preventing abuse, assessing capacity to consent, and providing education and opportunities (Hingsburger, 2010).

Susceptibility to Phytophthora root rot incited by Phytophthora cactorum and P. drechsleri was tested in flooded and non-flooded settings with inoculation tests within a greenhouse with seedlings growing in soilless substrate and outdoors with transplants growing in soil. Fraser fir was highly susceptible to both Phytophthora species, Canaan fir was not susceptible in non-flooded settings but susceptible when flooded, and Nordmann fir was not susceptible in either non-flooded or flooded settings. A fungicide efficacy study was conducted with Fraser fir seedlings in two outdoor experiments. Dimethomorph, fosetyl-aluminum (Al), hydrogen dioxide, mefenoxam, and propamocarb hydrochloride were the chemicals tested. Based upon foliar health ratings and mortality data, dimethomorph was most effective in preventing disease incited by P. cactorum and P. drechsleri. Mefenoxam and fosetyl-Al were somewhat effective in preventing disease incited by P. drechsleri, but less effective in preventing disease incited by P. cactorum. Response to flooding stress was evaluated with a greenhouse experiment with seedlings growing in soilless substrate exposed to weekly flooding events, an outdoor experiment with transplants growing in soil exposed to continuous flooding, and a greenhouse experiment with transplants growing in soil within rhizotrons exposed to continuous flooding. Fraser fir was intolerant of flooding. Canaan fir had some tolerance of flooding. Nordmann fir was very tolerant of flooding. In the rhizotron study some Nordmann fir developed hypertrophied lenticels and surficial roots after exposure to flooding. In this research a gradient of susceptibility to root disease occurred across the true fir species tested. Fraser fir was the most susceptible to root disease, Canaan fir had an intermediate degree of susceptibility, and Nordmann fir had the least susceptibility to root disease. This suggests that true fir crops may be viable in locations unfit for Fraser fir production.

In these cases, submeso motions (i.e., non-turbulent motions with horizontal scales of a few meters up to 2 km) of uncertain origin can dominate the shear-generation of turbulence and vertical mixing, as well as generate \u201cmeandering\u201d horizontal motions and substantial horizontal dispersion in the SBL. It is thought that submeso motions in moderately complex terrain may be associated with internal gravity waves and terrain effects such as slope flows and cold pool interactions, or a combination of both. Data to confirm this hypothesis have been largely unavailable. To better understand the physical processes involved, we propose a method involving both observational and modeling techniques. Case studies of seven nights in late August and early September 2011 were chosen based on quiescent weather conditions and full availability of observational data from our central PA network of eight ground-based towers (ranging in height from 2-50 m AGL) and two SOund Detection And Ranging (SODAR) systems (with remotely observed wind and atmospheric stability measurements from 30 m up to ~250 m AGL). Observational data from this network have been continuously collected since 2007, generating a much larger data archive than most other studies of the SBL. \nUsing numerical modeling results from the Penn State Realtime Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at sub-kilometer (\u2206x=444 m) horizontal grid spacing in central PA, and archived wind and temperature data from the towers and sodars, we determine the dominant sources and types of submeso motions present and their effects on the surface flow. The combination of the high vertical resolution of observations and accompanying high-resolution, realtime, daily WRF model forecasts makes the Rock Springs network unique compared to other networks.\nThe proximity of the Rock Springs network to complex terrain features leads to a large percentage of nocturnal periods that are characterized by very weak winds, even when compared to other SBL environments. Combining network observations and model forecasts with data on the synoptic conditions and the properties of the submeso motions, we hypothesize that local terrain and roughness elements (trees, buildings, etc.) can perturb the flow and therefore be responsible for the generation of submeso motions. Gravity waves and drainage flows appear to be dominant sources for many of the submeso fluctuations in the network. \nWe classify each of the seven cases as very stable or weakly stable according to the percentage of bulk Richardson number values exceeding a transition value for each 12-hour case. The bulk Richardson number is constructed from 1-minute averaged wind and temperature observations. We find that submeso motions exist in all seven cases of this study, regardless of stability class. Furthermore, the stability classification chosen here is insufficient for predicting the occurrence or types of observed submeso motions. On the other hand, the characteristics of lower atmosphere synoptic conditions relative to the local terrain are much more important for determining submeso motions in our instrument network. In particular, we find that synoptic scale wind speed, wind direction, and cloud cover can influence characteristics of near-surface submeso motions. The case study results presented here can be used to enrich the community\u2019s knowledge of the SBL and motivate the development of numerical parameterizations of unresolved submeso motions to improve the accuracy of plume dispersion models.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8014], "author_name_tesi": "Hoover, Joshua Daniel", "last_name_ssi": "Hoover", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniel", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott James Richardson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott James Richardson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["submeso", "complex terrain", "stable boundary layer"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "AN EVALUATION OF AN EXTENSIVE GREEN ROOF MAINTENANCE METHOD", "id": "10670", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5129", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe work presented in this thesis evaluates a green roof maintenance procedure designed specifically to increase the number of plants in genus Sedum growing in sparsely vegetated portions of an extensive green roof.  Over their life, green roofs may suffer from poor plant coverage because of factors such as poor initial plant establishment, unfavorable growing conditions, extreme weather, and poor maintenance.  Through evapotranspiration, plants contribute significantly to the stormwater and cooling benefits a green roof provides, so maintaining thick plant coverage is important.  Plant death also leaves behind areas of exposed growing media which provide weed seeds a place to germinate.  Sedum species are desired over other species because of their ability to survive the stresses of living on a green roof thus providing the benefits of evapotranspiration over the entire growing season.  The procedure proposed herein seeks to increase the number of Sedum plants with minimal inputs of labor, plant material, and fertilizer, thereby decreasing long term maintenance costs.  Through a series of experiments outside on an experimental green roof, and in a climate controlled greenhouse, this thesis demonstrates that Sedum plants on an existing green roof provide a large and viable source of new Sedum cuttings that when dispersed on exposed green roof media will propagate themselves into new Sedum plants. On the experimental green roof, control treatments, where no cuttings were harvested and no cuttings were spread, had significantly fewer new plants per square meter than all treated sections, where cuttings were harvested and spread.  A reel mower showed significantly more new plants per square meter than a string trimmer, while both tools required the same amount of time to complete treatment.  The greenhouse experiments found no relationship between the rooting of sedum cuttings and irrigation regimes.  Three of the four species tested, S. album, S. sexangulare, S. spurium (John Creech) exhibited 100% rooting after 10 days, regardless of whether they were watered daily, every other day, twice in 10 days, or watered when they were spread and not watered again. S. kamtschaticum exhibited 100% rooting eventually, but not within the 10 day study period.

This distinctive feature allows tiltrotors to operate at two different design points: hover and cruise. The conflicting requirements of hover and cruise come with consequences. Tiltrotors are plagued with an aeroelastic instability caused by structural and aerodynamic coupling of the wing and large propeller called whirl flutter. Researchers at Penn State have shown that adding span extensions and winglets to tiltrotors can improve the whirl flutter margin. These wingtip devices may improve whirl flutter margin but alter the aircraft aerodynamics and mission performance. This thesis presents a design investigation of improving tiltrotor cruise performance with the use of span extensions and winglets.\nThe important constraint of maintaining baseline hover performance was imposed. Cruise performance is improved by optimizing span extensions and winglets for range specific transport efficiency. Range specific transport efficiency accounts for the aerodynamic and structural impacts of the wingtip devices. The aerodynamic performance is calculated using a multiple lifting line method for non-planar wing geometries. This performance tool conducts fast, accurate calculations, that when coupled with a genetic algorithm optimizer, results in a computationally inexpensive method for design optimization.

Since there are limits on the amount of information that can be conveyed in a given space or time, precision must be used in selecting the tools that most clearly and effectively convey necessary health information. This dissertation drew on culture-centric narrative theory (Larkey & Hecht, 2009) and exemplification theory (Zillmann, 1999) to inform the development of a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine promotion intervention. The dissertation consists of two studies. The first study identified determinants of HPV vaccine acceptability among college-aged women. The second study, a randomized controlled trial, tested the impact of narrative source on HPV vaccine decision-making and in a second set of analyses, tested mediators of narrative persuasion&#9135;identification with media characters, narrative transportation, perceived realism, and vividness. \nResults of the first study identified assumptions underlying college women\u2019s decisions to accept and resist the HPV vaccine. Four assumptions underlying women\u2019s decision to accept the HPV vaccine included: the importance of supportive family messages, the importance of explicit health care provider endorsement of the HPV vaccine, descriptive peer norms normalizing HPV vaccination, and disease framing (i.e., cancer) shaping the benefits of HPV vaccination. Five assumptions underlying college women\u2019s decisions to resist the HPV vaccine included: skepticism of vaccine safety, the idea that alternative prevention strategies provide sufficient protection, stigmatizing messages related to HPV, overcoming self-efficacy barriers, and delay strategies. Common to all women\u2019s narratives was that relationship status framed women\u2019s perceptions of HPV susceptibility. The decision narratives shaped the content and focus of an HPV vaccine video intervention that was developed to reach college-aged women. Results of the second study, a randomized clinical trial of the intervention, tested for the effects of narrative source on vaccination. Findings showed that after controlling for HPV knowledge, sexual activity, and daughter-parent vaccine communication, the combined peer-and-health care provider narrative intervention significantly increased HPV vaccine self-efficacy, intent and uptake. The second set of analyses, which tested narrative mediators, showed that identification with exemplars significantly mediated the relationship between peer narratives and HPV vaccine intent and that identification accounted for 71% of explained variance in a narrative communication model. Narrative transportation accounted for 56% of explained variance in the model, but showed effects only as a precursor of identification. Vividness, defined by the formal properties of video, accounted for 9% of explained variance in vaccine intent. Perceived realism did not significantly contribute to explaining how narrative source impacts HPV intent. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for advancing narrative message design for health promotion contexts as well as advancing HPV vaccine communication for practitioners are discussed. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5948], "author_name_tesi": "Hopfer, Suellen  ", "last_name_ssi": "Hopfer", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suellen ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael L Hecht", "Michael L Hecht", "Michelle E Day", "S.

My purpose as a researcher was to investigate the students\u2019 cognitive and affective interpretations and reinterpretations of multicultural poetry in a learning environment supportive of each person\u2019s awareness of himself/herself as a maker of meaning (Berthoff, 1990).  Conscious awareness of oneself as a maker of meaning in a social context is integral to the development of critical consciousness, which encourages human agency.  \n\nIn my teaching as inquiry into developing critical consciousness, I share my philosophy of education informing my agency as a teacher and researcher.  I discuss interpretation of language, curricula and culture, connections through poetry in curricula, pedagogical approaches for developing critical consciousness and agency, and evaluative approaches for growth in terms of multicultural poetry for children as essential to education for shaping the mind and nourishing the spirit.  I also discuss my philosophy of poetry focusing on multicultural poetry as political and potentially transformational.  I believe reading and hearing multicultural poetry can help nurture students\u2019 aesthetic readings, raise social and environmental awareness, develop critical consciousness, and encourage human agency.\n\nAs I share the students\u2019 and my dialectical writings making meanings of multicultural poems, I explore our revisiting of uses of rhyme and rhythm\u2014often associated with humor and playful narrative poetry\u2014in contexts of poetry and verse as voices for social justice.

Recent technological progress has enabled field monitoring of soils that can achieve unprecedented duration, temporal precision, and accuracy. Soil moisture lies at the heart of many soil dynamics, so this thesis explores two relationships involving soil moisture. First, it uses preferential flow patterns to examine the interplay between water movement and soil structure. Second, it looks at aspects of soil climate (soil moisture and soil temperature) on two time-scales: trends over several years and daily dynamics.\n\nTo quantify the rate of occurrence of preferential flow (PF), and its controls, and to examine the influence of land cover and irrigation on water flow dynamics, soil moisture was monitored at six depths every two minutes from four sites in or near a wastewater spray irrigation field from 2009 through 2011. Two irrigated sites \u2013 one cropped and another forested - were compared with two corresponding non-irrigated sites. The activation of preferential flow pathways was determined from the sequences of soil moisture responses at various depths, with a total of 633 events across four sites, including 82 irrigation events. The results showed that the overall averaged rates of occurrence of PF at the non-irrigated sites were 24.9% at the cropped site and 24.7% at the forested site. By contrast, the averaged rates at the irrigated sites were 47.1% at the cropped site and 45.0% at the forested site. The temporal stability of PF occurrence was evaluated, showing that the overall rate of occurrence of PF stabilized after 70 events at non-irrigated sites, while the irrigated sites took as many as 105 events (24 of which were irrigations). \n\nAssociations between 20 possible controlling parameters related to water input, moisture response, and season were quantified using the Student\u2019s t-tests between each parameter and PF detection. The most influential factors were water inputs, specially the total input and peak input intensity, with three of the four sites indicating these as strong (p < 0.05) controls over PF occurrence. Antecedent soil moisture and response slope (Maximum 2-minute increase in moisture content during the response) were also significant at some depths at some sites. Soil horizonation influenced soil water storage and dynamics by restricting flow and causing perched \nwater tables. Irrigated sites experienced satiated conditions for as much as 38% of the monitoring time at some depths, compared to a maximum of 3% at non-irrigated sites. Preferential flow was not only more likely to occur during irrigation events, but also during natural events at these irrigated sites, suggesting that the irrigated soils have physically adapted to accommodate large volumes of water, as a result of decades of spray irrigation. The results of this study have implications for understanding hydrology and contaminant fate in anthropogenically-altered landscapes as well as implementing sustainable management practices.\n\nSoil moisture and soil temperature have a complex relationship that has been rarely studied explicitly in field conditions over long periods of time. Soil moisture data was accompanied by soil temperature data collected from six depths from 5 cm to 100 cm over 4.5 years (2008 through 2012), allowing us to study the effects of land cover and wastewater irrigation on soil moisture, soil temperature, and their relationship, at four sites at Pennsylvania State University\u2019s \u201cLiving Filter.\u201d  Exploration of long-term trends showed negative correlations (linear R2 as high as 0.92 at 5 cm) between soil moisture and temperature at most depths and sites. \nLand cover effects were largely overshadowed by the strong influence of irrigation, despite clear effects of forest cover on temperature. Soil moisture and temperature experienced their greatest variability in alternating seasons (temperature in Spring/Fall, soil moisture in Winter/Summer), highlighting the complexity of their relationship. The long-term correlations between soil moisture and temperature were dependent on season, with winter and spring often causing small positive correlations. Daily soil thermal parameters, damping depth and thermal diffusivity, were calculated for each probe (5 cm to 40 cm), and depth-dependent damping depth curves were proposed to improve on the simple profile-wide damping depth parameter used in most modeling. Daily thermal diffusivity values were compared to mean daily soil moisture, but the expected non-linear relationship was not found.

Measurement was done by assembling a vertical thrust stand board inside a vacuum chamber.  The thruster was mounted via flexible WR-112 waveguide to 1-kg load cell.  Pressure was evacuated from the chamber to levels of 0.1 Torr and plasma was formed using ammonia and decomposed-ammonia simulated hydrazine as propellants.  Thrust measurements were taken at previously determined parametrically optimized values and reconciled against predicted values computed from pressure differential calculations.\n  \nThe 8-GHz MET uses the resonant TMz011 mode to excite a propellant gas into a free-floating plasma.  Due to density gradients and buoyancy issues in the plasma chamber, a vertical thrust stand was employed in order to obtain maximum thrust values.  This constraint provided several challenges in thrust stand design, including cavity redesign, load cell sensitivity issues, and vibration noise issues caused by the vacuum chamber pump.  Cavity redesign also allowed for materials optimization, including the reconstruction of the cavity using stainless steel for its better electrical properties, and a boron nitride separation plate.  A converging\u2013diverging nozzle with an area ratio of 25:1 was also included in the design to get more realistic operational values.\n\nThrust measurements in most cases were within 20% of predicted values and yielded more repeatable results than previous thrust measurements using deflection cones and momentum traps.  While some of this error could be accounted for with measurement uncertainty, this is still too large of a discrepancy between theoretical and measured values.

Through his work, Sudnow offers a study of the human body engaged in a complex activity.  \nThe purpose of this study is to use Sudnow\u2019s methodology to examine the journey one encounters when learning to ride a bike.  Specifically, this study seeks to explore the nature of improvisation and to determine what promise it holds for informing us about sports in general and cycling in particular.  What are the benchmarks that lead to the experiencing of improvisational behavior in the practices of jazz music and modern dance?  Are these benchmarks analogous to those encountered when learning to ride a bike for long-distance and endurance?\nHow one learns to ride a bike has defied accurate description since the bike\u2019s invention.  Those who have attempted to describe the complex intermingling and negotiation of forces necessary to keep the rider and machine upright and moving forward have rarely succeeded in their quest.  The skill seems to be too complicated to be described in words.  Riding a bike has long been described as a \u201cdifficult to explain yet easy to perform\u201d phenomenon.  This characterization has also been attributed to the performances of jazz music and modern dance.  In fact, many musicians and artists have likened the ability to create improvised behavior to the skill of riding a bike.  This study offers a description of this \u201clearning to ride a bike\u201d phenomenon by providing a closer examination of human performance in improvisational activities.\nThis study begins with a review of Michael Polanyi\u2019s work Meaning.  This text focuses on the acquisition of skills and their use in practical activities.  Polanyi\u2019s characterization of tacit and focal awareness provides important structure to this dissertation.  A review of the jazz music and modern dance literature then follows.  From this literature, the benchmarks one may experience on the way to becoming a skilled improviser are revealed.  Then, a review of the first-person cycling literature is considered followed by an account of the author\u2019s own experiences in learning to ride a bike for long-distance and endurance.  Together, these cycling perspectives describe a pathway one may experience when learning to ride a bike for long-distance and endurance.  The improvisation and cycling pathways are then compared to determine similarities and differences.  \nThis comparison reveals that riding a bike can be roughly analogous to improvisation when viewed as one of Polanyi\u2019s \u201ctechnical inventions.\u201d  However, it is further revealed that cycling can be more forcefully analogous to improvisational conduct if riding a bike takes on Polanyi\u2019s \u201cartistic frame\u201d revealing mythic storylines of \u201cflowing creativity.\u201d\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4908], "author_name_tesi": "Hopsicker, Peter Matthew", "last_name_ssi": "Hopsicker", "middle_name_ssi": "Matthew", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Mark Dyreson", "Douglas Ray Hochstetler", "Doug Anderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar, Committee Chair", "Mark Dyreson, Committee Member", "Douglas Ray Hochstetler, Committee Member", "Doug Anderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cycling", "improvisation", "phenomenology", "jazz music", "Polanyi", "modern dance", "Sudnow"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "ROLES OF THE CLAVAT1 AND ERECTA CLADES IN ARABIDOPSIS ANTHER DEVELOPMENT\n\n", "id": "7470", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1039", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Anther development, and therefore male fertility, relies on the coordinated differentiation of several adjacent cell types.  Establishment of these cell layers likely involves cell-to-cell communication pathways as plants rely more on positional cues than strict cell lineage for their development.  Currently, only a few genes are known to be involved in Arabidopsis early anther development, particularly in the establishment of these different cell layers.  The SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE (SPL/NZZ) gene functions in early anther development to promote formation of the sporogenous cell type.  Subsequently the EXCESS MICROSPOROCYES1/EXTRA SPOROGENOUS CELLS (EMS1/EXS) specifies the formation of the tapetum.  SPL/NZZ encodes a putative transcription factor, while EMS1/EXS encodes a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) and is thought to function with other known LRR-RLKs to mediate tapetum differentiation.  CLAVATA1 (CLV1) belongs to a four member clade of LRR-RLKs including BAM1 (for BARELY ANY MERISTEM1), BAM2 and BAM3.  The bam1 bam2 and bam1 bam2 bam3 mutants are male sterile, suggesting that BAM1, BAM2 and BAM3 are important for normal anther development.  Recent work has also shown that loss of the three ERECTA (ER) genes, ER, ERL1 and ERL2, results in underdeveloped and presumably sterile anthers, indicating that this gene family may also play a role in anther development.  The objective of this research is to understand the function of the BAM and ER genes in Arabidopsis anther development.  In addition, the relationship between SPL/NZZ, EMS1/EXS and the BAM genes in specifying anther cell differentiation is examined.  Analyses using molecular markers and cytological techniques shows that bam1 bam2 anthers appear lack the normal anther somatic cell layers and produce only pollen mother-like cells (PMLs), indicating a very early defect in cell fate specification.  Furthermore the bam1 bam2 bam3 triple mutant anther can produce the somatic cell types and BAM3 expression is drastically increased in the bam1 bam2 mutant flowers.  This indicates that BAM1/2 mediate a signal to negatively regulate BAM3 expression in order to properly specify the parietal cell type.  In addition, the meiotic cells of the bam1 bam2 double and bam1 bam2 bam3 triple mutants degrade, suggesting these cells are defective and BAM1, BAM2 and BAM3 may be important for normal meiosis.  Mutant analysis also demonstrates that SPL/NZZ is epistatic to BAM1/2, and BAM1/2 are in turn epistatic to EMS1/EXS.  Finally, phenotypic analysis of the ER-family mutants indicates that these genes act redundantly to promote cell proliferation during anther development and to direct normal growth and differentiation of anther cell layers, particularly the tapetum.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1029], "author_name_tesi": "Hord, Carey LeeAnna Hendrix", "last_name_ssi": "Hord", "middle_name_ssi": "LeeAnna Hendrix", "first_name_ssi": "Carey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Ma", "Teh Hui Kao", "Timothy W Mcnellis", "Paula Mc Steen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Ma, Committee Chair", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member", "Paula Mc Steen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CLAVATA1", "anther", "Arabidopsis", "Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases", "ERECTA"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "GEOPHYSICAL OBSERVATIONS OF POLAR ICE SHEETS AND ICE SHELVES\n", "id": "10182", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2200", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Knowledge of processes, dynamics, and the ongoing mass-balance of polar ice sheets is essential if we are to understand the response of the cryosphere to a changing climate. Here we present a series of hypotheses and associated observations and interpretations addressing the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Specific attention is paid to the grounding line, ice-shelf mass balance, and crystal orientation fabrics in streaming ice. Initially, GLAS ICESat laser altimetry data is used in an accurate and rapid method of grounding line location. The method exploits the high surface-slope at the grounding line relative to the flat ice-shelf and ice streams. Validation is performed using ground-based observations and comparisons between the modern grounding-line and past estimates indicate that the Siple Coast grounding line has been largely static for at least several decades. During this time the ice streams have been undergoing large changes in flow speed indicating that the grounding-line position is insensitive to such changes. In order to address the mass balance of the Ross Ice Shelf, a divergence method assuming steady-state is used to estimate the spatial distribution and magnitude of basal melting (Mb). An area average rate of -0.08\u0006 +/- 0.01 m/a is estimated indicating that accretion dominates the sub-ice-shelf environment with rates of Mb=-0.32 \u0006 +/- 0.01 m/a estimated in the centre of the ice shelf. Our estimates of accretion are an order of magnitude higher than previous studies and we caution that this is likely due to the divergence method misinterpreting past non-steady-state behavior of the ice streams. High melt rates (1.3\u0006 +/- 0.1 m/a) are observed at the ice shelf front. The ice front is further investigated using spatial and temporal elevation changes from GLAS ICESat laser altimetry data. Melt rates are observed to increase exponentially as the front is approached, from zero at approximately 40 km from the front to an average of 2.7\u0006 +/- 0.9 m/a within the front kilometer. Melt estimates are best fit by the relationship Mb=2.1exp(x/11800) m/a. Melt at the front is modeled as a combination of tidally-induced mixing and the ascension of buoyant water from beneath the ice shelf, indicating a relationship between melt profile and calving history. In the final section of this study, active-source seismic data are reported from an upstream location on Greenland's fastest-flowing outlet glacier, Jakobshavn Isbrae\u001a. Englacial reflectivity in these data reveal the development of complex and alternating crystal orientation fabrics, which we associate with changes in impurity loading brought about by climactic changes. These fabrics likely result in strain localization and therefore have implications for predictive ice sheet modeling.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2181], "author_name_tesi": "Horgan, Huw Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Horgan", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Huw", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Richard B Alley", "Charles James Ammon", "Chris Marone", "Charles Holland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Dissertation Advisor", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Committee Chair", "Richard B Alley, Committee Member", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Member", "Chris Marone, Committee Member", "Charles Holland, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["seismology", "greenland", "antarctica", "basal melt", "grounding line", "ice sheet", "ice shelf", "glaciology", "geophyscis", "remote sensing"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "In search of hyperlocal news: An examination of the organizational, technological and economic forces that shape 21st Century approaches to independent online journalism", "id": "13394", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7093", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, many popular media reports have observed a new phenomenon in news known as hyperlocal online news.

The purpose of this research was to first gather some systematic data that would allow us to generalize about the current state of hyperlocal news.

However, the data also suggests that among the hyperlocal sites, the sites that emerged as more technologically innovative and more supportive of democratic forms of communication were often sites that either focused on news at the neighborhood level or sites that received private subsidies.

The goal is to develop a system which can collect and characterize motion data that is comparable to current state of the art research equipment using only commercially viable products. First a low cost, low bandwidth inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor that can be strapped to a person\u2019s wrist is interfaced via I2C connection to an Arduino board. Custom firmware on the Arduino is used to collect relevant motion data pertaining to the person\u2019s upper extremity. This data is sent to a LabVIEW interface on a computer where it can be monitored in real time by a physician. For comparison, data from the exercises is also collected from the Eagle motion capture system from Movement Analysis Co. A side by side comparison is given between the IMU sensor and the motion capture system.\nThe same IMU sensor system, firmware and software, is then implemented on a standard weighted bar, a common rehabilitation device. Using a motor driven weight and closed loop feedback control, the system can adjust the weight distribution of the bar. The sensitivity and balance of the bar can all be fine-tuned for specific patient needs. The goal is to allow clinicians to provide personalized training and exercise adjustments, while simultaneously monitoring a patient\u2019s performance in real time for a more targeted rehabilitation.\nWhen analyzing wearable IMU sensors, the correspondence of individual features extracted varies depending on several aspects of the sensors and motion being performed.  In particular, mean acceleration does not correspond well to the camera system. Linear negative mean jerk metric had high correspondence, particularly for cases with less smooth motion. RMS acceleration magnitude showed high correspondence when not corrupted by measurement error. Dominant frequencies only show high correspondence when noticeable shaking is present, and may not be useful otherwise. The frequencies also tend to appear on specific axes, which is dependent on the motion being performed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10749], "author_name_tesi": "Hornung, Taylor Christian", "last_name_ssi": "Hornung", "middle_name_ssi": "Christian", "first_name_ssi": "Taylor", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jason Moore", "Stephen Jacob Piazza"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jason Moore, Thesis Advisor", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wearable Sensors", "Inertial Sensors", "Motion Capture", "Stroke", "Rehabilitation", "Therapy"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Soil Formation and Terrestrial Biosignatures in the Middle Cambrian", "id": "9375", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3723", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The composition and importance of terrestrial ecosystems during the Cambrian is the\nsubject of frequent speculation due to poor preservation and a paucity of comprehensive\nstudies.

The development of Alfisols and\nUltisols in the study area is consistent with weathering in a subtropical climate. Western\nsites tended to by slightly drier as compared to eastern sites.

The objective was to explore the significance of gender for women managers, the relationship of the body to management, and uncover knowledge of fostering somatic pedagogy.\nThe theoretical framework guiding this study, feminist poststructuralism, offered a lens through which to view the importance of gender. Additionally, the feminist poststructural constructs of positionality, deconstructing binaries, language, and discourse offered insight into the way women managers make meaning of their bodies\u2019 role in constructing and making meaning of knowledge.\nUtilizing a feminist participatory action research design, the study offers an example of feminist research that takes women\u2019s issues and concerns into consideration and emphasizes collaboration through active participation. As action research, the study is unique because of its origination and implementation in the community as opposed to a formal classroom or organization. Data collection was completed through an initial interview, journaling, email communication, and a follow-up interview. The fifteen participants offered a range of perspectives about the bodies\u2019 connection to management as well as the significant ways gender impacts their managerial style and experiences as a female manager. \nThe study contributes to the fields of adult and management education considerable data about embodied ways of sharing and creating knowledge, which adds to an under-researched but developing aspect of each field. Specifically, the study offers both adult and management education three major areas important to somatic pedagogy.       \n\nFirst, the relationship of dialogue to somatic learning emerged as critical to the experience. The participants found the embodied dialogue during the workshop sessions validating, empowering, and reassuring. Second, maintaining learner centrality involves ongoing inclusiveness of lived experiences, existing knowledge, and ideas and opinions of those invested in the learning process. Fostering learner-centeredness was especially important to the participants who strongly valued the interaction with other professional women and for creating a safe atmosphere in which to share details about their body\u2019s experience in relationship to managing. Third, the study expanded upon the participants\u2019 existing consciousness of their bodies and urged them to consider their bodies\u2019 actions and reactions in a particular context, which in this case was management. Through yoga, the women were able to relate concepts from poses to management practice such as flexibility, strength, conflict, balance, honoring decisions, taking time to focus, and stress management. Each of these findings presents vast implications for the development and implementation of a somatic pedagogy for adult and management education as well as organizations dedicated to holistic training and development. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6202], "author_name_tesi": "Horst, Tara Lynne", "last_name_ssi": "Horst", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynne", "first_name_ssi": "Tara", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward W Taylor", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Jo Tyler", "Helen Margaret Hendy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward W Taylor, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Member", "Jo Tyler, Committee Member", "Helen Margaret Hendy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["management education", "somatic pedagogy", "women managers", "feminist participatory action research", "body", "yoga"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "In Service Of The State: Desertion, Discipline, And Army Life In The Habsburg Monarchy, 1753-1781", "id": "28742", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12647", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The first standing army in the Habsburg Monarchy was officially founded in 1649.

At its heart, it seeks to answer the question: why did some soldiers serve and why did others choose to flee military service?  In particular, this dissertation is concerned with the multiethnic, multi-confessional, and multilingual nature of the Habsburg Monarchy--a monarchy that encompassed parts of almost two dozen modern European countries--and how the diversity of the recruited soldiers influenced the legal and administrative processes of the Habsburg standing army from 1753 to 1781.  Given the amount of diversity in the Monarchy, how did the military forge a unified force?  Based on the records of the Hofkriegsrat (the highest military administrative body in the Habsburg Monarchy until 1848) and collections of legal documents, this dissertation is composed of: an analysis of the legal status and treatment of deserters, a history of the actions of the Hofkriegsrat regarding desertion, and case studies of specific acts of desertion by individuals and groups.  By studying deserters, \u201cIn Service of the State\u201d provides insight into the development of state power in the eighteenth century and ultimately the relationship between the individual and the state.

Escape genes can closely juxtapose X-inactivated genes and provide a tractable model for assessing boundary function at epigenetically regulated loci. To delimit sequences at an XCI boundary, we examined female mouse embryonic stem cells carrying X-linked BAC transgenes derived from an endogenous escape locus. Previously we determined that large BACs, carrying escapee Kdm5c and flanking X-inactivated transcripts, are properly regulated. Here we identify two lines with truncated BACs that lack all or part of the distal Kdm5c XCI boundary. This boundary is not required for escape, since despite integrating into regions that are normally X inactivated, transgenic Kdm5c escapes XCI, as determined by RNA FISH and by structurally adopting an active conformation that facilitates long-range preferential association with other regions that escape XCI. Yet, XCI regulation is disrupted in the transgene fully lacking the distal boundary; integration site genes up to 350 kb downstream of the transgene now inappropriately escape XCI. Altogether, these results reveal two genetically separable XCI regulatory activities at Kdm5c. XCI escape is driven by a dominant element(s) retained in the shortest transgene that therefore lies within or upstream of the Kdm5c locus.

However, little research has examined the consequences of different script bilingualism on production. The primary goal of the present research was to determine whether language-specific differences, such as script, can modulate cross-language activation and the locus and manner of language selection in planning spoken words. To address this question, three experiments (simple picture naming, picture-word interference, and language switching) compared the performance of Japanese-English and Spanish-English bilinguals. In Experiment 1, bilinguals named cognate and noncognate pictures in each language. The results showed that both groups produced significant cognate facilitation in each language. The findings suggest that in the absence of the written lexical form, script differences do not function as a language cue to reduce cross-language activation. Furthermore, both languages appear to be activated to the level of the phonology. In Experiment 2, bilinguals named pictures in their L2 while ignoring visually presented distractor words in the L1. A critical finding in Experiment 2 was that both types of bilinguals showed phonological and translation facilitation, whereas only Spanish-English bilinguals demonstrated semantic interference and phono-translation facilitation. These results suggest that when the script is present in the task, different-script bilinguals are able to exploit perceptual information as a language cue to lexical access earlier than same script bilinguals. In Experiment 3, the bilinguals performed two language switching tasks, one with pictures and another with words. In each experiment they produced two names in L1 and two names in L2 in strict alternation. Although the two bilingual groups were similar in picture naming, Japanese-English bilinguals were slower in L2 than Spanish-English bilinguals in word naming, suggesting again that script differences create costs in mapping of orthography to phonology in L2. Taken together, the results of the three experiments suggest that although script differences cannot direct lexical access selectively, they allow the bilingual to select the language of production at an earlier point in speech planning when they are perceptually available.

This device, referred to as the Robotic Dynamic Activity Simulator (RDAS), represents the newest version of a previous model, the Dynamic Gait Simulator (DGS).  The RDAS simulates muscle function and the motion of the tibia in the sagittal plane over a time-scaled stance phase event that includes heel-strike and toe-off.  The behavior of the foot and ankle is a result of the forces developed between the plantar surface of the foot and the force plate, the simulated muscle action and the constrained kinematics of the proximal tibia.  The RDAS offers distinct advantages over the DGS, most notably the ability to vary simulation kinematic input parameters to optimize simulations for individual specimens.  \n\n   To assess the fidelity of the loading environment generated with the RDAS, six cadaver specimens were evaluated during walking simulations.  The sensitivity of these simulations to the anthropometric characteristics of subjects from which kinematic data were taken and used as input to drive the device was investigated.

The kinematics of the foot and ankle during walking simulations were representative of in vivo behavior.  The GRF reproduction exhibited improvements over the DGS for some conditions and was representative of in vivo behavior in the sagittal plane, but was dependent on the targeted tibial motion and anthropometric matching between the subjects from whom kinematic input data were derived and the experimental cadaver specimens.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [132], "author_name_tesi": "Hoskins, Andrew Howard", "last_name_ssi": "Hoskins", "middle_name_ssi": "Howard", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Sommer Iii", "Neil Sharkey", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Sommer Iii, Committee Chair", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Chair", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cadaver walking simulation", "dynamic gait simulation", "foot and ankle biomechanics", "robotics"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Salinity effects on polyvinyl alcohol separators and the use of spray-on separators in air-cathode microbial fuel cells", "id": "21863", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10058", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Separators in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) can be used to increase coulombic efficiencies (CEs), but they can also adversely affect power production. A new spray method of PVA separator preparation was compared to the traditional cast preparation method. Anode solution conductivities were varied to span values typical of domestic wastewater (~1 mS/cm) and laboratory solutions (7 and 13 mS/cm). Power densities were unaffected by the addition of a PVA separator onto the Pt catalyst cathode in the low conductivity solution relative to MFCs lacking a separator. However, power densities were reduced by 28% in a 7 mS/cm solution, and by 50% in a 13 mS/cm solution. The use of a separator enabled close placement of the electrodes, which resulted in power production 33% higher than control MFCs with widely spaced, separatorless electrodes in the 1 mS/cm. This low-conductivity condition was the only instance of where the power density was higher than that of the control. The reduced impact on power production in the low ionic conductivity solution was attributed to swelling of the PVA polymer, and the smaller contribution of solution resistance to total resistance in lower conductivity solutions.  Addition of PVA onto activated carbon cathodes produced results similar to those obtained with the Pt catalyst, with a 26% reduction in the maximum power density (from 702 \u00b1 29 mW/m2 to 519 \u00b1 6 mW/m2) in the 7 mS/cm solution. The reduction in power was reduced to <10% (636 \u00b1 64 mW/m2) when switching to closely spaced electrodes compared to MFCs lacking a separator with widely spaced electrodes in the 7 mS/cm solution.  Cast separators on both AC and Pt catalyst cathodes produced power densities 7-8% greater than the spray-on separators in a 7 mS/cm conductivity solution.  These results show that spray on separators can be an effective method for insultating closely spaced electrodes in low conductivity solutions and that PVA can be used as a separator in low conductivity solutions to increase CE with minimal effect on power production.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9755], "author_name_tesi": "Hoskins, Daniel Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Hoskins", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Thesis Advisor", "John Michael Regan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bioelectricity; bioelectrochemical; microbial fuel cell; separat"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Development of a Computational Fluid Dynamics Tool to Explore the Interactions between Cancer Cells and Leukocytes", "id": "9260", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4086", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new multidisciplinary computational method has been developed to model the physics of interacting systems of blood and cancer cells.

Testing an anti-ram barrier is by nature destructive and costly, so previous research [1] developed and validated scaling of the tests.  This thesis utilizes this small-scale testing capability to examine many methods and systems for modifying natural boulders as anti-ram barriers.  To obtain perspective on this scaling, a full-scale boulder barrier that was able to achieve a M30 pass rating as an anti-ram barrier has a mass of 9,750 kg, while its small-scale equivalent has a mass of 11.8kg. A goal of this thesis is to provide design guidance to determine which devices should be evaluated in full-scale testing, based on the lessons learned from small-scale testing.  \nThe simplest barrier design considered herein is a very large boulder that can dissipate the energy of the impacting vehicle.  However, such boulders are quite large and difficult to install.  This thesis explores engineering solutions that produce smaller rock barriers that yield similar or better results than the large rock barriers.  Additionally, this thesis explores methods to evaluate the potential of rock barrier failure due to fracture of the rock.  The evaluation process is based upon small-scale experimental tests of various rock samples.\nThe end results of this research are realization of several methods to enhance the ability of boulders to arrest the progress of an impacting vehicle.  These enhancements include performance improvements; for example, some of the engineered systems in this study improve the results of a single boulder design by reducing post-impact rotation by 42%.  Other designs improve the efficiency of installation, saving substantial time and money yet having end results that are similar in performance to the baseline design.  Overall, this research shows that it is possible to use smaller, more cost-effective boulder designs as part of an engineered system to impede an impacting vehicle. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10087], "author_name_tesi": "Hoskins, Samuel Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Hoskins", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Samuel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean Brennan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sean Brennan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Small-Scale", "Anti-Ram Rock Barrier", "Cohesionless Soil"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Confined locomotion in viscous and viscoelastic fluids at low Reynolds number", "id": "28887", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12469", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Locomotion of microorganisms plays a vital role in most of their biological processes. In many of these processes, microorganisms are exposed to complex fluids while swimming in confined domains, such as spermatozoa in mucus of mammalian reproduction tracts or bacteria in extracellular polymeric matrices during biofilm formation. A better understanding of the hydrodynamic interaction of a motile microswimmer with a boundary in a viscoelastic fluid is crucial to elucidate many biological processes, such as adhesion of bacterial cells during the formation of microbial biofilms. In the recent years, the swimming of motile microorganisms in complex fluids has received significant attention. It has been shown that the viscoelasticity of the ambient fluid alters the swimming speed and efficiency of a single microorganism as well as a population of motile cells, depending on the rheological properties of the background fluid and the swimmers' propulsion mechanism. However, the majority of these studies assumed the fluid environment to be an unbounded domain. Therefore, the boundary induced effects, which are ubiquitous in microorganisms' natural habitat, on their swimming behavior in complex fluids are poorly understood. \n\nIn this dissertation, we analytically investigate the combined effect of background fluid elasticity and confined environment on the swimming dynamics of a single microorganism. The self-propelled microorganism is simulated using a archetype model, known as \"squirmer\". In this model, the radial deformations of a self-propelled microswimmer is neglected and locomotion is merely induced via tangential motion of the swimmer's surface. We use a perturbation expansion to solve the Stokes equations in an Oldroyd-B fluid in the presence of a planar no-slip boundary. To this end, for the first time, the fully resolved solution of a confined squirmer in a Newtonian fluid in the absence of inertial forces is presented. The kinematics of swimming are examined for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional models and for the latter the investigation is extended to different types of boundaries. Our results are mainly presented through a phase portrait in swimming orientation and distance from the interface and are compared to that in a Newtonian fluid. We show that even in the limit of small Weissenberg number, the swimming dynamics significantly alters which leads to a dramatic increase in the residence time of the swimmer near the boundary.

While many species of mammals use multiple types of noise-induced modifications, the details of vocal responses to noise are unclear. Open questions include whether specific noise parameters elicit certain modification types, whether animals can adjust different vocal characteristics independently, and what effects behavioral contexts have on vocal noise compensation. The goals of this dissertation were to evaluate these questions, and to characterize the effects of noise amplitude and bandwidth (including degree of spectral overlap) on the acoustic structure of vocalizations produced by two acoustically dependent non-human mammal species. Methods included passive acoustic recordings of vocalizations, investigation of the subjects\u2019 acoustic habitats, and controlled playback experiments. \nAmplitude and spectral characteristics of acoustic habitats were examined for two (one captive and one wild) beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) populations. In the wild habitat, noise was measured during beluga encounters at two sites. Noise sources and levels varied between the two recording locations, with higher overall levels and a higher vessel/beluga encounter rate at Beluga River, and more noise from weather events at Kenai River. In the captive habitat, at Mystic Aquarium, noise levels were substantially higher than noise in Cook Inlet, and noise varied spatially within the exhibit and over both short- and long temporal scales. Comparison of noise levels with published beluga audiograms suggests that due to the differences in noise levels, belugas at Mystic Aquarium would be likely to hear noise at and above 2 kHz, and that in Cook Inlet, belugas are more likely to hear only noise above 4 kHz. \nNoise-induced vocal modifications were studied in both the captive and wild beluga populations during increased noise from exhibit maintenance or vessel passages, respectively. In both populations, noise-induced changes to vocalization structure were observed, primarily in the spectral content of calls. In captive belugas, minimum call frequencies were significantly related to narrowband noise levels, while in the wild population peak frequency was more likely to be related to noise levels. There were no consistent relationships between the duration of calls and noise levels in either population. Behavioral or environmental contexts also had significant relationships with vocalization structure, indicating a possible interaction between the signalers\u2019 communicative motivation and vocal noise compensation strategies, as observed for human speech. Modifications observed from the captive whales appeared unlikely to increase communication success during increased exhibit noise, but those produced by wild whales may serve a noise compensation function. \nExperimental tests of the onset order of vocal modification types and subjects\u2019 attention to specific noise parameters were performed with a captive group of cotton-top tamarins (Sagunius oedipus), an acoustically dependent social New World primate. Observed vocal modifications included the Lombard effect, frequency shifts, and temporal changes, but differed between the two examined call types. Changes to the spectral content and amplitude of vocalizations appeared to occur non-simultaneously for both call types. Data in this chapter represent the first observations of short-term changes to the spectral content of non-human primate vocalizations, and the first empirical demonstration of shifts in spectral tilt in non-human mammal calls. Similarity in responses of humans, cotton-top tamarins, and other non-human mammals indicate relative consistency of selection for signalers able to compensate for short-term increases in noise level. \nThe work presented in this dissertation expands current knowledge of the effects of noise on acoustic communication by nonhuman animals, and advances both theoretical understanding of the evolution of vocal noise compensation and practical considerations of the use of vocal modifications for monitoring and conservation of vulnerable species. It provides substantial evidence for the importance of communicative motivation in vocal noise compensation, and demonstrates previously unknown vocal flexibility in a well-studied non-human primate species. This dissertation advances the study of acoustic communication by non-human mammals, with relevance to the evolution of communication and applied conservation biology. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7948], "author_name_tesi": "Hotchkin, Cara Frances", "last_name_ssi": "Hotchkin", "middle_name_ssi": "Frances", "first_name_ssi": "Cara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Parks", "Susan Parks", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read", "Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "Jennifer L Miksis Olds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Parks, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Parks, Committee Chair", "Victoria Anne Braithwaite Read, Committee Member", "Tracy Lee Langkilde, Committee Member", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Member", "Jennifer L Miksis Olds, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vocal modifications", "acoustic communication", "the Lombard effect"]}, {"year_isi": 2000, "title_ssi": "Life's Influence on the Sedimentary Record: The Interplay of Ocean Chemistry, Circulation, and the Biological Pump", "id": "5817", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2243", "defended_at_dtsi": "2000-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tIn the modern ocean, the distributions of a variety of chemical elements are controlled by a combination of physical circulation and the metabolic activities of marine organisms.  While mixing acts to homogenize ocean chemistry, chemical gradients in oxygen, phosphate, and carbon isotopes are created through a process known as \"biological pumping,\" the transfer of elements from surface to deep waters via the production, sinking, and decomposition of organic matter.   Similar processes must have been at work in ancient oceans, but chemical patterns of certain time periods preserved in the geologic record are very different than today's, prompting many authors to suggest different operation of either biological pumping or circulation during those time intervals.  Accurate interpretation of ancient chemical patterns, however, requires disentangling the competing effects of biology, physics and changes in bulk ocean composition, which is difficult through intuition alone.   This study utilizes observation and numerical models to explore what combination of factors best explains chemical signals preserved in the geologic record and how the biological pump has operated through earth history.\n\tFor the Paleoproterozoic, the efficacy of biological pumping is evaluated through a combination of field data and numerical modeling.  Samples of carbonate cements collected from the Pethei Platform, a 1.9 Ga stromatolitic reef, reveal a substantially reduced carbon isotope gradient with depth relative to the modern gradient, 0.5 versus 2\u2030.  Such a small gradient would conventionally be interpreted as indicating a weak biological pump, but steady-state simulations using a two-box model of the Paleoproterozoic ocean suggest that the lack of a carbon isotope gradient may instead be due to high partial pressures of carbon dioxide in the Paleoproterozoic, which would increase the ocean's dissolved inorganic carbon content and damp the effects of biological pumping.\n \n\tA second box modeling study investigates the role of biological pumping in creating deepwater anoxia in the post-Carboniferous Phanerozoic.  Previous work had suggested that anoxia might be the product of either increased or decreased thermohaline circulation. Using open-system 3- and 4-box models of ocean circulation and nutrient cycling, we show that different mechanisms may operate to create anoxia on long and short timescales, and that estimates of ocean oxygenation are sensitive to the circulation scheme and vertical resolution of box models.  Overall, we find that changes in low-latitude productivity and thermohaline circulation interactively cause dysoxic to anoxic conditions on long timescales, while reduction of convective mixing induces rapid transitions to persistent dysoxia or anoxia in all simulations.\n\tFinally, the relative contributions of biological pumping and ocean circulation to Permian deepwater anoxia were evaluated using a general circulation model of the ocean coupled with a biogeochemical model of phosphate and oxygen cycling.  Previous authors had postulated that stagnation of ocean circulation led to deepwater anoxia in this time period.  We find that climatic warming consistent with Permian paleoclimatological evidence reduces ocean circulation rates and lowers deepwater oxygen concentrations to anoxic levels.\n\tAlthough the competing factors controlling ocean chemistry make extracting a causal mechanism for ancient chemical patterns complicated, these numerical experiments demonstrate the utility of numerical models in deconvolving the competing influences of marine biological activity, circulation, and ocean composition.  Our results suggest that large differences in chemical patterns among geologic time periods do not require cessation of either productivity or circulation, and that the sedimentary record of ocean chemistry is consistent with the presence of an active biological pump throughout earth history.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2224], "author_name_tesi": "Hotinski, Roberta Michelle", "last_name_ssi": "Hotinski", "middle_name_ssi": "Michelle", "first_name_ssi": "Roberta", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hiroshi Ohmoto", "Lee Kump", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hiroshi Ohmoto, Committee Member", "Lee Kump, Committee Chair", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ocean stagnation", "Pethei", "Permian", "Precambrian", "carbon isotopes", "anoxia", "biogeochemical cycles"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "GIS-based Spatial Analysis for Large-scale Solar Power Systems with Respect to Transmission, Distribution and Grid Integration: Case Study of Wyoming, U.S.", "id": "15513", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7305", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Efforts to incorporate renewable energy sources into current and future electricity regimes have been brought about due to the challenge of an increasing demand for electricity, retirement of aging conventional generation facilities, along with the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions from existing conventional energy sources.

Resulting locations were then analyzed according to transmission, distribution and grid integration in relation to populated areas and existing transmission lines.

Miniaturization of materials and devices requires shape memory actuation which is uncompromised at a small scale.  However, size effects need to be understood in order to scale shape memory actuation with the minimum size critical to device design.  Controlling material quality and properties is essential in fabrication of shape memory alloys into nanometer regime.  This work demonstrates a novel fabrication technique, biased target ion beam deposition (BTIBD), which uses additional adatom energy in order to fabricate high-quality nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloys thin films with nanometer thickness.  These fabricated ultrathin NiTi films provide insight into the size scale dependence of shape memory functionality at nanoscale regime.  BTIBD provides additional adatom energy to the growing film in order to fundamentally tailor the film growth mode for quality and properties.  An independent ion beam source is customized in BTIBD to provide low-energy ions (tens of eV) during growth of films on substrates.  Pure Ti and pure Ni targets are co-sputtering in BTIBD to fabricate NiTi thin films.  The prepared NiTi films are continuous, and the thickness ranges from several tens to a few hundreds nanometers.  The composition is controllable over the range of Ni-rich (>50.5 at% Ni), near-equiatomic, and Ti-rich (<49.5 at% Ni).  The film surfaces are consistently ultra-smooth \u2212 twice as smooth as conventional NiTi thin films fabricated by magnetron sputtering \u2212 over all the composition ranges and over wide surface areas.  The substrate/film interface is smooth and the interfacial diffusion is a minimal portion of the film thickness.  Crystallographic phases and grain size in BTIBD NiTi films with thickness on the order of 100 nm are tunable via heat treatment.  The as-deposited BTIBD films are amorphous.  A pure B2 phase (without other microstructural phases) is achieved via low-energy ion beam preheating of the film.  Coexistence of B2 and B19' phases are formed by post-deposition annealing, and the grain size increases in diameter as the annealing temperature increases.  NiTi thin films prepared by BTIBD are absent of columnar-void morphology at the surface and produce a large grain size, in contrast to the columnar-void prevalence and small grain size in magnetron sputtered films.  It is postulated that columnar-void morphology is imposing constraints on crystallization for formation of limited grain size.  Thermally-induced phase transformations occur to the ultrathin BTIBD films and are observed using temperature-dependent thin film stress measurements.  The thermal hysteresis in these films is considerably smaller (up to 50 %) than that in magnetron sputtered films.  Free-standing NiTi alloy 1D nanowires are machined from the NiTi alloy thin films by using nanoskiving.  Results are also shown for focused ion beam 1D micropillars, 2D thin sheet with nanometer thickness, and 2D micro-double shear specimen as additional objects to investigate geometric/microstructural size effect.  Nanoskiving combines deposition of thin films with thin sectioning to generate nanowires.  NiTi nanowires herein are generated under extreme conditions of alloy composition and sectioning orientation.  The mechanism of nanoskiving on NiTi alloy is postulated, and supported by microstructure characterization.  The preliminary findings demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of nanoskiving of metallic alloys.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11362], "author_name_tesi": "Hou, Huilong ", "last_name_ssi": "Hou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huilong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Reginald Felix Hamilton", "Reginald Felix Hamilton", "Mark William Horn", "Md Amanul Haque", "Long Qing Chen", "Jerzy Ruzyllo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Reginald Felix Hamilton, Dissertation Advisor", "Reginald Felix Hamilton, Committee Chair", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanoscale thin films", "Shape memory alloys", "Biased target deposition", "Phase transformation", "Structure and properties"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Development and Application of An Improved Reactor Analysis Model for Fast Reactors", "id": "19771", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8871", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Accuracy in neutron cross sections calculation and consistency in reactor physics are fundamental requirements in advanced nuclear reactor design and analysis. The work presented in this dissertation focuses on the development and advanced application of a reactor analysis model with updated cross section libraries that is suitable for online cross section generation for fast reactors. Research has been performed in two areas of interest in reactor physics.\n\nThe first target of the research is to develop efficient modeling capacity of the 1-D lattice code MICROX-2 for its neutron spectrum calculation based on Collision Probability Method (CPM). Expanded master cross section libraries have been generated based on updated nuclear data and optimized fine-group energy structure to accommodate both thermal and fast reactor spectra as well as to comply with the need for advanced fuel cycle analysis. After verifying the new libraries, the solution methods have been reviewed and updated, including the update of interpolation scheme for resonance self-shielding factors and improvement of spatial self-shielding models for various fuel assembly geometries. The assessment of the updated lattice calculation models has shown that the prediction accuracy of lattice properties represented by the eigenvalue and reaction rate ratios is improved, especially for fast neutron spectrum lattices of which the importance of neutrons in the unresolved energy range is high.\n\nThe second target of the research is to improve the accuracy of few-group nuclear cross section generation for the reactor core calculation. A 2-D pin-by-pin lattice model has been developed based on embedded CPM within the framework of the Nodal Expansion Method (NEM), which is capable of modeling the heterogeneity of the fuel assembly. Then, an online cross section generation methodology along with discontinuity factors has been developed based on Iterative Diffusion-Diffusion Methodology (IDDM), which can minimize the inconsistency in physics parameters by feeding the actual core condition into the cross section generation by the 2-D lattice code. In order to facilitate the iterative scheme between the 2-D lattice and core calculation, appropriate interface routines are used for accurate and consistent data transfer. Finally the overall physics method, starting from the 1-D lattice calculation to the core calculation, has been validated against benchmark problems, and promising results have been observed in core eigenvalue and power distribution comparisons.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8715], "author_name_tesi": "Hou, Jia ", "last_name_ssi": "Hou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Massimiliano Fratoni", "Fuqing Zhang", "Hangbok Choi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Dissertation Advisor", "Maria Nikolova Avramova, Committee Member", "Massimiliano Fratoni, Committee Member", "Fuqing Zhang, Committee Member", "Hangbok Choi, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cross Section Library", "MICROX-2", "Self-shielding Model", "Iterative Diffusion-Diffusion Methodology", "Embedded Lattice Calculation"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Algorithms for Aligning and Clustering Genomic Sequences that Contain Duplications", "id": "7838", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4581", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Genomes of advanced organisms contain numerous repeated sequences, including gene clusters, tandem repeats, interspersed repeats, and segmental duplications. Among these, gene clusters are the class most frequently of functional importance. Algorithmic processing of regions containing these clusters remains challenging in practice, and its lack of clean solutions has been a big obstacle in sequence analysis in bioinformatics. This thesis includes new methodologies for solving two sets of problems in processing the sequences of gene-cluster regions, particularly methods to properly align gene-cluster regions of multiple species. \n\nSimilar sequences sharing the same evolutionary origin are homologous. Homologous sequences that differ by speciation are orthologous. One set of problems deals with aligning all and only orthologous sequences in a gene-cluster region, between two or more species. A two-way orthologous-sequence identification tool is developed to produce orthologous pairwise alignments. The results are evaluated based on the phylogenetic inference of gene sequences. High specificity is achieved without much loss of sensitivity. Two approaches are designed to create orthologous multi-species alignments. One uses a chosen species to guide the alignment process, and it has been successfully applied genome-wide. The other solves a more di\u00b1cult formulation of the problem, where all species are treated equally. Its computational dificulty is discussed, and some initial experiments are reported. \n\nAnother set of methods deals with the construction of all homologous groups within a single genome. Each homologous group is expected to contain precisely the genomic intervals that are homologous to each other. A mixture of algorithmic and heuristic procedures is designed to maintain a balance between the completeness and purity of each group.

Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease that involves lipid accumulation, as well as proliferation and inflammation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Our studies further our understanding of the role of lipid regulation in vascular smooth muscle cells.\nDiglycerides, phospholipid-derived second messengers, regulate PKC-dependent signaling cascades. There are two distinct species that exist, ester-linked and ether-linked, that determine the physiological outcome of the cell. Our studies demonstrate that ester-linked diacylglycerol promotes PDGF-induced proliferation through activation of PKC epsilon-dependent MAPK/ERK growth signaling. On the other hand, ether-linked diglycerides inhibit mitogenesis through inhibition of PKC epsilon-dependent MAPK/ERK signaling and through inhibition PI3K/AKT signaling. These studies demonstrate two mechanisms, a PKC epsilon-dependent and -independent pathway, by which ether-linked diglycerides inhibit mitogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells.\nTo further understand the role of vascular smooth muscle cell growth, we examined the sphingolipid enzyme, ceramide kinase, responsible for the conversion of ceramide to ceramide-1-phosphate. Ceramide has been shown to stimulate signaling pathways that lead to growth arrest and/or apoptosis, whereas ceramide-1-phosphate has been shown to stimulate proliferation and inflammation. Our studies demonstrate that vascular smooth muscle cells have a direct involvement in endotoxin-induced inflammation and proliferation that is dependent upon ceramide kinase activation and production of ceramide-1-phosphate. Altered sphingolipid flux may be a contributor to determine a cell\u2019s fate between growth arrest and proliferation. These studies demonstrate a novel mechanism by which sphingolipid flux is shifted from proapoptotic ceramide to promitogenic ceramide-1-phosphate through endotoxin-induced toll-like receptor 4 activation.\nCollectively, our studies reveal several mechanisms by which bioactive lipids may determine vascular smooth muscle cell flux to either proliferation or cell growth arrest. The ability of ether-linked diglycerides to induce growth arrest, without inducing apoptosis, may be of therapeutic value in stent development for angioplasty. In addition, the ability to regulate ceramide kinase may be an effective therapy through inhibition of C1P-induced inflammation associated with vascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, as well as other inflammatory diseases, such as diabetes.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3474], "author_name_tesi": "Houck, Kristy Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Houck", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Kristy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Kester", "Jong Kak Yun", "Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Cara Lynne Schengrund", "Kent Eugene Vrana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Kester, Committee Chair", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member", "Cara Lynne Schengrund, Committee Member", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["toll-like receptor", "diglycerides", "ceramide-1-phosphate", "vascular smooth muscle", "signaling cascades", "cytokine"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Modeling the Influence of Shock Waves on the Combustion of Aluminum Droplets\n\n", "id": "12524", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5376", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A model for calculating the interaction between shock waves and a reacting aluminum droplet was developed.  The model accounts for acoustic impedance mismatch at the liquid surface, droplet deformation, wave propagation in the liquid, and cavitation.  To solve this problem, a low-dissipation method for computing reacting gas dynamic flows was developed.  This method combines features from the double-flux multi-component model, nonlinear error-controlled WENO, adaptive TVD slope limiters, rotated Riemann solvers, and adaptive mesh refinement to obtain a method that is both robust and accurate.   Success of the technique is demonstrated using an extensive series of numerical experiments including premixed deflagrations, Chapman-Jouget detonations, re-shocked Richtmyer-Meshkov instability, shock-wave and hydrogen gas column interaction, and multi-dimensional detonations.  An extended Riemann problem accounting for phase change and surface tension was developed to couple a reacting gas to a vaporizing compressible liquid.    The numerical method compares well with empirically measured separation locations over spheres, heat transfer correlations, and droplet deformation criterion.  The numerical algorithms developed in this work are fairly robust and applicable to a wide variety of compressible chemically reacting flows with or without interface capturing and phase change.  Computed results for shock waves interacting with liquid droplets indicate that shock waves reduce evaporation rate for non-reacting Al droplets, while increasing the burning rate when chemical reactions are considered; suggesting that the combustion of aluminum droplets may be kinetically-controlled mechanisms.  To the author's knowledge, this work represents the first time that a compressible reacting gas-dynamic flow has been coupled to a compressible liquid with vaporization and surface tension.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5369], "author_name_tesi": "Houim, Ryan William", "last_name_ssi": "Houim", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth K Kuo", "Kenneth K Kuo", "Gita Talmage", "Richard A Yetter", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Tarasankar Debroy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth K Kuo, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth K Kuo, Committee Chair", "Gita Talmage, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Tarasankar Debroy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chemically reacting flow", "Low-dissipation method", "Multi-component flow", "Level set method", "Vaporization", "Shock waves", "Cavitation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Out of the Nest and Into the Red: Three Essays on Debt in Young Adulthood\n", "id": "12397", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2910", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Great Recession of 2008 and rising costs of college have stoked popular and scholarly concern about young adult debt. Debt plays an important role in the lives of young people as they make the transition to adulthood, but little research has been conducted on the topic. This dissertation sheds light on the role of debt in the lives of young adults with three studies. The first study asks how indebtedness has changed across three cohorts of young adults in their twenties. The second and third studies examine how the acquisition of student loan debt is implicated in the early process of status attainment at a time when the cost of a college degree is high. To do this I draw on data from four different nationally representative surveys of young adults: The National Longitudinal Study of Men (1966 cohort), The National Longitudinal Study of Women (1968 cohort), The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1979 Cohort), and the National Longitudinal Study of Youth (1997 cohort). The results show: (1) median debt has remained relatively stable over time, but young adults today have fewer assets than their predecessors and take on more unsecured debt, leading them to have higher debt burdens (e.g. higher debt to asset ratios); (2) Student loan debt acquisition is linked to young adults\u2018 social class of origin. Young people from well-educated or high-income families are relatively protected from debt. Moreover, the relationship between parents\u2018 income and student loan debt is nonlinear, such that young adults from middle-income families have a higher risk of debt than those from lower and higher income families; (3) Parents\u2018 education and young adult\u2018s postsecondary education interact to affect student loan debt. Parents\u2018 education acts as a safety net that reduces the positive correlation between postsecondary education and debt. Overall, the findings suggest that debt plays an important role in the lives of young adults as they become independent, and has become\nmore burdensome for young adults across cohorts. Debt also plays an important role in the early process of status attainment, particularly for young adults who use debt as a way to pay for college.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2904], "author_name_tesi": "Houle, Jason N", "last_name_ssi": "Houle", "middle_name_ssi": "N", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle Lynn Frisco", "Molly Martin", "Michelle Lynn Frisco", "D Wayne Osgood", "Leif Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle Lynn Frisco, Dissertation Advisor", "Molly Martin, Committee Chair", "Michelle Lynn Frisco, Committee Chair", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transition to adulthood", "life course", "status attainment", "young adults", "student loan debt", "debt", "NLSY"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "VARIATION OF TOTAL MIXED RATIONS ON FARMS UTILIZING FEEDING MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE\n\n", "id": "8849", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "762", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Providing a consistent and adequate supply of nutrients is an important factor in optimizing health and production of dairy cattle.  The total mixed ration (TMR) feeding system is widely utilized as a tool to provide a consistent supply of nutrients; however nutrient variability is still a concern.  The objective of this study was to quantify variation of TMRs on six Pennsylvania dairies that utilize feed management software (TMR Tracker, Digi-Star LLC, Fort Atkinson WI).  Herd size averaged 648 \u00b1 405 cows with an average production of 33 \u00b1 2.4 kg/d.  Twelve weekly samples from sixteen different rations were collected from May through July 2007.  Across all ration analysis, on a DM basis, CP averaged 16.49 \u00b1 1.3 percent CP, ADF was 22.34 \u00b1 2.14 percent, NDF was 33.7 \u00b1 2.83 percent and P was 0.369 \u00b1 0.044 percent.  For twelve rations on five farms the nutrient deviation (formulated nutrient profile \u2013 sample analysis) was tested using paired t-tests to determine if fed rations differed from sample analysis.  Significance (P<0.05) was declared when deviation differed from zero.  Deviations were 1.14 percent (P<0.01) below formulation for CP, 2.97 percent (P<0.01) and 3.58 percent (P<0.01) above formulation for ADF and NDF, respectively across all rations.  There was significant difference in the pattern of variation of the deviation for DM percent, NEl, and CP percent between farms.  All farms had taken the initial step to improve feeding accuracy through the purchase of feed management software.  Three farms had percent load errors below one percent, two farms were just over one percent, and one farm was just above three percent.  Farms on the project showed significant differences in nutrient deviation and differences were also seen in the accuracy of mixing TMR batches.  This study showed that even with farms using feed management software, variation levels were high enough to warrant increased management observations and potential management changes.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [756], "author_name_tesi": "House, Brian Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "House", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa Holden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa Holden, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Total Mixed Ration", "Variation", "Feeding Management"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Out and About: Predicting Lesbians' Outness in the Workplace", "id": "6263", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1001", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-03-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Self-disclosure of sexual orientation in the workplace for lesbian women is a complicated issue because of the lack of national legal protection against sexual orientation-based discrimination in the workplace.

Structural equation modeling was used to test a model predicting self-disclosure of sexual identity in the workplace with a sample of 398 lesbian women.  Results suggested that a structural model including organizational tolerance of heterosexism, direct and indirect heterosexist experiences, and internalized homophobia as predictors of self-disclosure of sexual orientation in the workplace for lesbian women fit the data adequately.  As operationalized, the sexual identity development variables violated the multicollinearity assumption of SEM.

Chapter One begins by establishing that infrastructure is the internal network of a country that facilitates the conduct of various activities.  Overall, there are six broad categories of infrastructure (transportation, communication, electrical, political, medical and sanitation, and maritime).  The research in this dissertation will better improve our understanding of international conflict initiation, increase our knowledge about war outcomes, deepen the research into the role of technology in international relations, and expand our understanding of national capabilities.  \n\nChapter Two presents a theoretical foundation for the examination of infrastructure.  State leaders have a variety of goals that they want to achieve, and some of these goals involve international conflict. In order to achieve their goals, states possess capabilities which shape their probability of successfully achieving their respective goals.  The primary focus of previous research has been on how broad national capabilities (CINC scores and GDP in particular) affect the probability of successfully completing the state\u2019s goals.  However, Morgan and Palmer (1997) argue that technology is another approach to the achievement of state goals.  Infrastructure is a form of technology that influences the ability of a state and its leadership to achieve its goals. \nWhen a state possesses better infrastructure, this allows the military apparatus of a state to move faster, be better supplied, and lose less strength within the borders of the state.  With these potential benefits in mind, state leaders examine their infrastructure relative to other states.  If state leaders find that they possess an advantage in infrastructure over another state, they should be expected to pursue more bellicose and conflictual policies because their state will possess an advantage, thereby increasing the probability of success in the conflict, when holding everything else constant.  With this theoretical foundation, I put forward six hypotheses regarding the outcome of interstate wars (either victory or defeat) and twelve hypotheses regarding the initiation of militarized interstate disputes.\n\nChapter Three presents the first cross-national data set for transportation and communication infrastructure in order to statistically test the hypotheses set forth in the Theory Chapter.  Transportation infrastructure is the factor score of the number of railroads per square kilometer, the number of automobiles per square kilometer, and the number of air travel passenger kilometers per square kilometer.  Communication infrastructure is a factor score of the number of telegraphs per person-kilometer and the number of telephones per person-kilometer.  With this data, I then perform a number of tests to make a prima fascia case that this data is properly representing the states of the international system.\n\nChapter Four uses this new data set measuring transportation and communication infrastructure to test the six hypotheses concerning the outcome of interstate wars.  I find that advantages in relative transportation infrastructure and relative communication infrastructure after World War One improve the probability of a state winning a particular war.  I also find that three other indicators\u2014democracy, development, and initiation\u2014are all insignificant after controlling for transportation and communication infrastructure.\n\nChapter Five empirically examines the relationship between militarized interstate dispute initiation and transportation and communication infrastructure.  This analysis finds that differences in infrastructure do in fact influence conflict initiation.  Prior to World War One, transportation infrastructure was a dramatic influence over conflict initiation, have more than three times the effect of national capabilities during that era.  In the contemporary era, communication infrastructure plays a significant role in shaping the initiation of militarized interstate disputes; however the statistical findings of this model contradict my theoretical expectations.  In addition, I find that considerations of infrastructure are a generalizable finding across all the states of the international system; statistical test to see if infrastructure is limited to only Western states such as the United States and Europe are unsupported in this analysis.\n\nChapter Six brings this project to a close by summarizing the empirical findings of this entire dissertation.  The second section of this chapter discusses the important data set extensions necessary for this project\u2019s future.  Third, this chapter talks about the large number of potential research questions that could be addressed with the data and theory presented in this dissertation.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1228], "author_name_tesi": "Housenick, Christopher E.", "last_name_ssi": "Housenick", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Glenn Hunter Palmer", "David Scott Bennett Jr.", "Douglas William Lemke", "William Bianco", "Colin F Lint"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Glenn Hunter Palmer, Committee Chair", "David Scott Bennett Jr., Committee Member", "Douglas William Lemke, Committee Member", "William Bianco, Committee Member", "Colin F Lint, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["conflict", "war", "infrastructure", "international", "technology"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Toxigenic Clostridium difficile in the Bovine Calf Gut: Association with Enteric Disease in Calves and Significance to Public Health\n\n", "id": "10991", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "624", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Clostridium difficile is an emerging pathogen in humans and animals. A real-time multiplex PCR assay was developed and standardized for the detection of genetic elements of toxigenic C. difficile. The assay targeted genes encoding TcdA, TcdB, and CDT toxins of C. difficile andwas carried out in two duplex reactions. Reaction 1 targeted tcdA and tcdB while reaction 2 targeted cdtA and cdtB. The detection limit of the standardized real-time multiplex PCR assay for the toxin genes of C. difficle was 103cells/g and 101cells/g for non-enriched and enriched fecal and ground meat samples, respectively. When DNA is extracted directly from fecal and ground meat samples, toxin genes of C. difficile may be detected in as little as 4 hours, although, sample enrichment is recommended to increase sensitivity. The multiplex real-time PCR assay was used throughout the study.\n\tThe role of C. difficile in enteric disease in calves was investigated. The findings of the study revealed that young calves were nearly 11 times more likely to have enteric lesions when toxins TcdA and/or TcdB were detected in the feces. Toxigenic C. difficile was detected in 43% of calves with no enteric lesions or clinical symptoms of enteric disease. This observation confirms previous reports that calves could be asymptomatic carriers of C. difficile.  Isolates collected from calves were characterized using genotypic and phenotypic methods. Genes encoding TcdA, TcdB, and CDT were detected in 86.6%, 85.1%, and 83.6% of isolates, respectively. Deletions (100 bp) in the tcdC gene, a negative regulator of toxin expression, were detected in 73.1% of toxigenic isolates. All isolates were resistant to cefoxitin, a third generation cephalosporin, and 52.2% of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline.\n\tNine representative toxigenic C. difficile isolates were examined for in vitro toxin production in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of oxytetracycline, an antibiotic commonly administered to calves during the first two weeks of life.  It was observed that exposure to oxyetracycline increased TcdA and/or TcdB production of one isolate. Exposure to oxytetracycline also resulted in TcdA and/or TcdB production by an isolate that did not produce toxin under control conditions.\nA longitudinal study was conducted to determine the prevalence of toxigenic C. difficile in veal calves. Fifty veal calves from 4 herds (n=200) were followed for 18-22 weeks from the time of arrival on the veal farm to the time of slaughter. It was observed that 58 (29%) calves tested PCR positive for genetic elements of toxigenic C. difficile at least once over 18-22 week period. Calf age (p=0.011) and season (p=0.28e-6) influenced the prevalence of C. difficile toxin genes in calf fecal samples. Carcasses of calves (n=100) from two herds were sampled to determine the incidence of toxigenic C. difficile contamination. Carcass swabs were screened for toxigenic C. difficile contamination using culture and multiplex real-time PCR methods. Toxin genes of C. difficile were detected in 1 carcass swab by multiplex real-time PCR. Toxigenic C. difficile was detected by PCR and culture in 4 (8%) and 2 (4%) ground veal samples, respectively.\nIn summary, the findings of the study reveal that C. difficile is as an enteric pathogen in calves and calves could be asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic C. difficile. It is recommended that veterinary diagnostic laboratories should consider testing for C. difficile and TcdA/B toxins in fecal and necropsy samples from calves with suspected enteric disease. The study provided strong evidence to suggest that sub inhibitory concentrations of oxytetracycline could increase or induce production of toxins TcdA and TcdB. We have provided insight on the emergence of C. difficile in community acquired infections by identifying ground meat as a source of human exposure. Although the incidence of carcass contamination was low, viable toxigenic C. difficile was detected in finished ground veal product. Although other factors contributing to epidemiology of C. difficile-associated disease remain to be identified, this work has provided a basis for continued public health investigation. A full understanding of the changing epidemiology of C. difficile will provide valuable information needed for designing and implementing disease management and prevention strategies in veterinary and public health. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [620], "author_name_tesi": "Houser, Beth Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Houser", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Beth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao", "Bhushan M Jayarao", "Subhashinie Kariyawasam", "Gary H Perdew", "Arthur Hattel", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "David R Wolfgang", "Jeanne Ann Lumadue"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao, Dissertation Advisor", "Bhushan M Jayarao, Committee Chair", "Subhashinie Kariyawasam, Committee Member", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Arthur Hattel, Committee Member", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Committee Member", "David R Wolfgang, Committee Member", "Jeanne Ann Lumadue, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Clostridium difficile", "epidemiology", "public health", "calf enteritis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Sustainable Corn Stover removal Systems for Mushroom Substrate Production", "id": "15950", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8223", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Corn stover has been identified as a new potential feedstock for mushroom substrate production.  Corn stover removal can increase soil erosion, deplete soil nutrients and reduce soil carbon if not managed appropriately.  To mitigate corn stover removal in some situations, agronomists may need to add amendments like spent mushroom substrate (SMS) or mushroom compost (MC) to assist in to managing soil carbon levels.  The objective of this study is to measure the effects of a 75% spring corn stover removal, using that stover as an ingredient for mushroom substrate and returning that SMS as an soil amendment to build soil health.  The SMS resulted in an increase in soil C levels in the 0-5 cm soil profile by 81%, and 39% in the 0-25 cm soil profile.  In the untreated check, where no stover was removed and no SMS added, soil C in the 0-5 cm soil profile declined by 14% and increased in the 0-25 cm soil profile by only 1.3% over the three year study.  The combination of SMS addition and stover harvest also resulted in higher corn yields, lower slug populations, increased revenue, and decreased fertilizer inputs over the course of three a years of corn and three years of a hypothetical alfalfa rotation. Net returns were $4653 higher with the combination of stover harvest and SMS addition over the six years compared with the no stover harvest system.

Spring harvested yields were reduced by 11% in the first year and 43% in the second year of the study compared to fall yields.  Stover nutrient concentrations were generally unchanged, except for potassium, which declined from 7.4 to 3.0 g kg-1 or a 59.4% decrease from the fall to the spring.  Based on this study, harvest in the spring can reduce nutrient removal and the associated costs and is a viable strategy to reduce the impacts of stover harvest.  Overall, this study showed that the combination of partial stover harvest, SMS addition and spring stover harvest could improve returns associated with corn production while maintaining soil carbon levels.

While whirl flutter has been studied by many researchers, air and ground resonance in a tiltrotor has not been explored thoroughly. This dissertation investigates the aeromechanical instabilities of air and ground resonance in a tiltrotor and to assess some passive methods for improving the stability of a soft-inplane tiltrotor.\n\n    This research is broken into two parts, addressing the semi-span model and the full-span model. In the first chapters, a semi-span analytical model consisting of a rigid blade rotor coupled to a rigid pylon and an elastic wing is developed and validated. The Boeing Model 222 which was wind-tunnel tested in 1972 is used to validate the current analytical model. This aircraft is used as the baseline for the analytical investigation of ground resonance and air resonance in hover, air resonance in transition, and air resonance and whirl flutter in airplane configuration. Neither ground resonance nor air resonance in hover are predicted for the Model 222 though air resonance in transition and cruise as well as whirl flutter at high speeds are predicted. Aeroelastic couplings in the rotor blades and wing are shown to affect the air resonance stability in cruise and transition and to be useful in augmenting the inherent stability of the aircraft. Wing vertical bending coupled to wing torsion and rotor low frequency lag coupled to blade torsion were helpful for air resonance. However, the rotor coupling was quite detrimental to whirl flutter stability and the wing coupling was unable to stabilize all the air resonance regions completely.\n\n    The second part of the thesis expands the semi-span model to full-span: fuselage pitch and roll motion, anti-symmetric wing motion, and the second rotor motion are added. The full-span model determined that fuselage motion can couple with rotor low frequency lag to exhibit air resonance. The ground resonance case was stable for the full-span model but showed only a small margin of stability, indicating that a ground resonance instability is possible with a tiltrotor.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [187], "author_name_tesi": "Howard, Anna Kathleen Tyler", "last_name_ssi": "Howard", "middle_name_ssi": "Kathleen Tyler", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farhan S Gandhi", "Kon Well Wang", "George A Lesieutre", "Edward C Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farhan S Gandhi, Committee Member", "Kon Well Wang, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member", "Edward C Smith, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["full-span", "whirl flutter", "semi-span", "civil tiltrotor", "aeromechanical stability", "rotorcraft", "helicopter", "pitch-lag coupling", "ground resonance", "pitch-flap coupling", "air resonance", "aeroelastic couplings", "stability", "tiltrotor"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "From engineer to manager: A qualitative study of experiences, challenges, and individual transitions for engineering managers in aerospace companies.", "id": "6057", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "915", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-04-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the experiences and challenges faced by engineers as they moved to the position of engineering manager. Little research-based information was available to understand the challenges faced in this transition. Information was collected via qualitative interviews in the tradition of phenomenology. The phenomenon explored was the transition of engineers moving into engineering management with an emphasis on common experiences and challenges. Three interviews were conducted with five engineering managers. Each interview lasted approximately 75 minutes and was recorded and transcribed. The managers worked for aerospace companies on Long Island New York. Three research questions provided the framework for analyzing and presenting the results. Study findings included 45 experiences identified by the managers. The experiences were grouped into 9 themes. The experiences and themes were presented to the managers, who validated them and ranked the themes according to difficulty. Three themes were considered the most difficult aspects of the transition. These aspects were: (1) So much going on: The engineering manager role involves balancing many more responsibilities, tasks and priorities than the engineering role; (2) Relationship changes: Personal relationships, interaction dynamics and engineer perceptions of you have changed; and (3) Delegation: The challenge of leaving the hands on technical behind and learning to work through others.

The first study examines perceptions of local temperature change using nationally representative survey data from 89 countries. The second study explores perceptions of seasonal temperature and precipitation in a representative sample of U.S. residents.

In this study B2 aluminide films (NiAl and RuAl) have been deposited and characterized.  Both intermetallics could be deposited at temperatures near room temperature using co-sputtering with an as-deposited resistivity of 45.5 \u00b1 1.5 &#956;&#937;cm for NiAl and 157 \u00b1 4 &#956;&#937;cm for RuAl.  Ni/Al multilayers with a wavelength of 30 nm and below were fully reacted to form NiAl after annealing for 2 h at 400\u00b0C.  These films had a resistivity of 15.5-26.7 &#956;&#937;cm (wavelengths from 15.4-30 nm) after a 4 h anneal at 400\u00b0C, and the lower values of resistivity correspond to films with larger wavelengths.  In order for Ru/Al multilayers to be fully reacted at 400\u00b0C, wavelengths of less than 10 nm were required as well as longer annealing times (more than 11 h).  RuAl from the 400\u00b0C reaction of Ru/Al multilayers had a resistivity of 71.6-123 &#956;&#937;cm.  The lowest resistivity obtained for the B2 thin films was 11 \u00b1 0.1 &#956;&#937;cm, which was obtained for NiAl after a 20 min anneal at 800\u00b0C.\n\nBoth NiAl and RuAl have excellent bulk oxidation resistance, and in this study it was found that the oxidation resistance of the intermetallic thin films was superior to Al, Ni, and Ru metal films.  The intermetallic films showed no observable surface changes (light microscopy) up to 500\u00baC in flowing oxygen and were conductive to higher oxidation temperatures (800\u00b0C for RuAl, 850\u00baC for NiAl) than Ni (500\u00baC), Al (600\u00baC), and Ru (800\u00baC, although vaporization may have begun at ~700\u00baC).\n\nThe intermetallics NiAl and RuAl along with Ru and Au have been patterned into thin line structures and then tested using an alternating current (100 Hz) to induce thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) with 200 thermal cycles per second.  RuAl samples were able to withstand higher cyclic values of &#916;T than NiAl for comparable times to failure.  Both NiAl and RuAl were able to withstand higher values of &#916;T than gold.  The &#916;T for tests on NiAl ranged from ~300-520\u00b0C (Tmax: 400-600\u00b0C), with a time to failure of 100\u2019s of hours when &#916;T was near 300\u00b0C (Tmax: ~400\u00b0C).  Samples of NiAl that had a lower resistivity were able to withstand higher current densities due to reduced Joule heating.  RuAl had a longer time to failure than NiAl at high testing temperatures (&#916;T > ~350\u00b0C), but trends in the data indicate that the time to failure at lower temperature may be higher for NiAl.  Curves of the resistance as a function of time were plotted for all of the samples during the course of the AC tests.  These curves showed three distinct regions, which in the case of the intermetallic films can be ascribed to heating, the production of defects (dislocations and vacancies), and crack growth (and possibly voids).  It was determined that by measuring the slope of the R(t) curve at the beginning of the test, the time to failure and the length of time spent in each of the three regions could be estimated.  This will enable future tests to be paused at specific locations along the R(t) curves so that damage formation and crack growth may be studied.\n\nThe use of Ni- and Ru-aluminide films combined with 2 different etchants for the fabrication of MEMS has also been investigated.  Using a conventional wet etch for SiO2 sacrificial layers (HF) led to cracking and/or buckling depending on the stress state in the film (tensile/compressive).  However, using a gas phase etchant for silicon sacrificial layers, XeF2, free-standing regions could be formed that were crack free.  Resonators were fabricated from co-sputtered NiAl and RuAl, and annealed multilayers of Ni/Al and Ru/Al, and first out-of-plane bending mode resonance was observed by using XeF2 etching.  The best results were obtained for as-deposited NiAl that was co-sputtered at 1.5 mTorr and was under a compressive stress of ~0.83 GPa.  While the devices were not completely flat, they were free-standing, and improvements are expected by decreasing the stress in the co-sputtered films by increasing the sputtering pressure.  The results for RuAl resonators are also promising as the films can withstand high compressive stresses (~1.5 GPa, calculated from edge buckling), and improved performance from co-sputtered RuAl is expected by increasing the sputtering pressure in order to decrease the film stress.  Thermal actuators fabricated from as-deposited co-sputtered NiAl showed ~18 &#61549;m of motion with an applied current of 70 mA, and very little curvature/buckling was noted.  The effect of the high compressive stress is less pronounced in the doubly supported actuators than in the singly supported resonators.

Using mock circulatory loops in the development of tissue engineering therapies is desirable, as it provides an environment very similar to the in vivo for testing of tissue engineered heart valves, without requiring test animals and surgery.\nThe principle challenge in adapting a mock circulatory loop for tissue engineering use is developing blood analogues to be used in the loop that allow for both imaging and valve construct conditioning studies, while maintaining viability of the cells in the tissue engineered valve.  Traditional blood analogues, for example, an aqueous mixture of glycerol, xanthan gum, and sodium iodide, do not support cell growth, so new fluids must be developed and tested.\nUsing cell culture media as a base, we have developed two new blood analogues for use in mock circulatory loops.  Both blood analogues have the viscous behavior of blood, but have the optical and cell-enrichment properties required for short-term (up to 8 hours) imaging and long-term (up to 4 weeks) conditioning of tissue engineered aortic valves.  Coupled with our specially-designed loop that allows for imaging of the aortic valve position, these fluids will allow for fluid flow imaging around tissue-engineered valves and conditioning of these valves in vitro.\nUsing these new blood analogues and the specially designed mock circulatory loop, studies can be conducted to improve the design of tissue engineered aortic valves.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8152], "author_name_tesi": "Howell, Marc Christian", "last_name_ssi": "Howell", "middle_name_ssi": "Christian", "first_name_ssi": "Marc", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Keefe B Manning"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Keefe B Manning, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["mock circulatory loop", "blood analogue", "aortic valve", "tissue engineering"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Comprehensive Analysis on the Demographics and Health Characteristics of Caregivers to Persons with Dementia in the United States", "id": "25079", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11304", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With an aging population, the prevalence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and other dementias is increasing worldwide.

The study focused on evaluating the body connections to smoking and its relationship to the EC, investigating the social and material experiences related to learning to use an EC. Two theories framed this study: embodied adult learning theory and Actor Network Theory. The quantitative portion of the study utilized a longitudinal survey analysis of two surveys: the first survey looking at the use and characteristics of 53 dual EC users and smokers and the second survey analyzing this cohort for changes in EC device use. Qualitative data included two open-ended questions on the survey and in-depth interviews with 16 of the 53 survey participants with emphasis on investigating how a smoker came to know about and learn to use an EC. Qualitative data were analyzed with NVivo software. The findings of the quantitative analysis revealed that 74% of dual users intended to quit smoking with 66% quitting by the follow up. There was a significant difference in EC device use between surveys with quitters changing from a cigalike to mod device (p=0.01). The qualitative interviews added to the quantitative results, revealing three main themes around learning about and using ECs: a) sensory embodied connections to smoking and EC use; b) learning through the synergy of social and non-human systems; and c) using an EC as a step towards quitting. The study\u2019s findings provide insight on the intention of EC use and how it changes with experience, and the importance of choice and personalization for ECs to be a step towards quitting smoking.  The study provides a model for how adult educators and health care providers can help smokers progress through stages of EC use in their quitting journey. It also offers implications for tobacco regulation, a better understanding of how to balance the issues with ECs while not isolating former smokers who quit with these devices, and suggestions for further research.

During a vertical landing,\nthese Short Takeoff and Vertical Landing, STOVL, aircraft direct the high-speed, high\ntemperature exhaust from their primary thrust nozzles towards the ground to provide half\nof the required lift. The operational environment surrounding these aircraft is severely\nimpacted by the complex flow field established when these aircraft hover in close proximity\nto the ground. At low stand-off distances, aeroacoustic resonances give rise to high\namplitude impingement tones which may cause unsteady loading on the aircraft and be a\nsource of hearing loss for personnel near the aircraft. Of the utmost importance is the need\nto better understand the high temperature, high velocity flow field generated by these\naircraft which gives rise to extremely hazardous conditions for personnel and equipment\nin the vicinity of the aircraft.\n\nTo better understand the supersonic impinging jet flow field, two-component laser Doppler\nvelocimetry, LDV, measurements are made in the jet plume, impingement region, and\noutwash region of a scale model jet impinging on a simulated ground plane. The model\nused for this study is representative of a generic military-style STOVL aircraft in hover.\nVelocity measurements are made for jet stand-off distances of 6, 12, and 23 nozzle diameters\nabove the ground plane for an ideally expanded jet exhausting out of a contoured de Laval\nnozzle operating at a pressure ratio of 2.93 with an exit diameter of 13.5 mm.\n\nMean velocity measurements in the jet plume and wall jet are compared to previous\npitot rake measurements. There is good agreement with past data. Although there is a\nslight mismatch in measured peak velocities between the two measurement techniques\nthis discrepancy falls within experimental error. For plate separations of 6 and 12 nozzle\ndiameters, axially-directed velocities as high as 250 m/s are observed within half of a nozzle\ndiameter above the ground plane. Turbulence intensities as high as 15% of the jet exit\nvelocity are found to be in the shear layer for all stand-off distances.\n\nRadial velocities in the wall jet as high as 25% of the jet exit velocity are found to extend\nradially out to 9 nozzle diameters from the jet centerline. The wall jet becomes fully-developed by 9 nozzle diameters from the jet centerline as well. Peak velocity decay in the\noutwash drops off inversely to increasing radial distance. Between 8 to 12 nozzle diameters\nout, LDV show a higher wall jet velocity than previous pitot probe measurements. This is\nattributed to the smaller LDV and improved model alignment.\n\nTurbulence spectra obtained for a plate separation of jet stand-off distance of 6 nozzle\ndiameters show a distinct tone at several locations in the flow field that agree well the\nimpingement tone previously observed in acoustic field measurements. The velocity\nfluctuations appear to be coherent throughout the jet plume and wall jet flow out to\n1.4 nozzle diameters.
