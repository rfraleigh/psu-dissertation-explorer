The plummeting cost of massive sequencing not only leads to the flourishing of various genome projects, but also opens up many opportunities in previously uncharted areas, two remarkable examples of which are sequencing different individuals of the same species and sequencing transcriptomes. With the availability of multiple genome sequences from a population, it is possible to systematically catalog natural variations and, more importantly, investigate their genome-wide distribution to deduce functional elements through conservation or selection. Moreover, as genomic changes reflect evolution at work, the comprehensive map of natural variations serves as a basis for studying the properties and effects of evolutionary forces. For transcriptomics, sequencing has become a revolutionary way to characterize gene expression. It not only offers high replicability and unparalleled accuracy, but also requires less input material, enabling transcriptome study in tiny structures, and no prior knowledge of gene structure, allowing detection of unknown transcripts. Here, three sequencing-based studies are presented. One study explored natural variations between two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col and Ler, and then investigated one crucial evolutionary force to shape variations, meiotic recombination. The other two studies investigated the small RNA transcriptome in Arabidopsis meiocytes and mRNA transcriptomes in developing mouse cortex.\n\nIn the first study, the sequencing and comparison between Col and Ler uncovered 249,171 SNPs, 58,085 small and 2,315 large indels, with highly correlated genome-wide distributions of SNPs and small indels. Disease resistance genes contain significantly more variations, suggesting adaptation to specific environmental niches. These variations were then used as markers to investigate meiotic recombinations, crossovers and gene conversions, in two tetrads, detecting 18 crossovers, 6 of which had an associated gene conversion event, and 4 independent gene conversions. The number and length of identified recombination events suggest that Arabidopsis gene conversions are likely fewer and with shorter tracts than those in yeast. In addition, the analysis of variations in offspring plants showed meiosis provided a rapid mechanism to generate copy number variations (CNVs) by reshuffling existing variations.\n\nIn the second study, a recently developed method was applied to collect Arabidopsis meiocytes, a limited number of cells undergoing meiosis, and then small RNAs were profiled using SOLiD sequencing. 97 of 266 known miRNAs show expression in meiocytes. Interestingly, five miRNAs were found to account for more than half of the total miRNA expression in meiocytes, among which miR158a takes up about one third. The target genes of these five miRNAs have little or low expression in meiocytes. One putative novel miRNA was identified, which shows conservation with rice and maize. Analysis of longer reads provided clues for possible long ncRNAs in meiocytes. \n\nThe mouse transcritpome study uncovered 3,758 differentially expressed genes between two critical stages of cortex development, embryonic day 18 (E18) and postnatal day (P7). Neurogenesis-related genes, such as Sox4 and Sox11, were more highly expressed at E18 than at P7. In contrast, the genes encoding synaptic proteins were up-regulated from E18 to P7, suggesting cortex development changes focus from neuron generation to synapse formation. In addition, approximately 500 genes with unknown function show dramatic change in expression level, serving as a blueprint for further experimental studies. Thousands of novel splice variants from 2,930 genes were identified, providing clues about another layer of dynamic expression.\n\nThese sequencing-based studies pushed the limit of previous work. The characterization of meiotic recombination reached single base-pair resolution. The mouse transcriptome work is one of several early studies utilizing RNA-seq. The small RNA transcriptome in meiocytes, single type cells at microscopic scale, was profiled for the first time. All these studies provided unprecedented information about complicated biological processes.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7038], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Xinwei ", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xinwei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Ma", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Gong Chen", "Naomi S Altman", "Anton Nekrutenko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Ma, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Chair", "Gong Chen, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Special Member", "Anton Nekrutenko, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["next generation sequencing", "meiotic recombination", "small RNA", "cortex gene expression"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Roles Of Chitinases And Jaz Genes In Maize Herbivore Defense", "id": "26538", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11016", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A large percentage of the maize (Zea mays L.) crop loss yearly is due to insect damage, especially caterpillar damage.  With the rapidly increasing world population, it is critical to minimize this yield loss.  Besides chemical insecticides, alternative strategies to improve maize defenses against herbivorous insects are urgently needed and this requires a better understanding of how plants regulate their defense response.  Jasmonic acid (JA) and its derivatives, collectively known as jasmonates (JAs), are important plant signaling hormones for plant stress responses.  However the mechanism of JA regulation remains elusive.  Recent studies in Arabidopsis discovered a novel kind of transcription regulator, jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins (Chini et al., 2007; Thines et al., 2007).  Many studies show that JAZ proteins serve as primary response genes in jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways under insect attack (Chini et al., 2007; Chung et al., 2008; Delaur\u00e9 et al., 2008; Memelink, 2009; Ballare, 2011; Oh et al., 2012).  In addition to understanding the role JAZ proteins in maize, exploring plant defense proteins provides an opportunity to further understand plant-insect resistance mechanisms.  Moreover, plant chitinases are potentially excellent candidates for natural resistance since they could be both economically and environmentally advantageous in controlling insect pests.  Therefore, the focus of this project is to study the function of chitinases and JAZ proteins in maize herbivore defense using two maize inbred lines Mp708 and Tx601 that have different levels of JAs and native host plant resistance to fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, FAW) and other caterpillar species.  The practical goal of chitinase research is to find chitinase candidates that could effectively inhibit caterpillar damage and improve plant resistance.  Studies show that plants can degrade chitin, which is an integral component of the caterpillar peritrophic matrix (PM).  The PM is an important protective structure that surrounds the food bolus and protects the caterpillar midgut microvilli from chemical and physical damage.  After cloning four chitinase genes (chitinase A, chitinase B, chitinase I and PRm3), we performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis and the results indicated that chitinase transcript levels increased in response to FAW feeding and mechanical wounding in both the insect-resistant inbred line Mp708 and insect-susceptible inbred line Tx601.  Chitinase enzymatic activity was observed not only in infested maize leaves, but also in FAW food bolus and frass.  Damage to Tx601-fed FAW caterpillar PMs was also seen using scanning electron microscopy.  Sequence, transcript and proteomic analysis suggested that PRm3 is a better candidate for herbivore defense in maize.  Identification of JAZ gene families have occurred in many plant species especially in Arabidopsis (Chini et al., 2007; Thines et al., 2007; Yan et al., 2007), but little attention have been received for JAZ family in agronomically important maize.  In this JAZ study, the first goal was to identify and characterize candidate JAZ genes in maize.  16 JAZ genes, grouped into 5 clades, were identified and classified from maize genome and conservation was observed in members from the same JAZ clade.  Phylogenetic and synteny analysis indicated that JAZ genes had a common ancestor among four monocots (maize, rice, sorghum and Brachypodium) and one eudicot (Arabidopsis) genomes.  Strong purifying selection acted on most of the JAZ genes.  In addition, maize JAZ genes were found to be more closely related to sorghum; together they shared ancestral sequences from rice genome.  It is believed that whole genome duplications, tandem repeats and transposon insertions contributed significantly to JAZ gene expansion.  The second goal of JAZ study was to determine if differences in JAZ gene structure or expression could explain the differences in JA levels and resistance levels to insect feeding between the two inbred lines.  Sequence similarity of three paralogous JAZ gene pairs between Mp708 and Tx601 were compared.  Since there was no major difference in gene sequences, expression level of three JAZ genes were then investigated in response to fall armyworm feeding, mechanical wounding or hormone treatments using qRT-PCR in both Mp708 and Tx601.  The results showed that both the JA level and the transcript levels of JAZ genes together with several key genes in JA-signaling and biosynthesis pathways were up-regulated in response to feeding, furthermore, they indicated that JAZ1 gene transcript levels increased faster and had a higher fold induction in the resistant genotype Mp708.  Since the role of JA in plant resistance to herbivores is critical, we hope this research will provide a better understanding of defensive responses in maize.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10595], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Yang ", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dawn S Luthe", "Surinder Chopra", "Majid R Foolad", "Yinong Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dawn S Luthe, Dissertation Advisor", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Chair", "Majid R Foolad, Committee Member", "Yinong Yang, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["maize", "fall armyworm", "herbivore-induced plant defense", "chitinase", "jasmonic acid", "JAZ genes", "peritrophic matrix"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF SCALING METHOD IN THE ROTOR BLADE ICE ACCRETION TEST\n\n", "id": "11937", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6763", "abstract_tesi": "In the ice accretion test, due to the limitation of test section size and icing condition capability of the test facility, an icing test on the full sized airfoil is not applicable; therefore, to find a properly scaled airfoil which can reproduce essentially the same non-dimensional ice shape is of great interest. Because of the special structure and operating environment, the helicopter is more prone to be affected by the icing phenomena during flight. To study these icing features, the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand Lab (AERTS) from V/STOL Research Center of Excellence has built a brand new state-of-art rotor blade icing test facility. In this article, the calibration procedure of the test facility is firstly introduced. Calibration experiments for both standard 1 inch diameter cylinder rotor and 10.5 inch chord NACA 0012 rotor blade are presented. 26 cylinder tests and 37 airfoil tests were conducted to explore the facility capability of reproducing icing conditions and correct ice shape. A calibrated data base of 10 nozzle configurations for the full range of the facility is obtained. The scheme of scaling method is then proposed and guided the 4 of scaling tests. Test results are compared with both literature and AERTS own database.

Reduced lift-to-drag ratio reduces the vehicle capability to maintain altitude and also limits its maneuverability. Current ice accretion performance degradation modeling approaches are calibrated only to a limited envelope of liquid water content, impact velocity, temperature, and water droplet size; consequently inaccurate aerodynamic performance degradations are estimated. The reduced ice accretion prediction capabilities in the glaze ice regime are primarily due to a lack of knowledge of surface roughness induced by ice accretion. A comprehensive understanding of the ice roughness effects on airfoil heat transfer, ice accretion shapes, and ultimately aerodynamics performance is critical for the design of ice protection systems. \n\nSurface roughness effects on both heat transfer and aerodynamic performance degradation on airfoils have been experimentally evaluated. Novel techniques, such as ice molding and casting methods and transient heat transfer measurement using non-intrusive thermal imaging methods, were developed at the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand (AERTS) facility at Penn State. A novel heat transfer scaling method specifically for turbulent flow regime was also conceived. A heat transfer scaling parameter, labeled as Coefficient of Stanton and Reynolds Number (CSR=St_x\u2044(Re_x^(-0.2) )), has been validated against reference data found in the literature for rough flat plates with Reynolds number (Re) up to 1\u00d7107, for rough cylinders with Re ranging from 3\u00d7104 to 4\u00d7106, and for turbine blades with Re from 7.5\u00d7105 to 7\u00d7106. This is the first time that the effect of Reynolds number is shown to be successfully eliminated on heat transfer magnitudes measured on rough surfaces.\n\nAnalytical models for ice roughness distribution, heat transfer prediction, and aerodynamics performance degradation due to ice accretion have also been developed. The ice roughness prediction model was developed based on a set of 82 experimental measurements and also compared to existing predictions tools. Two reference predictions found in the literature yielded 76% and 54% discrepancy with respect to experimental testing, whereas the proposed ice roughness prediction model resulted in a 31% minimum accuracy in prediction. It must be noted that the accuracy of the proposed model is within the ice shape reproduction uncertainty of icing facilities. Based on the new ice roughness prediction model and the CSR heat transfer scaling method, an icing heat transfer model was developed. The approach achieved high accuracy in heat transfer prediction compared to experiments conducted at the AERTS facility. The discrepancy between predictions and experimental results was within \u00b115%, which was within the measurement uncertainty range of the facility. By combining both the ice roughness and heat transfer predictions, and incorporating the modules into an existing ice prediction tool (LEWICE), improved prediction capability was obtained, especially for the glaze regime. \n\nWith the available ice shapes accreted at the AERTS facility and additional experiments found in the literature, 490 sets of experimental ice shapes and corresponding aerodynamics testing data were available. A physics-based performance degradation empirical tool was developed and achieved a mean absolute deviation of 33% when compared to the entire experimental dataset, whereas 60% to 243% discrepancies were observed using legacy drag penalty prediction tools. Rotor torque predictions coupling Blade Element Momentum Theory and the proposed drag performance degradation tool was conducted on a total of 17 validation cases. The coupled prediction tool achieved a 10% predicting error for clean rotor conditions, and 16% error for iced rotor conditions. It was shown that additional roughness element could affect the measured drag by up to 25% during experimental testing, emphasizing the need of realistic ice structures during aerodynamics modeling and testing for ice accretion.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11582], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Yiqiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yiqiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Palacios", "Jose Palacios", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Robert Francis Kunz", "Namiko Yamamoto", "John Michael Cimbala"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Palacios, Dissertation Advisor", "Jose Palacios, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Robert Francis Kunz, Committee Member", "Namiko Yamamoto, Committee Member", "John Michael Cimbala, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aircraft Icing", "Ice Accretion Modelling", "Helicopter", "Aerodynamics", "Heat Transfer", "Surface Roughness", "Performance Degradation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Proposed Data Mining Driven Methdology For Modeling Human Gait and Geospatial Trajectories", "id": "19100", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8570", "abstract_tesi": "Less than 35% of human communication is verbal (hearing, listening, etc.), whereas greater than 65% of human communication is nonverbal (body posture, facial expressions, etc.).

This dissertation comprises two studies based on these assumptions.\t\n\tIn the first study, I investigated the effect of visually presented lyrics on song recall with members from auditioned choirs.

Cognitive load was measured through reaction times in a single sound monitoring task while learning songs. Non-music majors, but not auditioned choir members, learned two songs: For one song, they saw the lyrics, and for the other song, they did not see the lyrics. The presentation order of instructional conditions and songs was counterbalanced. When seeing the lyrics, participants reacted faster than when not seeing the lyrics.

Given limited instructional time, several strategies should be considered to prevent learners from experiencing cognitive overload while learning a difficult song aurally. Showing the lyrics of a new song could be one strategy for that purpose, at least for young adults with low levels of musical expertise. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16847], "author_name_tesi": "Han, Yo Jung", "last_name_ssi": "Han", "middle_name_ssi": "Jung", "first_name_ssi": "Yo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Music Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joanne Rutkowski", "Joanne Rutkowski", "Linda Carol Porter Thornton", "Ann Callistro Clements", "Peggy Van Meter "], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joanne Rutkowski, Dissertation Advisor", "Joanne Rutkowski, Committee Chair", "Linda Carol Porter Thornton, Committee Member", "Ann Callistro Clements, Committee Member", "Peggy Van Meter , Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["visually presented lyrics", "song recall", "song learning", "cognitive load", "modality effect", "verbal redundancy effect"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Collage as Critical Practice: Mapping New Art Teacher Experiences within Contemporary Assemblages of Education", "id": "r494vk167", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12991", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tIn this dissertation, I examine the experiences generated by a year-long support initiative for new art teachers guided by collage as critical practice.

The support initiative aimed to foster the implementation of contemporary theories of art education through a material and conceptual process of collage, which encouraged participants to consider their teaching experiences in relation to each other and to the larger discourses at play within school cultures.

By pursuing research through the support initiative, I aimed to: (1) understand how collage as critical practice functioned in relation to new art teacher support, and (2) understand new art teacher experiences within school cultures differently through collage. Collage as both method of support and method of analysis allowed for a mapping of new art teacher experiences which called attention to the dominant discursive and representational forces articulated by contemporary assemblages of education and lived by new art teachers, while also uncovering the ways new art teachers move beneath the surface of recognition within the ruptures of those articulations.

Colonias are rural subdivisions which lack infrastructure such as paved roads and water lines. Over twenty years has passed since the first policy was passed to end colonias development and improve conditions in existing ones. During this time, multiple definitions of what constitutes a colonia developed. In defining the colonia as a space lacking infrastructure, the State of Texas made colonias into a problem space that could be enumerated and fixed. After millions of dollars were spent to correct absent infrastructure and to prosecute colonias developers, colonias as defined solely by the infrastructure present should not exist. Yet they persist as spaces of inequality and poverty. Using research of government and legal documents and interviews with non-profit workers, government officials, and colonias residents, this thesis analyzes how three selected pieces of legislation have defined colonias space. I show how a focus on infrastructure has created an expectation that the problems of colonias can be solved through investment alone, rather than addressing the root causes behind colonias development, namely poverty and inequality. This research contributes to an understanding of the efficacy of anti-colonias policies, as follow-up studies to these policies and programs have never before been conducted.

In this research, machining recommendations for the commercial grades of ADI have been developed. The influence of ausferrite matrix plastic deformation and material transformation in the machining affected zone (MAZ) has been characterized. \n\nMachining studies of ADI were performed for common machining operations such as milling, turning and drilling under production machining conditions. The data collected in these experiments consisted of tool wear measurements, surface roughness characterization, and the chip formation during machining. Tool wear measurement data were used to generate initial machining recommendations for Grade 1 ADI, Grade 2 ADI, and Grade 3 ADI based on tool life estimation. The effects of cutting parameters on surface roughness and chip formation of ADI were also analyzed. Finally, microhardness, metallography, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization were used to understand the phenomena of strain induced plasticity and transformation during the machining of ADI to lead to an improved understanding of the machinability of ADI.\n\nMachining trials, based on tool wear measurement data, were evaluated to generate predictive tool life equations based on Taylor tool life models. These models were used to estimate starting machining parameters for each grade of ADI as well as guidelines for machining parameter adjustments based on tool life. ADIs should be machined at 25% lower cutting speeds than conventional steels with comparable bulk hardness. Similarly, appropriate cutting speed for machining the widely used Grade 1 ADI are 25% lower than cutting speeds used for grade 100-70-03 as-cast ductile iron. Within the various grades of ADI, recommended machining guidelines are inversely proportional to ADI hardness. The specific cutting forces showed that ADIs are similar to the range of specific cutting forces kc1 for ISO-H (hardened steel).  The machining-affected zone (MAZ) is of most concern for Grade 1 ADI because of the larger increases in MAZ hardness due both to matrix strain hardening and transformation hardening of the deformed austenite in the ausferrite matrix to martensite. MAZ strain hardening in drilling operation was observed in the first 150 um of the MAZ depending on machining operations and conditions.

Since 2000, with ABET\u2019s updated curriculum requirements, and NAE\u2019s Engineer of 2020 report, engineering educators have struggled to figure out a way to fit leadership into already packed curriculum (NAE, 2004).  Engineering leadership programs and research on the subject emerged.  Engineering leadership research has evolved from describing effective practices in the classroom for engineering leadership knowledge development to empirical studies attempting to define the concept of engineering leadership.  Findings suggest that traditional notions of leadership do not sit well with engineers (Rottmann, Sacks, & Reeve, 2014).  One aspect of traditional leadership theory and development includes the importance of interpersonal competencies.  Interpersonal competencies have been identified in recent research focused on the construct of engineering leadership (Cox, Cekic, Ahn, & Zhu, 2012; Hartmann, Stephens, & Jahren, 2015; Rottmann et al., 2014).  However, the interpersonal behaviors associated with engineering leadership have not been explored. This study explores the behaviors associated with interpersonal competencies of engineering leadership during the early-career stage. This qualitative study describes the interpersonal behaviors that are important for demonstrating engineering leadership during the early-career stage.   A qualitative approach, utilizing in-depth interview techniques, was utilized due to the need for an exploratory analysis of interpersonal competencies within the context of engineering. Nine engineering leaders across three large engineering firms participated in in-depth interviews to produce four engineering leadership characteristics important for early-career engineers and six interpersonal behavioral themes.  Findings also focus on the importance of technical knowledge and abilities and generational stereotypes that impact leadership and interpersonal competencies within the engineering context.   The results from this study suggest a framework for interpersonal behaviors associated with engineering leadership and relate to Emotional Intelligence.  Findings from this study help to inform Human resource professionals, engineering managers, and engineering educators as to the interpersonal behaviors that are important for engineering leadership at the early-career stage and can help to inform training programs, coaching techniques, and engineering leadership curriculum.

Experimentally we examined the effects of air bubbles rising through solutions of wormlike micelles.  A previous study of this problem reported oscillations in the speed of the rising bubble.  Our experiments revealed two distinct types of oscillations, which we have called ``type I\" and ``type II\".  By mapping the oscillatory instability to a temperature-concentration phase plane we found that type I oscillations occur when the equilibrium average length of micelles is larger than a critical value.  \n\nExperimental rheology was performed on the same fluids as well, which identified a transition in equilibrium micellar morphology as concentration increases.  This transition is found to occur in the same concentration range as the transition from type I to type II oscillations.  The rheological results indicate that type I oscillations occur in fluids which consist of entangled wormlike micelles, while the fluids which give type II oscillations consist of wormlike micelles in a ``fused\" or crosslinked network state.  \nThe rheological data also suggest that shear induced structures (SIS) may form in the fluids in which rising bubbles oscillate, and the oscillatory instability is attributed to the formation and subsequent destruction of SIS in the wake of a rising bubble.  Birefringent images taken during the free rise of an air bubble support this hypothesis.\n\nThe experimental results motivate the inclusion of SIS in a constitutive model for wormlike micellar fluids.  We consider a wormlike micellar fluids to consist of three types of wormlike micelles: short, long, and ``bundles\" which represent SIS.  The concentrations of these three species are coupled to each other through three ordinary differential equations.  The ODE's are then coupled to the Maxwell constitutive model for viscoelastic fluids to yield a new ``weighted Maxwell model\".  With a detailed examination of the physical meaning of the weighted Maxwell model, we find that further modifications are necessary in order to remain faithful to the physical properties of wormlike micelles.  These considerations lead us to develop a new ``memory kernel\" to include in our weighted Maxwell model.  We explain how the modification works and what it means physically.  With numerical simulations, we find that our model is capable of capturing the rheological properties of wormlike micellar fluids.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4771], "author_name_tesi": "Handzy, Nestor Zenon", "last_name_ssi": "Handzy", "middle_name_ssi": "Zenon", "first_name_ssi": "Nestor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Leonard Belmonte", "Anna L Mazzucato", "Diane Marie Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Leonard Belmonte, Committee Chair", "Anna L Mazzucato, Committee Member", "Diane Marie Henderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wormlike micelles", "non-equilibrium", "constitutive equation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF ACOUSTICS PROBLEMS USING THE DIRECT SIMULATION MONTE CARLO METHOD", "id": "8679", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "214", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the current study, real gas effects in the propagation of sound waves are simulated using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method for a wide range of systems.

As these vehicles are used to perform more difficult missions or a larger number of missions in remote environments, there will be a great need for these vehicles to behave intelligently and autonomously.  Cognitive architectures, computer programs that define mechanisms that are important for modeling and generating domain-independent intelligent behavior, have the potential for generating intelligent and autonomous behavior in unmanned vehicles.  The research described in this presentation explored the use of the Soar cognitive architecture for cognitive robotics.\n\nThe Cognitive Robotic System (CRS) has been developed to integrate software systems for motor control and sensor processing with Soar for unmanned vehicle control. The CRS has been tested using two mobile robot missions: outdoor navigation and search in an indoor environment. The use of the CRS for the outdoor navigation mission demonstrated that a Soar agent could autonomously navigate to a specified location while avoiding obstacles, including cul-de-sacs, with only a minimal amount of knowledge about the environment. While most systems use information from maps or long-range perceptual capabilities to avoid cul-de-sacs, a Soar agent in the CRS was able to recognize when a simple approach to avoiding obstacles was unsuccessful and switch to a different strategy for avoiding complex obstacles.\n\nDuring the indoor search mission, the CRS autonomously and intelligently searches a building for an object of interest and common intersection types.  While searching the building, the Soar agent builds a topological map of the environment using information about the intersections the CRS detects.  The agent uses this topological model (along with Soar's reasoning, planning, and learning mechanisms) to make intelligent decisions about how to effectively search the building.  Once the object of interest has been detected, the Soar agent uses the topological map to make decisions about how to efficiently return to the location where the mission began.  Additionally, the CRS can send an email containing step-by-step directions using the intersections in the environment as landmarks that describe a direct path from the mission's start location to the object of interest.\n\nThe CRS has displayed several characteristics of intelligent behavior, including reasoning, planning, learning, and communication of learned knowledge, while autonomously performing two missions.  The CRS has also demonstrated how Soar can be integrated with common robotic motor and perceptual systems that complement the strengths of Soar for unmanned vehicles and is one of the few systems that use perceptual systems such as occupancy grid, computer vision, and fuzzy logic algorithms with cognitive architectures for robotics.  The use of these perceptual systems to generate symbolic information about the environment during the indoor search mission allowed the CRS to use Soar's planning and learning mechanisms, which have rarely been used by agents to control mobile robots in real environments.  Additionally, the system developed for the indoor search mission represents the first known use of a topological map with a cognitive architecture on a mobile robot.  The ability to learn both a topological map and production rules allowed the Soar agent used during the indoor search mission to make intelligent decisions and behave more efficiently as it learned about its environment.  While the CRS has been applied to two different missions, it has been developed with the intention that it be extended in the future so it can be used as a general system for mobile robot control.  The CRS can be expanded through the addition of new sensors and sensor processing algorithms, development of Soar agents with more production rules, and the use of new architectural mechanisms in Soar.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5537], "author_name_tesi": "Hanford, Scott David", "last_name_ssi": "Hanford", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lyle Norman Long", "Lyle Norman Long", "Victoria A Braithwaite", "Richard Alan Carlson", "Robert Graham Melton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lyle Norman Long, Dissertation Advisor", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Chair", "Victoria A Braithwaite, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Carlson, Committee Member", "Robert Graham Melton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cognitive robotics", "Soar", "cognitive architecture", "intelligent mobile robot"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Team Creativity: A Process Model", "id": "6963", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5128", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-12-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A process model of team creativity is proposed and tested.

Historically, C-1-P was thought to oppose ceramide function by countering the accumulation of pro-apoptotic ceramide.  Compared to other sphingolipids, little is known about C-1-P, so it is not surprising that C-1-P has long been considered just a \u201cmetabolite of ceramide\u201d.  These experiments reveal that C-1-P should no longer be considered a sphingolipid of secondary importance.  The overall aim is to broaden the C-1-P knowledge base, which should guide rational predictions about acute and chronic effects of C-1-P modulation, a requirement for target validation for therapeutic intervention.  \nTo test the hypothesis that a cell-surface receptor mediates invasion of micro- and macrovascular endothelial cells through an extracellular matrix barrier, a protein/lipid binding screen was conducted to identify proteins that interact specifically with C-1-P.  Described herein are the identification and characterization of a C-1-P interaction with the heterotetrameric protein complex of annexin a2/p11 in human primary vascular endothelial cells.  A chemotaxis assay demonstrated that exogenously delivered C-1-P selectively mediates invasion of micro- and macrovascular endothelial cells through a Matrigel\u2122 extracellular matrix barrier.  In support of an interaction with a cell-surface protein, C-1-P-mediated invasion was independent of prostanoid production or enhanced cellular proliferation, processes known to be stimulated by intracellular accumulation of C-1-P.   Demonstrating that C-1-P is readily secreted from endothelial cells, two-fold more C-1-P was detected by mass spectrometry in conditioned medium compared to cell lysates. C-1-P selectively interacted with the purified annexin a2/p11 heterotetramer using a lipid binding ELISA methodology, indicating an interaction.  Additionally, immunoprecipitation of the p11 protein after exogenous C-1-P treatment demonstrated enrichment of associated C-1-P mass.  Finally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of either annexin a2 or p11 protein inhibited C-1-P-mediated invasion, suggesting that annexin a2/p11 hetetrotetramer expression is required for this action of C-1-P.  Identification of the annexin a2/p11 protein as a C-1-P-interacting protein represents the first report of a named putative C-1-P cell-surface receptor, substantiating C-1-P as a cellular signal independent of ceramide.  \nIn another related project, highlighting signaling induced by C-1-P, data suggested that C-1-P may also act upon another cell surface protein.  Experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that C-1-P, acting independently of ceramide, modulates innate immune signaling via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).  C-1-P, long considered to promote inflammatory signaling, instead abrogated activation of TLR4 signaling by lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  Specifically, C-1-P, but not ceramide, blocked LPS-stimulation at the level of:  activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, multiple MAP kinase pathways, and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.  This action of C-1-P was specific to TLR4 signaling, since C-1-P exerted no effect on the same signaling pathways after stimulation with TNF\u03b1.  Importantly, these results highlight C-1-P production, rather than ceramide reduction, as the causative agent.  Contrary to the dogma that C-1-P is a \u201cpro-inflammatory\u201d lipid, these experiments revealed \u201canti-inflammatory\u201d properties of exogenous C-1-P.  Overall, such results suggest that these seemingly opposing viewpoints may converge on a new hypothesis indicating complex immunomodulation by C-1-P.  \nIn sum, C-1-P merits \u201cre-branding\u201d as a bioactive sphingolipid capable of transducing signals through cell-surface \u201creceptors\u201d, independent of ceramide. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7828], "author_name_tesi": "Hankins, Jody ", "last_name_ssi": "Hankins", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jody", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Kester, Ph D", "Richard Bernard Mailman", "Leo Fitzpatrick, Ph D", "Channe D Gowda", "Girish Subramanian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Kester, Ph D, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Bernard Mailman, Committee Member", "Leo Fitzpatrick, Ph D, Committee Member", "Channe D Gowda, Committee Member", "Girish Subramanian, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ceramide-1-phosphate", "ceramide", "sphingolipid", "annexin a2", "p11", "Toll-like receptor 4", "LPS"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Purchase Type, Pre-purchase Mood, and Gender on Levels of Consumer Guilt in an Impulse Purchase Context", "id": "14762", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7470", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this mixed-methods study, we examine the emotion of consumer guilt.

The environment in which they grow, soil, obscures our view of them, making roots more difficult to observe and study than their verdant, above-ground counterparts. To facilitate the study of roots, scientists have developed systems to allow us to see roots, from high-tech imaging devices to simple, gel or solution based systems that are devoid of soil and the environment in which roots evolved to grow. Understanding and improving root growth will allow for the development of more efficient lines of plants. Improving plant nutrient acquisition by optimizing a root system is of increasing importance as population grows and the world is tasked with producing more food. Climate change, drought, and decreased availability of fertilizers make will continue to make this task more difficult in future years.\nTo understand and ultimately improve root growth, scientists have simplified questions into testable hypothesis that rely on controlled conditions, repeatable experiments, and model systems. Though this has accelerated our rate of discovery, the impact of these discoveries has yet to be made in our food and agricultural systems. To have an impact beyond that of just basic discovery, an ambitious goal on its own, we must ensure that the systems that we use and the questions that we ask mimic a realistic environment and target the areas which we can improve. Work in plant biology is largely dominated by research on the model organisms, Arabidopsis thaliana, and, within that work, focused on gene discovery. As we learn more about the complexity of phenotypic control, the simple line connecting genotype to phenotype has evolved into a complex network of regulation and interaction.\nMy research is on three independent projects. First, I examined the lateral root growth angle of the model plant Arabidopsis. Though we know much about how the primary root develops, we know little about lateral root growth and how these organs maintain outward growth. Our assumptions into this process have been drawn based upon what we know about the primary root. Second, I developed a system by which we can closely mimic the phosphorus limiting growth conditions of soil in an agar-based growth medium. This work refutes many of the discoveries made about plant phosphate responses based solely upon work using Arabidopsis. Lastly, I examined the control of root hair formation in rice.

The ban was motivated by a 2011 aerial survey of wildlife populations which found statistically significant declines in eleven large mammal species. The decision to eliminate hunting marked a pronounced change from previous decades of wildlife management that included hunting and photographic concession. This shift in resource management is particularly important in the Ngamiland district of Northern Botswana in which over half of all residents are employed in the tourism industry. Trophy hunting, including of iconic and endangered species such as the African elephant (Loxodonta Africana), was previously permitted in Ngamiland and brought significant economic benefits to local communities, safari operators, and the national government. The role of hunting as a tool of conservation and importance of hunting-based tourism as a livelihood practice has been a subject of debate within and beyond Botswana for decades. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty around the types and severity of impacts the hunting ban will produce for both social and ecological systems. This thesis examines these impacts through a mixed methods approach including twenty-two semi- structured interviews and archival data collection as well as remote sensing analysis of vegetation patterns in Ngamiland. Results demonstrate considerable spatial variability both among perceptions of the ban, as well as vegetation patterns across the landscape. This suggests a significant degree of socioecological heterogeneity not recognized by a homogenous resource management policy such as the hunting ban. It also suggests an uneven ability among concessions to transition successfully to photographic-based tourism, potentially weakening incentives for conservation in certain areas.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10798], "author_name_tesi": "Hann, Erica Christine", "last_name_ssi": "Hann", "middle_name_ssi": "Christine", "first_name_ssi": "Erica", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian King"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian King, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Botswana", "trophy hunting", "conservation", "livelihood practices", "socioecological systems"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Laboratories of Writing: The Political Causes and Consequences of Statutory Language in the U.s.

I ask three broad questions: 1) How is statutory language measured? What state-level characteristics affect the development of statutory language? And what effect does statutory language have on the implementation of policy? I use an original dataset of laws passed in the U.S. States: English-only laws and medical marijuana laws. \nIn Chapter 2, I present a measure of statutory language that provides additional information about state laws and allows for the laws to vary on multiple dimensions. I find that these dimensions are not highly correlated suggesting that laws vary on the potential areas where they focus. Next, I show that these measures are different from other conventional measures of statutory language. \nIn Chapter 3, I test hypotheses related to state-level characteristics that affect the writing of statutory language. I find evidence that laws are becoming increasingly specific and that states are learning from others. I identify what factors make states more likely to borrow text from other states and find that states tend to look to states that have passed laws more recently for inspiration.\nIn Chapters 4 and 5, I investigate the effects that statutory language has on implementation. I first investigate the consequences of English-only laws by analyzing provision of English-language services to eligible students. I find that statutory language matters; in particular, laws that are more detailed on education lead to the reduction of services for English Language Learners. \nIn Chapter 5, I continue to investigate the effects of statutory language on implementation. I find that the language of medical marijuana laws has an effect on the level of patients that register, but only when that language directly targets on dispensaries. In this chapter, I develop a model to predict the adoption of medical marijuana policies. I find that states are more likely to adopt if the initiative is available, the populace is more liberal, and there are more recreational users in the state. \nThis dissertation makes a case for the importance of studying statutory language, particularly in the U.S. states.

Dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmission is responsible for a myriad of diseases including Parkinson\u2019s disease, Tourette\u2019s syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), drug abuse, and schizophrenia.  Schizophrenia is a devastating mental illness that affects approximately one percent of the population worldwide.  It attacks its victims upon their emergence into adulthood and the workforce and leaves them severely disabled and dependent on life-long pharmacological treatment for.  The majority of therapeutic antipsychotic drugs act as antagonists at D2R sites in the brain, but D2Rs are not genetically altered in schizophrenic individuals.  We hypothesize that pathological dysregulation of dopaminergic signaling may stem from alterations in expression or function of proteins which interact with and regulate DR-mediated signaling, otherwise known as DRIPs (dopamine receptor interacting proteins) and DRAPs (dopamine receptor associated proteins).  \nWork presented in this thesis further investigates protein constituents of the D2R-signalplex and characterizes their effects on the regulation of dopaminergic signaling.  A systematic survey of the literature has culminated in the collection of information concerning approximately fifty DRIPs and DRAPs.  These proteins comprise the D2R-signalplex and affect various aspects of the life cycle of D2Rs, including regulation, trafficking, degradation, and recycling.  Efforts were undertaken to investigate whether interacting partners of these known DRIPs could themselves bind the D2R.  Isolation and characterization of the cohort of proteins that comprise the D2R signalplex will provide insight into the mechanisms of receptor function in both healthy and diseased states.  \nTRPC1 was identified as a novel DRIP via yeast two-hybrid strategy.  Here we validate the interaction of TRPC1/D2R in both heterologous and native protein expression systems.  TRPC1, a nonselective, nonvoltage gated cation channel, colocalizes with D2R in cell culture systems and primate cortical neurons.  TRPC proteins can function as scaffolding molecules as well as ion channels, and the TRPC1/D2R interaction affects trafficking of the D2R signaling complex to the plasma membrane.  TRPC1 provides a direct link between D2R and intracellular calcium stores and may play a functional role in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases.\nInteractions between individual DRIPs NCS-1 and TRPC5 were further investigated.  NCS-1 and TRPC5 were confirmed to interact through biochemical assays and native protein expression systems.  NCS-1 regulates currents through TRPC5 channels, and both proteins were identified to function in a common pathway that operates to control the process of neurite extension.  An interruption of this interaction would have significant neurodevelopmental consequences, and may contribute to neurological dysfunction in pathologic states.\nzDHHC4, a newly discovered palmitoyltransferase, has been confirmed to interact with the D2R in a number of protein-interaction systems.  Evidence is presented that suggests that zDHHC4/D2R interaction has different functional consequences for the two D2R isoforms, D2S and D2L.  The zDHHC4/D2L interaction promotes the internalization of the receptor, whereas the zDHHC4/D2S interaction appears to have no effect on the trafficking of this isoform.  This suggests that zDHHC4 differentially palmitoylates the D2L on cysteine residues not present in the D2S.  zDHHC4 may contribute to the differences in D2S/D2L trafficking observed in neurons.  \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3935], "author_name_tesi": "Hannan, Meredith A", "last_name_ssi": "Hannan", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Meredith", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson", "Ralph Lauren Keil", "Blaise Peterson", "Janet Robishaw, Ph D"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson, Committee Chair", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member", "Blaise Peterson, Committee Member", "Janet Robishaw, Ph D, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Signalplex", "Transient Receptor Potential", "Dopamine D2 Receptor", "Schizophrenia"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "\"love him and everything else will fall into place\":  An analysis of narratives of African-american fathers of children with autism spectrum disorders", "id": "18441", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8942", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This exploratory qualitative dissertation analyzed the narratives of six African-American fathers of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).

In this thesis, four studies on enzymatic systems are presented with the goal of further elucidating the mechanisms by which enzymes confer enormous rate enhancements to chemical reactions. In the first study, mixed quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical calculations are applied to study a series of phenolate inhibitors of increasing pKa bound to ketosteroid isomerase to explore the catalytically relevant hydrogen bonds in the enzyme active site. The second study uses molecular dynamics simulations to explore the use of water in the active site in lieu of the native enzymatic hydrogen bonds. The third study focuses on the positioning of the catalytic base in ketosteroid isomerase using molecular dynamics simulations, and this positioning is suggested to arise from non-local contributions involving nearby hydrophobic residues and an active site loop.

Previous studies on bail have found racial differences in detainment but a less strong relationship between bail amount and race. This may be because of a lack of specificity, in that most studies do not differentiate between multiple, potentially distinctive bail outcomes. This study adds to the literature by considering monetary and unsecure bail types separately in models looking at racial disparity between black, white, and Hispanic defendants in bail type and amount. Employing a focal concerns framework, it is hypothesized that racial disparity may emerge in bail decisions because race is used as a perceptual shorthand for blameworthiness and dangerousness.

By varying the ventilation gas, it is shown experimentally that cavity size and closure are better predicted by the mass ventilation rate than by the volumetric ventilation rate that is commonly used throughout the literature.  A model of the shear entrainment mechanism is also used to show that lower density gases, such as helium, are entrained faster, on a volumetric basis, than denser gases, such as air and sulfur hexafluoride, consistent with the experimental findings.  Waves on the cavity interface are shown to play an important role in cavity behavior leading to a proposed non-dimensional mass ventilation rate parameter based on the cavity surface area.  Cavity dynamics and statics are affected by both the amplitude and length of the interface waves.  Long wavelength disturbances appear to cause contractions in cavity size, which result in increased cavity pressure.  Conversely, shorter wavelength disturbances alter the skin friction relation.  \nThe waves on the cavity interface are also shown to be the cause of tonal and broadband pressure oscillations inside the cavity that are radiated from the interface as sound.  As such, cavities are not only tonal monopole noise sources, but broadband monopole noise sources as well.  Well defined, gross wave motion is related to tonal noise whereas random cavity interface waves or disturbances are the source of broadband noise. There are two observed tonal noise generation mechanisms, pulsation and a feedback loop, and the controlling physics of these tones are discussed.  Additionally, pulsation appears to be a cavity state rather than a stand-alone closure regime and the conditions necessary for pulsation to occur are determined.  Broadband noise generation when the cavity is near a free surface is different compared to the case without a free surface, when the tunnel is filled and pressurized.  When the cavity is near a free surface, the noise appears to scale with the ventilation speed but, when the free surface is removed the noise scaling is different and much more complex. \nFinally, a model based on the pathlines of the liquid stream around the cavity is proposed.  The Froude number and cavitation number are shown to contribute to the pathlines of the liquid stream.  Predicted cavity shapes can be inserted into the shear entrainment model to predict the mass flow rate required to maintain a smooth cavity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16357], "author_name_tesi": "Hansford, Samuel E", "last_name_ssi": "Hansford", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Samuel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Francis Kunz", "Rhett William Jefferies", "Timothy A Brungart", "Robert Francis Kunz", "Jules Washington Lindau V"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Francis Kunz, Dissertation Advisor", "Rhett William Jefferies, Committee Chair", "Timothy A Brungart, Committee Member", "Robert Francis Kunz, Committee Member", "Jules Washington Lindau V, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supercavitation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Aquatic Habitat Characters That Support Both The \nBridle Shiner (Notropis bifrenatus) And The \nIroncolor Shiner (Notropis chalybaeus)\n", "id": "19624", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8312", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The endangered Bridle Shiner, Notropis bifrenatus, and endangered Ironcolor Shiner, Notropis chalybaeus, co-exist in Marshalls Creek (Delaware River drainage), Monroe County, Pennsylvania.

Visual and acoustic cavitation desinence calls were made over a range of angles of attack; force measurements were taken and the flow near the fins was measured with Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). The tip-loaded fin tended to show the least favorable tip vortex cavitation inception behavior; the root-loaded fin showed the most favorable behavior, and the elliptically-loaded fin was between these extremes. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7802], "author_name_tesi": "Hanson, David Royal", "last_name_ssi": "Hanson", "middle_name_ssi": "Royal", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Paterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Paterson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cavitation", "Vortex Lattice Theory", "Tip Vortex Cavitation", "Particle Image Velocimetry", "Acoustic Measurements"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Computational Investigation of Convective Heat Transfer on Ice-Roughened Aerodynamic Surfaces", "id": "14182drh5013", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14182", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ice accretion on aerodynamic surfaces of aircraft is a fundamental safety hazard. Accreted ice has an abundance of geometric scales, from the size of the gross features such as horns and scallops down to the minute details of individual frozen droplets. The smallest geometric scales take the form of surface roughness, which has a first-order effect on the ice growth. This presents many challenges to analysis methods, especially for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Directly resolving roughness with CFD can increase the size of the computational mesh by orders of magnitude. Equivalent Sand-Grain Roughness (SGR) models are the only commonly used way to account for surface roughness in CFD; however, these methods are fundamentally unable to resolve the physics relevant to convective heat transfer.\n\n\nThe Discrete Element Roughness Method (DERM) is proposed and evaluated as an engineering solution to the problem of convective heat transfer on rough surfaces.  DERM shows potential to improve heat transfer predictions beyond the capability of SGR models while only slightly increasing the computation time. As part of the present work, DERM is derived for and implemented in a general-purpose CFD solver and explored as a way of modeling the sub-resolved roughness scales. In order to establish DERM for ice roughness, a fundamental understanding of the relevant flow physics and heat transfer is developed.\n\nHigh-resolution Computerized Tomography (CT) scans of ice-roughened airfoils are used to generate Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) models. The CAD models are analyzed to develop a deeper understanding of the geometric character of the ice roughness. Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulations of the flow over an iced airfoil as well as a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) are used to develop understanding of how the roughness interacts with the boundary layer near the leading edge of an airfoil. The details of the turbulent flow field are extracted from the LES and compared with the RANS model predictions.\n\nThese models are also used to develop an understanding of the DERM modeling assumptions. One such assumption is neglect of the ``dispersive stresses'' and ``dispersive energy fluxes''; these are quantified from the LES of an ice-roughened airfoil. The results show that the dispersive stresses are not negligible; in fact, they can be quite large compared with the Reynolds stresses. This result indicates that DERM may be improved for use with ice-roughened airfoils by development of computational models for the dispersive terms. \n\nFinally, DERM-based CFD solutions are coupled with LEWICE to predict ice-growth on airfoils. The DERM-LEWICE predictions are compared with ice shapes generated in experiments and indicate that DERM has potential to improve ice-shape predictions in the glaze-icing regime.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14657], "author_name_tesi": "Hanson, David Royal", "last_name_ssi": "Hanson", "middle_name_ssi": "Royal", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Kinzel", "Michael Kinzel", "Jose Palacios", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Stephen M Lynch", "Robert Francis Kunz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Kinzel, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Kinzel, Committee Chair", "Jose Palacios, Committee Member", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Stephen M Lynch, Outside Member", "Robert Francis Kunz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Computational Fluid Dynamics", "Ice Accretion", "Discrete Element Roughness Method", "Convective Heat Transfer", "Large Eddy Simulation", "Surface Roughness"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Impact of Assimilating Surface Pressure Observations from Smartphones on a Regional, High Resolution Ensemble Forecast: Observing System Simulation Experiments", "id": "28709", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12531", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Smartphones equipped with barometers represent an untapped, and incredibly dense source of surface pressure observations that could be used to improve numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecasts.

NAFLD is associated with insulin resistance and increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. NAFLD begins with lipid accumulation in liver and may progress to necroinflammatory steatohepatitis, advance fibrosis or cirrhosis, and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma. While hepatic accumulation can be simplified as an imbalance between the pathways of lipid input and output, the nutritional and hormonal regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism is quite complicated and has been the subject of research for several decades. We hypothesize that dietary factors, physical activity and hepatic genes are all involved in the development of NAFLD. Therefore, a series of studies was performed to investigate the effect of dietary factors, including simple carbohydrate, unsaturated fat, and retinoids on the development of NAFLD at the intact animal, cellular, and molecular levels.\nDietary factors, including macronutrients and micronutrients, are involved in the development of NAFLD. In chapter 3, we aimed to investigate the roles of high simple carbohydrate diet, unsaturated fat and retinal supplementation on hepatic steatosis in mice. Mice were assigned to diets groups that included normal chow diet (NC), high carbohydrate only diet (HCD), high carbohydrate diet plus supplementation with lipid emulsion (HCD+4% LE or 13.5% LE), high carbohydrate diet with supplementation with retinal (HCD+RAL) and high carbohydrate diet with both LE and RAL (HCD+LE+RAL). Mice were maintained on experimental treatments for 4 or 5 weeks. The main finding was that the HCD only diet, without supplementation, induced hepatic steatosis as demonstrated by histology and biochemical TG quantification, while supplementation with LE reduced lipid accumulation; however, retinal had no effect on hepatic steatosis. Gene expression analysis revealed that HCD only diet induced hepatic steatosis via stimulation of three key lipogenic genes, namely sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). By contrast, supplementation with LE suppressed SREBP-1c, ACC and FAS. In addition, the results showed that hepatic inflammation was initiated, because inflammation markers, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) and serum amyloid P component (APCS) were significantly induced in liver by the HCD only diet. In total, the results indicated that reducing the percentage of carbohydrate with unsaturated fat supplementation can provide a beneficial preventative effect in experimental NAFLD.\nVitamin A (retinol) is critical for many developmental and biochemical processes, such as cell differentiation, embryonic development, reproduction, vision and immune function. Recently, the roles of vitamin A and other retinoids in lipid and energy metabolism have received increasing attention. In chapter 4, we aimed to clarify the roles of retinoids, including retinal, retinoic acid and \u03b2-carotene in the development of hepatocellular steatosis in liver cells, using HepG2 cells as a model. Hepatocellular steatosis was induced by either increasing the glucose concentration of the medium (high glucose) or adding oleic acid to the cultures of HepG2 cells. The results showed that none of those retinoids reduced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells; conversely, gene expression data showed that retinoic acid stimulated expression of the lipogenic genes, FAS and SREBP1c in a dose dependent manner. The results indicated that retinoids did not have beneficial effects on treatment of hepatocellular steatosis induced by high glucose or oleic acid in vitro in HepG2 cells, and in fact, retinoic acid may contribute to lipid anabolism. However, we successfully established a hepatocellular steatosis model induced by high glucose, which provides a useful and convenient tool to study the pathogenesis of NAFLD in vitro. \nHuman epidemiologic studies suggest that genetic factors are also involved in the development of NAFLD. More specifically, several independent genome-wide association studies have found a strong association between NAFLD with a non-synonymous variant of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) encoding an isoleucine to methionine substitution at position 148 (I148M). However, the biological function of PNPLA3 is still under debate. In chapter 5, we aimed to explore the biological function of NAFLD associated gene, PNPLA3 (also known as adiponutrin). Firstly, we studied hepatic PNPLA3 expression in our mouse hepatic steatosis model induced by the high-carbohydrate diet (samples came from studies in chapter 3). The results showed that PNPLA3 gene expression was increased ~22-fold in the high-carbohydrate diet group compared to the control group. However, lipid emulsion completely reversed PNPLA3 induction by the high carbohydrate diet. Interestingly, the expression pattern of several lipogenic genes, including SREBP1c, FAS and ACC, followed that of PNPLA3. Secondly, we studied hepatic PNPLA3 expression in a mouse model of hepatic steatosis induced by a high fat diet (samples came from another independent study). In this study, mice were assigned to normal chow (NC ~10% fat), high fat diet (HF ~60% fat), and high fat with voluntary exercise (HFE) for 16 weeks.  Hepatic PNPLA3 gene expression was not changed in mice fed high fat diet although they developed hepatic steatosis; however, voluntary exercise dramatically decreased hepatic PNPLA3 gene expression compared to normal chow and high fat diet-fed mice. Thirdly, we investigated nutritional and hormonal regulation of PNPLA3 in liver cells in vitro. In HepG2 cells that were cycled between 5.5 and 25 mM glucose (to mimic starvation and refeeding conditions), PNPLA3 was significantly decreased ~5-fold by glucose starvation and increased ~2.5-fold by glucose refeeding, while insulin and glucagon had no effect. Carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) expression correlated with PNPLA3 expression. Unsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid, linoleic acid, EPA and DHA (400 nM each, 24 h), each significantly decreased PNPLA3 mRNA by ~50%, but linolenic acid did not. Lastly, we studied the effect of PNPLA3 knockdown on hepatocellular steatosis in HepG2 cells. The results showed that PNPLA3 knockdown did not affect total lipid content when HepG2 cells were incubated in normal medium or treated either with high glucose or oleic acids, although we observed that PNPLA3 knockdown increased FAS expression. Overall, studies in chapter 5 suggest that PNPLA3 plays a role in lipogenesis but not lipolysis. \nFibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a novel member of the FGF family, is mainly expressed in liver and adipose tissue. Recently, studies have consistently shown that FGF21 beneficially affects carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. In addition, human studies observed increased serum FGF21 in patients with NAFLD. However, the physiological actions of FGF21 are still not fully understood. In chapter 6, we aimed to explore the potential role of FGF21 in hepatic lipid metabolism by evaluating how nutritional, hormonal signals and physical activity regulate FGF21 expression in mice and HepG2 cells. In in vivo studies, hepatic FGF21 gene expression was significantly increased in mice fed the high carbohydrate diet, but not in mice fed a high fat diet. By contrast, adipose FGF21 mRNA was not changed in mice fed the high carbohydrate diet. In addition, our studies revealed that hepatic FGF21 mRNA expression was suppressed in mice with voluntary access to a running wheel exercise for 16 weeks. However, short-term physical activity (1 week) had no effect on hepatic FGF21 expression, but suppressed muscle FGF21 expression. In in vitro studies, FGF21 mRNA was shown to be strongly induced in HepG2 cell incubated in medium with either high glucose or 2-deoxy-D-glucose. In addition, insulin significantly induced FGF21 expression, while glucagon had no effect. Collectively, these results showed that FGF21 in liver is regulated by dietary carbohydrate, insulin, and physical activity, suggesting that FGF21 functions as a regulator in gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis in liver. \nIn summary, my dissertation work indicates that dietary factors are important players in the development of NAFLD, and that the hepatic enzyme (PNPLA3) and peptide hormone (FGF21) contribute to metabolic adaption of the liver to nutritional and physical activity signaling. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8735], "author_name_tesi": "Hao, Lei ", "last_name_ssi": "Hao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross", "A Catharine Ross", "Michael Henry Green", "Gary J Fosmire", "Joshua D Lambert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross, Dissertation Advisor", "A Catharine Ross, Committee Chair", "Michael Henry Green, Committee Member", "Gary J Fosmire, Committee Member", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease", "simple carbohydrate", "lipid", "vitamin A"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Evolution of Natural Killer Cell Receptor Genes\n", "id": "6896", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3891", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Natural killer (NK) cells play important roles in the early immune response against tumor and virus-infected cells. Their activity is controlled by the interaction of the receptors on the NK-cell surface with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Genes encoding families of NK receptors are organized into two chromosomal complexes: the leukocyte receptor complex (LRC) and the natural killer gene complex (NKC). To understand the diversity and evolution of these different gene families of NK receptors, the following three related studies were conducted. (1) Belonging to the immunoglobulin-like superfamily, the family of killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) is tandemly clustered in the LRC. I examined the evolutionary relationships of primate KIR genes and showed that the KIR gene family has experienced a rapid expansion in primate species. I also identified the positive selection at the MHC-binding sites (MBS) of KIR genes. Estimates of divergence times between duplicate genes suggested that KIR genes and their ligand, MHC class I genes, coevolved in primates. (2) The KLRA (previously known as Ly49) gene family in rodents belongs to the C-type lectin-like superfamily but performs the same function as that of KIR in primates. They are tandemly clustered in the NKC. I characterized the entire KLRA gene cluster in rats and identified a total of 33 genes, which is approximately twice as large as the KLRA repertoire in mice. The phylogenetic analysis of rodent KLRA genes suggested that this gene family expanded very quickly in rodents and the majority of these genes were generated after divergence of mice and rats. The similarity of the evolutionary pattern between primate KIR and rodent KLRA genes suggests that their rapid evolution is caused by the functional divergence of the genes and the interaction with MHC class I molecules. (3) In addition to the KLRA gene family, the NKC contains a large number of other C-type lectin-like receptor genes which are expressed on NK and other immune-related cells. I characterized all the C-type lectin-like NKC genes and their organization from four major orders of placental mammals, primates (human), rodents (mouse and rat), carnivores (dog), and artiodactyls (cattle). Phylogenetic analysis of these genes indicated that the genes within the NKC are highly heterogeneous with respect to the rate of birth-and-death evolution within and between different mammalian species, but the NKC is also remarkably conserved in the gene organization and persistence of orthologous genes. Searching for putative NKC sequences in opossum and chicken genomes suggested that the expansion of the NKC gene families might have occurred before the radiation of placental mammals but after the divergence between birds and mammals.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3864], "author_name_tesi": "Hao, Li ", "last_name_ssi": "Hao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Li", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Masatoshi Nei", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Wojciech Makalowski", "Robert Paulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Masatoshi Nei, Committee Chair", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Wojciech Makalowski, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["birth-and-death", "Natural killer receptors", "Evolution", "duplication"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Design, Fabrication, and Characterization of Metallic Nanostructures for Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy and Plasmonic Applications ", "id": "14637", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7155", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Metal/dielectric nanostructures have the ability to sustain coherent electron oscillations known as surface plasmons.

This dissertation centers on design, fabrication, characterization of metallic nanostructures and their applications in surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and actively tunable plasmonics.\nMetal-dielectric nanostructures are the building blocks for photonic metamaterials. One valuable design guideline for metamaterials is the Babinet\u2019s principle, which governs the optical properties of complementary nanostructures. However, most complementary metamaterials are designed for the far infrared region or beyond, where the optical absorption of metal is small.  We have developed a novel dual fabrication method, capable of simultaneously producing optically thin complementary structures. From experimental measurements and theoretical simulations, we showed that Babinet\u2019s principle qualitatively holds in the visible region for the optically thin complements. The complementary structure is also a good platform to study subtle differences between nanoparticles and nanoholes in SERS (a surface sensitive technique, which can enhance the conventional Raman cross-section by 106~108 fold, thus very useful for highly sensitive biochemical sensing). Through experimental measurement and theoretical analysis, we showed that the SERS enhancement spectrum (plot of SERS enhancement versus excitation wavelengths), dominated by local near-field, for nanoholes closely follows their far-field optical transmission spectrum. However, the enhancement spectrum for nanoparticles red-shifts significantly from their far-field optical extinction spectrum, due to nontrivial high orders of evanescent scattering modes. This study unveils the different near-field properties between nanoparticle and nanohole arrays and adds important details to the conventional wisdom for SERS substrate design. \nBesides SERS studies on gold substrates, I further extended my research to transition metals, i.e. platinum. I have carried out a comparative study of SERS performance for gold and platinum substrates. The commonly observed low enhancement from a platinum substrate is explained by the larger Fano interference between its free intra-band electrons and its bound inter-band electrons.\nA major challenge in applying SERS for biochemical sensing is to fabricate substrates with excellent sensitivity and uniform surface functionality. Graphene, a single sheet of carbon atoms with an ideal two-dimensional honeycomb crystal structure, offers excellent surface chemical properties. We synthesized high quality single-layer graphene sheets by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on copper foils and transferred them to gold nanostructures, i.e., nanoparticle or nanohole arrays. Our experimental data show that graphene coated metallic substrates could achieve higher sensitivity of SERS detection than bare metallic substrates. The combined graphene-nanostructure substrates show about three-fold or nine-fold enhancement in the Raman signal of methylene blue (MB) compared with the bare nanohole or nanoparticle substrates, respectively. The difference in the enhancement factors between the nanohole and nanoparticle substrates is explained by the different coating morphologies of graphene on the two substrates. SERS enhancement of graphene is further investigated on mechanically exfoliated graphene. We found that SERS enhancement of graphene can be tuned by changing its Fermi level through doping. Both molecular doping and gate doping experiments show that hole-doped graphene yields a larger SERS enhancement in MB than electron-doped graphene, which indicates that the SERS enhancement of graphene involves the chemical mechanism. SERS enhancement from metallic nanostructures, on the other hand, is mainly an electromagnetic effect, relying on the plasmonic properties of the nanostructures. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations indicate that graphene does not alter the plasmonic properties of nanostructures significantly, and consequently there is little influence on the electromagnetic SERS enhancement.  However, graphene offers additional chemical enhancement which could be combined with the conventional SERS enhancement of bare gold nanostructures to achieve higher detection sensitivity. \nBesides SERS, plasmonics offers an opportunity to merge photonics and electronics at the nanoscale, namely optoelectronics, to obtain even larger data capacity and speed of operation. As a necessary component for optoelectronic devices, various optical switches have been developed. First, a thin layer of frequency responsive liquid crystals (LCs) is integrated with a gold nanoparticle or nanohole array. The frequency of the applied voltage controls the configuration of LCs to align parallel or perpendicular to the nanoparticle. The transmission spectra of the system shift back and forth as a result of changing effective LCs dielectric function. We demonstrated that this hybrid system is highly reversible and repeatable. We further extend this concept to use photosensitive LCs to change the absorption bands of a plasmonic absorber. We construct a tunable plasmonic absorber by integrating a photosensitive nematic liquid crystal (PNLC) layer onto an asymmetric gold nanodisk array. A repeatable tuning range of ~ 25 nm in the dual absorption bands of the plasmonic nanodisk array is demonstrated in the near infrared region.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7143], "author_name_tesi": "Hao, Qingzhen ", "last_name_ssi": "Hao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qingzhen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Huang", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Mauricio Terrones", "Nitin Samarth", "Lasse Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Chair", "Mauricio Terrones, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanofabrication", "SERS", "active plasmonics", "nanostructures", "Fano resonance", "Babinet's principle", "near-field", "far-field"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Regulation of serum response factor activation by the B cell antigen receptor\n\n", "id": "6189", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5951", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nHow B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signals lead to different cell responses is one of the central questions in immunology. In this thesis, we examined the transcription factors Serum Response Factor (SRF) and NFAT as model systems to study how antigen receptor signal specifically regulates SRF vs NFAT.  \nSRF and NFAT are important for cell proliferation, cell survival, and cytokine production. However, how SRF is regulated by antigen receptor signal is unknown. Here we show that SRF is activated by BCR stimulation via an Src-Syk-Tec-PLCg-Ca2+ (Lyn-Syk-Btk-PLCg2-Ca2+) pathway. Although this pathway is also used to activate NFAT, SRF and NFAT are differently regulated by the downstream Ca2+ and diacylglycerol (DAG) signals. SRF responds to lower levels of Ca2+ and is less dependent on IP3R expression than NFAT. In addition, the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin plays a partial role in SRF activation, while it is fully required for NFAT activation. Signals from the DAG effectors PKC, Ras and Rap1, and the downstream MEK-ERK pathway are required for both SRF and NFAT, however, NFAT but not SRF is also dependent on JNK signals. We also show that Ca2+ and DAG signals act in concert to regulate transcription factors in that the nuclear association of ERK is dependent on Ca2+ signals, although its activation is Ca2+ independent.  \nActin cytoskeleton is another regulator of SRF in various adherent cells. In lymphocytes, the actin cytoskeleton has been found essential for antigen receptor signaling. Filamentous actin (F-actin) or actin polymerization process has been proposed to play positive roles in T cell activation stimulated by antigen presenting cells. We found that actin polymerization or F-actin plays negative roles as well in transducing BCR signals. Our results demonstrate that induction of actin depolymerization enhances and stablization of F-actin inhibits BCR induced SRF and NFAT activation and the sustained phase of Ca2+ and ERK signals. Furthermore, a rapid induction of actin depolymerization is detected by BCR stimulation prior to polarized actin repolymerization, and the degree of actin depolymerization correlates with the strength of BCR stimulation. We further show that actin depolymerization by BCR stimulation is triggered by intracellular Ca2+ increase. These results suggest that the actin cytoskeleton serves as a transducer for the strength of antigen receptor stimulation and act as a coupler between early BCR signals to the late signaling events.  We also found that the actin cytoskeleton modulates BCR signals by regulating the dynamics of lipid rafts, the special lipid domains on the plasma membrane that serve as signaling platform. Forced actin depolymerization delays the internalization of lipid rafts after BCR stimulation. Surprisingly, actin depolymerization by itself activates ERK and induces lipid raft clustering. We therefore propose that actin cytoskeleton has two novel roles in modulating BCR signals by regulating lipid raft clustering. First, actin cytoskeleton at the resting state keeps lipid rafts apart, thus preventing non-specific cell activation. Second, actin cytoskeleton regulates the extent and duration of the lipid raft clustering in response to different strength of BCR stimulation. \nIn conclusion, this work describes how a single BCR can differently regulate SRF and NFAT. This work also shows that actin superstructure modulates the strength of the BCR signals. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5945], "author_name_tesi": "Hao, Shengli ", "last_name_ssi": "Hao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shengli", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Avery August", "Robert Paulson", "Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Sally Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Avery August, Committee Chair", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Sally Johnson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["BCR", "NFAT", "Ca2+", "DAG", "actin", "IP3R", "Lyn", "Syk", "Btk", "PLCg", "ERK", "BCR signal", "SRF"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS, THE SIZE-BASED VIABLE ENRICHMENT AND THE EX VIVO EXPANSION", "id": "14693szh141", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14693", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cancer metastases account for 90% of cancer deaths.

The amino nitrogen of HIS residue is a preferred ligand. One pair of Chl a molecules serves as the primary electron acceptors A0 along the PS I electron transfer chain. Unusually, a methionine residue (MET) provides the axial ligand to the central Mg2+ ion, MET688 to eC-A3 Chl a in the A-branch and MET668 to eC-B3 Chl a in the B-branch.

The molecular dynamics simulation of the A-branch variant PS I implies that the amino nitrogen of HIS688 binds to the A0 Mg2+ ion.

The achieved polycrystalline Si nanowire arrays have precise dimensional, positional, orientation and length control. The potential application of these SPC Si nanowires to Schottky barrier field effect transistors (SBFETs) is studied. To get better device performance in these Schottky barrier field effect transistors, it is imperative to understand how different material, contact and nanowire length parameters affect the electrical transport mechanism in the metal contact / Si nanowire / metal contact structure. In order to achieve this goal, computer simulation is conducted on this structure with the aid of AMPS (Analysis of Microelectronic and Photonic Structures) program.\n\nTo explore the feature size effect on solid phase crystallization, SPC Si nanowire doping efficiency is compared with SPC Si thin films with the same doping and annealing conditions by resistivity measurement. Results show that as feature size shrunk, the doping efficiency gets poorer and poorer. It suggests that more grain boundary area, surface defect states and / or intragranular defect states might exist in one dimensional nanowires than 2 dimensional thin films. Two kinds of transistor structure, top gated and back gated, are fabricated and electrical characterization measurements are conducted on them. Results show that in our case, top gated \u201cspacer\u201d structure is not a good choice for SBFET due to the poor control of gate over channel current and low carrier mobility in SPC Si nanowires. On the contrary, back gate showed efficient control of the channel current. An extensive electrical characterization is conducted on the back gated SBFETs fabricated from SPC nanowires with three different SPC annealing temperatures. These SPC silicon nanowire transistors need low threshold voltage to be turned on and achieved a current on / off ratio of about 103. However, their field effect mobilities are very low, suggesting small grain sizes and high defect states in SPC Si nanowires.  Transistor performances are compared between these three groups of nanowires and the effect of annealing temperature on solid phase crystallization mechanism in Si nanowires is explored. As the SPC annealing temperature increases, the subthreshold slope gets improved, suggesting the decrease of trap states in the channel. Results also show that it is the grain boundary scattering, not surface scattering that dominate the electrical property in our SPC Si nanowire transistors. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6721], "author_name_tesi": "Hao, Yuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Hao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash", "S Ashok", "Osama O Awadelkarim", "Jian Xu", "Jerzy Ruzyllo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash, Committee Chair", "S Ashok, Committee Member", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["solid phase crystallization", "silicon nanowire"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Dynamical Hierarchy for the General Circulation", "id": "11343", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2620", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We present a series of dynamical states using an idealized three-dimensional general circulation model with gray radiation and latent heat release.

In both dry and moist cases, the contribution of eddy fluxes to the general circulation is necessary to reproduce an Earth-like Hadley cell. Additionally, the deepening of the tropical tropospheric layer and the shape of the extratropical tropopause can be understood through the eddy-driven Brewer-Dobson circulation. These results suggest that the standard theory for an axisymmetric Hadley circulation implicitly assumes contributions from baroclinic eddy fluxes and that eddies alone can generate a realistic tropopause structure in the absence of moist convection.

The bone marrow constantly generates new erythrocytes to replace \u201cworn out\u201d erythrocytes that are removed by the spleen. As many as 1011 erythrocytes per day are produced by this mechanism, which we refer to as steady state erythropoiesis. During fetal development and at times of acute erythropoietic need, steady state erythropoiesis is unable to keep pace with the demand for new erythrocytes. During this time, a second erythropoietic pathway is mobilized. Stress erythropoiesis rapidly generates new erythrocytes in response to acute anemia or the increased demand for more erythrocytes during embryogenesis. Previous work from our lab demonstrated that stress erythropoiesis utilizes signals and progenitors that are distinct from steady state erythropoiesis. These observations grew from our initial characterization of the murine flexed-tail (f) mutation. f/f mice exhibit normal steady state erythropoiesis, but exhibit a defect in stress erythropoiesis. We showed that f/f mice exhibit a splicing defect in Smad5, a transcription factor that acts downstream of the BMP4 signaling pathways. Functional analysis of f/f mice revealed the key role of BMP4 dependent signals in the rapid expansion of specialized population of stress erythroid progenitors in the spleen during the recovery from acute anemia. My work in this thesis, described the characterization of the BMP4 dependent stress erythropoiesis pathway in three ways. We show that mutation of the Kit receptor results in a severe defect in the expansion of stress BFU-E, indicating a role for the Kit/SCF signaling pathway in stress erythropoiesis. BMP4, hypoxia and SCF act in concert to maximize the proliferation, differentiation and survival of stress erythroid progenitors, resident in the adult spleen. These studies show that these progenitors express a unique combination of immature (Kit, Sca1) and mature cell markers. These progenitors exhibit the ability to rapidly expand and differentiate into large numbers of terminal differentiated erythrocytes. In order to further characterize this process, we have expanded these studies by using bone marrow transplantation (BMT) as in vivo model. We show that the BMP4 dependent stress erythropoiesis pathway is required for erythroid short-term radioprotection following bone marrow transplant. BMP4 signaling is required for the expansion of stress erythroid progenitors in the spleen and the proper regulation of GATA2 and SCL in these cells. Further analysis showed that three populations of stress erythroid progenitors expand in the spleen following bone marrow transplant, each with a distinct potential. The most immature of the three is Population-I, which expresses the stem cell markers Kit and Sca1. These cells are committed erythroid progenitors; however, when transplanted into secondary recipients, they are capable of providing short-term erythroid radioprotection, with no contribution to other myeloid lineages. This population also exhibited self-renewal properties in serial transplantation assays, which suggests that it may contain stress erythroid \u201cstem cell\u201d. Analysis of these three stress erythroid progenitor populations showed that these progenitors are also present in the fetal liver during the development of embryo, which highlights the similarities between fetal erythropoiesis and stress erythropoiesis. The final part of my thesis concerns the question of how these stress progenitors are maintained in the spleen. During recovery from acute anemia essentially all of the spleen stress progenitors are mobilized. We show that bone marrow cells can home to the spleen and in response to a Desert hedgehog signal in the spleen microenvironment; they develop into BMP4 responsive stress progenitors. Hedgehog induces the expression of BMP4 and together these two signals are required for the development of BMP4 responsive stress progenitors. The characterization of stress erythroid progenitor cells and the signals that regulate their development potentially will aid in the development of new therapeutics to treat anemia and improve the recovery from bone marrow transplants.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4801], "author_name_tesi": "Harandi, Omid Fasihi", "last_name_ssi": "Harandi", "middle_name_ssi": "Fasihi", "first_name_ssi": "Omid", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Paulson", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Avery August", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss", "Andrew Thomas Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Chair", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Committee Member", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bone Marrow Transplantation", "Red Blood Cell", "Anemia"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "DETERMING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ON-LINE VIDEOS IN MODIFYING STUDENTS\u2019 PERCEPTIONS AND KNOWLEDGE REGARDING STUDY ABROAD PROGRAMS\n\n\n", "id": "7756", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6496", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of video on-line in modifying students' perceptions and knowledge gain regarding study abroad programs.

The second section of the questionnaire included questions regarding learning and use of various sources of information.  The third section included a 23-knowledge questions and the fourth section included the demographics.

Students were interested in going to an international restaurant and slightly less interested in hosting an international visitor.  Regarding the barriers to participate in study abroad programs, students that participated in the treatment seem to have learned from the videos.  Students learned that financial costs, lack of opportunities to participate in CAS programs were not barriers to participate.\nOn-line videos seem an effective way to teach some students regarding various aspects of study abroad programs.  In this study videos seem effective in terms of transferring financial costs of programs and study abroad opportunities information to students and what it takes to participate in international programs offered by CAS.\nData demonstrated that respondents were more likely to participate in shorter study abroad trips and somewhat less likely to participate in \u201csemester long\u201d programs.  At the same time, data collected from the students after each of the videos was very positive.  This data suggests that students not only retained a great deal of information about specific aspects of the videos but it also suggests that students might be inclined to participate based on what students wrote after each video was viewed.\nStudents in the treatment group indicated that they significantly increased their learning from \u201cVideos through ANGEL\u201d, \u201cLectures\u201d, \u201cOutside classroom activities\u201d, and \u201cBy themselves through the Internet\u201d.

Three independent variables were found to be significantly correlated with the dependent variable participation.  Participation is positively correlated with \u201cInterest\u201d, \u201cHow important international issues are for the students\u201d, and \u201cHow much students have learned during Fall semester\u201d.\nIn order to increase the participation intent within CAS students, interventions that boost students\u2019 interest of participating, students learning on international issues, and the importance of international issues should the emphasized.

The three main phenomena causing instability in BWRs are the control system stability, the channel density wave oscillations, and the coupled neutronics.  The coupled neutronics, which can originate from thermal-hydraulic or reactivity instability, is the subject of this thesis.  Coupled neutronic instability can originate from thermal-hydraulic or reactivity instability.  This is the most important BWR stability phenomenon from it being able to happen in both in and out-of-phase mode.  However, BWR instability is not classified as a safety issue based on demonstrations showing oscillations can be detected and suppressed in the event of their occurrence. \n \nOn February 25th, 1999, an instability event occurred at the Swedish BWR unit Oskarshamn-2.  It was a feedwater transient that stems from the loss of feedwater heaters, causing a rapid decrease in feedwater temperature.  As power reached 108% with the decreased inlet temperature, pump rundowns were initiated three times to decrease core flow and power.  Three pump rundowns were used because the power would start to increase after each pump rundown.  A partial SCRAM was executed to reduce the power to 65%, but the power once again increased due to the decreasing core inlet temperature.    The power began to undergo oscillations with 0.5 Hz oscillations with growing amplitude until it reached 132% power, when the reactor had a full SCRAM to successfully shut down the reactor.\n\nThe objective of the thesis is to apply and validate the coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulic code TRACE/PARCS for BWR stability analysis by using the Oskarshamn-2 data.  TRACE is a thermal-hydraulic system code used by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (U.S. NRC).  PARCS is a reactor core simulation code that is coupled with TRACE.  This research work aims to test the ability of the TRACE/PARCS coupling for prediction of in-growing oscillations that occur at low flow conditions with high inlet subcooling.  The Oskarshamn-2 model was developed to simulate the transient event and validate two sets of stability tests, before and after transient event.\n\nThe results seen from the coupled TRACE/PARCS model compare very well with the reference solution obtained with the computer code SIMULATE.  The axial void fraction, power, and fuel temperature profiles obtained with TRACE/PARCS agree with SIMULATE.  The simulated TRACE/PARCS oscillations for the transient follow the expected pattern and compare very well to the plant data oscillations.  The decay ratios are in or close to the expected range of around 1.300 for instability oscillations.  The TRACE/PARCS predictions for coupled neutronic BWR instability demonstrate the code ability to predict growing oscillations that occur at low flow conditions with high inlet subcooling.

A total of 53 therapists and 79 clients from university clinics participated, resulting in 52 therapist client pairings. First, it was hypothesized that secure attachment to therapist would be negatively related to both therapist and client attachment insecurity (i.e., anxiety and\navoidance) and positively related to client ratings of both client and therapist in-session\naffiliation. In addition, client ratings of therapist affiliation were hypothesized to moderate the relations between both client attachment avoidance and anxiety and secure\nattachment to therapist. As expected, secure attachment to the therapist was inversely related to therapist attachment anxiety and positively related to client ratings of therapist affiliation. Contrary to expectation, client attachment insecurity, therapist attachment\navoidance, and client ratings of client in-session affiliation were not related to secure\nattachment to therapist. Therapist affiliation was found to moderate the relation between client attachment avoidance (but not attachment anxiety) and secure attachment to therapist.

There were five main goals in this study: 1) to accurately define the force-velocity relationships for a multi-joint movement and compare them to Hill's classic force-velocity curve, 2) to compare several options for presenting force-velocity curves in a multi-joint movement, 3) to accurately define the power-load and power-velocity relationships in a multi-joint movement for the ranges of force and velocity that were obtainable, 4) since the entire theoretical power-velocity curve was not obtainable because of physical limitations, to determine whether the data in this experiment lies in the ascending or descending portion of the theoretical power-velocity curve, and 5) to determine the load and velocity at which maximum power was produced.\nTen well-trained subjects were asked to perform maximum effort, noncountermovement vertical jumps with a range (80% of bodyweight unloading to 125% of bodyweight additional loading) of external loads applied.  Each subject performed 28-34 trials with two trials at each condition.  The instant of the maximum levels of the various velocity measures was used as the time to measure all of the other variables and the trial with the highest maximum center of mass velocity was selected for analysis.\nRelationships were identified as 'Hill-like' if they were descending, had upward concavity, and 0<a/Fo<1.  All of the variables studied in this investigation (maximum velocity of the center of mass, maximum knee angular velocity, maximum leg extension velocity, ground reaction force, and knee moment) were plotted against load. None of these relationships compared well with Hill's curve. Various logical combinations of these variables were compared to each other and to Hill's curve.  Only ground reaction force vs. maximum center of mass velocity (video), vs. maximum knee angular velocity, and vs. maximum leg extension velocity were Hill-like.  The best fit was the ground reaction force vs. maximum center of mass velocity (video) relationship, mathematically fit with Hill's curve.\nPower, calculated by multiplying ground reaction force and maximum center of mass velocity, varied as expected with maximum center of mass velocity and was on the descending part of the theoretical power-velocity curve.  Maximum power corresponded to approximately 37-61% of the maximum squat lift of the subjects and 56% of maximum velocity.  This was higher than predicted from theoretical models, but was similar to weightlifting studies.\nThis study successfully determined the force-velocity and power-velocity relationships for a multi-joint movement.  Theoretical reasons why there was limited agreement with Hill's curve were discussed.  No other study known by the author covers as wide a range of forces and velocities in vertical jumping.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [381], "author_name_tesi": "Hardyk, Andrew T.

Optical shadowgraphy and high-speed digital imaging were used to measure the explosive-driven shock wave position versus time from varying explosive charges.  From this, shock Mach number versus distance from the explosion center can be found.  These data then yield explosive overpressure and duration, thus explosive impulse.  Explosive impulse is a key parameter in explosive characterization and in determining potential damage to structures.  High-speed digital cameras and three-dimensional digital image correlation software were then used to measure aluminum panel deflections due to measured explosive impulse impingement.  \n\nExplosive characterization was performed on two explosives, pentaerythritol tetra-nitrate (PETN) and triacetone triperoxide (TATP).  The characterization included optical measurements of shock wave position versus time and piezo-pressure measurements of explosive overpressure duration versus distance.  Experimental results were supported computationally by simulations performed using the commercial computational fluid dynamics code AUTODYN.  Results show the importance of the shock Mach number versus radius profile, since all other pertinent information can be derived from it.  These data show that the characterization procedure developed here is effective for both a traditional explosive, PETN, and for an exotic, non-ideal explosive, TATP.\n\nGram-scale-explosive blast tests were performed on aluminum panels using the above characterized explosives.  Typically, material blast testing is conducted at full-scale, but these tests are expensive, dangerous, and difficult to instrument effectively in the field.  The present laboratory experiments performed with gram-scale explosive charges show that laboratory-scale testing can be repeatable and effective for documenting material responses to an explosive impulse.  \n\nA \"shock-hole\" fixture was developed to allow panel boundaries to be effectively clamped, yet provide optical access to the deforming panel surface, which was measured by high-speed digital imaging and image correlation.  Results of parametric experiments show that panel deformation is a function of explosive impulse, independent of explosive charge type.  Dynamic and permanent plastic deformation of the aluminum panels is also dependent on fixture design, with the permanent plastic deformation being highly influenced by boundary conditions.  \n\nThe gram-scale explosive testing procedures developed here show the benefits of laboratory-scale explosive testing: high repeatability and advanced instrumentation, along with relatively low resource costs and minimal danger to researchers.  Explosive scaling procedures developed previously allow gram-scale blast information to be extrapolated to full-scale test parameters.  Small-scale material testing can be more difficult to scale appropriately, yet it can still be used to validate computational models and to experimentally determine physical properties of materials.  The techniques developed here form a basis for future laboratory-scale explosive materials testing. The scientific understanding of gram-range explosions and blast scaling has also benefited.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4145], "author_name_tesi": "Hargather, Michael John", "last_name_ssi": "Hargather", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Stuart Settles", "James Bernhard Anderson", "Panagiotis Michaleris", "Robert John Santoro", "Gita Talmage"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Stuart Settles, Committee Chair", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member", "Panagiotis Michaleris, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member", "Gita Talmage, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["schlieren", "shadowgraph", "TNT equivalence", "laboratory-scale explosives", "explosive", "material blast testing"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Optimization of Conformal Low Profile Dipole Antennas", "id": "10827", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "503", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A study of horizontal low profile (close to the ground) open sleeve dipole antennas was carried out. The open sleeve dipole is a well established technique of increasing the bandwidth of a conventional dipole. By introducing parasitic elements in the vicinity of  the driven element the impedance is slightly desensitized to changes in frequency. The objective was to see if such open sleeve dipoles at distances of less than 0.1 wavelength from a PEC ground plane would be a feasible alternative to conventional patch antennas for use in conformal applications.\n\nTypically horizontal dipoles close to the ground have low radiation resistance and act as poor radiators. Also they have a high impedance mismatch with typical feed systems (50 ohms or 75 ohms) making them impractical for use in certain applications. Simulations using FEKO showed that such low profile antennas based on the open sleeve idea could be constructed close to a PEC ground using thin wires and still have acceptable VSWR characteristics. Conformal variants of such antennas were then built - using thin conducting strips (instead of thin wires) on suitable substrates - and tested to verify the simulation results. These substrates in addition to providing mechanical backing to the antenna also reduce its effective length thus permitting miniaturization of the antenna. The design of these antennas and their results of this study are presented in the thesis. A qualitative comparison between the VSWR obtained using simulations and measurements seems to suggest the possibility of using these open sleeve dipole designs for conformal low-profile antenna applications.

In essence, SPFs are mathematical equations developed through statistical regression modeling of historical data, and are used to predict crash occurrence at sites comparable to those where the historical data was obtained. \nThe aim of this research is to use statistically derived functional form transformations coupled with the parametrization of the negative binomial coefficient of over-dispersion, to minimize the effect of heterogeneity on the predictions of crash frequencies. The functional form transformations were targeted at the parameter heterogeneity that could arise from the use of improper functional form, while the over-dispersion parametrization aimed at accounting for any heterogeneity resulting from unobserved effects empirical to the dataset. The scope of this study is approximately 5,443 centerline miles of 142 2-lane State highways in Washington State, with crash data for nine years from 2002-2010. \nThis dissertation investigates the utility of the multinomial fractional polynomial (MFP) search algorithm for deriving functional forms for SPFs, while accounting for heterogeneous effects. The original contribution of this dissertation lies in the development of novel nonlinear functional form SPFs, and their comparative evaluation against a baseline negative binomial (NB) specification, a baseline heterogeneous negative binomial, and a random parameter negative binomial specification. A 10-fold cut method was used for the MFP search due to the size of the modeling dataset- this enabled the teasing out of minute variations in the dataset. Cumulative residual (CURE) plots were also employed to visually gauge the effect of the MFP functional form transformations on the model cumulative residuals. Following this, the resulting functional forms were incorporated with a heterogeneous negative binomial specification, as a means of obtaining segment specific parametrizations of the negative binomial over-dispersion term alpha, while obtaining some insight into the factors that contribute to the observed over-dispersion. It was found that Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT), homogeneous segment length, the degree of curvature of horizontal curves, the length of a roadside culvert, the presence of a tree group on the roadside, and the presence of a retaining wall, contributed significantly to the over-dispersion of the observed crash data.\nThe model specifications were also compared to a random parameter negative binomial specification estimated for the same dataset, and it was found that the heterogeneous negative binomial specification with MFP derived functional form transformations provided a better convergent log-likelihood, as well as lower prediction validation estimates for mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE).\n The gaps in the extant literature that this dissertation was hoping to fill were the lack of a statistical procedure to empirically determine variable functional forms without any assumptions on the distribution of the variable\u2019s effect on crash counts, and a modeling approach that could capture segment specific heterogeneity effectively. Towards this goal, the proposed algorithm proves to be an acceptable method towards modeling SPFs, while providing good insight into segment level parametrization of over-dispersion, thereby enabling effective safety rating and decision making at specific regions of a roadway network.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10974], "author_name_tesi": "Hariharan, Baradhwaj ", "last_name_ssi": "Hariharan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Baradhwaj", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar", "Swagata Banerjee Basu", "Jeremy Joseph Blum", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar, Dissertation Advisor", "Swagata Banerjee Basu, Committee Member", "Jeremy Joseph Blum, Committee Member", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Crash frequency", "heterogeneity", "count data", "negative binomial", "multinomial fractional polynomial", "over-dispersion"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE & SERVICE ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE\n\n", "id": "10458", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1294", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The need for transformation from today's inflexible business environment to an agile enterprise that can change direction rapidly has never been greater - Enterprise Architecture (EA) is widely accepted as an essential mechanism for ensuring agility and consistency, compliance and efficiency.

Current treatments for anemia include blood transfusions, recombinant erythropoietin treatment and in severe cases bone marrow transplantation, which aim at restoring normal hemoglobin and erythrocyte levels. However, research shows that prolonged use of any of these treatments can lead to infectious and non-infectious complications in case of blood transfusions, venous thromboembolism and hyporesponsiveness in case of Epo treatment. These drawbacks call for an alternative treatment that can be used in the long term with minimal complications, ideally using a natural defense mechanism of the body to anemia. Steady State erythropoiesis occurs in the bone marrow and is primarily homeostatic. In response to anemic stress the need for new erythrocytes quickly outpaces the erythropoietic capacity of steady state erythropoiesis. At these times, stress erythropoiesis predominates. Unlike steady state erythropoiesis, which generates erythrocytes at a constant rate, BMP4 dependent stress erythropoiesis relies on mobilization, expansion and differentiation of distinct stress erythroid progenitors, leading to generation of a larger number of erythrocytes. Stress erythropoiesis is best understood in mice where this process is primarily extra-medullary occurring in the adult spleen and liver and in the fetal liver during development. Although stress erythroid progenitors develop in the adult spleen, they originate in the bone marrow and once they migrate to the spleen they acquire the characteristics of stress progenitors. This thesis presents an in depth study of the migration of stress erythroid progenitors from the bone marrow to peripheral blood and ultimately the spleen. Here, we demonstrate the growth and identification of stress erythroid progenitors from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in mice with acute anemia and study the mechanism regulating the migration of these stress progenitor populations.

This inherent genomic variability permits the rapid evolution of a virus population in response to changing environmental conditions, reestablishing a new population of viruses that have adapted to their surroundings.  The development of antiviral drug resistance is propagated through this mechanism.  To maintain this high degree of genomic adaptability, RNA viruses exist on the edge of \u201cerror catastrophe.\u201d  Slight increases in the relative mutation frequencies of RNA virus genomes can surpass the tolerated error threshold yielding viral inviability or \u201clethal mutagenesis.\u201d   \n\n\nThe antiviral drug ribavirin was recently demonstrated to function as an antiviral lethal mutagen.  Following intracellular phosphorylation to the 5\u2019-triphosphate, this antiviral nucleotide is misincorporated into the viral (poliovirus) RNA genome by the promiscuous viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP).  Once present in the viral genome, ribavirin templates the misincorporation of the pyrimidines C and U during multiple rounds of replication.  The degenerate templating specificity of ribavirin enhances the frequency of A to G and G to A transition mutations, forcing the virus into error castrophe and loss of viability.\n\n\nEfforts towards the development of novel antiviral lethal mutagens are described throughout this thesis.  Chapter one provides an overview of the lethal mutagenesis strategy, citing many of the pioneering accomplishments in the development of this antiviral drug discovery approach.  Chapter two describes the development of a \u201cuniversal base\u201d ribonucleoside designed to be misincorporated opposite all four RNA bases.  A structural comparison between this analogue (3-NPN) and the antiviral drug ribavirin is presented.  The third chapter of this thesis expands on the development of universal base ribonucleosides and examines a series of substituted indoles and azaindoles for antiviral activity.  One particular compound, termed 5-NINDN, functions as a universal base by misincorporating opposite all four RNA bases when utilized as a substrate for poliovirus and coxsackievirus RdRPs.  Chapter four examines a family of 5-substituted cytidine derivatives, structurally inspired by 5-hydroxy-2\u2019-deoxycytidine, a lethal mutagen for HIV.  Two analogues from this series were shown to possess good antiviral activities against poliovirus and coxsackievirus, with 5-nitrocytidine surpassing the observed antiviral activity for ribavirin.  The final chapter, Chapter five, is split among two studies.  The first section describes basic strategies for nucleotide synthesis, focusing on efforts directed towards an efficient synthesis of ribavirin triphosphate and pyrazofurin triphosphate.

The contributions of each finite strip are then summed to obtain the approximate equations of motion for the aircraft. These equations are then linearized about a cruise setpoint. This linearized dynamics model for the aircraft is then used to synthesize inner-loop controllers for roll, pitch, and yaw. These controllers can be implemented within an on-board autopilot system, therefore enabling autonomous flight 'out of the box'. The performance of these controllers was simulated and compared to controllers generated using an established vortex-lattice code to determine the accuracy of the finite strip method.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15426], "author_name_tesi": "Harkins, Joseph ", "last_name_ssi": "Harkins", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jacob Langelaan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jacob Langelaan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Modular Aircraft", "UAV", "Controls", "Aerodynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "MILLENNIAL SLIP-RATES ALONG THE EASTERN KUNLUN FAULT AND RAPID EVOLUTION OF CHANNEL MORPHOLOGY IN THE YELLOW RIVER HEADWATERS, NORTHEASTERN TIBET, CHINA\n", "id": "10013", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4756", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A mechanical description of the interplay between ongoing crustal deformation and topographic evolution within the Tibetan Plateau remains outstanding, and thus our ability to describe the mechanisms responsible for the creation of this and other continental plateaus is limited.  In this work, we employ a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the Quaternary record of active tectonism and coeval topographic evolution in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.  Fluvial channel topographic data paired with geochronologically calibrated measures of erosion rate reveal a headward migrating wave of dramatically accelerated incision rates in the headwaters of the Yellow River, which drains a large portion of northeastern Tibet.  This transient increase in incision is likely driven by downstream base-level changes along the plateau margin and is superimposed onto a broad region of higher erosion rates confined to the plateau itself, within the Anyemaqen Shan (mountains).  The Kunlun fault, one of the major active strike-slip faults of Tibet, trends through the Anyemaqen Shan.  Using a careful approach towards quantifying millennial slip-rates along this fault zone based on the age of offset landforms, we constrain the Pleistocene kinematics of the eastern portion of the Kunlun fault and link this deformation to tectonically-driven erosion in the Anyemaqen Shan.  Consideration of the age and morphology of fluvial terraces offset by the fault both highlights uncertainties associated with slip-rate determinations and allow more confident quantification of the allowable range of slip-rates at sites that take advantage of these features.  Several new slip-rate determinations from this study at select locations corroborate a small number of previous determinations to identify an eastward decreasing slip-rate gradient and termination of the Kunlun fault within the Anyemaqen Shan.  Existing geodetic data reveals a similar pattern of eastward-decreasing distributed shear across the fault zone.  The spatial coincidence of tectonically driven erosion in the Anyemaqen Shan with the slip-rate gradient and termination the Kunlun fault implies that the crust of the northeastern plateau has the ability to accumulate regionally distributed permanent strain.  Therefore, traditional \u2018rigid-body\u2019 rotation type descriptions of Tibetan Plateau kinematics fail to describe deformation on the northeastern plateau.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4721], "author_name_tesi": "Harkins, Nathan Ward", "last_name_ssi": "Harkins", "middle_name_ssi": "Ward", "first_name_ssi": "Nathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Kirby", "Eric Kirby", "Donald Myron Fisher", "Kevin Patrick Furlong", "Douglas Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Kirby, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Kirby, Committee Chair", "Donald Myron Fisher, Committee Member", "Kevin Patrick Furlong, Committee Member", "Douglas Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluvial geomorphology", "strike-slip faulting", "tibet", "active tectonics", "Geomorphology", "Yellow River"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Oxygen as a Biosignature on Terrestrial Planets", "id": "14152ceh5286", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14152", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the search for life on Earth-like planets around other stars, the first (and likely only) information will come from the spectroscopic characterization of the planet\u2019s atmosphere. Of the countless number of chemical species terrestrial life produces, only a few have the distinct spectral features and the necessary atmospheric abundance to be detectable. The easiest of these species to observe in Earth\u2019s atmosphere is O2 (and its photochemical byproduct, O3). But the amount of oxygen in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere has evolved with time, jumping from essentially zero free O2 in the Archean to potentially detectable amounts of O2 and O3 following the Great Oxidation Event. The anomalous abundances of sulfur isotopes in ancient sediments provide the strongest evidence for an anoxic atmosphere prior to ~2.45 Ga, but the mechanism for producing this \u2018mass-independent\u2019 fractionation pattern remains in question. The prevailing hypothesis has been that it is created by differences in the UV photolysis rates of different SO2 isotopologues. We argue instead that the dominant process involves combinatorial factors in sulfur chain formation. Because two minor S isotopes rarely occur in the same chain, the longer S4 and S8 chains should be strongly, and roughly equally, depleted in all minor isotopes. This gives rise to negative D33S values and positive D36S values in elemental sulfur. The fractionations produced by the chain formation mechanism can explain many of the patterns observed in sedimentary rocks laid down during the Archean, and supports the classic interpretation that the sulfur mass-independent fractionation signal records the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis.\n\nO2 can also be produced abiotically by photolysis of CO2, followed by recombination of O atoms with each other. CO is produced in stoichiometric proportions. Whether O2 and CO can accumulate to appreciable concentrations depends on the ratio of far-UV to near-UV radiation coming from the planet\u2019s parent star and on what happens to these gases when they dissolve in a planet\u2019s oceans. Using a one-dimensional photochemical model, we demonstrate that O2 derived from CO2 photolysis should not accumulate to measurable concentrations on planets around F- and G-type stars. K-star, and especially M-star planets, however, may build up O2 because of the low near-UV flux from their parent stars, in agreement with some previous studies. On such planets, a \u2018false positive\u2019 for life is possible if recombination of dissolved CO and O2 in the oceans is slow and if other O2 sinks (e.g., reduced volcanic gases or dissolved ferrous iron) are small.

An additional purpose was to examine the stability of the person-place relationship over time and between different physical dimensions of place.  A final purpose was to examine the relationship between accumulated experience, participation in educational/interpretive programs and the person-place relationship.\n\tAn exploratory factor analysis revealed three distinct constructs as hypothesized which were identified as place identity, place dependence, and place-based affect.  Using a single measure of place attachment, a confirmatory factor analysis found the model of place identity and place dependence as first-order constructs of place attachment to be a good fit to the data.  Place-based affect was not supported as a dimension but was retained in the remaining analyses as an independent construct.\n\tA 2 x 2 x 2 fully repeated measures analysis of variance (ANCOVA) testing the factors of place connection (i.e., place attachment and place-based affect), scale of place (i.e., IRNP as a whole and favorite place within IRNP), and time (i.e., departure day and three months later) was conducted on the data.

No significant effects were found, which suggests that visitors\u2019 place attachment and place-based affect are not momentary or short-lived phenomena.  Inclusion of the time factor reduced the sample size from 245 to 64; therefore, an additional analysis was conducted without the time factor in order to analyze the results of the entire study sample.  A 2 x 2 fully-repeated measure ANCOVA testing the factors of place connection and scale of place revealed a main effect of scale of place as well as interaction effects of scale of place x age and scale of place by previous visits.  Age and previous visits were significant covariates.\n\tIn the final analysis, multiple regression was conducted on the dependent variables, place attachment and place-based affect, and the independent variables, accumulated experience (i.e., length of stay, previous visits to IRNP, and previous visits to similar places) and educational/interpretive program participation.  No significant predictors were found for place attachment.  Length of stay and educational/interpretive program participation were positive predictors of place-based affect while previous visits to IRNP was a negative predictor.  The model accounted for 6.6% of the total variance of place-based affect.\n\tThe findings suggest place-based affect is not a dimension of place attachment as conceived in this study.  However, it is important theoretically because it is intrinsic in the majority of place attachment definitions.  Future research may consider alternative measures of place attachment in the overall model as well as test for different relationships between place identity, place dependence, place-based affect and place attachment.\n\tImplications for managers include the acknowledgement that high place-based affect was reported relative to IRNP.  Also, educational/interpretive program participation has the potential to influence place attachment.  Used in conjunction with research on outcomes relative to place attachment, this information provides managers with a better understanding of the psychological perspective of visitors to IRNP.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3766], "author_name_tesi": "Harmon, Laurlyn K", "last_name_ssi": "Harmon", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Laurlyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Leisure Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry C Zinn", "Linda L Caldwell", "Alan R Graefe", "Theresa K Vescio"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry C Zinn, Committee Chair", "Linda L Caldwell, Committee Member", "Alan R Graefe, Committee Member", "Theresa K Vescio, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["place", "person-place relationship", "place-based affect", "affect", "place attachment", "place dependence", "place identity"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Evaluating the Implementation of Real-time Transit Information through an Examination of Information Supply and Demand", "id": "28843", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12534", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The  purpose  of  this  project  was  to  evaluate and strategize  the  implementation  of  real-time  transit  information  systems  (RTTISs) through  an  examination  of  information  supply  and  demand.

These include improving public outreach, improving feedback for commuters, providing different cost tiers for information, utilizing alternative sources for the information, and creating passive income through advertising on smartphone applications and websites. \n\nThrough these findings and strategies, real-time transit information can be better understood.

A series of gypsum precipitation experiments were carried out to determine the relationship between &#916;44Cax-s and precipitation rate as a function of saturation state and Ca2+/SO42- ionic ratio. The ionic strengths of all the experiments were fixed at 0.6 M, and the ionic ratios were fixed between 3 and 0.33. The initial saturation states of the precipitation solutions ranged between 4.7 and 1.6. The precipitated gypsum had a &#916;44Cax-s range of 1.43\u2030 where the fastest and slowest precipitation rates produced crystals with a &#916;44Cax-s of -2.25 and -0.82\u2030 respectively. This is the same range of Ca fractionation observed in naturally occurring evaporites from the ODP 654 site at the Tyrrhenian Basin (Hensley, 2006). The weight averaged surface area normalized rates ranges from 2.29x105 to 1.00x103 &#956;mol/m2/h. In general, stirred solutions demonstrated a negative dependence of &#916;44Cax-s on precipitation rate, in accordance with the findings of Tang et al. (2008b). Unstirred solutions showed a slight positive relationship between &#916;44Cax-s and precipitation rate, which is the trend observed by Lemarchand et al. (2004). The &#916;44Cax-s had strong dependence on precipitation rate as a function of saturation state and stirring. Rate as a function of ionic ratio did not affect the Ca fractionation of the precipitated crystals. Crystal morphology was found to correlate with precipitation rates, such that fast rates produced small (10-20 &#956;m in diameter) platelet like crystals and slow precipitation rates produced large needle like crystals (>1000 &#956;m in diameter). The small crystals were also found to isotopically equilibrate with the precipitation solution over time once the system had reached chemical equilibrium (&#937;=1). The trends in &#916;44Cax-s observed in stirred and unstirred solutions may suggest a Ca fractionation mechanism that is controlled by surface reactions in stirred solutions, and by diffusion in unstirred solutions. Surface reactions describe the incorporation of outer sphere complexes into the crystal lattice, a process which may fractionate Ca in favor heavier isotopes. The results of this study are significant as they provide valuable insight to the ongoing debate about what controls Ca fractionation during mineral precipitation. The observed Ca fractionation in gypsum also calls into question the interpretations of &#948;44Ca measurements in nature with respect to diagenesis in soils, and in reconstructing ancient sweater chemistry from calcium carbonates. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3564], "author_name_tesi": "Harouaka, Khadouja ", "last_name_ssi": "Harouaka", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Khadouja", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Scott Fantle", "Matthew Scott Fantle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Scott Fantle, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew Scott Fantle, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["isotopic fractionation", "calcium", "gypsum"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Experimental and theoretical effects of microorganisms, organic molecules, and atom exchange rates on the Ca isotopic composition of gypsum: Implications for the use of Ca isotopes as a geochemical proxy", "id": "28895", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12062", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Ca isotopic composition of minerals in the geologic rock record is a valuable proxy used to understand the processes that shaped the physical, chemical and biological evolution of our planet. However, correctly applying the Ca isotope proxy requires an in depth knowledge of how Ca isotopes fractionate during mineral precipitation. The mechanisms that control Ca isotopic fractionation during abiotic mineral precipitation are not yet clearly understood, and there is very little known about the mechanisms that govern biologically induced Ca isotopic fractionation during biomineralization. The main goal of this dissertation is to determine how biology can control Ca isotopic fractionation by quantifying the effect microbial life has on the Ca isotopic composition of gypsum and determining the underlying mechanisms that produce the measured Ca isotopic composition. The results of the work will be used to evaluate the viability of Ca isotopes as a biosignature of microbial life, as well as the extent to which the presence of organics can impact the Ca isotope record.\n\nThe presence of Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans microbes in the gypsum precipitation solution resulted in a Ca isotopic fractionation factor that was 0.3 permil lighter than gypsum precipitated from abiotic controls. The change in tge fractionation factor due to the presence of microbes was strongly correlated with crystal morphology, such that biotic precipitates have smaller aspect ratios than abiotic precipitates produced under the same conditions. The change in morphology led to the hypothesis that microbially produced soluble and insoluble organic molecules inhibit gypsum precipitation rate, altering the fractionation factor. Simple gypsum precipitation experiments in the presence of basic amino acids confirmed this hypothesis, as amino acid inhibition resulted in lowering the fractionation factor by 0.2 permil relative to controls. Further, the difference in the energy of a surface upon which an amino acid is detached and attached, as determined by DFT theory, can vary up to 3 eV between multiple gypsum faces, which implies that organic molecule inhibition of gypsum precipitation is a surface selective process. It was also found, based on Gaussian frequency calculations of the same faces, that the fractionation factor associated with growth on the individual faces can vary by as much as 1.4 permil. Hence, surface selective inhibition of gypsum can allow for a greater expression of the fractionation factor of uninhibited faces relative to the inhibited faces, resulting in an isotopically distinct crystal.\n\nThe empirical and theoretical evidence presented in this dissertation lead to the hypothesis that the presence of organic molecules can influence the fractionation factor of minerals by surface selective inhibition of a growing particle. Each crystal face is theorized to have a distinct fractionation factor, and surface selective inhibition results in compensatory growth on alternate faces, allowing for their distinct fractionation factor to be expressed in the bulk isotopic composition of the mineral. The results in this work imply that Ca isotopes are not suitable as a standalone biosignature of microbial life, as the presence of organic molecules, which can also be produced abiotically, are the likely trigger of the biological isotopic fractionation effect. However, the presence of organic molecules during mineral formation are now an additional interpretation of variation in Ca isotope record on the order of 0.2-0.3 permil.

While there is an extensive literature related to the application of continuous improvement and the implementation of assessment, few studies have empirically explored the link between continuous improvement and student learning. This study uses a nationally representative sample of engineering faculty members and students to explore this link. In phase I, engineering programs were grouped based on their status as high or low continuous improvement programs. In phase II hierarchical models explored the direct effect of continuous improvement on student learning outcomes, controlling for student and institutional characteristics. In phase III, a multiple-group path analysis explored the indirect effects of continuous improvement through a multiple group analysis in which the conceptual model was fit to the data for the high and for the low programs separately. \n\nThe result of the cluster analysis validated the use of the four continuous improvement variables to differentiate engineering programs into high and low continuous improvement groups. Group membership, however, was not a significant influence on student learning in the two-level hierarchical model tested, and program-level variance was small, suggesting that a single-level model with students as the unit of analysis was appropriate and that the influence of continuous improvement on student outcomes is likely an indirect one. The path models for the high and low groups differed significantly, supporting the hypothesis that continuous improvement indirectly influences the relationships between student and institutional characteristics, student experiences, and student learning outcomes. Further, the path results suggested a number of conceptually supportable modifications to the analytical and conceptual frameworks used in the study. These modifications suggest that the relationship between student experiences and student outcomes is not unidirectional, as originally conceptualized, and that relationships between different experiences and between different outcomes deserve further attention.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [688], "author_name_tesi": "Harper, Betty J.", "last_name_ssi": "Harper", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Betty", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa R Lattuca", "Patrick T Terenzini", "Michael John Dooris", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa R Lattuca, Committee Chair", "Patrick T Terenzini, Committee Member", "Michael John Dooris, Committee Member", "Jonna Marie Kulikowich, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["college student outcomes", "college student experiences", "curricular and instructional improvement", "undergraduate engineering programs", "continuous improvement", "structural equation modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF HORSE FARMS IN THE CHESAPEAKE BAY WATERSHED", "id": "10801", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4386", "abstract_tesi": "A survey of 23 horse farms in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed was conducted to assess their potential impact on water quality. Whole farm nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) balances were estimated for 13 of the surveyed farms. Rations were evaluated on 21 of the farms for crude protein (CP) and P content according to NRC (2007) Nutrient Requirements for Horses. Fresh feces, manure, hay, concentrate and soils were sampled on all 23 farms. Crude protein as a percent of the NRC requirements ranged from 78 to 263 with a mean \u00b1 S.D. of 161\u00b136 for all rations evaluated. Similarly, P ranged from 102 to 364 with a mean of 184\u00b148. Horses at a maintenance nutrient requirement level had the highest ration nutrient excesses averaging 173% N of NRC and 229% P of NRC. Fresh feces averaged 8.3 lbs N/ton with 0.4 lbs NH4/ton and 9.2 lbs P2O5 with 6,522 mg/kg of water-extractable P. Stockpiled manure averaged 12.9 lbs N/ton with 0.8 lbs NH4/ton and 7.9 lbs P2O5 with 1,460 mg/kg of water-extractable P. Phosphorus source coefficient scores indicate the potential of P to extracted by water and contribute to runoff pollution and they are measured on a scale from 0 to 1. Those scores were higher for fresh feces, at 0.73, than stockpiled manures at 0.18. Soil P ranged from 7- 432 ppm and averaged 71 ppm. Soil P saturation percentage was calculated by the equation [{soil P (mmole/kg) / (soil Al (mmole/kg) + soil Fe (mmole/kg))} X 100]. The mean soil P saturation percentage of all the farms was 7.9 % and five (22%) of the farms had samples over the environmental threshold of 15%.

Being able to feed alternative forage silages in addition to corn silage and alfalfa haylage to lactating dairy cows may increase the resilience of dairy farms. \nA series of 3 experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of partially replacing corn silage with the following alternative forage silages (AFS): brown midrib dwarf forage sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench)) or fall grown oat (Avena sativa L.) silages (Exp. 1), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) or triticale (X Triticosecale) silages (Exp. 2), or brown midrib dwarf pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.) silage (Exp. 3) The AFS were included at 10% of the diet dry matter of lactating dairy cows. The experiments investigated the effect on dry matter intake, milk yield, milk components and fatty acid profile, apparent total-tract nutrient digestibility, N utilization, and enteric methane emissions. Additionally, we analyzed the in situ dry matter and neutral detergent fiber disappearance of the AFS vs corn silage and alfalfa haylage.  Sorghum was grown in the summer and harvested in the milk stage. Oat was grown in the fall and harvested in the boot stage. Wheat and triticale were planted in the fall as cover crops and harvested in the spring at the boot stage. Pearl millet was harvested at the flag leaf visible stage. Corn was harvested at one half milkline. All forages were ensiled. Neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber concentrations were higher in all AFS than in corn silage. Lignin concentrations were less consistent with sorghum, wheat, and triticale silages having higher lignin content than the corn silage, while the oat and pearl millet silages had lignin concentrations similar to that of corn silage. All AFS had < 1% starch compared with \u2265 35% starch in corn silage. \nExperiments 1 and 2 were replicated 3 \u00d7 3 Latin square design experiments with 3, 28-d periods and 12 lactating Holstein cows. The control diets contained 44% (DM basis) corn silage for both experiments. Experiment 3 was a crossover design experiment with 2 periods of 28 d each and 17 lactating Holstein cows. The control diet for experiment 3 contained 50% (DM basis) corn silage.\nIn experiment 1, sorghum silage inclusion decreased dry matter intake, milk yield, and milk protein content, but increased milk fat and maintained energy corrected milk yield similar to the control. Oat silage had no effect on dry matter intake, milk yield or components compared with the control. The oat silage diet increased apparent total-tract digestibility of dietary nutrients, except starch, whereas the sorghum diet slightly decreased digestibility. Cows consuming the oat silage diet had higher milk urea N and urinary urea N concentrations. Milk N efficiency was decreased by the sorghum diet. Diet did not affect enteric methane emissions. This study showed that oat silage can partially replace corn silage at 10% of the diet DM with no effect on milk yield, but BMR sorghum silage harvested at the milk stage with < 1% starch will decrease dry matter intake and milk yield in dairy cows.\nIn experiment 2, dry matter intake was not affected by diet, but both wheat and triticale silage decreased yields of milk (41.4 and 41.2 vs 42.7 kg/d) and milk components, compared with corn silage. Milk fat from cows fed the wheat and triticale diets contained higher concentrations of 4:0, 6:0, and 18:0 and tended to have lower concentrations of total trans fatty acids. Apparent total-tract digestibility of DM and organic matter was decreased in the wheat silage diet, and digestibility of neutral-and acid-detergent fiber was increased in the triticale silage diet. The wheat and triticale silage diets resulted in higher excretion of urinary urea, higher milk urea N, and lower milk N efficiency, compared with the corn silage diet. Enteric CH4 emission per kg of energy corrected milk was highest in the triticale silage diet. This study showed that, at milk production of around 42 kg/d, wheat silage and triticale silage can partially replace corn silage DM and not affect dry matter intake, but milk yield may decrease slightly.\t\nIn experiment 3, diet did not affect dry matter intake or energy corrected milk yield, which averaged 46.7 kg/d.  The pearl millet silage diet tended to increase milk fat concentration, had no effect on milk fat yield, and increased milk urea N. Concentrations and yields of milk protein and lactose were not affected by diet. Apparent total-tract digestibility of DM decreased from 66.5% in the control diet to 64.5% in the pearl millet silage diet. Similarly, organic matter and crude protein digestibility was decreased by pearl millet silage, whereas neutral- and acid-detergent fiber digestibility was increased. Total milk trans fatty acid concentration was decreased by pearl millet silage with a particular decrease in trans-10 18:1. Urinary urea and fecal N excretion increased with pearl millet silage compared with corn silage. Milk N efficiency decreased with pearl millet silage. Pearl millet silage increased enteric methane emission from 396 to 454 g/cow/d and increased methane yield and intensity. Substituting corn silage with brown midrib dwarf pearl millet silage at 10% of the diet dry matter supported high milk production in dairy cows. \nOverall, the alternative forages fed in these experiments had fiber of greater digestibility than the corn silage they replaced. However, AFS dry matter was less digestible than corn silage due to the lower starch content and milk yields were decreased. Alternative forages have the potential to increase dairy farm resilience in part because of their varied use of water and nutrients and their positive effects on soil health, including reducing soil erosion and increasing soil organic matter. Alternative forages can be excellent forages for farms that need more forage fiber to feed more cows or desire more highly digestible forage fiber for higher producing cows.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16825], "author_name_tesi": "Harper, Michael T", "last_name_ssi": "Harper", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexander Nikolov Hristov", "Alexander Nikolov Hristov", "Gregory Wayne Roth", "Kevin John Harvatine", "Marvin H Hall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexander Nikolov Hristov, Dissertation Advisor", "Alexander Nikolov Hristov, Committee Chair", "Gregory Wayne Roth, Committee Member", "Kevin John Harvatine, Committee Member", "Marvin H Hall, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["forage brown midrib", "dairy cow", "sorghum silage", "oat silage", "wheat silage", "triticale silage", "pearl millet silage", "forage", "brown midrib"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EVALUATING THE SOIL BUILDING CHARACTERISTICS AND GROWTH BENEFITS OF FOUR-COMPOSTED ORGANIC WASTE PRODUCTS\n ON FIELD GROWN WOODY NURSERY STOCK\n\n", "id": "12001", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6222", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High quality soils are essential for the production and marketability of high quality field-grown nursery stock. Loss of topsoil and depletion of organic matter (OM) are often consequences of field production.  As an alternative to removing fields from production and rebuilding soils by growing several seasons of green manure crops, many nurseries are investigating composted organic waste as a means of rebuilding soil OM and soil structure. A side-by-side comparison was conducted to determine the effects of readily available composted OM on soil characteristics and growth of tree liners.\nPlots amended with spent mushroom substrate (SMS), mixed waste (PSU), yard waste (SCLB), or sewage sludge (UAJA) and a set of unamended control plots were established in Spring 2000 as a randomized complete block design. In the experiment plot five plants of five ornamental tree species including crabapple (Malus \u2018Candymint\u2019), Kousa dogwood (Cornus kousa Hance \u2018Stellar Pink\u2019), Fraser fir (Abies fraseri (Pursh) Poir), red maple (Acer rubrum L. \u2018October Glory\u2019 and \u2018Red Sunset\u2019) and red oak (Quercus rubrum L.) were planted.  Over the four-year study, total soil OM content increased by 47-52 % and soil porosity increased in the amended soils as compared to the unamended soils.  Conversely, bulk density was reduced in the amended plots.  The amendments also changed the chemical properties of the soils. The SMS, PSU and SCLB amendments each increased the soil pH, whereas the UAJA amendment decreased pH. All of the amended plots showed an increase of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, cation exchange capacity and soluble salts, and a decrease in calcium and magnesium.  Plant response varied among the different amended soils.  There was no significant difference in height, caliper, survival and quality among the crabapple across all treatments including the control. The Fraser fir and dogwood suffered high losses in all the treatments.  The red maple grown in the UAJA amended plots grew significantly larger in caliper and were observed to be of higher quality (e.g., larger darker leaves, more branching, and uniform canopies) compared to the other treatments. Furthermore, all amended plots produced an increase in weed biomass which suggests the need for a more structured weed control program.  These observations could be a result of the addition of amendments, the soil\u2019s response to the amendments, or a combination of both. In general the organic supplements did enhance soil characteristics and affected growth. Observations indicate the species do not respond the same to the addition of organic amendments. Owing to the number of variables within nursery fields, plant families and compost qualities, further research on different species, by application rates and with additional supplements such as fertilizer are warranted.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6213], "author_name_tesi": "Harpster, Tracey Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Harpster", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Tracey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James C Sellmer", "James C Sellmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James C Sellmer, Thesis Advisor", "James C Sellmer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["soils", "red maple", "red oak", "Fraser fir", "dogwood", "crabapple", "SMS", "foliar analysis", "compost"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Community Punishment and the Effects on Child Behavior Outcomes", "id": "14694nvh5204", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14694", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As incarceration rates rose in the United States, the number of parents held in correctional facilities increased as well. This rise in parental contact with the criminal justice system increases the likelihood that children will be exposed to the associated negative consequences. As of 2010, approximately 1.7 million children under the age of 18 had a parent held in either a state or federal prison (Maruschak, Glaze, & Mumola, 2010). However, only a relatively small proportion of individuals who come into contact with the criminal justice system are incarcerated. While an estimated 1.6 million people were held in state or federal corrections facilities (Carson, 2015), over 4.7 million adults were under community supervision including probation and parole (Kaeble, Maruschak, & Bonczar, 2015). The sheer number of youth affected by various forms of parental legal sanctions within the United States makes studies of its effects on youth increasingly important. However, although a well-established connection exists between parental incarceration and child problem behaviors, research is still needed to further understand these specific effects for other forms of parental sanctions.\nRelying on the theoretical framework provided by both cumulative risk perspective and stress proliferation, the current study utilizes the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to determine the effects of parental community punishment on child internalizing and externalizing behaviors (i.e. depression, anxiety, delinquency, and aggression). The inclusion of various family factors within this context is emphasized as prior research has suggested the importance of family processes in the relationship between other legal sanctions and juvenile outcomes. Overall, the present study addresses three main research questions: 1) What is the association between maternal and paternal community punishment and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors compared to households where parents have not experienced any criminal sanctions?, 2) Is experiencing maternal and paternal incarceration associated with more negative child behavioral outcomes compared to maternal and paternal community punishment?, and 3) How do various family and parenting factors affect the association between maternal and paternal community punishment and negative child behavioral outcomes?.\nRegression analyses across waves three, four, and five (i.e. when children are ages three, five, and nine, respectively) suggest that parental community punishment is associated with higher levels of child misbehaviors. However, this relationship appears to only correlate with maternal community punishment, being most clearly demonstrated in the year nine externalizing behaviors analyses; fathers\u2019 experiences of community punishment were not found to possess any significant relationships with child misbehaviors within any wave. Therefore, results suggest that there may be some aspect of community punishment specific to its effect on mothers and their ability to parent and/or their parenting practices that drives such effects. \nWith this research, the effects of parental legal sanctions on child behaviors are examined outside of incarceration. Understanding how forms of parental community punishment impact children within the home is crucial. As such, important family factors are controlled for to ensure results are not due to detrimental family contexts. These results can provide significant insight into future policy as well. Findings regarding community punishment on youth outcomes can aid individuals, their families, and the criminal justice system in understanding the aftermath of such sentences and better equip families and individuals to deal with such experiences successfully.

Posttest (5 months past pre-test) comparisons provided evidence for CALM\u2019s efficacy to: support some aspects of educators\u2019 emotional functioning; promote efficacy for classroom management; reduce time urgency, one aspect of burnout, and reports of physical symptoms; and improve physiological indicators of blood pressure and cortisol functioning. \nStudy 2 was an implementation process evaluation exploring three dimensions of participant responsiveness (attendance, practice, and perceptions) within the intervention group.

Though scholars following in Sutherland\u2019s footsteps have continued to explore the immigration-crime link as newer waves of immigrants enter the United States, this issue remains arguably the most important substantive, political, and theoretical question facing sociology and criminology today.  Unfortunately, there remain a number of persistent gaps in the empirical literature and a careful review of this research shows it to be (1) scarce and limited in scope, (2) widely varied in terms of the unit of analysis and measure of immigration, (3) focused on victimization (particularly homicide), (4) geographically limited, (5) cross-sectional, (6) focused on total (not race/ethnic-specific) crime, and (7) inconsistent in concluding whether immigration is associated with crime.  Moreover, theorizing on the expected relationship between immigration and crime is under-developed and prominent theoretical frameworks suggest that immigration may be positively, negatively, or unassociated with crime, as well as operate uniquely at particular points in time or for specific race/ethnic groups.\n\nUsing census-place level arrest data from California, New York, and Texas paired with corresponding U.S. Census Bureau data, the current study builds off of prior research and addresses several of these shortcomings in important ways.  First, this project explores the immigration-violence relationship in 1990 and 2000 to assess whether the association between immigration and violent crime has changed over time.  This approach marks a substantial advance in immigration-crime research by utilizing census-place panel data and fixed-effects (change score) methods to construct stronger causal models for exploring whether immigration is related to violence and, if so, whether this association has changed over time.  Second, using race-ethnic disaggregated arrest data that include Hispanics, this project examines whether immigration impacts black, white, and Hispanic violence in unique ways.  Because Hispanic arrest data are scarce, particularly prior to the year 2000, this project advances current research by utilizing census-place level arrest data (rather than victimization) that include this key group in order to compare the relationship between immigration and violent arrests for blacks, whites, and Hispanics over the 1990-2000 period.\n\nResults from seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) cross-sectional, change-score, and \u201cchanging effects\u201d models indicate that (1) immigrant concentration is associated with increased violent crime rates for whites, blacks, and Hispanics in 1990, (2) the relationship is particularly strong for blacks, (3) the association between immigration and violence is, for the most part, null in 2000, (4) the lack of relationship between immigration and violence is racially invariant in 2000, and (5) the attenuation of the relationship between recent immigration and violence represents a statistically significant change between 1990 and 2000 only for blacks.  Supplemental analyses suggest that these findings are reasonably robust and not contingent upon outliers or influential cases, specific sub-sets of the sample (e.g., large or small units or units from specific states), or the specification/operationalization of immigration at the macro-level.\n\nPolitically, immigration has been both a crucial component of America\u2019s growth and a periodic source of conflict since at least the early 1800s; in recent years it has become one of the most contentious issues on the nation\u2019s political agenda.  The current study is timely in addressing a crucial political issue \u2013 whether recent immigration flows are associated with violence and whether this association has been stable over time and across race/ethnic groups.  Substantively, immigration dovetails with key themes in sociology, including stratification, social problems, social control, and social change.  Social scientists are faced with the task of trying to understand the impact of immigration on our society and on the immigrants themselves, including how immigration may drive social change in communities.  The current study suggests that immigration impacts violent crime in communities differently at specific points in time and across race/ethnic groups.  Future research would do well to further explore this complex relationship and consider whether immigration policy aimed at reducing social problems like crime may be temporally conditioned and affect whites, blacks, and Hispanics in distinctive ways.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1137], "author_name_tesi": "Harris, Casey Taggart", "last_name_ssi": "Harris", "middle_name_ssi": "Taggart", "first_name_ssi": "Casey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier", "Darrell J Steffensmeier", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer", "Derek Allen Kreager", "Christopher Jon Zorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier, Dissertation Advisor", "Darrell J Steffensmeier, Committee Chair", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer, Committee Member", "Derek Allen Kreager, Committee Member", "Christopher Jon Zorn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["immigration", "violence", "crime", "arrests", "race", "ethnicity", "time"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "PARASITOID FORAGING IN A \u201cVOLATILE\u201d ENVIRONMENT: EFFECTS OF HOST AND HOST-PLANT SPECIES ON COTESIA MARGINIVENTRIS (HYMENOPTERA: BRACONIDAE) BEHAVIOR\n", "id": "12227", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1075", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When plants are damaged by insect feeding they protect themselves by releasing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which are utilized by natural enemies of the herbivores, such as parasitoid wasps. Because VOCs aid in parasitoid host-finding, elucidation of their limitations is of major importance. This dissertation explores the chemical ecology of two economically important caterpillar pests, Spodoptera exigua (beet armyworm) and Trichoplusia ni (cabbage looper), and a shared parasitoid natural enemy Cotesia marginiventris. S. exigua is a preferred host of C. marginiventris, while T. ni is reportedly only parasitized if feeding in fields near S. exigua. Parasitoids exhibit sophisticated and flexible associative learning capabilities that can persist for several days, and positive or aversive experiences related to host suitability may have important ecological impacts because they affect the efficiency of the foraging parasitoid. This doctoral dissertation combines chemical, behavioral, and ecological methods to explore the foraging behavior and realized host range of this important biological control agent. First, I show that S. exigua and T. ni differentially induce VOCs in cotton, collards, and Palmer pigweed. Using behavioral bioassays conducted in a wind tunnel, I demonstrate that C. marginiventris associates both host and non-host odors more frequently with the preferred host S. exigua than the sub-optimal host T. ni. Furthermore, wasps can differentiate the odor blends of plants damaged by S. exigua or T. ni. Lastly, I show that host species suitability can be dependent on which plant species the herbivore is consuming, and this can affect egg deposition and development of C. marginiventris. Combined, these studies illustrate the complexities underlying generalist parasitoid foraging in environments where multiple host and host-plant species occur.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1065], "author_name_tesi": "Harris, Christina Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Harris", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Christina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "Gary Felton", "John Frazier Tooker", "Dawn S Luthe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Committee Chair", "Gary Felton, Committee Member", "John Frazier Tooker, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spodoptera exigua", "Cotesia marginiventris", "plant volatiles", "chemical ecology", "Parasitoid", "Trichoplusia ni", "tritrophic interactions"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Determinants of Religious Conflict: A Cross-national Examination of Conflict Manifestation", "id": "20034", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9582", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Religion is an important determinant of collective action and can operate on multiple levels to influence social contention. Social scientists are paying increasing attention to the power of religious institutions to shape patterns of social life by fomenting both societal harmony and discord. This research focuses upon the latter. I explore the extent to which established theories of social conflict can be applied to explain patterns of conflict that are affiliated with religious identity.\n\nChapter 1 introduces the research project and offers an outline of the dissertation.\n\nChapter 2 assesses existing data and provides a detailed description the procedures used to collect the information employed in this research. This research utilizes primary and secondary data to examine religious conflict. Information on the sociopolitical environment is drawn from the 2008 International Religious Freedom Report dataset. Information regarding religious conflict events is collected and quantified in the Religious Conflict Events data. Additional country-level data is drawn from various reliable sources as well. \n\nChapter 3 examines the structural determinants of religious repression using data coded from the 2008 International Religious Freedom Reports. Regression analysis suggests that the presence and scope of religious repression is associated with levels of general and religion specific measures of restriction and regulation. \n\nIn Chapter 4, I analyze the macro-social influences on religious intergroup conflict (RIC). The chapter explores conflict events between non-state actors and tests for the impact of religious diversity, competition, and inequality on the extent of RIC events. The analysis demonstrates that religious conflict between groups is primarily driven by inequality and discrimination based on religious identity.\n\nPast research often explores the factors that cause and escalate religious conflicts of one type or another\u2014rebellion, interstate war, civil war\u2014however, few, if any, attempt to determine which type of conflict is likely to emerge based on the sociopolitical contexts in which the actors exist. Chapter 5 is an exploration of the influences predicting the likelihood of particular forms of religious conflict. Multinomial logistic regression demonstrates that the commonality of religious conflict manifestations is more or less likely in specific sociopolitical contexts.

Nearly half of alcohol-dependent patients relapse within three months of treatment. Recent neuroimaging research has provided evidence that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in substance use disorders. Studies suggest that PFC dysregulation, involving impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA), may confer an increased risk for relapse following treatment for substance use disorders.\nThis investigation examined PFC function in alcohol-dependent patients in residential treatment using: (1) the color-word Stroop task as a measure of response inhibition, and (2) a visual cue reactivity paradigm as a measure of salience attribution to alcohol cues, as well as to natural reward stimuli. The objective of this research was to determine whether task-related PFC activity during treatment would be predictive of post-treatment relapse, using an innovative and clinically viable neuroimaging technology, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Relative to abstainers, relapsers were expected to exhibit: (1) reduced inhibition-related PFC activity during the Stroop task, reflecting inhibitory control impairments, and (2) increased PFC activity to visual alcohol stimuli during the cue-reactivity paradigm, indicating heightened responsiveness to alcohol-related cues. Alcohol-dependent patients (n=50) were recruited from Caron Treatment Centers, Wernersville, PA, a residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility. Healthy control participants (n=20) were recruited from the local community. In the patient group, neuroimaging tasks were conducted using fNIRS 14-28 days after admission to treatment. Following discharge, patients were followed for prospective relapse on a weekly basis for 12 weeks, using web-based self-report queries.\nIn support of our hypothesis, relapsers exhibited reduced inhibition-related PFC activity during the Stroop task, relative to abstainers. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, these same\niii\nrelapsers also exhibited blunted activity in the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) in response to alcohol stimuli during the cue-reactivity paradigm. This finding is consistent with recent fMRI research by Sinha and colleagues reporting PFC hypoactivity during alcohol-related cue exposure in subsequent relapsers (Seo et al., [JAMA Psychiatry, 70, 727 (2013)]). Rather than the attribution of salience to alcohol stimuli, blunted dlPFC activity may reflect deficits in self-regulation, leading to disinhibited behavior and increased risk for subsequent relapse. No significant correlations were found between fNIRS measures of prefrontal response to alcohol cues and self-reported craving.\nIn addition to neuroimaging variables, relapsers and abstainers were differentiated by two self-report measures: subjective craving ratings in response to alcohol cues and total scores on the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the accuracy of neuroimaging variables to correctly classify patients as abstainers or relapsers. Neuroimaging measures alone correctly classified 80.6 percent of patients, and a model combining neuroimaging with self-report variables correctly classified relapsers versus abstainers with 93.8 percent accuracy. These data provide evidence for a brain-based metric which may be used to predict the likelihood of post-treatment relapse. Confirmation of these findings through further research is warranted, as this technique could provide clinicians with an objective measure to aid in treatment planning, aftercare recommendations, and pharmaceutical development.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13471], "author_name_tesi": "Harris, Jonathan David", "last_name_ssi": "Harris", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott C Bunce", "Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy", "Andras Hajnal", "Roger Emil Meyer", "Kent Eugene Vrana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott C Bunce, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Sue Grigson-Kennedy, Committee Chair", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member", "Roger Emil Meyer, Committee Member", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Addiction", "Neuroimaging", "Prefrontal Cortex", "Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy", "Alcohol Use Disorder", "Relapse"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "AN EXAMINATION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN TREATMENT-SEEKING COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH DOUBLE MINORITY STATUS", "id": "14785kih5146", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14785", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Evidence suggests that members of divergent cultural minority groups often experience disproportionate amounts of psychological distress as compared to the general white population. The double jeopardy hypothesis posits that as a result of occupying two marginalized statuses, the combined effects of racial/ethnic and sexual minority group memberships lead to greater negative consequences than occupying one status independently (Greene, 1994). Minority stress theory is a theoretical framework that can be used to understand the accumulative distress experienced as a double minority. However, minority stress has not been thoroughly researched with the treatment-seeking college student population. Many colleges and universities have reported significant increases in students\u2019 utilization of counseling services (Byrd & McKinney, 2012), the severity of symptoms (Drum, Brownson, Denmark, & Smith, 2009) and the length of treatment (Tosevski, Milovancevic, & Gajic, 2010). Furthermore, the difficulty of transitioning to college and navigating the self-exploration process may evoke even more distress for questioning-identified students of color because of the complexity associated with negotiating the multiple aspects of their identity. Though, while evidence suggests that this population is at increased risk of negative psychological outcomes, there is limited to no research on this plight. Additionally, the research has not begun to examine the absence of a proximal stressor, such as social support, which might effectively buffer the psychological distress experienced by this population. The current research addressed the following research questions: (1) Do racial/ethnic minority students experience more distress than white students? (2) Do sexual minority students (LGBQ) experience more distress than heterosexual students? (3) Do those with a double minority identity experience more distress than those with a single minority identity? (4) How does the stability of one\u2019s sexual identity influence the amount of distress experienced? (5) Is the relationship between social support and psychological distress moderated by one\u2019s questioning status? (6) For double minorities, is the relationship between social support and distress moderated by one\u2019s questioning status? Results indicated that racial/ethnic minorities and sexual minorities evidenced more overall distress. Most findings evidenced small to moderate effects.

Having MetSyn increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  Epidemiological studies have shown that higher whole grain intakes are associated with a lower prevalence of MetSyn or MetSyn-related biomarkers.  However, there is inconsistent clinical evidence regarding the benefit of whole versus refined grains on MetSyn markers. We hypothesized that including whole grains in the place of refined grains within a healthy diet would improve MetSyn markers.  A randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel study was conducted in 50 overweight and obese individuals who had or were at risk for MetSyn.  Participants consumed an isocaloric diet containing either whole or refined grain products for 6 weeks followed by a hypocaloric version of the same diet for 6 weeks.  All foods were provided to participants daily from a metabolic kitchen.  MetSyn criteria, body composition, adipokines, endothelial function, and plasma alkylresorcinols (compliance biomarker) were measured at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks.  Alkylresorcinols increased by 450% (P <0.0001) on the whole grain diet and did not change significantly on the refined grain diet, indicating that the participants were compliant to their assigned diets.  Fasting plasma glucose tended to decrease more on the whole grain compared to the refined grain diet (whole: -0.24, -0.10 to -0.48 mmol/L vs. refined: -0.05, 0.06 to -0.17 mmol/L, P=0.07).  Prediabetes was resolved in all participants in the whole grain group (n=9/9) and in only 13% of the refined grain group (n=1/8).  Weight, waist circumference, % adipose tissue (AT; body, trunk and abdomen), cholesterol (total, LDL, and HDL), and blood pressure were decreased on both diets (P <0.05).  Levels of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine, high-molecular weight adiponectin, decreased during the ISO phase in both groups (whole: -543 \u00b1 489, vs. refined: -470 \u00b1 718 pg/mL), but increased in the whole grain group and decreased further in the refined grain group during HYPO phase (whole: 255 \u00b1 782, vs. refined: -106 \u00b1 712 pg/mL, P <0.05).  Similar patterns were observed with total adiponectin (P<0.05).  Leptin decreased more in individuals with hyperleptinemia on the whole grain diet compared to the refined grain diet (P <0.05).  Most inflammatory and oxidative stress markers and endothelial function did not change; however, a surrogate marker of arterial stiffness, the augmentation index (AI), increased in both groups (whole: 4.22 \u00b1 14.3, vs. refined; 2.26 \u00b1 7.29, P <0.05). In sum, the improved adipokine profile may, in part, account for the improvement in fasting glucose on the whole grain diet.  Furthermore, we speculate that microbial metabolism of cereal fiber in the lower intestine may be involved in improving body insulin sensitivity, specifically through the increased production of glucagon-like peptide-1, although this endpoint was not measured in the current study.  Including whole grains in the place of refined grains improved glycemic control in individuals with prediabetes. \n\tAbdominal adiposity is a central criteria of MetSyn.  Increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with higher risk of developing insulin resistance and MetSyn.  We explored the relationship between VAT, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (ASAT), and metabolic and anthropometric measurements in a subset (n=28/60) of abdominally obese study subjects.  In addition, the effects of whole and refined grains on ASAT and VAT were assessed.  Interested, eligible participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging of their abdomens at 0 and 12 weeks.  Axial scans at lumbar vertebrae L4-5 to L3 were manually traced to separate the AT depots.  Average AT mass across all slices and sum of 3 slices around L4-5 and L3 (\u201csegments\u201d) were calculated.  Positive correlations (Spearman) existed between ASAT and BMI (r=0.63), waist circumference (r=0.62), total (r=0.71), trunk (r=0.63) and abdominal AT (r=0.71), CRP (r=0.57), IL6 (r=0.63), and leptin (r=0.57, P<0.05), whereas VAT directly correlated with trunk AT (r=0.42), resting metabolic rate (r=0.40), insulin (r=0.37) and HOMA-IR (r=0.39, P<0.05) at baseline.  Changes in ASAT correlated with changes in weight (r=0.59), BMI (r=0.61), total (r=0.41), trunk (r=0.46) and abdominal AT (r=0.44) and triglycerides (r=0.42).  Changes in VAT correlated with changes in insulin (r=0.39, P<0.05) alone.  Percent change from baseline in VAT correlated inversely with percent change in alkylresorcinols, a biomarker of whole grain intake (r=-0.48, P=0.01); however, this relationship was trend in raw change scores (r=-0.34, P=0.09).  Only the whole grain group had a significant reduction in average VAT (refined: -14 \u00b1 20 g, P=0.08 vs. whole: -18 \u00b1 20 g, P=0.001), although the changes were not significantly different between the groups.  Overall, the results show that VAT and insulin were strongly correlated whereas ASAT was correlated with body fatness and inflammatory markers.  In conclusion, the evidence demonstrates that replacing refined grains with whole grains improves glycemic control in those with prediabetes, possibly related to improved AT function and adipokine profiles.  Furthermore, we confirmed that VAT and insulin were positively correlated, suggesting that VAT plays a role in the progression of insulin dysfunction.  On the other hand, the effect of whole and refined grains on the different abdominal AT depots was not elucidated and requires further research. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8254], "author_name_tesi": "Harris, Kristina Arline", "last_name_ssi": "Harris", "middle_name_ssi": "Arline", "first_name_ssi": "Kristina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Sheila Grace West", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Ryan John Elias"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Dissertation Advisor", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member", "John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member", "Ryan John Elias, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nutrition", "weight loss", "obesity", "whole grain", "metabolic syndrome", "insulin resistance"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "BURDEN, UNCERTAINTY, AND PATIENT SYMPTOMATOLOGY \nIN FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT PATIENTS: A PROSPECTIVE STUDY\n\n", "id": "8856", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4078", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This descriptive study examined the experience of family caregivers of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) patients to identify stress-related factors that could impact the effectiveness of their caregiver role in the current atmosphere of early discharge of bone marrow transplant recipients from hospital care. \nA conceptual framework that integrated caregiver burden, uncertainty, and patient symptom pattern assessment served as a basis for this prospective repeated measures study design, whereby several instruments were administered to the study participants at two sites.\nData were collected from 46 patient-caregiver dyads at four points in the acute transplant treatment process: (a) pre-transplant, (b) immediately after transplant, (3) one week after discharge from the hospital, and (d) one month after discharge.

The data analysis was conducted using descriptive statistics, ANCOVA, and Pearson Partial Correlation.\nThe following were the principal findings: caregiver burden and uncertainty were most evident at Interview 1 and 2 (pre-transplant and immediately post-transplant); levels of burden and levels of uncertainty in this population were at or above levels reported for caregivers of patients with chronic diseases; burden was at a level associated with diagnosis of depression in other research; and times of highest stress were associated with the greatest difference in caregiver and patient assessment of symptoms (e.g., pain, fatigue, and other psychological and physical symptoms). \nThe findings of this study support the need for focused support for caregivers early in the HSCT treatment process, monitoring of caregivers for signs of clinical depression, and recognition that their stress level may alter the accuracy of their assessment of patient symptoms. The lack of increase in burden and uncertainty scores post discharge suggests that the caregivers in this study may not have found care of the patient at home to be more stressful than during hospitalization, and may have considered it to be an acceptable treatment model. Limitations related to the convenience sampling in this study support the need for additional research to confirm these findings and improve generalization to other HSCT caregiver populations. The contribution to the literature of an understanding of the family caregiver experience revealed in this study provides new insights into potential areas for the development of healthcare intervention. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4053], "author_name_tesi": "Harris, Margaret E.

Detecting similarities between genomes is a valuable technique in discovering functional elements, and sequence alignment is the primary tool for discovering similarities.

We seek to change that, to have the program automatically infer appropriate parameter choices from statistics derived automatically from the sequences.\n     We introduce a program, INFERZ, which addresses part of the inference problem, inferring substitution and gap scores according to a mathematically sound model.

We test this process on both simulated and actual genomic data, and show that iteration will converge in general, but found that converged scores were not a consistent improvement.\n     INFERZ has a synergistic relationship with LASTZ, our improved drop-in replacement for the widely used alignment program BLASTZ. INFERZ makes repeated calls to LASTZ to test score sets, and LASTZ provides the user an option to have INFERZ decide what scoring parameters to use. Compared to BLASTZ, LASTZ adds a richer set of seeding strategy choices, supports alignment to probabilistic sequences and reduces memory requirements.

The use of a diffusion chamber allows for controlled growth in stable conditions for high and low supersaturations over ice ranging from 2% to 25%. The temperature inside the chamber can be determined with relatively high precision (to about 0.1 K); however, determination of the saturation state has greater error (typically around 20% reaching a maximum of 50%). Both the accuracy and the practical use of the device were greatly improved by developing software to automatically track, control, and record the growth of the particles. Mass growth data from the BEL chamber are used to test the traditional capacitance model and the Kinetically Limited Adaptive Habit (KLAH) model. The KLAH model is able to reproduce the shape and magnitude of the laboratory data within measured precision that the universally used capacitance is unable to replicate. The KLAH model was also used to determine the critical supersaturations and their dependence on temperature from -30 \u00b0C to -35 \u00b0C. Critical supersaturations derived from minimizing the error between the KLAH solutions and the laboratory data compare well with values derived from prior studies. Between -30 \u00b0C and -34 \u00b0C, the critical supersaturation is typically in the range of 3% to 5%; however, a substantial rise in the critical supersaturation occurs at -35 \u00b0C. KLAH predicts the axis-averaged deposition coefficients (\u03b1) based on the temperature and critical supersaturation, and these were determined to be below 0.1 for most cases, and as low as 0.004. These results are similar to a number of prior laboratory studies, but are at odds with recent measurements taken in the AIDA chamber.

Ubiquitination of retroviral Gag proteins appears to be important for efficient virus budding, presumably by contributing to interactions with host proteins that are hijacked by viruses to assist in virion release.  However, the role of ubiquitin and viral protein ubiquitination in enveloped virus budding remains controversial and poorly understood.  Precious little is known about the role of ubiquitin in the assembly and budding of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses, such as paramyxoviruses.  Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) is a nonpathogenic prototypic paramyxovirus ideal for the investigation of processes it shares with other pathogenic paramyxoviruses.  Paramyxovirus matrix (M) proteins orchestrate virus assembly by accumulating at sites of budding and recruiting viral and cellular components to these sites.  It has been found that proteasome inhibitor treatment, which leads to the depletion of free pools of ubiquitin, potently inhibits PIV5 particle and virus-like particle (VLP) production, implicating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in PIV5 assembly and budding.  We sought to investigate the involvement of ubiquitin in PIV5 budding.  We find that PIV5 M protein can be ubiquitinated and the most abundant form of ubiquitinated M protein is a monoubiquitinated form.  Free ubiquitin is detected in released PIV5 virions. Ubiquitinated M protein is detected in released virions and VLPs.  The primary lysine residues modified by ubiquitin attachment were identified by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.  \n\nCumulative mutagenesis of MS-identified and predicted ubiquitination sites from lysine to arginine that resulted in reduced M protein monoubiquitination also led to reduced VLP production, reduced virion production and infectivity, and reduced incorporation of free ubiquitin into virions.  Recombinant PIV5 encoding cumulative lysine-mutant M protein exhibits an early assembly defect as observed by immunofluorescence microscopy.  The level of monoubiquitinated PIV5 M protein is also reduced by proteasome inhibitor treatment and treatment of PIV5 infected cells with proteasome inhibitors results in a similar early assembly defect.  Our results  suggest that the monoubiquitination of PIV5 M protein is important for efficient virus budding.  These data suggest that proteasome inhibitors \u2013 including the drug bortezomib (Velcade), approved in the United States by the FDA for use in multiple myeloma \u2013 have potential as antiviral agents for the treatment of paramyxoviral infections.  \n\nAdditionally, several lysine residues in PIV5 M protein that are crucial for budding, but dispensable for ubiquitination, were identified.  These lysine residues may be part of sequence motifs that bind to cellular components for efficient virus budding.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4326], "author_name_tesi": "Harrison, Megan Stasik", "last_name_ssi": "Harrison", "middle_name_ssi": "Stasik", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Eric Thomas Harvill", "Edward C Holmes", "Richard John Frisque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Paul Schmitt, Dissertation Advisor", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Chair", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Member", "Edward C Holmes, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["virus budding", "paramyxovirus", "ubiquitin"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Skew Flat Fibrations and Totally Convex Immersions", "id": "14140mah5044", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14140", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A fibration of $\\R^n$ by oriented copies of $\\R^p$ is called skew if no two fibers intersect nor contain parallel directions.

While the exact cause remains unknown, we do know that it results from a combination of both genetic and environmental factors. With advancements in DNA sequencing technology, several individual genes in addition to larger chromosomal regions have been identified as schizophrenia-associated. Despite the identification of these candidate genes, the complexity of the disease has prevented the elucidation of a clear molecular mechanism. Identifying the risk factors is only the first step towards building a stronger understanding of the disease model. Given the polygenic nature of schizophrenia, it is also necessary to continue the search for additional potential risk genes. This thesis will focus on the RNA-binding motif protein 8A gene (RBM8A), commonly referred to as Y14. Although Y14 has not yet been linked to schizophrenia, our group is working to suggest that this gene is an important factor in helping to understand the disease.  For this purpose, we looked at several ways in which we could manipulate the gene. First, we were able to achieve effective Y14 overexpression in vitro, which led to in vivo studies indicating that Y14 can regulate hippocampal neural development and anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Additionally, we designed a Y14 conditional knockout mouse which recently resulted in the production of eight male chimeras.  Overall, the techniques employed to investigate the potential role of Y14 have provided exciting new ideas and will serve as a platform for the future study of schizophrenia and other neurological disorders. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8368], "author_name_tesi": "Harrison, Michelle Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Harrison", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yingwei Mao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yingwei Mao, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["RBM8A", "Y14", "schizophrenia"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Applying Stewardship Theory to Higher Education Donors", "id": "21155", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9757", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Stewardship is the critical last step in the fundraising process, consisting of activities that help institutions to retain donors and increase their giving to higher education institutions.

There are a number of uncertainties involved in modeling of a human body glucose regulatory system, such as inter and intra subject variability, approximations in modeling etc. Such problems combined with inaccuracies in state measurements and delays involved in control input action make it a challenging control problem.  \nMany minimal and comprehensive models exist for the modeling of the glucose regulatory system which has been coupled with different identification techniques in the past. A new simplistic approach to data driven modeling has been used in this work which provides parameters that have a direct correlation with actual physiological behavior. Meal consumption and insulin injection are considered as inputs to the system and blood glucose level is the state of the system. A Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter is implemented for meal consumption and insulin delivery which mimics the meal and insulin absorption behavior exhibited by the human physiological system. A state space model with time varying parameters has been developed to model the dynamics, and an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) has been implemented on available data to recover the state and parameters and predict the state in a certain time horizon. A Type 1 Diabetes mellitus Simulator approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a substitute for clinical trials along with data obtained from clinical patients has been used for evaluating the models. Real time consistency tests conducted on the EKF show that the filter is consistent. Other conventional models have been compared with the state space model on the basis of their ability to predict the system state accurately, and the efficacy of the EKF is established. \nUsing the parameters and the covariance matrix obtained from the EKF an adaptive dual control method has been implemented for closed loop control of the glucose regulatory system. The adaptive dual control regulates insulin delivery to maintain cautious control as well as   provide persistent excitation to enable faster parameter identification. \nThe controller determined insulin delivery rate is administered as bolus insulin with a subject specific default basal insulin rate provided by the simulator. The results are compared with a published Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller, using accepted statistics for evaluating quality of control. Results from adaptive dual control indicate promising improvement when applied with meal bolus delivery but controlling postprandial glucose levels with closed-loop control without any meal information still remains a challenging problem.

New materials will have profound impacts on various environmentally conscious applications, such as alternative fuel storage, hydrogen recovery, natural gas purification, and carbon dioxide capture and storage. Designing a material that meets the demanding performance criteria of real-world use has proven a challenging endeavor, but microporous polymers are a promising alternative. This is primarily due to the material's pore sizes being on the order of molecular dimensions, while simultaneously retaining the ability for the polymer--gas physicochemical interactions to be tailored for specific gas separation applications. Both experimental and computational investigations have shown that seemingly minor changes in the chemical structure can have a profound effect on the gas adsorption and separation properties of a polymeric material; however, the vast number of possible functionalities makes the evaluation of potential structures a daunting challenge.\t\t\n\t\n\tThis dissertation focuses on developing and utilizing computationally efficient means to analyze candidate polymeric materials for use in carbon dioxide adsorption and separation applications. After validating the simulation models for structural and adsorptive performance, several important structure--property relationships are described. In particular, this work proposes and analyzes multiple families of functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity, from which we obtain important design principles of gas separation performance. It is shown that the explicit modeling of a polymer's micropore structure facilitates a fundamental understanding of the nature of the polymer--gas interactions, which was used as a means to reveal the most influential pore characteristics for each application.

Particular emphasis is placed on general relativity\nand Maxwell theory, although many results also apply in related\nformalisms. They are obtained by extending and applying a series of\nideas originally developed by W. G. Dixon to understand the\nmechanics of isolated bodies. Since this formalism is not\nwell-known, we provide an extensive review in a unified form. This\nelucidates the structure of an object's stress-energy tensor and\nelectromagnetic current vector. Multipole decompositions of these\nobjects are also studied in considerable detail, and are designed to\nautomatically \"factor out\" the relevant conservation laws.\n\nIn the case of charge-current vectors, we show how to extend these\nresults to also take into account the assumed smoothness and\ncompactness of the physical matter. This allows essentially all\nreasonable current configurations with a given total charge to be\nparameterized without any reference to the spacetime structure. Such\nconstructions provide natural methods for comparing the properties\nof current distributions in different systems. They also simplify\nthe study of \"rigid\" currents. It is found that such objects\ncannot generally exist without allowing for the presence of\nsingularities. An even stronger result applies to the nonexistence\nof rigid number density vectors in systems where the total number of\nparticles is fixed.\n\nThese formal developments are applied in various way to study the\nmotions of various compact extended bodies. The first case\nconsidered here is that of an uncharged test mass embedded in a\nspatially-flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. It is shown that\neven with zero (global) momentum, such an object may adjust its mass\nand trajectory merely by changing shape. Mass shifts are in fact\nunavoidable in almost all cases, and could be significant for\ngalactic superclusters. This effect is due to changes in an object's\ngravitational potential and internal energies; an explanation which\nis made precise without any appeal to linearizations or symmetry\nprinciples.\n\nLastly, we study the influence of a charge's internal structure on\nits motion in flat spacetime. Interactions with a body's own\nelectromagnetic field are taken into account, and allowances are\nmade for a large class of shapes, density distributions, internal\ncurrents, elasticities, and spins. Even if the angular momentum\nremains small, many such objects are found to be affected by large\nself-interaction effects beyond the standard Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac\nforce. Limits where these effects become negligible are found to be\nquite restrictive, and depend on the boundary conditions (e.g.\nretarded or radiative) used to derive the self-field.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [136], "author_name_tesi": "Harte, Abraham ", "last_name_ssi": "Harte", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abraham", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pablo Laguna", "Deirdre Shoemaker", "Benjamin Owen", "Victor Nistor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pablo Laguna, Committee Chair", "Deirdre Shoemaker, Committee Member", "Benjamin Owen, Committee Member", "Victor Nistor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["extended bodies", "equations of motion"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Zucchini yellow mosaic virus: Post-infection impacts on the Cucurbita pathosystem", "id": "27373", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11992", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Most plants are hermaphrodites and achieve, on average, half of their fitness via the male (pollen) function.  Environmental stressors, such as pathogen infection, are known to negatively impact seed production.  However, few studies have examined the impacts of environmental stress on the male function.  Moreover, few empirical studies have examined the complex interactions among multiple biotic stresses of the same host plant.  The various parasites (i.e. herbivores and pathogens) that negatively impact the fitness of a host make up a plant pathosystem.  Studies examining multiple components of a pathosystem simultaneously suggest that the interactions that result from multiple parasites utilizing the same host cannot be predicted by simple pairwise comparisons alone.  This dissertation examines the impacts of a pathogen, Zucchini yellow mosaic virus, on the male function of Cucurbita pepo, and it examines the interactions among various components (plant, pathogens, and herbivores) of the Cucurbita pathosystem in a naturalistic setting.  \n\nFirst, I examine the impact of Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) on the fitness of a virus-resistant transgene (Chapter 2).  There are concerns that escape of the virus-resistant transgene into wild populations of Cucurbita pepo could increase the weediness of wild species and/or impact non-target species.  Here I show that in the presence of ZYMV, the proportion of seeds sired by transgenic plants is much greater than would expected based solely on staminate flower production, suggesting a stronger fitness advantage to the transgene in the presence of the target pathogen than revealed by previous studies that examined only seed production.\n\nIn my second project (Chapter 3) I examine the impact of ZYMV infection on various components of the male function in wild C. pepo.  Using large-scale field experiments, I show that viral infection significantly reduces staminate flower production, pollen production per flower, and pollen competitive ability in vivo.  Together, these experiments show that transgenic plants sire a greater than expected proportion of seeds due to the significant negative impact of ZYMV infection on the male function of wild C. pepo plants.  \n\nRecent evidence shows that vertical infection of ZYMV occurs in wild C. pepo, however, the exact mechanism for vertical transmission has not been determined.  Additional studies have shown that vertical infection with ZYMV can also occur in virus-resistant transgenic plants.  This suggests the possibility that vertical infection with the virus is a result of pollen transmission.  Therefore, for my third project (Chapter 4) I used highly sensitive PCR techniques to determine that while vertical infection of ZYMV can be pollen transmitted at very low rates, the primary mechanism for vertical infection is most likely transmission via the infected maternal parent through the ovule.  \n\nFinally, for my fourth project (Chapter 5), I conducted a series of large-scale field and greenhouse experiments to examine the impact of ZYMV infection on subsequent infection with powdery mildew.  I show that plants infected with ZYMV are less likely to become infected with powdery mildew and that when infected with powdery mildew, ZYMV infected plants show reduced powdery mildew symptom severity, most likely due to a plant immune response triggered by ZYMV infection.  Additionally, I show that because transgenic plants remain virus-free during viral epidemics, they are more likely to be infected with powdery mildew, thereby mitigating the potential benefits of the virus-resistant transgene.   \n\nAmong the more novel results of this dissertation are A) transgenic plants have a fitness advantage through the male function in the presence of the target pathogen, B) viral infection decreases plant fitness through the male function, C) a possible mechanism for vertical transmission of a virus, and D) a possible immune response triggered by infection with one parasite inhibits infection with a secondary parasite.  Taken together, these studies have important implications for the fitness of the virus-resistant transgene during introgression into wild populations of C. pepo.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11429], "author_name_tesi": "Harth, Jacquelyn Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Harth", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Jacquelyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew George Stephenson", "Matthew Joseph Ferrari", "James Alan Winsor", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew George Stephenson, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Joseph Ferrari, Committee Chair", "James Alan Winsor, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Zucchini yellow mosaic virus", "transgene", "cucurbita", "powdery mildew", "viral infection"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Connecting disciplinary concepts and language: A study of legal literacy development in a second language and legal culture", "id": "22025", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10108", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While research in legal literacy has suggested that the development of expertise is intimately linked to domain-specific conceptual knowledge, language instruction in English for Legal Purposes (ELP) has traditionally drawn a sharp distinction between language form and legal content.

Little work has been done to explore how lawyers from other legal systems and language backgrounds acquire proficiency in U.S. legal discourse.  Drawing on a Vygotskyan sociocultural theoretical framework, the study addresses these gaps by employing a conceptual approach to second language legal literacy instruction, emphasizing the ways in which fundamental common law concepts structure the genres that law students in the U.S. read and write.

Analysis draws on various data sources but focuses on a microgenetic analysis of all drafts of student writing from the legal writing course, audiovisual recordings of concept-based instruction sessions, and audiovisual recordings of individual dynamic assessment sessions.

The detection sensitivity of LIBS is element dependent and the limits of detection (LODs) are higher than competing techniques used in nuclear forensics like secondary ionization mass-spectroscopy or gamma spectroscopy. LIBS non-invasiveness, small sample size requirements, and a need for minimal or no sample preparation, are the main attributes and moderately responsible for the challenges encountered when identifying and quantifying elements with this technique. Secondly, interference of the individual spectral lines in the plasma emission spectrum limit the LIBS detection selectivity and reliability. Finally, the matrix effects also limit the performance of LIBS since the emission intensity from the target element depends on not only the concentration, but also the chemical and physical properties of the matrix.\n\nIn this dissertation, optimization of the characteristics of the laser pulse have been pursued and new analysis techniques were introduced to improve LIBS detection sensitivity and isotope selectivity. Optimization of the laser pulse shape through simple and more complex pulse shaping techniques was shown to influence the overall LIBS emission intensity, signal-to-background, and the ionization state of the plasma. Similarly, 2.05 \u03bcm femtosecond (fs) laser pulses were observed to produce a plasma of lower temperature and density compared to 800 nm fs laser pulses, resulting in an increased signal-to-background ratio (SBR). Ab initio mod- eling was applied to show that the reduced plasma temperature and density for longer wavelength laser pulses leads to the increased SBR.\n\nAs an extension of LIBS, laser ablation molecular isotopic spectrometry (LAMIS) was adapted for use with fs-laser pulses. Expansion of the LAMIS technique to isotopic analysis of uranium using fs-laser pulses and the capability to per- form this analysis at remote distances through the combination of fs-filamentation LAMIS (F2\u2013LAMIS) was demonstrated. The molecular isotope shift for the UO emission band at 593.57 nm was measured to be ~0.05 \u00b1 0.007 nm, which is twice as large as the largest known atomic/ionic isotope shift of 0.025 nm for the 424.43 nm U II emission line. Spatio-temporally resolved spectral and shad- owgraphic measurements showed that the UO species expanded at a slower rate compared to the uranium atomic species.\n\nThe bulk matrix composition of the sample was observed to affect the measured LIBS and LAMIS signal, and resulted in a reduced analytic capability of the technique for both elemental and isotopic measurement. In specific examples, the measured LIBS emission intensity for an analyte of interest was observed to increase with the presence of a second element of greater concentration, which is the inverse of what is expected for many other analytical techniques. The increase in the analyte emission intensity was studied via temporally resolved plasma and emission diagnostics and through the use of ab initio modeling.\n\nThe results of this work provide new insights that will aid the development of LIBS/LAMIS as a technique capable of not just elemental analysis, but also isotopic analysis at standoff distances in real time, which is important to remote sensing applications in nuclear forensics, safeguards, and counterproliferation.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11981], "author_name_tesi": "Hartig, Kyle Cameron", "last_name_ssi": "Hartig", "middle_name_ssi": "Cameron", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Igor Jovanovic"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Igor Jovanovic, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nuclear forensics", "laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy", "uranium", "filamentation", "matrix effects"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Microbial community development in an ecological wastewater treatment system", "id": "12497meh353", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12497", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ecological approaches to wastewater treatment may offer many advantages over conventional methods by virtue of their low energy and chemical usage as well as their potential to generate significant quantities of beneficial biomass byproducts; however, relatively little is known about the development of the microbial and chemical conditions that lead to high treatment efficiencies.

The purpose of this study was to examine microbial community development during the start-up and stabilization of a pilot-scale ecological wastewater treatment plant (Eco-Machine\u2122), as well as to analyze potential relationships between various water quality indicators and the microbial communities. This study is the first to analyze the spatial and temporal development of microbial communities in an Eco-Machine\u2122. Both location within the system and total run/development time substantially affected the clustering/ordination of the microbial communities present. Note that the true time factor has not been separated from seasonal effects or changes in the influent itself; all these factors are components of \u201ctime\u201d in this study. Location had a linear effect, while time had a unimodal effect. The location effect suggests that analyzing multiple tanks at a treatment plant may give a much more complete view rather than selecting a single oxic tank as has often been done. While some community members are likely prevalent or at least present in the different tanks due to hydraulic connectivity, variations in nutrient levels and other biochemical factors may cause substantial differences throughout the system. There may have been disturbance between 2013 and 2015 which caused the unimodal effect, making continued monitoring ideal to determine if it is truly inherently unimodal.
