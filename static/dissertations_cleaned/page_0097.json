A Nielsen report reveals that more than two-thirds of the world\u2019s Internet population visit social networking sites each month, accounting for almost 10% of all internet time. Recent studies have also shown that users post massive amounts of personal and professional information on the social network. Hence it becomes absolutely necessary to enhance the safety and reduce the risk associated with the usage of social networks.\n\nThis thesis aims at exploring the consequences of the adoption of social networks by employees working in enterprises. In the first part of the thesis we suggest methodologies to answer questions related to the risks incurred in an organization due to the usage of social network by its employees, efficient approaches that can be taken to mitigate the different risks and the financial and organizational implications for an organization in implementing any of the possible risk mitigation approaches.\n\nIn the second part of the thesis we propose a new flexible framework for privacy policy generation in social networks, filling the gap between the privacy management needs of a social network user and privacy protection mechanism provided by the current social networks. We conclude, with the help of simulation results, that the framework proposed significantly enhances the privacy and security of the profile information on the social network at the cost of very little time overhead for the user.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6010], "author_name_tesi": "Rajasekaran, Sathya Dev ", "last_name_ssi": "Rajasekaran", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sathya Dev", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anna Cinzia Squicciarini", "Anna Cinzia Squicciarini", "John Metzner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anna Cinzia Squicciarini, Thesis Advisor", "Anna Cinzia Squicciarini, Thesis Advisor", "John Metzner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Social Network", "Privacy", "Security", "Risk Analysis", "Organization", "Employee"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Pulsed-Laser Crystallization of Ferroelectric/Piezoelectric Oxide Thin Films", "id": "13554axr998", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13554", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Integration of ferroelectric/piezoelectric thin films, such as those of lead zirconate titanate (PZT), with temperature sensitive substrates (complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS), or polymers) would benefit from growth at substrate temperatures below 400\u02daC. However, high temperatures are usually required for obtaining good quality PZT films via conventional routes like rapid thermal processing (>550\u00b0C). Those conditions are not compatible either with polymer substrates or completed CMOS circuits and dictate exploration of alternative methods to realize integration with such substrates.\nIn part of this work, factors influencing KrF excimer laser induced crystallization of amorphous sputtered Pb(Zr0.30Ti0.70)O3 thin films at substrate temperatures <~215\u00b0C were investigated. (111) Pt/Si substrates were utilized to understand the process window. Laser energy densities studied were in the range 35 \u2013 85 mJ/cm2. The Pb content in the films was varied via the Ar gas pressure (in the range 5 mTorr \u2013 9 mTorr) during sputtering of amorphous films. It was seen that a higher Pb content in the as-deposited films aided nucleation of the perovskite phase. Ozone-containing ambients (10% O3/90% O2) during the annealing promoted the formation of the metastable Pb-rich pyrochlore/fluorite phase, while annealing in pure oxygen produced the perovskite phase at relatively lower annealing laser energy densities. Heterogeneous nucleation from the substrate is favored on utilizing a layer-by-layer growth and crystallization process. Films were also grown on polymers using this method. Ferroelectric switching was demonstrated, but extensive process optimization would be needed to reduce leakage and porosity.  \nReal time laser annealing during growth allows for scaling of the layer-by-layer growth process. A pulsed laser deposition system with in situ laser annealing was thus designed, built, and utilized to grow Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 thin films on a laser crystallized Pb(Zr0.20Ti0.80)O3 seed layer, at a temperature of ~370\u02daC. Polycrystalline 1.1 \u03bcm thick films exhibited columnar grains with small grain sizes (~30 nm). The films showed well-saturated hysteresis loops (with a remanent polarization of ~25 \u03bcC/cm2, and a coercive field of ~50 kV/cm) and exhibited loss tangents <2.5% with a permittivity of ~730. Film orientation could be controlled via the substrate choice; {111} Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 films were grown on oriented (111) Pb(Zr0.30Ti0.70)O3 sol-gel seed layers, while epitaxial {001} films were prepared on (100) SrTiO3 single crystals. \nIn order to study the microstructure evolution in these films, in situ pulsed-laser annealing was used to grow crystalline lead zirconate titanate (PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3) thin films at a substrate temperature of ~370\u02daC on PbZr0.30Ti0.70O3-buffered platinized silicon substrates. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis indicated that the films were well crystallized into columnar grains, but with pores segregated at the grain boundaries. Lateral densification of the grain columns was significantly improved by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen from 120 mTorr to 50 mTorr, presumably due to enhanced adatom mobility at the surface accompanying increased bombardment. It was found that varying the fractional annealing duration with respect to the deposition duration produced little effect on lateral grain growth. However, increasing the fractional annealing duration led to shift of 111 PZT X-ray diffraction peaks to higher 2\u03b8 values, suggesting residual in-plane tensile stresses in the films. Thermal simulations were used to understand the annealing process. Evolution of the film microstructure is described in terms of transient heating from the pulsed laser determining the nucleation events, while the energy of the arriving species dictates grain growth/coarsening.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13888], "author_name_tesi": "Rajashekhar, Adarsh ", "last_name_ssi": "Rajashekhar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Adarsh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry", "Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Long-Qing Chen", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan E Trolier-Mckinstry, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Long-Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ferroelectric Thin Films", "Piezoelectric Thin Films", "Laser Annealing", "Pulsed-Laser Heating", "Pulsed Laser Deposition", "Laser Crystallization", "Integration with polymeric substrates", "Low Substrate Temperature Processing", "In situ Laser Annealing", "PZT Thin Films"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Inventory Management At Hospitals To Minimize Platelet Wastage", "id": "19786", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9482", "abstract_tesi": "This research proposes inventory policies for the management of platelets at hospitals.

Most of the previous work develop inventory policies based on a known demand pattern over a finite time horizon. Further, they assume that the entire platelet units received by the hospitals from the blood center are fresh (with all 3 days of transfusable life remaining). However, in practice, nearly 50% of the incoming platelets have one day shelf life. This research develops inventory models for the hospitals and the blood center under realistic settings (demand uncertainty, platelets with varying shelf life, finite supply at the blood center) with the objective of minimizing platelet shortage and wastage (due to outdating).\nIn this dissertation, single objective deterministic inventory model is first developed to determine the number of platelet units to order and time between orders at the hospital. The model is extended to multiple objective inventory models at the hospital. The deterministic models are later extended stochastic programming models under demand uncertainty for hospital inventory management. Finally, inventory management along the entire blood supply chain is studied and platelet ordering policies are developed under demand uncertainty.\nDue to the computational complexity of the stochastic programming model developed for hospital inventory management, three heuristic rules are proposed for determining the platelet ordering policy at the hospital. The performance of these three ordering policies is compared against that of the traditional periodic review order-up-to policy, using real-life data obtained from a medical center. The shelf life of arriving platelets, coefficient of variation of demand and cost parameters are varied, and their impact is analyzed on the performance measures and the best rule with respect to each setting is determined. Based on the hospital setting and cost prioritization, the decision maker can decide the best performing rule.\nA new variant of the genetic algorithm, called modified stochastic genetic algorithm (MSGA) is proposed for determining the order-up-to level and re-order points at the various stages of the blood supply chain consisting of a blood center, which serves several hospitals. The performance of the MSGA algorithm is tested against an existing genetic algorithm. Using actual platelet demand data, it is shown that the MSGA algorithm performs well and can be easily scaled up to solve for larger supply chain problems. The proposed MSGA methodology is generic and can also be applied to determine ordering policies for other perishable supply chains, such as food or drug supply chains.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14899], "author_name_tesi": "Rajendran, Suchithra ", "last_name_ssi": "Rajendran", "first_name_ssi": "Suchithra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A.

However, the additional economic benefits due to increased production and additional drilling/operational costs need to be carefully calculated to access the overall benefits of horizontal wells in CBM reservoirs.\nReservoir simulators offer a powerful tool to reservoir engineers to predict the production performance of CBM reservoirs in an accurate manner. However, full scale simulation runs take hours, or even days, to complete. Hence, it becomes practically cumbersome to explore a full suite of different design scenarios and operational behavior of a given reservoir within a reasonable period of time. It is here where Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are used to develop expert systems which can accurately mimic the production performance of a given reservoir within fraction of seconds. Once properly trained and validated, the expert system is capable of not only predicting the production performance under a given set of design conditions, but also provide accurate information on design specifications in an inverse manner, thus going beyond the reservoir simulator\u2019s capability. \nIn this study, an additional inverse formulation was implemented in which reservoir characteristics were obtained once production data and design specifications were provided to the expert system. Finally, the expert system is then used for field development planning where design parameters such as drainage area, sandface pressure, stimulation factor (skin) and horizontal well length are predicted.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7309], "author_name_tesi": "Rajput, Vaibhav Hiralal", "last_name_ssi": "Rajput", "middle_name_ssi": "Hiralal", "first_name_ssi": "Vaibhav", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coalbed Methane", "Reservoir Simulation", "Artificial Neural Networks", "Field Development Optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Development of a Compositional Simulator for Liquid-Rich Shale Reservoirs", "id": "qv33rw64w", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12307", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydrocarbon production from shales has gained significant momentum in recent years with the advancement in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies, and production from shales (and unconventional sources in general) is beginning to garner greater share in US energy portfolio. However, storage and production mechanisms in these ultra-tight reservoirs is not well understood. It is widely believed that adsorption accounts for a significant portion of stored gas in shale gas reservoirs. However, whether this mechanism is important in liquid-rich systems is not well established. In addition to this, due to the matrix permeabilities existing in nano-darcy ranges, it is hard to establish physics of flow on Darcy\u2019s law alone.\nIn this work, we have developed a new thermodynamically consistent adsorption model that is made applicable to liquid-rich shale systems. Standalone calculations reveal that neglecting this storage mechanism could result in under-estimation of reserves by about 5-15%. The model is based on the ideal adsorbate solution theory (IAST), which has been successfully applied to coalbed methane and dry-gas shale systems earlier.\nAdditionally, a new approach for multi-mechanistic flow formulation is applied in this study. Previously, multi-mechanistic studies include modeling diffusional flow based on the difference in concentration or molar density. However, this approach becomes handicapped when we have a single phase condition (gas/oil) in the matrix and the other single phase condition (oil/gas) in fractures, since it is not possible to consistently define concentration gradient across discontinuous phases. Such a condition is frequently expected to take place in shale systems, where pressure in fractures would be significantly different from that in the matrix, and therefore fractures may have two hydrocarbon phases, while matrix will still be in single phase condition. In our work, we have defined diffusive flux based on gradient in chemical potential, with the resulting equation being mathematically equivalent to the one defined based on concentration gradient. This approach is consistent across all the thermodynamic conditions (single and/or two phasic conditions).\nFinally, flow modeling in near-wellbore region is of utmost importance, especially in shale systems where early production phase is characterized by depletion through the hydraulically fractured region. It is established in literature that flow in near-wellbore region of horizontal well is of ellipsoidal nature. This is more emphasized when we consider that micro-seismic studies state that the fracturing process forms an ellipsoidal region. Thus, in order to model the flow pattern correctly, we have modeled the reservoir in ellipsoidal coordinates. A comparison of our model\u2019s performance is made with analytical models presented for horizontal wells in homogenous regions.\nIn addition, we also generated pressure-transient and pressure-derivative type curves using the ellipsoidal model. These type curves were validated using type-curve matching process, with satisfactory results. At the end, an in-depth sensitivity analysis was performed on certain important parameters and presented. Also, a case study is shown, using reservoir parameters from Utica and Marcellus shales. Sensitivity analysis is performed on drainage area and SRV volume, with some recommendations provided on economically-feasible drainage area per well.\nIn summary, we have developed a three-phase, 3D, dual-porosity, dual-permeability compositional reservoir simulator in this study.

A Ti-32.4 at% Al-4.1 at% Ru alloy was used; it undergoes various phase transformations. Specimens were prepared by arc-melting. The alloy was beta-homogenized at 1300 oC and ice-water quenched. Powdered specimens with particle size equivalent or smaller than 45 micron were prepared, and packed in a quartz capillary. The X-ray measurements were performed during the step-wise heating and cooling between room temperature and 1220 oC. A single beta phase with relatively small amounts of alpha2, G and alpha phases were initially present in the sample. Decomposition of the as-quenched beta phase to the equilibrium phases was investigated as well as the phase relationships among the major phases (beta, alpha2 and G). At an average heating rate of 5.3 oC/min, most of the beta phase decomposed to form the alpha2 and G phases, possibly through eutectoid reaction taking place between 687 oC-709 oC. The gamma phase formed at approximately 917 oC. A reverse eutectoid reaction for the formation of beta phase was observed between 1018 oC and 1220 oC, but was incomplete due to two possible reasons: suspected low diffusion rates in the alpha2 and G phases, and the presence of a relatively large amount of dissolved oxygen, which increases the stability of the alpha2 phase. beta-ordering could not be detected due to the overlap of the beta\u2019 (001) reflection, the most intense superlattice reflection for the beta\u2019 phase, and the Ti5Si3 (020) diffraction peaks. During cooling from 1220 oC to room temperature at an average heating rate of 4.8 oC/min, the beta phase partially decomposed to alpha2 and G phases,but no significant amount of transformation was observed.

Mathematical expressions for the relationships between lattice parameters and alloy compositions were proposed for the G, beta, and alpha2 phases. It was suspected that the presence of Ru affects the stability of the beta phase. A slight change in Ru content was also detected in the alpha2 and G phases during the phase reactions. Simulated step-wise heating and cooling microstructure contained plate-like alpha2 phase and the G-phase matrix as the product of the beta decomposition between 683 oC and 709 oC.

In this dissertation we apply molecular modeling methods to study FSIs in the following systems:\n1. Dissociation of water on titania surfaces\nWe studied the adsorption and dissociation of water at 300 K on the following TiO2 surfaces: anatase (101), (100), (112), (001) and rutile (110) at various water coverages, using a recently developed ReaxFF reactive force field. The molecular and dissociative adsorption configurations predicted by ReaxFF for various water coverages agree with previous theoretical studies and experiment. ReaxFF predicts a complex distribution of water on these surfaces depending on an intricate balance between the spacing of the adsorption sites (under-coordinated Ti and O surface atoms), water-surface interactions, and water-water interactions. Using molecular dynamics simulations to quantify water dissociation over the TiO2 surfaces at various water coverages, we find that the extent of water dissociation predicted by the ReaxFF reactive force field is in general agreement with previous density-functional theory studies and experiments. We demonstrate a correlation between the extent of water dissociation on different TiO2 surfaces and the strength of hydrogen bonding between adsorbed water molecules and water outside the adsorbed layer, as evidenced by the red shift of the O-H vibrational stretching mode of adsorbed water.\n2. Mechanisms of Oriented Attachment in TiO2 nanocrystals\nOriented attachment (OA) of nanocrystals is now widely recognized as a key process in the solution-phase growth of hierarchical nanostructures. However, the microscopic origins of OA remain unclear. Using the same ReaxFF Ti/O/H reactive force field employed in the previous study, we perform molecular dynamics simulations to study the aggregation of various titanium dioxide (anatase) nanocrystals in vacuum and humid environments. In vacuum, the nanocrystals merge along their direction of approach, resulting in a polycrystalline material. By contrast, in the presence of water vapor, the nanocrystals reorient themselves and aggregate via the OA mechanism to form a single or twinned crystal. They accomplish this by creating a dynamic network of hydrogen bonds between surface hydroxyls and surface oxygens of aggregating nanocrystals. We determine that OA is dominant on surfaces that have the greatest propensity to dissociate water. Our results are consistent with experiment, are likely to be general for aqueous oxide systems, and demonstrate the critical role of solvent in nanocrystal aggregation. This work opens up new possibilities for directing nanocrystal growth to fabricate nanomaterials with desired shapes and sizes.\n3. Li interactions in carbon based materials\nGraphitic carbon is still the most ubiquitously used anode material in Li-ion batteries. In spite of its ubiquity, there are few theoretical studies that fully capture the energetics and kinetics of Li in graphite and related nanostructures at experimentally relevant length/time-scales and Li-ion concentrations. In this study we describe development and application of a ReaxFF reactive force field to describe Li interactions in perfect and defective carbon based materials using atomistic simulations. We develop force-field parameters for Li-C systems using van der Waals-corrected density-functional theory (DFT). Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations of Li intercalation in perfect graphite with this new force-field not only gives a voltage profile in good agreement with known experimental and DFT results but also captures the in-plane Li ordering as well as the interlayer separations for stage I and II compounds. In defective graphite, the ratio of Li/C i.e. the capacitance increases and the voltage shifts, both in proportion to the concentration of vacancy defects and metallic lithium is observed explaining lithium plating seen in recent experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of the force-field by simulating model carbon nanostructures i.e. both 0D and 1D structures, that can be potentially used as battery electrode materials. While a 0D defective onion-like carbon facilitates fast charging/discharging rates by surface Li-adsorption, a 1D defect-free carbon nanorod requires a critical density of Li for intercalation to occur at the edges. Our force-field approach opens up the opportunity for studying energetics and kinetics of perfect and defective Li/C structures containing thousands of atoms as a function of intercalation. This is a key step towards modeling of realistic carbon materials for energy applications.\n4. Transfer of aqueous protons across single layer graphene\nProton transfer across single layer graphene is associated with large computed energy barriers and is therefore thought to be unfavorable at room temperature. Experiments, however, have not yet been performed to test this prediction. Here, we subject a single layer of graphene on fused silica to cycles of high and low pH and show that protons transfer reversibly through the graphene to undergo acid-base chemistry with silica surface hydroxyl groups. After ruling out diffusion through macroscopic pinholes, the protons are found to transfer through rare, naturally occurring atomic defect sites. Computer simulations reveal low energy processes for water-mediated proton transfer across hydroxyl-terminated atomic defect sites that participate in a Grotthuss-type relay mechanism, while defects terminated by pyrylium-like ether bridges shut down proton exchange. Given the unfavorable energy barriers to transfer of helium and H2, the calculations show that single layer graphene is selectively permeable to aqueous protons.\n5. Capacitive mixing\nThe amount of salinity-gradient energy that can be obtained through capacitive\u2013mixing based on double layer expansion depends on the extent the electric double layer (EDL) is altered in a low salt concentration (LC) electrolyte (e.g., river water). We showed that the electrode-rise potential, which is a measure of the EDL perturbation process, was significantly (P = 10\u20135) correlated to the concentration of strong acid surface functional groups using five types of activated carbon. Electrodes with the lowest concentration of strong acids (0.05 mmol g\u20131) had a positive rise potential of 59 \u00b14 mV in the LC solution, whereas the carbon with the highest concentration (0.36 mmol g\u20131) had a negative rise potential (\u201331 \u00b1 5 mV). Chemical oxidation of a carbon (YP50) using nitric acid decreased the electrode rise potential from 46 \u00b1 2 mV (unaltered) to \u20136 \u00b1 0.5 mV (oxidized), producing a whole cell potential (53 \u00b1 1.7 mV) that was 4.4\u00d7 larger than that obtained with identical electrode materials (from 12 \u00b1 1 mV). Changes in the EDL were linked to the behavior of specific ions in a LC solution using molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations. The EDL expanded in the LC solution when a carbon surface (pristine graphene) lacked strong acid functional groups, producing a positive-rise potential at the electrode. In contrast, the EDL was compressed for an oxidized surface (graphene oxide), producing a negative-rise electrode potential. These results established the linkage between rise potentials and specific surface functional groups (strong acids), and demonstrated on a molecular scale changes in the EDL using oxidized or pristine carbons.\nOur applications to these five systems clearly demonstrate the capability of ReaxFF-based molecular dynamics simulations to provide a bridge between ab-initio results and experiments.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10450], "author_name_tesi": "Raju, Muralikrishna ", "last_name_ssi": "Raju", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Muralikrishna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Milton Walter Cole", "James David Kubicki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Chair", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Chair", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Milton Walter Cole, Committee Member", "James David Kubicki, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Computational Chemistry", "ReaxFF Reactive Force Fields", "Fluid/Solid Interfaces", "Titania-Water Interactions", "Li/C ReaxFF"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Influence of Phosphorus and Nitrogen on Annual Bluegrass Encroachment in a Creeping Bentgrass Putting Green \n", "id": "13887", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7266", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) encroachment into newly established creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) putting greens is a concern for golf course turfgrass managers attempting to maintain uniform and consistent putting surfaces.  An integrated approach to controlling annual bluegrass would benefit turf managers by reducing pesticide use and potential for herbicide injury.  The primary objective of this study was to determine the influence of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) containing fertilizers on annual bluegrass encroachment into a newly established creeping bentgrass putting green. The second objective was to determine if tissue P and N concentrations and soil Mehlich 3-P concentrations are associated with annual bluegrass encroachment.  This 1-yr field study was conducted at the Joseph Valentine Turfgrass Research Center in University Park, PA on a 2-yr-old sand-based putting green originally seeded to \u2018Penn A-4\u2019 creeping bentgrass.  Treatments included four N rates (195, 293, 391, and 488 kg N ha-1 yr-1) and four P rates (0, 43, 86, and 129 kg P ha-1 yr-1).  Criteria for evaluating treatments included population of annual bluegrass, tissue N and P concentrations, soil Mehlich 3-P concentrations, clipping yields, and turfgrass color.  Results show annual bluegrass populations increased in plots treated with P versus plots in which no P was applied.  The annual bluegrass population in the 0 kg P ha-1 yr-1 plots decreased by 2% over the two-year experiment; whereas, the population increased from 2.9 to 6.8 percent in plots receiving 43 to 129 kg P ha-1 yr-1.  Treatments \u2265 43 kg P ha-1 yr-1 resulted in a greater increase in annual bluegrass from the pre-treatment population when compared to treatments with no P; however, no differences in percent change in the annual bluegrass population were detected among the 43, 86, and 129 kg P ha-1 yr-1 treatments on any assessment date during the study.  Nitrogen treatments had no influence on annual bluegrass encroachment, and no N-by-P treatment interaction occurred during the study.  Treatments producing turf with tissue P concentrations ranging from 4.0 to 5.5 g P kg-1 tended to show a lower percent change in annual bluegrass populations than treatments producing turf with tissue concentrations > 5.5 g P kg-1.  Annual bluegrass populations did not continue to increase as tissue P concentrations increased from 6.0 to 9.1 g P kg-1.  A linear relationship was found between P treatments and Mehlich 3-P in both years of the experiment.  Mehlich 3-P concentrations were positively correlated with percent change in annual bluegrass in 2005, but not in 2004.   Results from this study confirm previous findings by researchers that additions of P fertilizer in creeping bentgrass putting greens enhance annual bluegrass encroachment, but contradict some reports of N additions promoting annual bluegrass encroachment.  Although critical levels of tissue P in putting green turf that promote annual bluegrass encroachment were not identified, levels < 5.5 g P kg-1 were less likely to show increases in annual bluegrass.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7248], "author_name_tesi": "Raley, Robert Brandon", "last_name_ssi": "Raley", "middle_name_ssi": "Brandon", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Landschoot"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Landschoot, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nitrogen", "phosphorus", "creeping bentgrass", "annual bluegrass", "putting green"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "METAL ORGANIC CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIER COATINGS FOR THE INHIBITION OF SOLID DEPOSIT FORMATION FROM HEATED JET FUEL", "id": "11660", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "436", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Solid deposit formation from jet fuel compromises the fuel handling system of an aviation turbine engine and increases the maintenance downtime of an aircraft. The deposit formation process depends upon the composition of the fuel, the nature of metal surfaces that come in contact with the heated fuel and the operating conditions of the engine. The objective of the study is to investigate the effect of substrate surfaces on the amount and nature of solid deposits in the intermediate regime where both autoxidation and pyrolysis play an important role in deposit formation. A particular focus has been directed to examining the effectiveness of barrier coatings produced by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on metal surfaces for inhibiting the solid deposit formation from jet fuel degradation.\n         In the first part of the experimental study, a commercial Jet-A sample was stressed in a flow reactor on seven different metal surfaces: AISI316, AISI 321, AISI 304, AISI 347, Inconel 600, Inconel 718, Inconel 750X and FecrAlloy. Examination of deposits by thermal and microscopic analysis shows that the solid deposit formation is influenced by the interaction of organosulfur compounds and autoxidation products with the metal surfaces. The nature of metal sulfides was predicted by Fe-Ni-S ternary phase diagram. Thermal stressing on uncoated surfaces produced coke deposits with varying degree of structural order. They are hydrogen-rich and structurally disordered deposits, spherulitic deposits, small carbon particles with relatively ordered structures and large platelets of ordered carbon structures formed by metal catalysis. \n         In the second part of the study, environmental barrier coatings were deposited on tube surfaces to inhibit solid deposit formation from the heated fuel. A new CVD system was configured by the proper choice of components for mass flow, pressure and temperature control in the reactor. A bubbler was designed to deliver the precursor into the reactor for the deposition\nof metal and metal oxide functional coatings by MOCVD.  Alumina was chosen as a candidate for metal oxide coating because of its thermal and phase stability. Platinum was chosen as a candidate to utilize the oxygen spillover process to maintain a self-cleaning surface by oxidizing the deposits formed during thermal stressing. Two metal organic precursors, aluminum trisecondary butoxide and aluminum acetylacetonate, were used as precursors to coat tubes of varying diameters. The morphology and uniformity of the coatings were characterized by electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The coating was characterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to obtain the surface chemical composition.  This is the first study conducted to examine the application of MOCVD to coat internal surfaces of tubes with varying diameters.              \n         In the third part of the study, the metal oxide coatings, alumina from aluminum acetylacetonate, alumina from aluminum trisecondary butoxide, zirconia from zirconium acetylacetonate, tantalum oxide from tantalum pentaethoxide and the metal coating, platinum from platinum acetylacetonate were deposited by MOCVD on AISI304. The chemical composition and the surface acidity of the coatings were characterized by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The morphology of the coatings was characterized by electron microscopy. The coated substrates were tested in the presence of heated Jet-A in a flow reactor to evaluate their effectiveness in inhibiting the solid deposit formation.  All coatings inhibited the formation of metal sulfides and the carbonaceous solid deposits formed by metal catalysis.  The coatings also delayed the accumulation of solid carbonaceous deposits. In particular, it has been confirmed that the surface acidity of the metal oxide coatings affects the formation of carbonaceous deposits. Bimolecular addition reactions promoted by the Br\u00f8nsted acid sites appear to lead to the formation of carbonaceous solid deposits depending on the surface acidity of the coatings. \n        In the last part of the study, the residual carbon was incorporated in the zirconia coating by deposition with and without oxygen. As carbon surface is less active towards coke deposition, presence of residual carbon in the coating was expected to reduce its activity towards carbon deposition. The residual carbon in the coating was characterized by Raman spectroscopy and thermal analysis.  However, it has been observed that residual carbon in the coating beyond a certain concentration compromises the integrity of the coating during the process of cooling the substrate from deposition temperature to room temperature. It has been found that residual carbon in the zirconia coating does not appear to affect the activity of the surface towards carbon deposition.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [430], "author_name_tesi": "Ram Mohan, Arun ", "last_name_ssi": "Ram Mohan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Arun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Semih Eser", "Semih Eser", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Ljubisa R Radovic", "Coray M Colina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Semih Eser, Dissertation Advisor", "Semih Eser, Committee Chair", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "Ljubisa R Radovic, Committee Member", "Coray M Colina, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Jet fuel", "metal sulfides", "degradation", "surface coatings", "Inhibition", "MOCVD"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Modeling Heat Transfer In Cantaloupes During Hot Water Immersion And Thermal Destruction Of Listeria monocytogenes", "id": "21058", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8332", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Listeria monocytogenes outbreak in 2011, associated with the consumption of cantaloupes was responsible for numerous cases of listeriosis and 33 deaths. There is a need to develop a suitable postharvest treatment to ensure that cantaloupes are free of Listeria monocytogenes. The overall goal of this research was to determine the effect of a thermal treatment process, in the form of hot water immersion, to enhance the microbiological safety of cantaloupes. The specific objectives of this research were: (a) to study the potential of microbial penetration into whole cantaloupes by conducting dye penetration and surface inoculation of L. monocytogenes on whole cantaloupes, (b) to develop a finite element model to simulate the time-temperature distribution within cantaloupes during heating and to validate the finite element model by conducting hot water immersion studies on cantaloupes, and (c) to determine the destruction of L. monocytogenes on surface inoculated cantaloupes by subjecting them to hot water immersion.\nIn the dye penetration study, whole cantaloupes were immersed in dye solution to study the maximum distance of penetration into cantaloupes. In the surface inoculation study, whole cantaloupes were inoculated with a cocktail of L. monocytogenes strains L2624, L2625, L2626, and L2676, the strains that were associated with the 2011 cantaloupe outbreaks. The cantaloupes were inoculated on the surface with this cocktail in order to determine the extent of microbial penetration into the fruit. A finite element model of cantaloupes was used to determine the time-temperature distribution in them, when heated by immersing in hot water at different temperatures, and this model was validated using hot water immersion experiments with cantaloupes. Based on the results from the finite element model, the inoculated cantaloupes were subjected to hot water immersion on day 0 of inoculation at temperatures of 850C and 950C for 5 minutes.\nThe dye penetration study showed that the maximum penetration was up to 1 cm inside the fruit. During the surface inoculation study with cantaloupes, the maximum cell population was recorded on day 0 of inoculation and the maximum cell penetration was up to 1 cm into the cantaloupes. The predicted time of heating from the finite element model for hot water immersion at 850C and 950C was 5 minutes in order for the temperature at positions 5 mm beneath the surface to reach 750C and 850C, respectively. The hot water immersion of inoculated cantaloupes at 850C and 950C for 5 minutes showed that the thermal treatment reduced L. monocytogenes by 3.46 \u00b1 0.31 log10 CFU/ml and 4.88 \u00b1 0.18 log10 CFU/ml, respectively. Populations of L. monocytogenes recovered from cantaloupes that were subjected to hot water immersion at 850C and 950C for 5 minutes were significantly lower than those of the controls (P < 0.05).\nThe results presented in this research show that hot water immersion treatments have the ability to reduce levels of Listeria monocytogenes in cantaloupes contaminated with this pathogen. Additionally, the simulation model of heat transfer indicated that while the temperature of the rind elevated rapidly, the pulp of cantaloupes remained at room temperature. This feature of hot water immersion treatment is an advantage if such a treatment is considered as a post harvest treatment process because it does not increase the temperature of the pulp, thereby not affecting the sensory properties of the cantaloupe.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8247], "author_name_tesi": "Ramachandran, Radhika ", "last_name_ssi": "Ramachandran", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Radhika", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cantaloupe", "Listeria monocytogenes", "modeling", "hot water immersion"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Subgrid modeling using transport equations: large-eddy simulation of the atmospheric boundary layer", "id": "10603", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6017", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In large-eddy simulation (LES), the modeling of sub&#64257;lter-scale motions when the\n&#64257;lter width (&#8764; Delta) is comparable to the size of the energy-carrying eddies (&#8764; l), is a\nchallenging task.

The problem is aggravated by the fact that there are not enough new drugs available to combat these pathogens or re-sensitize them to existing therapies. As a consequence, there is an ongoing quest for new targets and new drugs.\nOne such target described in this study is the trans-translation pathway, the key components of which are ubiquitous among bacteria. The pathway, mediated by the tmRNA- SmpB ribonucleoprotein complex, serves to release translational complexes that stall at the 3\u2019- end of nonstop mRNAs, and ensures removal of both the aberrant mRNA and incomplete nascent polypeptide. The presence of tmRNA-SmpB in every bacterial species suggests that trans-translation confers some competitive advantage to the cell. Most likely, all bacteria require the resolution of nonstop translational complexes to be able to survive and carry out vital cellular processes. The idea is supported by results obtained in this study from examining the role of trans-translation in pathogen Shigella flexneri, and its close relative Escherichia coli. It has been shown that tmRNA is not essential in E. coli, because it has an alternate factor, ArfA, which mediates the release of nonstop ribosomes. This study shows that tmRNA cannot be deleted in S. flexneri, which lacks ArfA. However, this phenotype is suppressed by providing S. flexneri cells with E. coli ArfA, indicating that due to the absence of a functional backup ribosome release mechanism, tmRNA is essential in S. flexneri.\nEstablishing the requirement for tmRNA in S. flexneri has added to existing knowledge about the role of trans-translation in the viability and virulence of a number of other pathogens. The phenotypes that occur in pathogens due to lack of tmRNA activity, together with the fact that the components of trans-translation are not found in animals, makes the pathway additionally attractive as a drug target. This study validates the pathway as a target for broad- spectrum antibacterial development. High throughput screening and secondary screening methods were used to identify small molecule inhibitors of trans-translation, several of which exhibited antibacterial activity against three different bacterial species. In S. flexneri, inhibition of bacterial growth by trans-translation inhibitors was consistent with the species requiring the pathway for survival. One of the several compounds exhibiting broad-spectrum activity, KKL- 35, which scored as a tagging inhibitor in both E. coli and in Mycobacterium smegmatis, also inhibited tmRNA-mediated tagging in vitro. Attempts to isolate mutant S. flexneri strains resistant to KKL-35 were largely unsuccessful, suggesting that KKL-35 may target a component within the cell in a manner that could select against the development of resistance to the inhibitor. Taken together, this work establishes the foundations for developing inhibitors of trans-translation both as tools to further investigating the physiology of trans-translation and as lead compounds for new antibacterials.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8586], "author_name_tesi": "Ramadoss, Nitya S", "last_name_ssi": "Ramadoss", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Nitya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Charles Keiler", "Kenneth Charles Keiler", "Sarah Ellen Ades", "Squire J Booker", "Katsuhiko Murakami", "Edward G Dudley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Charles Keiler, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth Charles Keiler, Committee Chair", "Sarah Ellen Ades, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Katsuhiko Murakami, Committee Member", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["trans-translation", "tmRNA", "antibiotic development", "small molecules", "Shigella flexneri"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "DIVERGENT PROPERTIES OF MOUSE AND \nHUMAN ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTORS\n", "id": "6785", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4975", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-09-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates the transcription of several genes in reponse to binding ligand. AhR ligands include a structurally diverse group of chemicals, and some of these are major environmental contaminants such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). Exposure to these chemicals results in a variety of toxic responses, and the AhR is thought to mediate most, if not all of these adverse reactions. There are a number of intra- and inter-species differences in terms of the relative sensitivity to the toxic effects of AhR ligands, and there is also considerable variation in the AhR\u2019s amino acid sequence between species. It is likely that the differences in the AhR are partly responsible for the differences in sensitivity to TCDD between species. Mouse models are most commonly used in toxicological studies to evaluate the risk upon exposure to AhR ligands and the data is extrapolated to estimate risk to humans. If there are substantial differences between the mouse AhR (mAhR) and human AhR (hAhR) that lead to variation in response to ligand exposure, there may be a need to develop a more suitable model to estimate toxicological risk to humans. This work characterized some of the biochemical differences between mAhR and hAhR and found that there were a number of differences between mAhR and hAhR. This variation could contribute to differences in response to ligand at the molecular level. hAhR exhibits nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling properties that are different from mAhR, and hAhR is not influenced in the same way as mAhR by the chaperone protein XAP2. hAhR also has a 10-fold lower apparent ligand affinity than mAhR. Some of these differences appear to be due to the sequence variation in the poorly conserved transactivation domain of the receptor. This study also attempted to identify novel AhR target genes through the use of chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarrays, and this method can eventually be adapted to perform in vivo chromatin immunoprecpitations from tissue. In summary, these studies will help provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which the AhR mediates a toxic response upon exposure to ligands.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4952], "author_name_tesi": "Ramadoss, Preeti ", "last_name_ssi": "Ramadoss", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Preeti", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary H Perdew", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Richard John Frisque", "Avery August", "David John Vandenbergh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary H Perdew, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor", "TCDD", "XAP2", "Relative Ligand Affinity"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "DO INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS WHO HOLD LARGE STAKES OVER LONG HORIZONS HAVE PRIVATE INFORMATION ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE?", "id": "7099", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5703", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Prior studies fail to find that dedicated institutional investors (those characterized by long trading horizons and high ownership stakes in portfolio firms) trade in anticipation of future performance.

The effect of glycation on intracellular proteins is, on the other hand, less well known in spite of the vital importance of intracellular proteins for cell, tissue, and organ function. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of glycation on the structure and function of skeletal muscle myosin. Myosin was incubated for up to 30 minutes with glucose and subsequently tested for structural and functional modifications by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry and a single fiber in vitro motility assay, respectively. MALDI spectra revealed glycation-related structural alterations as evidenced by disappearance of specific Lys-C proteolysis products and appearance of higher mass peaks that are attributed to crosslinking by glucose. This change was paralleled by a significant reduction in in vitro motility speed, suggesting a structure-related decline in myosin mechanics in response to glucose exposure. There is complete reversal of motility speed after reaction with the Schiff base-cleaving agent hydroxylamine hydrochloride.\nGlutathione (GSH) is an abundant tripeptide in skeletal muscle and is known for its antioxidant function and ability to protect cells from toxicity of xenobiotics. Earlier studies have suggested that abundant thiol compounds may inhibit the process of glycation. In order to understand the effect of GSH on glycated myosin function, we used a single fibre in vitro motility assay. Myosin function responded to glucose exposure in a dose-dependent manner, i.e., motility speeds were reduced by 10, 34, and 90% of pre-incubation values after 30 minutes exposure to 1, 3 and 6 mM glucose concentration, respectively. The 30-minute 6 mM glucose incubation was followed by a 20-minute 10 mM GSH incubation. After glucose exposure (0.10 \u00b1 0.07 ?m/s, n=3), GSH treatment restored (p<0.001) motility (0.98 \u00b1 0.06 ?m/s, n=3) close to pre-incubation levels (1.12 \u00b1 0.06 ?m/s, n=3). \nAntibodies against Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGEs) were used to quantify the amount of AGEs in SOL and EDL muscle cross sections from male and female Wistar rats of 5 different age-groups (3-6 months, 11-12 months, 16-19 months, 20-25 months and 27-30 months).  Confocal microscopy was used to detect the primary anti-AGE-RNAse antibody. Intracellular AGEs showed a significant increase (p<0.001) in both SOL and EDL muscles of males and females across age groups. However, sarcolemmal AGE formation was significant (p<0.05) across age-groups only in the fast-twitch EDL muscle of male rats. Immunoblotting showed myosin along with 2 other proteins of ~57 kD, to be glycated in all age groups of both muscle types in both the sexes. Cross sections were double labelled for Type I and Type IIA fiber types in EDL and SOL muscles respectively. The increase in AGEs was irrespective of fiber type in both SOL and EDL muscles. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [862], "author_name_tesi": "Ramamurthy, Bhagavathi ", "last_name_ssi": "Ramamurthy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bhagavathi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Farrell", "Sally Johnson", "James Harold Marden", "Charles H Lang", "Lars Larsson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Farrell, Committee Member", "Sally Johnson, Committee Member", "James Harold Marden, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Lars Larsson, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["aging", "glutathione", "myosin", "glycation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "USING DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION TO IMPROVE BLOOD SUPPLY CHAIN\n", "id": "12435", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "439", "abstract_tesi": "Blood Supply chain is a very complicated and interesting problem as it\u2019s a costly commodity and its wastage is undesirable.

This thesis deals with minimizing the shortage and wastage of blood units by maintaining an optimal amount of safety stock in the system. \n  \nIn this thesis, various critical parameters that affect the blood supply chain like Lead time, Safety stock level and Hold time were studied and an optimal safety stock level was obtained for each blood type. The safety stock level was focused on minimizing the blood shortage and wastage. This thesis also compares three issuing policies Last in First out, First in Last out and Expiry first. The performance of all three of the policies was evaluated based on the shortage and wastage of blood units. The thesis uses simulation as a tool to compares the effect of future increase in demand, Lead time and inter-arrival time. The system was observed for variation in safety stock level as the demand, lead time and inter-arrival time increased while other parameters were constant.\n\nFrom the simulation results it was found out that Expiry first always outperformed the FIFO and LIFO policies. It was noted that Lead Time has critical influence in system performance. The lesser the lead time the effect of other parameters in the system is significantly low.

The surface charge and zeta potential developed by the suspended particles could be a driving factor in this process. To study the mechanism behind the deposition of suspended magnetite on stainless steel, laboratory-scale experiments were carried out under a range of standard boiler water chemistry, simulating fouling experienced in boiler units. A high-temperature\u2013high-pressure electrophoretic deposition cell with provisions to test deposition on metal substrates has been developed. The trends in the deposition processes for the various chemistry were validated using visual observations, surface microscopy, and in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). A three-electrode assembly design was developed to carry out the in situ electrochemical measurements in various boiler water environments. The experimental setup was successfully used to test boiler water chemistry at 300\u00b0C (572\u00b0F) and 10 MPa (1450 psi). The chemistry tested included all-volatile treatment (AVT; oxidizing and reducing using hydrazine), caustic treatment (CT), phosphate treatment (PT), and a filming amine (GE HRSG-02). In addition, the effect of particle size on the deposition process was studied. \n\nThe experimental results have been explained using established principles of suspended oxide behavior in aqueous environments. The results indicated that the presence of suspended magnetite particles at a pH25\u00b0C = 9.3, controlled by ammonium hydroxide, caused the particles to aggressively deposit on the stainless steel surface. On the other end of the AVT spectrum, when tested at pH25\u00b0C = 9.8, no visually observable deposits were found on the surface of the steel. Operating close to the point of zero charge of magnetite at 300 \u00b0C resulted in deposition and moving away from the point of zero charge mitigated deposition. In case of the caustic treatment and phosphate treatment, it was seen that the compression of the double layer due to the additional electrolytes in the system could influence the deposition process even when the pH of the system was away from the point of zero charge of magnetite at 300\u00b0C. No significant influence of hydrazine was observed on the deposition of magnetite. Impedance spectroscopy was successfully used in these tests to identify in situ the cases where deposition occurred. \nThe filming amine chemistry did not mitigate deposition completely, but the presence of the HRSG-02 affected the nature of deposits observed on the substrate. Macroscopically the substrate appeared to be covered with deposits and some darker regions. The results of the filming amine study point to possible interactions between the amine-substrate and amine-magnetite. Increasing the particle size distribution clearly showed a decrease in the deposition even though the boiler water chemistry was conducive for deposition. Although, controlling the particle size is not an option for utility boilers, these tests provide further insight into understanding deposition at high temperatures in boiler type environments. \nIn addition to experimental results, the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory has been used to model the behavior of the suspended particles under the AVT boiler water chemistry regime. The DLVO interaction energy curves and the calculated agglomeration probabilities support the experimental observations regarding the deposition of magnetite under the AVT regime. Such calculations can be extended to other treatment chemistries as well providing means to predict the behavior of suspended particles in boiler water.  \nIn summary, this study has clearly established a link between the solution chemistry at 300 \u00b0C (572 \u00b0F) to the deposition of magnetite on 304 SS. The results show that the zeta potential, which is influenced by the pH of the solution, could be the major factor dictating the susceptibility of deposition at these conditions. EIS was used successfully to establish that magnetite deposition results in high values (> 106 \u03a9) of the magnitude of the impedance. Although qualitative, this could provide valuable information when monitoring boilers and power plants for deposition. These results also proved the success of the experimental setup developed in this project for simulating the boiler environments of interest and for studying the deposition phenomena commonly faced in boilers. This study is a one of a kind study focusing purely on the particle attachment aspect of deposition across a wide range of boiler water treatment chemistries with the results supported by surface analyses, impedance spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14649], "author_name_tesi": "Raman, Balaji ", "last_name_ssi": "Raman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Balaji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Serguei N Lvov", "Serguei N.

Local governments find it difficult to manage this space and satisfy the demands of their citizens. To increase their efficiency, local governments are adopting information technologies under initiatives branded as e-government.  Citizens groups are seeking action spaces to solve local problems triggered by global trends and often see information and communication technologies (ICT) as part of the solution. This raises interesting questions about the role of ICTs in urban civic life in developing countries. How are ICTs used in citizen-government interactions? How does local political context influence technology use among citizens? What factors facilitate or inhibit use of ICTs in local government? Do ICTs facilitate greater citizen involvement in local government? Do they strengthen governance and deepen democracy? \nThis research examines the impact of ICTs on the civic lives of people in Bangalore City, the information capital of India. It analyzes the e-government efforts of the local government in Bangalore, the Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BMP), and studies the efforts of Janaagraha, a citizen\u2019s group, to facilitate participatory democracy among Bangaloreans. \nIn this dissertation, I examine what e-government means in the context of Bangalore. To understand why only specific services are available and how people use these e-government services, I compare the visions and interpretations of \u2018e-government\u2019 from the perspectives of the officials involved and survey citizens of Bangalore city. The policy on e-government makes it clear that the government expects ICT usage to promote better service provision and facilitate democratic outreach between government and citizens.  I demonstrate that there is a gap between how officials and citizens view e-government. Among officials a managerial model dominates over participatory democratic possibilities where as citizens see it as a failed effort to reach out and promote citizen involvement due to entrenched government culture, lack of committed personnel, and lack of trust.\nResults suggest that the democratic potential of the Internet has been marginalized. An executive-driven, \"managerial\" business model of citizen-government interaction has assumed dominance at the expense of participatory democratic possibilities. Efficiency concerns drive reliance on digital government in a top down process, with citizen demand not being considered an important factor. The focus has been on the \u2018e\u2019 rather than on basic governance that reaches the average citizen.\nTo understand how information technology might help citizen participation in governance, I analyze Public Record of Operations and Finance (PROOF). This initiative is an example of how computerization of information management in local administration has helped Bangaloreans engage with their local government. The strategies through which citizens of Bangalore have been able to participate more in local government and the role ICTs have played in those strategies is examined through the related Ward Works initiative. Ward Works is an initiative that allows citizens to participate in prioritizing, monitoring and evaluating works undertaken by the local government in their wards.\nThe successful PROOF and Ward Works initiatives are a case of IT interacting with the structure and process of local government in tandem with civic action. Their success can be attributed to collaboration between citizens, and between citizens, BMP officials and corporators. Their distinguishing characteristic is the civic engagement component. Greater availability of information is not a sufficient condition to promote citizen participation. Conscious efforts are necessary to highlight what information is available and how it can be useful to citizens who want to participate in governance. \nWhat are some of the findings of this research? While the state government has discouraged decentralization and sharing of power in practice, citizens groups have been able to take advantage of a simple computerization process within local government to gain more space for participation in governance. PROOF and Ward Works were successful because considerable energy was spent in mobilizing existing neighborhood organizations and resident welfare associations to generate resources locally. These initiatives indicate that community leaders who identify and engage efficient government administrators are catalysts to reform. Local government officials are intricately embedded in local social relations and will respond to community pressure if it is backed by political leaders at a higher level.  Civic engagement is most successful in communities that have both strong bonding capital and key individuals who provide bridges to other groups. Strong bonding capital alone is detrimental to groups when they attempt to solve larger issues relevant to everyone in the community. While education and information seem to motivate citizen engagement, wealth does not seem to encourage collective action. It appears to encourage individuals to seek solutions on their own rather than rely on the community.\nThe particular contribution of this research is an empirical examination of the role of ICTs in citizens\u2019 civic and political engagement in the context of a city that serves as a technology hub in a developing country.  It is clear that the role of information technology in the political engagement process can vary across governments. In Bangalore, the IT capital of India and information hub of Karnataka, digital divide is still severe enough to make traditional forms of IT use in the governance process, such as email, online consultation and feedback generation, impractical. IT is a factor that facilitates transparency and allows administrators to be accountable if they choose to share information with the citizens. IT is still not the key factor that encourages citizen participation in governance. However, IT can alter information flows that can be used by citizens to participate in governance.\nIndia is currently undergoing changes in government philosophies and is becoming more responsive to governance with citizens participation. Innovative information technology use could facilitate citizen participation. This research highlights that changes need to occur in all areas: within government, among citizens and in the attitudes of all stakeholders towards the role of information technology and its innovative uses. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6446], "author_name_tesi": "Raman, Veena V", "last_name_ssi": "Raman", "middle_name_ssi": "V", "first_name_ssi": "Veena", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Karl Davis", "Prof Jorge R Schement", "Mary Beth Oliver", "Richard Denny Taylor", "Dr. Christopher Benner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Karl Davis, Committee Chair", "Prof Jorge R Schement, Committee Chair", "Mary Beth Oliver, Committee Member", "Richard Denny Taylor, Committee Member", "Dr. Christopher Benner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["participatory democracy", "Information technology", "Bangalore City"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "SOFT ERRORS IN LOGIC CIRCUITS:\nANALYSIS AND MODELING\n\n\n", "id": "7462", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5413", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soft errors in data paths are gaining importance as technology scales down,\nbecause of increased speed, the number of stages in pipelines, and the decrease in device\nsizes and supply voltages.

Given previous findings linking dispositional optimism with successful behavioral, psychological, and physical outcomes after adverse events, disease, and injuries, the current study aimed to examine the relationships between psychiatric symptoms, cognitive ability, and personality factors in predicting functional outcome following moderate and severe TBI.  More specifically, it was expected that dispositional optimism would predict long-term functional outcome following TBI.

Furthermore, the data indicate that dispositional optimism predicts psychological distress, rather than functional outcome.  These findings illustrate that higher levels of dispositional optimism in individuals sustaining moderate to severe TBI is related to better psychological, cognitive, and functional outcomes and that this personality trait may be a useful predictor of psychological distress following TBI.

This approach was unsuccessful in solving the CO poisoning problem, possibly due to the tendency of the carbon molecular sieves to concentrate CO and CO2 in pore walls.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5404], "author_name_tesi": "Ramanathan, Ramnarayanan ", "last_name_ssi": "Ramanathan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ramnarayanan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk", "Chunshan Song", "Digby D Macdonald", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Chair", "Chunshan Song, Committee Member", "Digby D Macdonald, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["split pool", "electrocatalysis", "combinatorial chemistry", "catalysis", "physical intuition", "directed sorting"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "An Investigation on the Deicing of Helicopter Blades using Shear Horizontal Guided Waves", "id": "6501", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5415", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-11-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite all the advances that have made air travel safer than ever, the accumulation of ice on airplane and rotorcraft wings continues to be one of aviation\u2019s most challenging problems.  Ice accumulates on the wings as an aircraft flies through icing clouds. Icing clouds contain water droplets suspended in a super cooled, unstable liquid state.  Water droplets in an icing cloud remain suspended in the liquid state as long as there is no surface for them to crystallize on.  When this state is disturbed, such as when an aircraft passes through, the droplets freeze.  In-flight ice buildup is a serious issue for propeller aircraft and rotorcraft, which fly at altitudes where icing clouds are likely to be found.  The formation of ice on engines, wings and propellers of airplanes, and helicopter blades can seriously degrade the safety of an aircraft.  In addition to losing aerodynamic lift, the rotor-blade can become unbalanced if the ice sheds unevenly causing dangerous vibratory loads on the system.  Hence the presence of a reliable and efficient deicing or anti-icing system is imperative for their safe operation.\nThe current method used to deice helicopter blades is similar to that available in automobile rear windows.  These electro-thermal systems consist of heating coils that run along the span or chord of the rotor-blade.  A current source connected via a slip ring configuration heats the coils, which in turn melt the ice on the surface.  Due to their enormous power consumption, electro-thermal systems are generally configured to deice one foot of one blade at a time.  This makes it hazardous to fly the helicopters under severe icing conditions.  Even with the energy saving deicing procedure the electrical power required substantially exceeds the normal helicopter electrical system capacity, necessitating a large secondary electrical system with redundant, dual alternator features.  The electro-thermal system for the Bell 412 helicopter weighed 162 lbs and required 26 kW of power for 2 blades!  \nVarious types of deicing systems were compared in chapter 1 and electro-mechanical systems were found to be the most energy efficient and practical for in-flight conditions.  A novel approach of breaking the ice-substrate bonds by exceeding their adhesive strength using guided shear horizontal waves was chosen as the deicing mechanism.  A comparison of the different electro-mechanical actuation systems pointed towards monolithic shear mode piezoelectric actuators as the choice that would satisfy the energy and dimensional requirements.  \nA survey of literature on the mechanics of ice adhesion, in chapter 2, led to the selection of 1.42MPa as the target adhesive bond strength for the refrigerated ice-aluminum interface.  The static adhesive strength of naturally occurring forms of ice such as rime ice and glaze ice to aluminum (0.12MPa and 0.4MPa respectively) is much lower than that of the refrigerated ice-aluminum adhesive strength (1.42MPa).  Therefore, selecting the static adhesive strength of the refrigerated ice-aluminum interface as the bond strength to overcome would enable the system to deice rotor-blades under natural icing conditions.  \nEquivalent circuit analysis was applied to the actuator, aluminum plate and ice layer system to determine an expression for the shear stress at the ice aluminum interface per unit excitation voltage supplied to the actuator and the corresponding electrical power consumed.  All the parameters that affected the stress at the ice-aluminum interface were identified from the equivalent circuit model of the system.  The parameters were split into control (can be actively changed by user) parameters and material (no user control over the variation of these parameter due to temperature and electric field) parameters.  A statistical approach (Design of Experiments) was used to determine the control parameter settings that resulted in the maximum shear stress at the ice aluminum interface per unit actuator excitation voltage.  \n\tA material parameter design of experiments was carried out to determine the effect of the deviation in the variable parameters on the stress at the ice-aluminum interface and actuator power consumption. A simplified approach to calculate the shear piezoelectric actuator losses under high excitation fields was presented.  The experimental results indicated that the adhesive shear strength of the ice-aluminum bond under high frequency dynamic loads is much lower that its static adhesive strength.  This was proved by the fact that the ice-aluminum interface bonds were broken at stress values of 0.73MPa as opposed to the target 1.42Mpa.  This can be attributed to inherently stochastic nature of ice and the fact that the ice-aluminum bond fails at a much lower stress under dynamic loading as opposed to static loading.  \nThe shear mode actuator has a projected power consumption of 0.6kW for the twin bladed Bell 412 (assuming 6 actuators per foot per blade each consuming 50W) if deiced by station as opposed to 26kW for a corresponding electro-thermal system.  The shear mode actuator has a projected power consumption of 3.6kW if both blades are deiced simultaneously over the desired length (1/3rd span from the root) as required in severe icing conditions.  The piezoelectric shear mode actuation system (estimated weight of 50 lbs with the actuators themselves accounting for less than 1 lb.) has the potential of delivering this performance while being 70% lighter than a comparable electro-thermal system (weight of 162 lbs).  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5408], "author_name_tesi": "Ramanathan, Srinivasan ", "last_name_ssi": "Ramanathan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Srinivasan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vasundara V Varadan", "Vasundara V Varadan", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "K A Jose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vasundara V Varadan, Committee Chair", "Vasundara V Varadan, Committee Chair", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Member", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Member", "K A Jose, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["piezoelectric actuators", "shear horizontal guided waves", "helicopter blades", "deicing system", "acoustics", "equivalent circuit"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Processing and Characterization of Mist deposited Patterned Quantum dot thin films", "id": "9802", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6019", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this project, a study on the mist-deposited quantum dot films for novel inorganic display applications is carried out.

These quantum dots are dispersed in toluene, an organic solvent. Conventionally, these quantum dots are deposited on the glass substrates by spin-coating or electro-phoretic deposition (similar to electroplating). But these methods do not provide a way to pattern these quantum dot films, because, the etch chemistries of QDs have not been fully developed yet. In this study, a technique of mist deposition is used to deposit the quantum dots on the masked glass and flexible substrates. Films thus obtained are characterized by means of their surface morphology (using AFM, SEM), and the QD-LEDs fabricated are investigated. Devices have been built and demonstrated using this deposition technique and the results prove possible applications in Nanophotonics and Optoelectronics.

Frequent occurrence of these clouds, especially in the spring and autumn\ntransition seasons and winter, is well documented. Observations reveal that these\nextensive stratus layers can persist for days, contributing significantly to the Arctic\u2019s\nsurface energy balance. Because Arctic stratus clouds can influence the freezing and\nmelting rates of Arctic sea ice, there exists a possible link between the dwindling Arctic\nsea ice extent and Arctic cloudiness.\nEven though mixed-phase clouds are prevalent and play a vital part in the Arctic\nenvironment, many details about their life cycle are not well understood. This limited\nunderstanding, caused by the dearth of observations, poses major challenges when\nrepresenting these clouds in large-scale models. To address these deficiencies the\nDepartment of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program\nfunded the Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (M-PACE) field campaign. Because\nM-PACE data contain detailed measurements of a wide range of mixed-phase cloud\nscenes, including both single and multilayered clouds, this data set is in wide use.\nAlthough multilayered mixed-phase clouds are fairly common in the Arctic, the\nmajority of past studies focused on single layer mixed-phase clouds. The relative\nsimplicity of single layer clouds and the availability of data on them may have led to a\npreference for their study over multilayered clouds. Besides complicated atmospheric\nstructure in multilayered clouds, obtaining data containing sufficient information about\nall of the cloud layers can be a challenge. For example, low-lying liquid layers can\ncompletely attenuate lidar signals. The microwave radiometer-derived liquid water path\n(LWP) is an integral quantity; therefore, additional information is needed to vertically\ndistribute the liquid, but this information is usually unavailable. The vertically pointing\ncloud radar Doppler velocity spectra data can contain information about several cloud\nlayers above the radar, but the unavailability of techniques to deconvolve spectra has\nlimited the value of these data.\nThis dissertation explores the use of Doppler radar velocity spectra to identify and\ncharacterize hydrometeor populations in multilayered Arctic mixed-phase clouds on\niv\nOctober 6, 2004. A 35-GHz cloud radar located at Barrow, Alaska, during the M-PACE\ncollected the Doppler spectra. The analyses were centered on two cloud layers that were\nidentified using the smallest hydrometeor velocity, a quantity derived from the Doppler\nspectra. Data from a pair of depolarization lidars operating near the radar confirmed the\npresence of liquid in these two cloud layers, which were embedded in ice precipitation\noriginating from higher clouds. The hydrometeor populations in the radar sample\nvolumes, the cloud particle phases were separated via multiple peaks in the Doppler\nvelocity spectra.\nThe persistent nature of the bimodality in the ice phase was employed in spectrally\nseparating two distinct ice hydrometeor populations that were present in many of the\nsample volumes: ice formed within (new ice) and above (background ice) the two cloud\nlayers. The comparison of ice fall velocity versus radar reflectivity relations derived for\ndistinct ice showers falling through the two cloud layers suggested that riming and\naggregation caused variability in background ice. Analyses of the fall velocity and\nreflectivity characteristics of the columnar new ice crystals revealed that riming was more\ndominant than aggregation.\nTo asses these results, we analyzed in-situ data from multiple sensors collected later\non the same day. The data revealed that riming and aggregation were frequently observed\nin background ice crystals, confirming what was indicated in the remote sensing data.\nThe main finding in the in-situ analyses was frequent occurrence of drizzle in the mixedphase\nclouds later in the day. The remote sensing data from the first analyses period did\nnot indicate drizzle. This warranted the reexamination of the radar Doppler spectra and\nlidar data to determine why drizzle was not detected in the multi-peak spectral analyses.\nThe reanalysis demonstrated that the two mixed-phase cloud layers were drizzling at\nearlier times. However, with the progression of time an ice precipitating cloud layer\nhigher up advected over the embedded clouds. The embedded clouds experienced less\ncloud-top radiative cooling because of the longwave emissions by the higher cloud and at\nthe same time the background ice precipitation removed liquid from both embedded\nclouds. Since liquid is essential for longwave cooling at cloud top, which drives the\ncloud\u2019s circulations, its reduction caused weaker downdraft and updraft motions. As the\ncloud circulations weakened the two embedded clouds decoupled and drizzle production\nv\nceased. Therefore, drizzle was not identified in the multi-peak spectra during our\nanalysis.\nThe spectral analyses also provided a glimpse into the ice formation in the embedded\nclouds. Ice originating in the embedded clouds was detectable only after the background\nice was present inside the clouds; this suggests secondary ice production. Since\nconditions needed for rime-splintering were present in the embedded clouds the\nformation of new ice in the embedded clouds was attributed to this mechanism.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4296], "author_name_tesi": "Rambukkange, Mahlon P", "last_name_ssi": "Rambukkange", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Mahlon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Johannes Verlinde", "Johannes Verlinde", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux", "Jerry Y Harrington", "Kultegin Aydin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Johannes Verlinde, Dissertation Advisor", "Johannes Verlinde, Committee Chair", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Committee Member", "Jerry Y Harrington, Committee Member", "Kultegin Aydin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rime-splintering", "Doppler veloctiy spectra", "Mixed-phase cloud"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Multidisciplinary Applications of U.S. Soils Datasets: Machine Learning Models, Data Mining, and Land Use Analyses", "id": "13705amr418", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13705", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "U.S. efforts to understand and map soils have revolutionized the understanding of soil genesis, morphology, classification, behavior and mapping of soil. With one of the largest publicly available soils datasets in the world, the value of soils information continues to extend to many aspects of society such as agriculture, tax assessment, the design and construction of highways and buildings, and land management. With a growing human population, soil is being subject to increasing demands for food, energy and water. This has resulted in extensive soil erosion, where soil is degrading faster than it is naturally replenished. Current agricultural practices are therefore a threat to soil natural resources. In order to assess and manage changing demands on soil natural resources, soil data must adapt to new computational tools that can provide knowledge for decision-makers and stakeholders to preserve soil resources. This dissertation harnesses a high performance computational environment to change the design and application of U.S. national soil datasets. First, we demonstrated how the National Characterization Soil Survey (NCSS) database can be used to create a machine-learning pedotransfer function (PTF) to predict soil bulk density \u2013 a crucial soil variable often missing in soil databases. The results of a 5\u2012fold cross-validation showed that the average root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) was 0.13 g cm-3, and the mean prediction error (MPE) was -0.001 g cm-3. Performance of the PTF was also illustrated by estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks for four representative pedons across a temperature-precipitation gradient; these estimates were within 5% of measured SOC stocks. Second, we demonstrated how existing soil legacy datasets: the NCSS database, the National Soil Information System (NASIS), the gridded soil survey (gSSURGO), and the Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA) databases, can be used in a high performance computing system to create 100 meter spatial soil class and property maps. We overlaid and merged soil point data with soil characteristics extracted from gSSURGO, terrain attribute layers to describe the land surface, maps describing vegetation indices and land surface temperature derived from MODIS land surface satellite data, climatic and hydrologic datasets, to construct models of soil classes and properties using data mining algorithms. Ten-fold cross validation was used to calculate the performance metrics of the models. The average R2 for soil property models was 72%, while the soil class models had on average 37% out-of-bag prediction error. We then showed that these models could be used to extend predictions to the conterminous U.S. using environmental predictors with exhaustive coverage. Third, we used the NCSS database in land use analyses to assess the on-field environmental impacts of a double cropping system that provides for both food and biomass production from agricultural cropland in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Simulating different combinations of soil, fertilizer, harvest and location scenarios (n = 144), we quantified trade-offs among producing a low carbon energy source, improving soil carbon, and reducing nitrogen losses. Results showed that benefits to soil carbon, biomass yields, and in many cases profitability will be greater if winter crops are fertilized, resulting in trade-offs between these benefits and nitrogen losses.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14388], "author_name_tesi": "Ramcharan, Amanda Maria", "last_name_ssi": "Ramcharan", "middle_name_ssi": "Maria", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas L.

Initial research had identified that owner organizations were still trying to manage the quality of essential facilities information generated, documented over the course of a project and delivered at its completion.\nThis research established a procedure for planning the quality assurance and control for facilities information handover.

The West Antarctic Rift System has thinner crust, consistent with crustal thickness beneath other Cretaceous rifts. The Transantarctic Mountains show thickening of the crust from the costal regions towards the interior of the mountain range, and high velocities in the lower crust at several locations, possibly resulting from the Ferrar magmatic event. Ross Island and Marie Byrd Land Dome have elevated crustal Vp/Vs ratios, suggesting the presence of partial melt and/or volcaniclastic material within the crust. \nThe pattern of seismic anisotropy in Madagascar is complex and cannot arise solely due to mantle flow from the African superplume, as previously proposed. To explain the complex pattern of anisotropy, a combination of mechanisms needs to be invoked, including mantle flow from the African superplume, mantle flow from the Comoros hotspot, small scale upwelling in the mantle induced by lithospheric delamination, and fossil anisotropy in the lithospheric mantle along Precambrian shear zones.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14404], "author_name_tesi": "Ramirez, Cristo ", "last_name_ssi": "Ramirez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cristo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Andrew Nyblade", "Dr. Andrew Nyblade", "Dr. Charles Ammon", "Dr. Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Dr. Victor Sparrow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr. Andrew Nyblade, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr. Andrew Nyblade, Committee Chair", "Dr. Charles Ammon, Committee Member", "Dr. Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Committee Member", "Dr. Victor Sparrow, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Antarctica", "Receiver functions", "Crustal structure", "Madagascar", "Shear wave splitting", "Mantle dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF WAR ON OCCUPATIONAL OUTCOMES: A CASE STUDY OF THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR", "id": "12978dnr126", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12978", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines the long term effects of the Spanish Civil War on educational and occupational outcomes.

A constant pressure, constant flow, showerhead, plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) process has been developed to fabricate high mobility TFTs and circuits on rigid and flexible substrates at 200 \u00b0C. ZnO films and resulting devices prepared by PEALD and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) have been compared. Both PEALD and PLD ZnO films result in densely packed, polycrystalline ZnO thin films that were used to make high performance devices. PEALD ZnO TFTs deposited at 300 \u00b0C have a field-effect mobility of ~ 40 cm2/V-s (and > 20 cm2/V-S deposited at 200 \u00b0C). PLD ZnO TFTs, annealed at 400 \u00b0C, have a field-effect mobility of > 60 cm2/V-s (and up to 100 cm2/V-s). \n\nDevices, prepared by either technique, show high gamma-ray radiation tolerance of up to 100 Mrad(SiO2) with only a small radiation-induced threshold voltage shift (VT ~ -1.5 V). Electrical biasing during irradiation showed no enhanced radiation-induced effects. The study of the radiation effects as a function of material stack thicknesses revealed the majority of the radiation-induced charge collection happens at the semiconductor-passivation interface. A simple sheet-charge model at that interface can describe the radiation-induced charge in ZnO TFTs. \n\nBy taking advantage of the substrate-agnostic process provided by PEALD, due to its low-temperature and excellent conformal coatings, ZnO electronics were monolithically integrated with thin-film complex oxides. Application-based examples where ZnO electronics provide added functionality to complex oxide-based devices are presented. In particular, the integration of arrayed lead zirconate titanate (Pb(Zr, Ti)O3 or PZT) thin films with ZnO electronics for microelectromechanical systems (MEMs) and deformable mirrors is demonstrated. ZnO switches can provide voltage to PZT capacitors with fast charging and slow discharging time constants. Finally, to circumvent fabrication challenges on predetermined complex shapes, like curved mirror optics, a technique to transfer electronics from a rigid substrate to a flexible substrate is used. This technique allows various thin films, regardless of their deposition temperature, to be transferred to flexible substrates. \n\nFinally, ultra-low power operation of ZnO TFT gas sensors was demonstrated. The ZnO ozone sensors were optimized to operate with excellent electrical stability in ambient conditions, without using elevated temperatures, while still providing good gas sensitivity. This was achieved by using a post-deposition anneal and by partially passivating the contact regions while leaving the semiconductor sensing area open to the ambient. A novel technique to reset the gas sensor using periodic pulsing of a UV light over the sensor results in less than 25 milliseconds recovery time. A pathway to achieve gas selectivity by using organic thin-film layers as filters deposited over the gas sensors tis demonstrated.  The ZnO ozone sensor TFTs and the UV light operate at room temperature with an average power below 1 \u00b5W. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11219], "author_name_tesi": "Ramirez, Jose Israel", "last_name_ssi": "Ramirez", "middle_name_ssi": "Israel", "first_name_ssi": "Jose", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Suman Datta", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["zno", "thin film transistors (TFT)", "large-area electronics", "radiation-hard ZnO TFTs", "integration of ZnO electronics with PZT films"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Self-assembly of Polloids: From Flattened Colloids to Strong and Flexible Chains", "id": "16257", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8042", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The field of colloidal science has been exploited for decades due to the intriguing properties and versatile applicability of colloids in numerous natural and industrial processes.

In this dissertation, \u201ccolloidal monomers\u201d are spontaneously self-assembled into strong and flexible chains through a designed particle-binding mechanism that is tunable.  No external force field is applied during the assembly process.  These colloidal polymers \u2013 polloids \u2013 aim to study the dynamics and polymerization of real polymers that exhibit both durable and reversible bonds.  \nThe monomers in polloids consist of micron-size particles with a small physical deformation, a localized flat region.  By tuning the ionic strength of the solution, a flat region on one particle can preferentially bond to either the flat region or the spherical part of another particle.  The increase in the effective interaction area strengthens the bond into a deep secondary energy minimum, where a thin layer of fluid lies in between the two particles and allows full bond rotation.  The main contributions of this research are 1) a DLVO model that predicts the interparticle potential as a function of separation distance between two particles facing flat-flat, flat-sphere or sphere-sphere, the latter being the usual DLVO potential, 2) a controlled technique to create localized flat regions on spherical colloids with a model that predicts the growth of the flat radius with time, 3) the three-dimensional visualization of polloids in solution mimicking polymers, and 4) the data analysis showing how the distribution of chain length and weight follow closely classical condensation polymerization.

Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), previous studies have found that adolescents who report same- or both-sex attraction are more likely to engage in non-violent delinquency (Conover-Williams 2014) and are more likely to have contact with the criminal justice system compared with their sexual majority peers (Himmelstein and Br\u00fcckner 2011).

I examine whether respondents\u2019 answers to a sexual identity question asked in latter waves of the survey lead to different conclusions regarding the role of sexual orientation on crime than previously reported in the literature. I also address how gender and race/ethnicity affect the role of sexual orientation on crime to move beyond analyzing sexual minorities as a monolithic population. In contrast to previous findings, results suggest that being sexual minority tends to be negatively associated with delinquency. In particular, sexual minority boys have much lower odds of engaging in violent and non-violent delinquency compared with their sexual majority peers. Even when results show a positive association between sexual orientation and delinquency, the magnitude of the effects is attenuated using the new operationalization of sexual minority status. Thus, previous findings appear to have erroneously reported a positive relationship between sexual minority status and delinquency due a reliance on an inaccurate indicator of sexual orientation. Last, I find that patterns of delinquent involvement are susceptible to different configurations of sexual, gender, and ethnic/racial identities.

The inner edge is defined by the initiation of a wet stratosphere followed by escape of water to space, whereas the location of the outer edge is determined by the maximum greenhouse effect of CO2. Previous calculations have shown that a conservative estimate of the habitable zone is relatively wide at ~0.95-1.67 AU (Kasting et al., 1993). A wide habitable zone facilitates the search for extraterrestrial life because the probability of finding potentially habitable planets increases, relaxing design specifications for observing telescopes. In our own solar system, the solar flux received by early Mars 3.8 Ga is only slightly less than that predicted at the outer edge, suggesting that the Red Planet may have once been habitable if it contained additional greenhouse gases in its atmosphere. In the case of Earth, our close proximity to the inner edge implies susceptibility to various climatic catastrophes at elevated temperatures. The calculations of Kasting et al. have become obsolete as line-by-line absorption databases are continually updated with newly discovered lines, leading to increased absorption for key greenhouse gases such as CO2, H2O, CH4, and H2. This suggests that current climate models may just be able to produce warm conditions for early Mars, although it also means that life on Earth may be more vulnerable than previously thought. The aim of this Thesis is to update the 1-D climate model of Kasting et al., derive updated habitable zone boundaries and use them to a) refine the telescopic search for life in exoplanetary systems, b) assess whether early Mars may have once manifested a warm and wet climate, and c) evaluate the implications for the habitability of the Earth as a result of continued increases in CO2. With our new climate model we find: a) that these new absorption databases move the inner edge past the orbit of Earth, demonstrating the inadequacy of 1-D models, b) 5 \u2013 20% H2, along with 1.3 \u2013 4 bar CO2, generates above freezing mean temperatures for early Mars, and c) a runaway greenhouse cannot be triggered from increased fossil fuel emissions.

The quantification of distinct insect-mediated damage types (DT) on fossil leaf assemblages has revealed consistent, long-term patterns of DT richness (DTR) responding to biotic and abiotic disturbance. External feeding is the most abundant and diverse type of leaf damage in living and fossil forests; however, due to mouthpart convergence across various insect lineages, the relation between external-DTR and insect richness (IR) has remained unknown, restricting the use of external-DTR in describing past and extant herbivory. We explore the relation between leaf chewing insect species and external-feeding DTR in two lowland tropical forests in the Republic of Panama. Herbivorous insects feeding on the canopy of dominant plant species at each site were collected, and their induced DTs recorded. A robust, positive correlation between IR and external-DTR was found across host plants at both sites, for the first time linking the number of insect species on a plant-host species to the number of recorded external-DTs. External-DT turnover across plant hosts was found to follow insect species turnover, suggesting that herbivore assemblages are to some extent reflected in external-feeding DT composition in living forests. DTs recorded by multiple insect species in Panama are also the most abundant in two South American Paleogene floras, indicating that abundant DTs in fossil floras underestimate the number of culprit insects, and raising caution for absolute and quantitative estimations of ancient IR. External DT composition is quantifiable in living and fossil forests, and is promising for insect herbivore turnover across host plant species. These findings validate underlying assumptions in fossil-based interpretations of DTR and suggest that external DTR, when used in combination with endophagous and specialized feeding traces (known to usually represent single insect species on single host species), can be a robust proxy for tracking relative changes in IR in the fossil record.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4171], "author_name_tesi": "Ramirez Carvalho, Monica ", "last_name_ssi": "Ramirez Carvalho", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Monica", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Daniel Wilf", "Peter Daniel Wilf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Daniel Wilf, Thesis Advisor", "Peter Daniel Wilf, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["herbivory", "fossil", "canopy crane", "paleoherbivory", "panama"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "UNRAVELING THE FUNCTIONAL MOTIFS OF THE YAN ENHANCER IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER\n", "id": "6074", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1927", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-03-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The organization of eukaryotic genomes can be divided primarily into two regions, those areas that are transcribed and those that regulate transcription.  This thesis focuses on improving our understanding of cis-regulatory modules and how they direct transcription.  To address this issue we used the Drosophila melanogaster yan gene as our model.  The yan gene encodes a general inhibitor of differentiation and proliferation and is expressed dynamically throughout Drosophila development including oogenesis, embryogenesis and the larval central nervous system (CNS) and eye imaginal disc.  We were interested in identifying module elements required for these various stages of expression.  In this work we describe analysis of a 20 Kb genomic region surrounding the first exon of the yan gene.  We show that discrete parts of this genomic region are responsible for specific subportions of the Yan protein expression pattern.  In particular, we isolated a 122 bp fragment that is sufficient to specify yan expression within the developing eye.  In this eye-specific enhancer we identified a number of elements critical to directing yan expression including a boundary element associated with insulator activity.  One such regulatory element requires Su(H), a component of the Notch pathway, for gene transcription.  Experimental data also demonstrated that this activation by the Notch pathway can be negatively modulated by receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling.  Pointed, a nuclear target of the RTK pathway, is able to directly bind to the yan enhancer and compete with Su(H) for DNA binding.  This is one of the first instances where these two pathways have been shown to interact directly in an antagonistic manner.  In summary, this work not only describes the various genomic components necessary for Yan expression throughout development but also provides a mechanism for regulation of yan transcription during eye development. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1909], "author_name_tesi": "Ramos, Edward ", "last_name_ssi": "Ramos", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Edward", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhi Chun Lai", "Andrew G Clark", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "David Scott Gilmour"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Chair", "Andrew G Clark, Committee Member", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Drosphila", "Yan", "Module", "Enhancer", "Gene Regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A DIACHRONIC VARIATIONIST APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF SUBJECT PRONOUN EXPRESSION IN SPANISH: FIRST-PERSON SINGULAR", "id": "13422mar464", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13422", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present dissertation examines first-person singular (1sg) subject pronoun expression\u2014the alternation between yo \u2018I\u2019 and the unexpressed variant\u2014 based on data (N=6,450) drawn from 13th- 20th century Spanish literary texts. Our results reveal no increase in expression rates over time and that, in general, the linguistic conditioning of variable 1sg subject expression has largely remained constant over time.\nFirst, effects of subject continuity are found, with pronominal expression disfavored in contexts of continuity (more accessible referents) and favored in discontinuous contexts (less accessible referents). Three measures of subject continuity\u2014switch reference, human switch reference, and distance\u2014are shown to be applicable. However, subtle signs of change arise by comparing their applicability over time. In particular, the measure of distance from the previous mention of the same referent in the preceding discourse shows a graded effect: as distance increases, assessed in the number of intervening clauses, so progressively does use of pronoun yo. Interestingly, evidence suggests that the graded effect of distance may be developing over time into a more local effect of switch reference with respect to the immediately preceding clause, with pronominal expression especially favored when the subject of the intervening clause has a specific, human referent. \nFurther, the results of this study support the view that an approach merely focused on verb form ambiguity does not provide conclusive answers regarding tense effects on subject expression. Although I found a general favoring effect of morphologically ambiguous verb tenses (with syncretism between first and third person), this is only marginal in contexts of subject continuity. Thus, a synergetic dynamic operates between ambiguity in verb morphology and switch reference: ambiguous verb forms significantly increase subject expression with discontinuous referents. In addition, a mechanical priming effect is shown to be present in all the periods. Thus, the presence of a 1sg pronominal subject enhances the likelihood that the subsequent 1sg coreferential subject is also pronominal. Conversely, when the previous coreferential subject is unexpressed, the likelihood of subject expression diminishes, favoring a subsequent unexpressed 1sg subject.\nFinally, the widely reported effect of cognition verbs, strongly favoring 1sg subject expression in present day varieties, is absent in these data. A usage-based construction grammar approach allows analysis that considers particular lexical items and forms, which reveals the role of prefabs in explaining idiosyncratic usage patterns of yo with specific verb forms and their impact on broad categories (semantic classes). This analysis provides evidence that the cognition verb forms creo and s\u00e9 have undergone changes that can explain present-day usage patterns. The use of yo \u2018I\u2019 with creo \u2018think\u2019, originally \u2018believe\u2019, has increased steadily across time as its meaning has bleached. In parallel, increasing grammaticalization of s\u00e9 \u2018I know\u2019 with a complement clause is observed.

Apples are the second most consumed fresh fruit in the United States.  The causal agent of fire blight is Erwinia amylovora.  Except for streptomycin, there is no registered product that can effectively prevent E. amylovora from infecting apple and pear orchards.  Unfortunately, in the United States, streptomycin-resistant strains of E. amylovora have been found.  A better understanding in general of the molecular genetics of the bacteria could lead not only to a better comprehension of the disease process but also the development of additional reliable management tools.  In this research, three E. amylovora genes were studied:  a regulatory gene called rpoN; and two metabolic genes called argD and pyrC.  I found that the rpoN gene was essential for pathogenicity, for the hypersensitive response in non-host tobacco, and for the expression of the HrpN protein.  The rpoN mutant was prototroph, indicating that the rpoN mutant non-pathogenic phenotype was not due to a defect in basic metabolism or growth.  The argD gene is essential for the biosynthesis of the amino acid arginine in bacteria, including E. amylovora.   E. amylovora argD mutant was an arginine auxotroph and did not cause disease or grow in host tissue.  This study suggests that E. amylovora cannot obtain enough arginine from the host during infection.  The pyrC gene is indispensable for the biosyntheis of pyrimidines.  Surprisingly, even though the E. amylovora pyrC mutant was a uracil auxotroph, it was able to obtain uracil from the host, grow and cause disease.  This study suggests that E. amylovora can obtain and utilize sufficient uracil from the host.  The study of the last two genes gave us an insight about the nutrition requirements that the bacteria have during infection and after infecting the host.  This knowledge could help develop potential fire blight controls.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10214], "author_name_tesi": "Ramos-Sepulveda, Laura ", "last_name_ssi": "Ramos-Sepulveda", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy W Mcnellis", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco", "Beth Krueger Gugino", "Yinong Yang", "Edward G Dudley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy W Mcnellis, Dissertation Advisor", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco, Committee Member", "Beth Krueger Gugino, Committee Member", "Yinong Yang, Committee Member", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Erwinia amylovora", "fire blight", "arginine", "plasmid", "pyrC and rpoN"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Diversity in Question: Inclusionary and Exclusionary Social Interactions Among International Graduate Students", "id": "7981", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1082", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A half-century after the Brown vs. Board of Education decision, segregation remains a prominent issue within the American education system. While segregation was imposed by law prior to the Brown decision in 1954, today self-segregation poses a challenge to the effectiveness of university diversification policies. Most studies of self-segregation have focused primarily on the African American experience within higher education institutions without taking into account the experiences of international college students. The majority of studies on international students' experiences on U.S. college and university campuses have centered primarily on international undergraduates as opposed to international graduate students. This study, in contrast, examines how and why some international graduate students self-segregate and other do not while attending a large public university in the United States. Using Mid-Atlantic University as a case study, I explore this issue employing two main strategies. First, I investigate the sociological rationale behind social interactions among international graduate students, and second, I conduct an in-depth analysis of the extent to which university policies for diversity reinforce specific social tendencies among international graduate students. Following a qualitative methodological approach, I employ the following methods: open-ended interviews, focus groups, interaction chart analysis, and participant observation. In doing so, the present study draws upon, yet challenges, existing theories of cultural and social capital by analyzing the link between tendencies of social interaction and the formation of cultural identities.

The basic concept underlying the approach is a compliant cellular truss, with tendons used as active elements. The members of the truss are connected through compliant joints such that only modest bending moments may be transmitted from one member to another. Actuation is achieved by pulling on one set of cables while controlling the release of another, so that the stability of the structure is maintained in any intermediate position. The tendon-actuated compliant truss can be made to behave locally, and temporarily, as a compliant mechanism, by releasing appropriate cables. As a result, in the absence of aerodynamic forces, the structure can be morphed using relatively low forces. \nA parallel genetic algorithm is developed for the design of unit cells using topology optimization. A \u201cfitness\u201d value is assigned to each candidate structural layout and it is a measure of how well the structure meets the design requirements. The fitness function was formulated to include the morphing capabilities on actuation of the cables, as well as the stability of the structure under external loads. The forces in the cables are optimized to obtain the best match between the morphed structure and the required configuration.  \nA six-noded octahedral unit cell with diagonal tendon actuation was obtained for a bending type deformation of the NASA HECS wing.  Initial cell geometry and orientation is determined by \u201cstrain matching\u201d to the local morphing deformation required by the application. The cell size is dictated by the available space, the morphing strain, and discretization errors in approximating a smooth desired shape. A finite element analysis is performed on a wing made of these unit cells and sized for a representative vehicle weighing 3000 lbs (1360 kg). The weight of the truss wing (without the skin and actuators) was comparable to a conventional stiffened skin construction although its deflections are larger.  Aeroelastic concerns of flutter and divergence can perhaps be addressed through the use of active control. \nAdditional cell topologies using fewer cables are also obtained. A procedure is presented to get an estimate of the size of the compliant joint made of pseudoelastic shape memory alloy given the loads. A compliant joint was designed for a smaller vehicle weighing about a kilogram. A skin system is required that can accommodate large shape changes while carrying and transferring aerodynamic loads. The skin could be designed either using high strain-capable materials or sliding skins could be used. \nAn analysis on the scaling of actuator requirements with aircraft size showed that,  if actuation of the aircraft structure involves the morphing of the wing against the lift forces or if the actuators are in the load path, then the weight of the aircraft can be limited to something in the range of a few kilograms to a few thousands of kilograms. \nThese analyses show that a 3D cellular truss structure can be fairly complex with a large number (18) of cables per unit cell and the area change possible using these structures is limited. Even in-plane actuation of the truss structures involves high actuation forces in the cables resulting in a high actuator weight. This can be addressed pin/compliant joint connected beams to carry the lift loads and the actuating cables then act only against the in-plane loads which are much lower. The genetic algorithm can easily be modified to design such structures. Preliminary results are shown using the algorithm and suggestions are made to improve the results.  \nThis investigation into smoothly morphing aircraft structures has yielded insight into the problem, design procedures and a powerful tool for the design of morphing aircraft structures using cables, truss elements and beams. There are still many challenges to be addressed before they become practical.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1556], "author_name_tesi": "Ramrakhyani, Deepak Shyamlal", "last_name_ssi": "Ramrakhyani", "middle_name_ssi": "Shyamlal", "first_name_ssi": "Deepak", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George A Lesieutre", "Mary I Frecker", "James Harold Marden", "Farhan S Gandhi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George A Lesieutre, Committee Chair", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Chair", "James Harold Marden, Committee Member", "Farhan S Gandhi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Morphing structures", "active structures", "shape change", "compliant joint", "bird wing"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The efficacy of perspective instantiation in improving middle school students' comprehension of informational text\n", "id": "11608", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1070", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-01-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This pretest posttest control group design study investigated whether assigning a perspective to fifth grade (n=74) and sixth grade (n=74) students prior to reading a long informational text would improve their performance on multiple measures of comprehension.

History matching problem can be solved as an optimization or data assimilation problem. In this research, the history matching problem is solved from the optimization point of view. Currently, many commercial history matching tools use evolutionary strategy optimization algorithms such as di\ufb00erential evolution, particle swarm optimization etc. to find solutions of history matching. However, these algorithms usually require a large number of numerical simulation runs in order to converge to acceptable solutions. If each numerical simulation takes an extensive time to complete, these algorithms become ine\ufb03cient. In this research, a new assisted history matching tool named as GP-VARS is presented that can provide multiple solutions of history matching fewer numerical simulations. GP-VARS uses Gaussian process (GP) based proxy models to provide fast approximate forward solutions which are used in Bayesian optimization to find history match solutions in an iterative manner. An application of VARS based sensitivity analysis is applied on forward GP model to calculate the sensitivity index for uncertain reservoir parameters. The results of sensitivity analysis are used to regulate the lower and upper bounds of di\ufb00erent reservoir parameters in order to achieve faster convergence. A second GP model is used to provide an inverse solution which also provides temporary history match solutions. Since the history matching problem has non-unique solutions, the uncertainty in reservoir parameters is quantified using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC ) sampling from the trained forward GP model. The collected MCMC samples are then passed to a third GP model that is trained to predict the EUR values for any combination of reservoir parameters. The GP-VARS methodology is applied to three di\ufb00erent heterogeneous reservoir case studies including a benchmark PUNQ-S3 reservoir located in north sea and the M4.1 reservoir located in Gulf of Mexico. The results show that history matching can be performed in approximately four times less number of numerical simulation runs as compared to the state of the art di\ufb00erential evolution algorithm.

In addition to insect natural enemies, insect pathogenic fungi in the genus Metarhizium can impact insect populations either through application of a formulated product or as a naturally-occurring or conserved biological control agent.  The development of effective biological control, especially through conservation of endemic strains, can contribute to environmental quality and reduced health risks in agricultural systems. Plants influence belowground soil organisms through the release of diverse carbon rich root exudates and Metarhizium has been shown to survive in the rhizosphere of plants. In addition, soil is a major habitat of Metarhizium and soil characteristics such as organic matter, pH and elements such as phosphorus, potassium, calcium etc. are known to affect the habitable niches of Metarhizium.\nTherefore, I focused my research on the impact of cover crops and soil characteristics on Metarhizium with the long-term goal of improving conservation biocontrol. This thesis consists of 3 chapters, focused on understanding the effect of a commonly used production practice \u2013 cover cropping \u2013 and soil characteristics on the detection of Metarhizium robertsii in an organic feed grain system. This thesis reports research conducted from 2013 through 2015 as a component of a larger study to assess the benefits and tradeoffs associated with increasing the diversity of cover crops in an organically-managed feed grain production system. \nIn Chapter 1, I reviewed the scientific literature aimed at understanding the role of Metarhizium as an insect pathogen, its role in pest management in organic systems and the effects of agricultural practices on entomopathogenic fungi. Further, I reviewed literature on cover crops, effects of plant diversity and plant species on the soil microbial community and the impact of soil characteristics on the occurrence of entomopathogenic fungi, and specifically, Metarhizium, in soil.\n \tIn Chapter 2, I investigate the effect of twelve cover crop treatments that vary in species diversity in an organically-managed corn-soybean-wheat rotation on the occurrence of the entomopathogenic fungus, M. robertsii. I consider the effects of the nominal treatments as well as the expressed diversity of a subset of the cover crop mixtures. Cover crops influence entomopathogenic fungi through the release of root exudates which are a source of nutrients for M. robertsii. Because the effects of cover crops may manifest over time, I examine the effects of cover crop biomass from the current year as well as previous fall on detection of M. robertsii. Accordingly, in this chapter, I hypothesized that: 1) cover crops with increasing diversity will result in greater detection and diversity of Metarhizium as compared to cover crop monocultures; 2) cover crop biomass in the fall will be correlated with Metarhizium detection in spring; 3) cash crops will significantly affect Metarhizium detection; and 4) expressed diversity of cover crops will significantly affect Metarhizium detection. Against my expectations, the results revealed no effect of cover crop diversity on detection of Metarhizium. Only one species, M. robertsii, was detected from the experimental site. In addition, the frequency of Metarhizium detection did not vary between monocultures and mixtures comprised of diverse species of cover crops, i.e. polycultures. I suggest that the unexpected results are due to low initial species diversity from the previous long-term effects of conventional management at the research site. Further, I found that plant species (i.e., corn vs soybean) significantly affect Metarhizium detection.  I suggest that this difference in detection between corn and soybean is due to plant identity effects.  Furthermore, my results reveal the existence of legacy effects of the expressed cover crop species biomass in the previous fall on Metarhizium detection in spring. Taken together, my research suggests that the effect of cover crop biomass on M. robertsii detection is not immediate but appears with a time lag. \nIn Chapter 3, I examine the effects of 13 soil characteristics at the experimental site on M. robertsii to determine if particular soil characteristics may be associated with the conservation of this beneficial fungus. Specifically, I hypothesized that labile carbon, gravimetric moisture and electrical conductivity will be negatively related, whereas calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium will be positively related, and elements such as copper, zinc and sulfur and pH will be positively or negatively associated to the detection of Metarhizium. I observed that gravimetric soil moisture, pH and sulfur were positively related to the frequency of detection of Metarhizium. The range of sulfur at our experimental site was within the normal agronomic range for crop production in Pennsylvania soils. The remaining soil characteristics were not instrumental in M. robertsii detection in soil. Thus, my research identifies soil characteristics which could be manipulated by the farmers to conserve M. robertsii in the soil at site.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14583], "author_name_tesi": "Randhawa, Puneet Kaur", "last_name_ssi": "Randhawa", "middle_name_ssi": "Kaur", "first_name_ssi": "Puneet", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Ellen Barbercheck", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco", "Dawn S Luthe", "Nina Ellen Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Ellen Barbercheck, Thesis Advisor", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member", "Nina Ellen Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cover crops", "soil characteristics", "Metarhizium robertsii", "organic feed grain system"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of Dry-Soil Infrared Techniques for Soil Organic Carbon Characterization\n\n\n", "id": "9179", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5230", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) is one of the most important soil quality parameter. It is a proxy for soil organic matter, which influences the physical, chemical and biological properties of the soil. Soil carbon also plays an important role in global C cycle. Understanding the dynamics of SOC is therefore, very important for monitoring soil quality. High density sampling is usually required to capture the spatial variability in SOC of an area which makes costly standard methods highly impractical. The standard procedures for SOC measurement are time consuming and expensive and thus discourage the detailed study of crop-soil management systems. Rapid and relatively in-expensive methods of SOC quantification are needed to improve our understanding of its dynamics and spatial and temporal variability in soils. \nInfrared spectroscopy in combination with multivariate analysis is a technique for rapid and in-expensive quantification of SOC. This technique is non-destructive and preserves the basic integrity of the soil system. It does not require expensive and time consuming sample pre-processing or the use of expensive and environmentally hazardous chemical extractants.  In addition, the method has the potential to be used for determining carbon quality and simultaneously measuring several other soil properties. This ability of spectroscopic technique can be particularly useful in site- specific agriculture (precision agriculture) which requires extensive information on soil properties and conventional laboratory systems are too costly and labor intensive to generate the necessary data. \nDespite an increased interest in infrared spectroscopy especially MIR for measuring soil properties, its utility is not completely understood. There are some inconsistencies in the data and differences in opinions of various researchers about the performance of this technique and its applicability in management systems. The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of different IR techniques to characterize SOC, identify the factors that limit the performance and develop ways to overcome those limitations. Specifically we compared the ability of two infrared regions (near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR)) and also two MIR optical sampling options (diffuse reflectance (DR) and attenuated total reflectance (ATR)). We used samples from three management studies which were very different in terms of diversity to develop SOC calibration models, using partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis.\nIn the first study we compared the ability of MIR and NIR spectroscopy to determine SOC. The accuracy of two methods as judged by root mean squares error of prediction (RMSEP) was similar for the two less diverse study sets (RMSEP = 0.12 - 0.14). For the more diverse study set error was smaller and correlation higher with the MIR region (RMSEP = 0.27) compared to NIR region (RMSEP = 0.31). SOC calibration models did not perform as well for diverse study compared to the other two which indicates that at the errors associated with calibration models depend on the sample set structure. There is a potential to improve the model accuracy in the MIR region by selecting the most relevant spectral regions. Although we could get slight improvement in model accuracy for all sets by eliminating part of the spectrum that was not associated with SOC, we could not get good performing models based just on the organic bands alone. For very diverse data sets, calibration performance can also be improved by using more than one calibration model. This was proved using samples from one study set where better calibration was achieved by using separate models for samples from upper and lower depths. Samples can be divided for separate calibrations either on the basis of known sample information (for example depth or site of sampling) or by performing un-supervised clustering. \nIn general when dealing with a single set of soils, MIR proved to be more efficient than NIR when expressed as the percentage of study samples that are not needed in calibration, and the efficiency of both ranges were better with less diverse data sets. For adapting an existing calibration model to a new site, some samples from a new site have to be included in the updated calibration. We found that if the sample set for which the model was originally developed is diverse or is similar in mineralogy to the new study, lesser number of samples from the new set need to be included in calibration. However, better predictions can be obtained by building calibration model on some samples from that site instead of trying to extend an existing model especially in cases where the new site is more diverse or else is very different from the old site.\nThe second study we evaluated a new optical sampling approach called ATR for SOC quantity and molecular functional group quality determination and compared it with DR. Most of the MIR spectroscopic studies reported in the literature used diffuse reflectance (DR) sampling technique. Although the technique is useful in mineral soils, the high absorbance could be a problem in case of soils very rich in organic matter.  ATR-FTIR technique also has a higher potential to be used in situ. In contrast to most DR instrumentation, the ATR technique involves a sealed optics and therefore is less influenced by the temperature, dust and humidity of the measuring environement.  \nUsing two different types of soil collections we could show that ATR-FTIR calibrations perform nearly as well as DR-FTIR calibrations. The usable MIR spectral range for SOC determination is different for DR and ATR-FTIR. There are still unresolved issues about the best spectral range for quantifications and qualitative analysis of SOC. However two ranges were found to perform well for SOC quantitative analysis (3900-1240, 1750-540 cm-1). The better quality MIR spectral signature in the fingerprint region suggests that ATR may perform better than DR for SOC qualitative analyses. Although our diamond-ATR studies utilized a lab based FTIR, the same instrumental components are found in portable instruments. Since ATR optics is easily sealed we can expect similar so on-site performance as we achieved in the lab.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5208], "author_name_tesi": "Randhawa, Rupinder K", "last_name_ssi": "Randhawa", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Rupinder", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Joseph Archibald", "Douglas D Archibald", "Heather D Karsten", "David Russell Hunter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Joseph Archibald, Thesis Advisor", "Douglas D Archibald, Thesis Advisor", "Heather D Karsten, Thesis Advisor", "David Russell Hunter, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spectroscopy", "Chemometrics", "ATR", "near infrared", "mid-infrared", "Soil organic carbon"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "A Directed Continuum Model of a Columnar Thin Film", "id": "6612", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1055", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As is well known, classical continuum theories fail to adequately describe material behavior as long-range loads or interactions begin to have a significant effect on the overall behavior of the material. For example, when the presence of atoms, grain boundaries, cracks, inclusions, or pores must be considered, the material may no longer conform to the locality requirements of classical continuum theories. One particular example of such a system is a columnar thin film (CTF), which consists of regularly spaced columns (on the scale of tens of nanometers or more in diameter and one or more microns in height) attached to a substrate. This structure may experience loading conditions due to a variety of sources, including the manufacturing process or in use. As a result of the heterogeneous nature of a CTF, the film is influenced by non-local phenomena. A directed continuum theory (also known as Cosserat, micromorphic, or micropolar theory) will be used to capture the non-local behavior of the film, although the directed continuum theory is itself a local theory.\n\nThe analysis in this work begins by establishing the kinematics relationships for a  discrete model, inspired by the physical structure of a CTF, and determining the discrete form of the governing equations. A Taylor series expansion of the displacement terms used in the discrete governing equations is used to obtain a continuous form of the governing equations. This work proposes a strain energy density that, following established directed continuum formulations, yields both the identical set of governing equations (found via the Taylor series) as well as the boundary conditions, i.e., a linear homogeneous boundary value problem (BVP). The BVP is analyzed to gain insight into the relationship between the behavior of the model and the input parameters.

In almost every motor task, there are infinite solutions to accomplish the task goal.  We addressed the questions of how learning influences the utilization of redundancy and whether practice schedules that facilitate the use of redundant solutions enhance learning.  We used a virtual interception task and examined the redundancy at the level of the movement path of the end effector.\n\nIn Experiment 1, we found that there was evidence for utilizing path redundancy even after extensive learning.  Spatial variability in the middle of the path was greater than the variability near the target.  With learning, there was a decrease in path variability throughout the movement path, but with extended learning there was a selective decrease in path variability only near the target.  The structure of the movement variability also indicated that different paths were being used to hit the target.\n\nIn Experiment 2, we addressed the question of whether the ability to flexibly use redundant solutions was influenced by the degree to which redundancy was utilized during practice.  Contrary to expectations, we found that the group with lowest utilization of redundancy during practice was better able to utilize multiple paths to hit the target, indicating that flexibility may be emergent from learning the target location.  Additionally, these results also highlight the importance of the task context in drawing inferences based on analysis of movement variability.\n\nIn Experiment 3, we examined the influence of introducing variability at the task goal level and the execution redundancy level on retention and generalization.  Variability at the task goal level was induced by changing the target location whereas variability at the execution redundancy level was induced by requiring participants to use different movement paths to achieve the same target location.  The results showed that introducing variability at the task goal level led to better performance when the target was in different locations.  However, the manipulation of movement variability at the execution redundancy level did not show any positive effects on retention or generalization.\n\nOverall, the results support the view that skilled performance does not involve consistent repetition of a single movement pattern; instead, multiple solutions are always used to achieve the task goal.  However, an important caveat is that the ability to utilize redundant solutions may be an emergent feature of learning a particular task-relevant parameter.  As a result, practice schedules that explicitly constrain the participant to use different ways to achieve the task goal may not necessarily facilitate learning.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5407], "author_name_tesi": "Ranganathan, Rajiv ", "last_name_ssi": "Ranganathan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rajiv", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell", "Karl Maxim Newell", "Mark Latash", "Dagmar Sternad", "Joseph Paul Cusumano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell, Dissertation Advisor", "Karl Maxim Newell, Committee Chair", "Mark Latash, Committee Member", "Dagmar Sternad, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["redundancy", "variability", "motor learning", "movement path", "interception"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Using Computations to Analyze and Redesign Metabolism", "id": "8855", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5869", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the availability genome-wide datasets for various organisms, research in biology has moved towards a systems-level analysis that portrays a comprehensive picture of cellular physiology.

These uncertainties have been magnified in the context of global supply chains. Most of the Operations Research literature ignores an important component of the system, the Decision Makers (DMs) who run it. This thesis deals with inventory management under risk in the newsvendor model while incorporating the DM's risk preferences. The newsvendor is modeled as being risk averse, risk neutral or risk seeking, collectively referred to as the risk aware newsvendor.\n<br>\nThe first model looks at a risk aware newsvendor who sells a single product over a single selling season. We consider the associated expected utility maximization  problem to find the optimal order quantity. Without any assumptions on the actual form of the utility function of the newsvendor, we extend the current literature on the risk averse newsvendor (who orders less than the risk neutral newsvendor) to the risk seeking case and show that the risk seeking newsvendor orders more than the risk neutral newsvendor. We also show that these relationships are not just necessary but also sufficient. The ordering strategies of the risk aware newsvendor are then modeled as agents in an evolutionary algorithm. We develop a directional ordering rule based on the above theory which is used by all the agents. The rule uses the risk neutral solution as the anchor and allows the agent to adjust and order less or more than the risk neutral newsvendor based on its risk preference. The adjustment quantity is not pre-specified and is learnt by the agents. The emergent ordering patterns from the evolutionary agent model are compared with the analytical utility models as well as experimental results in the literature.\n<br>\nWe then look at the effect of changes in demand risk on the optimal ordering quantities of the risk aware newsvendor. Changes in demand risk are characterized by first and second order stochastic dominance shifts in the underlying random variables. With minimal assumptions on the utility functions for the newsvendor, we develop relationships between the optimal ordering quantities in two demand scenarios, one scenario being riskier than the other. The stochastic dominance approach is more generic than comparisons made using the variances of the two demand distributions. We then test the effect of first order stochastic dominance and second order stochastic dominance shifts in risk in the evolutionary agent model. In the latter, we restrict our attention to mean preserving spreads.\n<br>\nThe performance of the evolutionary agent models is then analyzed and we provide computational support for the insufficient adjustment bias proposed in the literature. The critical role of mutation probabilities (in the evolutionary algorithms) in guaranteeing convergence to the optimal (risk neutral) order quantity is demonstrated. The insights from this analysis are then linked to the insufficient adjustment bias seen in practice. A simple penalty based mechanism is then proposed to mitigate the effect of risk preferences on inventory orders. The mechanism allows the DM to order any quantity he/she chooses but deviations from a reference/suggested quantity are penalized using a penalty function. A simple expression is provided for the risk neutral newsvendor to obtain the optimal order quantity when the cost of deviation is included in the newsvendor's objective function. We then consider the special case of setting the reference quantity to the classic risk neutral order quantity. In this setting, only the risk averse and risk seeking newsvendors will be penalized for deviations. This policy is tested and shown to be very effective in inducing optimal ordering in the evolutionary agent model. \n<br>\nWe also investigate a common assumption on the existence of an interior point solution to the expected utility maximization  problem. We provide intuitive arguments on why (and when) the assumption is reasonable. Using Monte-Carlo simulation, we obtain the distribution of expected utility for a newsvendor with a power utility function considering both risk averse and risk seeking preferences. An analysis of these distributions using stochastic dominance results is also performed.\n<br>\nFinally, we study the effect of incorporating supply disruption risk in addition to the demand risk faced by the newsvendor. The newsvendor assures capacity at the supplier by reserving it at some cost. Orders are placed with the supplier and arrive, in full, if no disruption in supply occurs (or not at all otherwise). Assuming a Power utility function for the newsvendor , we provide closed form solutions for all risk preferences for the optimal order quantity. The effect of supply disruptions in the evolutionary agent model is investigated.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [429], "author_name_tesi": "Rangarajan, Atul ", "last_name_ssi": "Rangarajan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Atul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran", "V Daniel R Guide Jr.", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "David Arthur Nembhard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Chair", "V Daniel R Guide Jr., Committee Member", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Member", "David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["risk preferences", "supply chain disruptions", "utility models", "Newsvendor model", "evolutionary agent computation", "inventory models"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Nanophase Glass Ceramics for Capacitive Energy Storage\n\n", "id": "10161", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "871", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Glass ceramics are candidate dielectric materials for high energy storage capacitors.  Since energy density depends primarily on dielectric permittivity and breakdown strength, glass ceramics with interconnected nano-crystalline particles and low porosity, which leads to high breakdown strength, are expected to have high energy density values.  Three glass ceramic systems were investigated.  Barium/lead sodium niobate glass ceramics, designated as PNNS (PbO-Na2O-Nb2O5-SiO2) and BNNS (BaO-Na2O-Nb2O5-SiO2), and barium titanate silicate glass ceramic, designated as BTS (BaO-TiO2-SiO2), belonging to medium (\u0192\u00d5r ~ 400-700) and low (\u0192\u00d5r ~ 20) permittivity regimes, respectively, were fabricated by roller quenching and controlled crystallization.  The overall properties of the glass ceramics were controlled by connectivity and volume fraction of crystallites. \nPNNS and BNNS developed perovskite and tungsten-bronze phases during crystallization with permittivity values between 400 and 700.  Microstructural analysis of PNNS glass ceramic revealed grain sizes of the order of 50 nm.  The calculated breakdown strengths were ~0.7 and ~075 MV/cm for PNNS and BNNS respectively.  The resulting energy densities at breakdown were ~4.5 and ~6.5 J/cm3 for PNNS and BNNS respectively.  However, the disadvantages, such as difficult glass formability, less control over crystallization due to multiphase formation and low dielectric breakdown strength values due to high dielectric contrast between the glass and crystal phases, associated with PNNS and BNNS glass ceramics served as the motivating factor for exploring BTS glass ceramic.  \nThe major advantage of studying BTS glass ceramic over the other systems is that a single crystalline phase, fresnoite (Ba2TiSi2O8), grows from the quenched glass and properties can be explored over the whole spectrum ranging from fully amorphous to fully crystalline.  Crystallization kinetics of the BTS glass is explored to control the relative volume fractions of amorphous and crystalline phases.  The mechanism of crystallization was found to be 3-dimensional interfacial growth as indicated by Avrami parameter values.  In addition to the two extremes of fully amorphous and fully crystalline samples, partially crystalline samples were also chosen for electrical property studies.  \nBTS, being an alkali-free system, showed exceptional stability in dielectric properties with temperature until about 400\u201eaC.  The crystalline phase has similar composition and dielectric permittivity as that of the glass phase.  It is concluded from impedance results that the glass phase is the major contributor to the composite conductivity.  The minimal dielectric contrast between glass (\u0192\u00d5r ~ 15) and crystal (\u0192\u00d5r ~ 18) phases resulted in comparatively higher breakdown strength values (~1.9 MV/cm) than PNNS and BNNS.  The energy density of BTS glass ceramic was calculated to be ~2.5 J/cm3.\nHigh field properties were studied to estimate the energy densities of PNNS, BNNS and BTS glass ceramics from polarization-electric field loops and to compare and contrast the amorphous and crystalline BTS samples.  Similar to low field impedance results, high field P-E loops indicated amorphous BTS to be more conductive when compared to crystalline BTS.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [864], "author_name_tesi": "Rangarajan, Badri ", "last_name_ssi": "Rangarajan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Badri", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan", "Michael T Lanagan", "Thomas R Shrout", "Carlo G Pantano", "Bruce Gluckman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Chair", "Thomas R Shrout, Committee Chair", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member", "Bruce Gluckman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fresnoites", "Crystallization kinetics", "Dielectric Properties", "Glass ceramics", "Energy density"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THERMAL HISTORY PREDICTION USING FAR-FIELD TEMPERATURE MEASUREMENTS DURING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING", "id": "13739rqr5128", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13739", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With recent advancements in Additive Manufacturing, the need for computational models to gain theoretical understanding prior to experimentation is growing. In this work, a simulation of Directed Energy Deposition (DED) using Finite Volume Methods is developed to study the thermal behavior, especially the thermal history during the deposition process. DED is an Additive Manufacturing process that uses high-power lasers for material melting and can deliver near net shape of the desired component. The thermal histories of the process can help understand the microstructure, residual stress, and material properties of the obtained component. The experimental setup monitors the temperature using far-field temperature measurement devices, thus limiting temperature observation to a particular point as opposed to computational models, wherein the degree of freedom to monitor the temperatures is larger. 2D and 3D models were both developed, with the former being the stepping stone. The proposed simulation considers experimental processing conditions such as a moving heat source and relevant boundary conditions to generate plots of thermal histories. The results were based on the implementation of user-defined functions (UDF) in C to numerically simulate a moving heat source, which encompasses the properties of the laser.

Regulations have been the primary means by which design changes to the sidewalk environment have been implemented.  This historical reliance on top-down planning approaches has given way more recently to new human-scaled approaches to studying public space, thanks to pioneers like Kevin Lynch, Jane Jacobs, William Whyte, and Jan Gehl.  However, these approaches have not been widely applied to the sidewalk.  Existing representations of the sidewalk have been incomplete in illuminating that this everyday piece of infrastructure creates a unique urban experience.  Photography has, for the most part, been absent amongst the tools planners and architects use to represent and design sidewalks.  In this thesis, I analyze and critique the ways sidewalks have been represented, and propose a fine-grained, focused observational approach using photomontage as a technique to create a Photographic Sidewalk Narrative.  The result is a photographic tool that represents the urban sidewalk experience and reveals insights about its design potential.  I photographed a 250-foot stretch of sidewalk on St. Mark\u2019s Place in Manhattan with two cameras using time-lapse and still frame techniques.  The still photographs were then compiled to create the Photographic Sidewalk Narrative, which tells a story of this sidewalk segment.  Single photographs show specific aspects of the space, while comparing photographs taken at different times of the day, during different weather conditions, from slightly different angles, or zoomed in or out, helps the designer become aware of subtle needs being expressed in the space, which can lead to new insights and design ideas. This thesis adds this new photographic tool to the existing toolkit of ways to observe and understand a sidewalk, which can be used by designers to understand sidewalks as they currently exist, and to inform their future design. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16882], "author_name_tesi": "Rangaswamy, Cara Parry", "last_name_ssi": "Rangaswamy", "middle_name_ssi": "Parry", "first_name_ssi": "Cara", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darla Lindberg", "Peter Aeschbacher", "Denise Costanzo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darla Lindberg, Thesis Advisor", "Peter Aeschbacher, Thesis Advisor", "Denise Costanzo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sidewalk", "urban fabric", "photomontage", "representation", "observation", "design"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "FOUR ESSAYS IN ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS ON CARBON MANAGEMENT AND INVASIVE SPECIES CONTROL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "6064", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5412", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\nMany of the environmental policy issues that challenge contemporary society are characterized by uncertainty about the relationships between human choices and environmental outcomes, and consequences of environmental change for the human condition.  Some recent challenges with these features include global warming, invasive species, newly emergent and re-emergent vector-borne diseases, nutrient pollution, and transgenic crops.  Policy decisions must be made to address environmental risks, yet policy makers often lack essential information on cause-effect relationships, and the benefits and costs of policy decisions.\n   The broad goals of this dissertation are to contribute towards scientific understanding of the optimal management of environmental risks, and the design of policy instruments to implement social objectives under conditions of uncertainty.  The research proceeds through two case studies.  One is the management of the global carbon cycle, and the second is managing the risks of invasive species.  Carbon emissions are a leading cause of the global warming phenomena and the resulting risks from climate change. Invasive species are now being recognized as an enormous ecological risk with huge economic costs.  Both of these problems are characterized by the collective nature of risks involved and the need to make decisions under incomplete knowledge about linkages and consequences.   By incorporating theories, models and methods from environmental sciences, environmental economics and decision sciences, this research aims at contributing towards better understanding of the decision problems, and the design of optimal strategies given what is known today and what may be learned in the future.\nDecisions about the control of carbon emissions and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d are highly controversial, in large part because scientific understanding of the causes and consequences of climate change is highly imperfect.  One question is whether society should do anything at all to limit growth of carbon in the atmosphere.  The proponents of early and aggressive actions to limit carbon emissions argue that the enormous potential damages to ecosystem and human society make for immediate measures to limit carbon emissions or to sequester carbon essential.  Proponents of \u2018wait and watch\u2019 approach argue that investment in abatement infrastructure is irreversible and comes at too large a cost for to the current generation.  A second question is how to achieve societal goals for carbon.  This issue involves equally controversial choices among technological options (e.g. conventional emission abatement versus sequestration in forests or deep oceans), and among carbon policy instruments (e.g., carbon taxes versus carbon trading).\nThis thesis devotes three essays to the economics of global warming.  The first examines the optimal allocation between carbon sequestration and conventional abatement.  The problem is approached as a dynamic optimization problem. A conceptual model that captures the benefits and costs of carbon emissions, sequestration and climate change is developed and used to examine characteristics of an optimal solution.  In addition, the model is used to design a carbon trading mechanism that allows for pollution emitting firms to offset their emissions by buying carbon sequestered through afforestation projects.  A key contribution to the literature on carbon trading will be attention to the time consistency of the trading rules.  A policy is time consistent when there is no incentive for future generations to deviate from the planned path.  Finally, simulation experiments are conducted to study the effect of key parameters of the model on decision rules and thus guide policy making.  \nThe first essay serves as a benchmark for exploring the implication of uncertainty in that I develop the case of perfect information.  The second essay begins my analysis of risk.  Specifically, in this essay I modify the model developed in chapter one to explore the implications of uncertain events for optimal plans and design of mechanisms.  Special attention is devoted to the possibilities of catastrophes and pollution-eliminating discoveries through the second essay.  \nThe third essay also builds up on the first to explore risks that are peculiar to the sequestration process. These arise due the unobservability of sequestered carbon and stochastic flux associated with atmospheric parameters.  Such a holistic treatment of uncertainty would help contribute towards understanding of the nature of uncertainties and their impact on the choice of appropriate tools. \nThe fourth essay is devoted to the invasive species management problem.  The introduction of species to non-native environments is the largest source of ecosystem change and biodiversity loss worldwide after habitat destruction. The economic impacts, in terms of diminished amenities and resources and associated commercial and recreational opportunities, capital modifications and maintenance requirements, and potential health impacts can be enormous. For example, one estimate puts the damages in the US alone to be $122,639 million per year from all invasive species.\nThe risks of invasive species can be dealt with either through preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of invasion or measures to mitigate the damages of invasion.  A key problem in using preventative controls is that predicting the most likely invaders or the most likely vectors is extremely difficult.  In fact, invasions cannot be predicted from either the general properties of habitat or species or both.  Moreover the \u2018if in doubt keep them out\u2019 policy can be exorbitantly costly.  \u201cEvery year, the 2000 inspectors in the Agricultural Department\u2019s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) face the Herculean task of checking some 50,000 ships, 1 million aircraft and tens of millions of travelers arriving from overseas with countless tons of cargo and packages\u201d, (CQ, Researcher).  Mitigative efforts may entail actions taken before or after invasion.  An example of pre-invasion mitigation would be steps to enhance the resilience of native ecosystems.  Post-invasion control efforts are not costless to adopt either as such measures often adversely affect the native habitat.  Due to incomplete knowledge about the nature of invasive species, none of the above options may be certain and further still all come at increasing costs.  \nTherefore, optimal management of systems may require a prudent allocation of efforts between all the instruments available at hand in order to simultaneously minimize the chances of invasion, damages from invasion, and the costs of control.  Surprisingly, despite the economic and ecological costs of invasive species, this question has received little attention in the economics literature.  This essay looks at the issue of optimal allocation between scarce resources to control and adapt to invasion, under significant uncertainty associated with the invasion process.  A cost effective mix of available options is designed that would minimize the threats and damages from invasive species.  Further, allocation of resources towards uncertainty reducing measures is looked at.  Finally, a numerical simulation experiment is performed to study the effects of key parameters on optimal allocation. This would have important implications for invasive species management and would provide policy makers with a much needed guidance towards tackling the invasive species problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5405], "author_name_tesi": "Ranjan, Ram ", "last_name_ssi": "Ranjan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ram", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle", "Liz Marshall", "Adam Zachary Rose", "David Gerard Abler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle, Committee Chair", "Liz Marshall, Committee Member", "Adam Zachary Rose, Committee Member", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Invasive Species Control", "Carbon Sequestration", "Carbon Management", "Decision Making under Uncertainty"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Greening of Human Rights in Iran", "id": "14598amr420", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14598", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "What counts as human rights, and whose human rights count? These questions are at the center of my dissertation, which analyzes how social justice movements in Iran strategically frame rights narratives for local and international audiences. Conceptually, human rights are a powerful rhetorical tool, which are often used by social movements as a means of political mobilization. However, states can also appropriate rights discourse to justify violent interventions, severely curtailing spaces of political speech. My analysis of contemporary Iranian social movements explains the limitations of using a human rights framework to address environmental degradation and political repression. \n\nSeveral months of qualitative research in Iran informs my study of the ways in which environmental and pro-democracy activists have \u2018greened\u2019 human rights discourse. First, the case of the Orumiyeh environmental justice movement reveals the ways in which environmental conservation is used to make broader human rights claims against the Iranian government. Second, through an analysis of silent protests organized by the Green Movement, I examine how performative silence makes visible both the limits of political speech and resistance to conditions of precarity experienced by Iranian citizens. Through the study of two social justice movements, I argue that international recognition of rights plurality is key to achieving social justice in political contexts where it is challenging to speak openly about human rights.\n\nThis research draws upon and advances scholarly literatures on human rights, environmental justice, and transnational and postcolonial feminist theory within geography and related disciplines. My research engages with environmental justice scholarship through an examination of how and why environmental concerns are implicated with human rights claims in Iran. Drawing from transnational and postcolonial feminist theory, I examine the ways in which global structures and state practices create conditions that make it difficult for citizens to speak to certain conditions of human insecurity - particularly those experienced by marginalized populations - thus problematizing universal human rights as the normative basis of rights recognition. Findings from my study has significant implications for the ways in which rights are enforced globally by questioning how rights claims are recognized when they are made outside of the normative framework of \u2018universal\u2019 rights, particularly when claims reflect culturally and contextually specific circumstances. My case studies demonstrate the critical importance of not only recognizing and engaging with rights plurality, but ultimately the need for new normative bases for addressing human vulnerability that extends beyond singular, universal notions of human rights and justice. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16185], "author_name_tesi": "Ranjbar, Azita Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Ranjbar", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Azita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lorraine Dowler", "Lorraine Dowler", "Melissa Wright", "Brian Hastings King", "Sarah Clark Miller", "Tamara Sonn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lorraine Dowler, Dissertation Advisor", "Lorraine Dowler, Committee Chair", "Melissa Wright, Committee Member", "Brian Hastings King, Committee Member", "Sarah Clark Miller, Outside Member", "Tamara Sonn, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Feminist geopolitics", "Iran", "Human rights", "Environmental justice", "Feminist Geography", "Green Movement", "Silence", "Social movements"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Characterizing laser induced cavitation: effects of air content, beam angle, and laser power", "id": "15133", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7278", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Laser-induced cavitation allows for cavitation bubbles to be systematically reproduced using\na high power laser and focusing the laser beam to a point.

Indirect methods have been proposed and promise improved high frequency characterization of dielectric materials. My research will concentrate on further developing novel methods for accurately characterizing dielectric thin film materials at high frequencies (1 GHz to 26 GHz). Titanium dioxide will be used because of its high dielectric constant (up to 170).  In this research the characterization of high k thin films will be investigated using the high k material titania (TiO2) on a fused quartz substrate. The study of titania on fused quartz is a logical low-cost method of establishing reproducible methods for high k microwave thin film characterization. The characterization techniques for thin films developed in this research will include use of the ring resonator, split-cavity resonator (dielectrometer) and coplanar transmission line. This paper investigates techniques not only to measure titania thin films, but most high k dielectric materials. Limitations to this technique will be described in detail in this paper. In this research, refinements to techniques for characterizing thin films are proposed that accurately determine relative permittivity and dielectric loss.

Most recently, the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act (Public Law 107-110) has placed additional pressures and accountability on teachers and schools. As a result, teachers\u2019 rates of stress and burnout are believed to have increased, and in turn, may be influencing teachers\u2019 effectiveness. Further, when teachers are asked to implement a new curriculum, those who show high rates of stress and a low sense of efficacy may also exhibit a lowered quality of implementation and ultimately have a negative impact on their students\u2019 learning. To extend previous research and address these current issues, the focus of the present study was to examine what factors in the teacher, as well as their support systems, impact both their feelings of burnout and the quality of implementation of a new evidence-based curriculum whose goal is to improve students\u2019 social and emotional learning (i.e., the PATHS program).  The present study specifically focused on the following factors: teachers\u2019 work pressure, teachers\u2019 efficacy, technical and principal support for the PATHS program, teachers\u2019 burnout, as well as teachers\u2019 dosage and perceptions of the quality of their PATHS implementation. \n\tResults revealed that teachers\u2019 stress and efficacy both have direct associations with teacher burnout while teachers\u2019 supports for curriculum use do not. Teachers\u2019 stress, efficacy, and curriculum supports also all have direct associations with particular aspects of implementation dosage and quality.  Moreover, interactive effects between stressors, efficacy, and curriculum supports suggest that it is the combination of factors that most impacts the quality with which lessons and concepts are being delivered to students. High levels of work pressure alone did not decrease teachers\u2019 level of implementation quality, nor did low levels of burnout. Additionally, teachers with higher efficacy were \u201cprotected\u201d from the influence of high burnout on their implementation quality. Finally, results also varied by grade level, suggesting that teacher efficacy, as well as both principal and technical support, are more critical factors for upper grade level teachers. These findings reiterate the importance of teacher characteristics in the implementation of new curriculum. Researchers must also pay particular attention to grade level and other demographic factors that may play a role in program fidelity and program outcomes.  Ultimately, schools must address the \u201cwhole\u201d teacher as well as the role of principal and technical support in order to attain their most desired, and now required, outcomes of improved academic achievement.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1120], "author_name_tesi": "Ransford, Carolyn R", "last_name_ssi": "Ransford", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Carolyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark T Greenberg", "Scott David Gest", "Eric Loken", "David Alexander Gamson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark T Greenberg, Committee Chair", "Scott David Gest, Committee Member", "Eric Loken, Committee Member", "David Alexander Gamson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["teacher burnout", "teacher efficacy", "implementation quality", "teacher characteristics", "school environment", "stress", "support", "curriculum implementation"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A procedural validation for Affordance-based Finite State Automata (FSA) in Human-involved Complex Systems.", "id": "9511", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3604", "abstract_tesi": "Human-machine cooperative systems area is a popular application area for system theory, where there is the integration between the functionalities of human and system.

Microtubules are at the crux of neuronal polarity, as they facilitate directional trafficking within the neuron. Moreover, microtubule orientation within each compartment is considered to be one of the key determinants of axonal and dendritic identity. Neurons are vulnerable to various types of injury and it is critical for these cells to repair, as most neurons cannot be replaced. The overarching theme of the upcoming sections is neuronal responses to injury and the underlying molecular mechanisms. \nLoss of an axon is a major challenge to a neuron. Neurons in both vertebrates and invertebrates respond to axon loss by converting a dendrite to an axon. In Chapter 2, we show that the nociceptive Class IV sensory neurons in Drosophila, also respond to complete axon loss or proximal axotomy by converting a dendrite to a new axon. However, distal axotomy frequently led to formation of two axons, one from the axon stump and another by converting a dendrite. Using microtubule polarity changes as a read-out, we describe a novel feedback mechanism between the two regenerating axons, such that when growth from the stump is blocked, the decision to convert a dendrite becomes accelerated. \nPrevious studies have discovered that axon regeneration in Drosophila sensory neurons requires spastin, a microtubule-severing enzyme. However, it is not known how loss of spastin leads to this defect. In Chapter 3, we present evidence that loss of atlastin, a protein that interacts with spastin, also results in defective axon regeneration. Interestingly, impaired axon regeneration was observed only when reduced levels of spastin or atlastin were combined with the presence of a dominant-negative microtubule regulator. Further, impaired axon regeneration due to loss of spastin or atlastin was associated with defects in localization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at regenerating axon tips. Thus, we propose a model where, spastin and atlastin are involved in ER-microtubule co-ordination during axon regeneration. \nIn comparison to axon regeneration, very little is known about dendrite regeneration. Previous studies in the dendrites of Drosophila peripheral neurons have revealed that dendrite regeneration does not require the dual leucine-zipper kinase (DLK) signaling pathway, which is critical during axon regeneration. In order to extend these studies to vertebrates, somatosensory neurons in zebrafish can be used as a model. However, the input-receiving sensory branches of these neurons have been considered as axons, and not dendrites. In Chapter 4, microtubule polarity of the sensory endings in zebrafish Rohon-Beard neurons is investigated by live imaging techniques, in an effort to resolve their identity. Also, tools to test the requirement of the DLK pathway in the regeneration of zebrafish sensory endings are also described.

The gap between the turbine rotor and the stationary casing is referred to as the tip gap. High pressure turbine blades are typically un-shrouded and pressure driven flow through the tip gap is termed as over tip leakage. Over tip leakage reduces efficiency of the turbine stage and also causes thermal distress to blade tip surfaces. The gap height typically increases over the operational life of a turbine, leading to increased efficiency drop. The thermal load on the tip surface also increases with increasing gap height and is exacerbated by the radial transport of high temperature fluid found in the core of the combustor exit flow. Thus over tip leakage not only decreases stage efficiency, but also constrains it by limiting the maximum cycle temperature.\nReducing the sensitivity of turbine performance to the effects of the tip gap is termed Tip Desensitization. An experimental investigation of tip desensitization through coolant injection from a tip surface trench was conducted in a large scale, low speed, rotating research turbine facility. Five out of twenty nine rotor blades, referred to as cooled blades, are provided with coolant injection at four locations, at 61%, 71%, 81%, and 91% blade tip axial chord length. At each of the first three locations the coolant jets are directed towards the blade pressure-side, while coolant is exhausted radially at the last location. \nQualitative information of tip surface flow was obtained through the implementation of surface flow visualization using an oil and pigment mixture. Quantitative measurements of absolute total pressure were conducted in a plane located at 30% axial chord downstream of the rotor exit plane using a fast response total pressure probe aligned to the absolute tip velocity vector. Time accurate, phase locked total pressure was measured and averaged over 200 rotations. Total pressure defects due to over tip leakage vortex, passage secondary flow, and blade wakes are clearly observed in total pressure maps over the entire circumference and a range of radial locations. The effect of coolant mass flow rate and injection location was investigated by coolant injection from a single cooled blade with a gap height of 1.40% blade height. Coolant mass flow rates in the range of 0.4% - 0.7% of turbine mass flow rate were investigated. Coolant injection from all five cooled blades was also investigated. The effect of casing endwall surface roughness was also studied, without coolant injection.\nThe sensitivity of total pressure defect, due to over tip leakage, to tip gap height is reduced by both coolant injection and roughening of the casing surface. The total pressure defect due to the large gap height of 1.40% blade height is reduced to levels comparable to the defect due to a gap height of 0.72% blade height. The strong total pressure gradient that characterizes the leakage vortex due to the gap height of 1.40% blade height is considerably diminished by both coolant injection and roughening of the casing surface. Coolant injection from 81% chord location is most effective in reducing both the total pressure defect and the total pressure gradient. Casing surface roughness significantly shifts the leakage vortex towards blade suction surface reducing its interaction with the upper passage vortex. The benefit of casing surface roughness is greater at larger gap heights.\nSurface flows on the rotor and casing endwalls, blade tip surface for gap heights ranging from 0.72% - 1.4% blade height, and blade tip surface with coolant injection at a gap height of 1.4% blade height were visualized. Highly overturned flows are observed on both endwalls, caused by secondary flow exiting the stator. Important rotor endwall features such as the horseshoe vortex system, cross-passage secondary flow, and the path of the pressure-side leg of the horseshoe vortex are identified. A distinct reattachment line occurs on the tip surface of un-cooled blades, at approximately twice the gap height from the pressure-side corner. Surface patterns clearly indicate the presence of a gap vortex and chord-wise flow on the tip surface of un-cooled blades. \nCoolant jets are turned by the gap flow, towards suction-side of the tip gap. Cooling films form on the tip surface due to coolant jets from the first two locations while intense mixing of coolant and main gap flow is observed around the 81% chord location. The coolant jets prevent reattachment on the tip surface and also affect pressure-side corner separation of the gap flow. Suction surface traces with coolant injection indicate that roll up of gap flow in the neighboring passage is not continuous.\nCoolant injection directed towards the blade pressure-side corner and artificially introduced surface roughness could, individually, be effective techniques to operate high pressure axial flow turbines at large tip gap heights without the associated penalty on efficiency. The combination of coolant injection and artificially introduced surface roughness could lead to greater loss reduction. The specific coolant scheme used has been shown, qualitatively, to have thermal benefits in addition to reducing the total pressure defect associated with the roll up of gap flow into a vortex.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4657], "author_name_tesi": "Rao, Nikhil Molahally", "last_name_ssi": "Rao", "middle_name_ssi": "Molahally", "first_name_ssi": "Nikhil", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin", "Lyle Norman Long", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Timothy F Miiler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Committee Chair", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Committee Member", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Timothy F Miiler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Axial turbine", "over tip leakage", "tip leakage flow", "tip surface coolant injection", "turbine tip desensitization"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "High Order Unstructured Grid Methods For Computational Aeroacoustics\n", "id": "6207", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4940", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-02-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Practical problems concerning the aeroacoustics of aircrafts demand \nthe use of\nunstructured grids, to handle the complex geometry boundaries.

Affinity chromatography can provide very high selectivity, but throughput is often reduced by mass transfer limitations.  Affinity ultrafiltration is a potentially attractive alternative, but the high cost and practical limitations of the large macroligands used in previous studies has limited the viability of this technique. The overall objective of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of affinity ultrafiltration using small charged affinity ligands, with the change in protein charge exploited for high resolution separation using an electrically charged membrane.\n  Experiments were performed using a model system of bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin with the dye Cibacron Blue chosen as the charged affinity ligand.  The equilibrium binding characteristics between the two proteins and Cibacron Blue were evaluated using a simple ultrafiltration technique over a wide range of solution conditions. Protein filtration experiments were performed to evaluate the affects of Cibacron Blue on protein transmission using essentially neutral and negatively-charged versions of a composite regenerated cellulose membrane.  The addition of only 1 g/L of Cibacron Blue to an 8 g/L BSA solution reduced the BSA sieving coefficient through the negatively-charged membrane by more than two orders of magnitude, with this effect being largely eliminated at high salt and with the neutral membrane.  Protein sieving data were in good agreement with model calculations based on the partitioning of a charged sphere in a charged pore accounting for the change in net protein charge due to ligand binding and the increase in solution ionic strength due to the free ligand in solution. These results clearly demonstrate that the addition of small charged ligands can be used to control protein transmission during ultrafiltration.\nThe high affinity of BSA for Cibacron Blue was exploited to enhance the selectivity for the separation of BSA from ovalbumin.  The membrane selectivity was a complex function of the solution conditions, Cibacron Blue concentration, and membrane charge.  The addition of Cibacron Blue caused a 30-fold increase in selectivity due to the strong electrostatic repulsion of the highly charged BSA-Cibacron Blue complex.  Protein separations were accomplished using a diafiltration process, giving a BSA product with a purification factor of more than 90-fold and a yield greater than 90%.  An ovalbumin product was generated in the filtrate with a purification factor of over 10 and a yield of nearly 100%.  Subsequent experiments used a tangential flow filtration device that was linearly scalable to commercial manufacturing operations, demonstrating that this process should be feasible even at large scale.  The results clearly demonstrate the ability to use small charged affinity ligands with bio-specific binding characteristics to achieve high selectivity protein separations by high performance tangential flow filtration.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5516], "author_name_tesi": "Rao, Suma ", "last_name_ssi": "Rao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suma", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney", "Arnold Anthony Fontaine", "Themis Matsoukas", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Arnold Anthony Fontaine, Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["protein separation", "membranes", "affinity separations", "cibacron blue", "high performace tangential flow filtration"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Enhancing the Visualization Tools for a Concept Generator\n", "id": "10637", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6261", "abstract_tesi": "The thesis work consists of improving the visualization capabilities of an automated concept generator, which generates conceptual solutions from a repository of existing design data related to product design.

Copper-tungsten composites were developed to produce composite materials with relatively high thermal conductivity and low coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE).  FAST proved to be effective in producing materials that had very high density. \n\n Copper based material systems were combined with diamond particles were then developed to reduce CTE while improving thermal conductivity compared to the best known commonly used pure metal, copper.  It was discovered that a pure copper matrix was not effective to develop quality composite systems due to the poor interface that existed between the matrix and diamond particle.  Several approaches were taken to improve the interface.  Incorporating low melting temperature materials that would become an in-situ liquid phase showed some effectiveness in improving the interface and thermal conductivity.  Unfortunately, the thermal conductivity was not able to be improved due to the lack of chemical reaction between the diamond particles and the matrix.  Copper alloys containing zirconium were found to be the best solution to improving the interface.  Zr migrated to the interface from the matrix during the sintering process and formed a very thin layer of carbide.  Finite element analysis (FEA) was employed to provide further insight into the composite materials.  The analysis revals that the thermal conductivity of the alloy matrix changes as a result of the Zr migration from the matrix to the interface.  \n\n The copper alloy approach was extended to include carbon nanotubes instead of diamond particles. While the Zr migration and carbide formation was also observed, the composites did not show good thermal properties because of agglomerations of the carbon nanotubes.  The result was a composite material that had low density due to porosity within the pockets of nanotubes. The porosity was also severely detrimental to the thermal conductivity of the composites.\\\\\n Composite materials made from a combination of pure metals and thermally annealed pyrolytic graphite (TPG) were fabricated as heat spreading materials.  The results were characterized using a customized apparatus designed specifically to measure the thermal spreading cabability of a material.  The materials containing TPG showed a more uniform heat distribution and lower maximum temperature than their pure metal counterparts. Thermal modelling was carried out via FEA to determine the thermal interface resistance of the composite.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10661], "author_name_tesi": "Rape, Aaron M", "last_name_ssi": "Rape", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Aaron", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jogender Singh", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Joshua Alexander Robinson", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jogender Singh, Dissertation Advisor", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Joshua Alexander Robinson, Committee Member", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thermal Conductivity", "Thermal Transport", "Copper-diamond", "copper-tungsten", "composite materials", "SPS", "FAST", "Thermal Simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Acoustic Intensity Methods in Classical Scattering", "id": "6450", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "778", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Measurements made with scalar pressure sensors are only able to provide an estimate of the magnitude of the total intensity associated with an equivalent plane wave.  This equivalence is an assumption that the relative phase between pressure and velocity is identically zero.  True intensity sensors simultaneously measure the acoustic pressure and components of particle velocity (or related quantity such as acceleration, displacement, or pressure gradient) at a single coordinate in space.  Numeric computations regarding the scattering of a steady-state acoustic field by a rigid spheroid indicate that the equivalent plane wave intensity field only varies by \u00b10.5dB rel. incident acoustic intensity many object lengths away in the forward direction at high frequencies.

Solutions to this problem have also become increasingly important with the development and prevalence of web cartography.  Most existing algorithms involve parameters selected arbitrarily or heuristically, with little reference to the scale change between the original data and the desired generalized representation.  This research presents the hexagonal quantization algorithm, a new method by which regular hexagonal tessellations of variable scale are used to sample cartographic lines for simplification.  Hexagon width, reflecting sampling fidelity, is varied in proportion to target scale, thereby allowing for cartographic scale-specificity.  Tesserae then constitute loci among which a new set of vertices can be defined by vertex clustering quantization, and this set of vertices is used to compose a generalized correlate of the input line which is appropriate for its intended mapping scale.  Hexagon scaling is informed by sampling theory, drawn both from the field of geography and other cognate signal-processing fields such as computer science and engineering.   \n\nThe present study also compares the hexagonal quantization algorithm to the Li-Openshaw raster-vector algorithm, which undertakes a similar process using traditional square raster cells.  The lines produced by either algorithm using the same tessera width are objectively compared for fidelity to the original line in two ways: spatial displacement from the input line is measured using Hausdorff distances, and the product lines are presented against their input lines for visual inspection.\n\nResults show that hexagonal quantization offers appreciable advantages over the square tessellations of traditional raster cells for vertex clustering line simplification in that product lines are less displaced from input lines.  It is found that product lines from the hexagonal quantization algorithm generally maintained shorter Hausdorff distances than did those from the Li-Openshaw raster-vector algorithm.  Also, visual inspection suggests lines produced by the hexagonal quantization algorithm retain informative geographical shapes for greater differences in scale than do those produced by the Li-Openshaw raster-vector algorithm.

Cartographers' manipulation and use of raster data, especially in the context of scale change, tends to be unsophisticated, with techniques used rarely going beyond resampling strategies. Also, as with procedures developed for vector data, raster data generalization is typically not objectively related to mapping scale.\n\nThe overarching theme of this dissertation is the development of raster generalization procedures directly related to target mapping scale. It contributes to the presently small body of cartographic literature on raster generalization, with two contributions to digital elevation model (DEM) and topography treatments, and one to pixel land cover treatment. The dissertation consists of a suite of three projects which take three respective approaches to the overall scale-oriented goal: entropy-based quantification, analytical segmentation, and resolution change.\n\nThe first project presents the development of an automated method of cartographic DEM smoothing. Associating generalization level to the objective parameter of local terrain entropy, the method variably smooths a DEM such that sharper and more salient relief features are better retained while smaller fluctuations in the surface and more monotonous areas are more aggressively smoothed. This effect is achieved by using variably-sized low-pass filter kernels, with their sizes being determined by the inverse of the local surface entropy. The algorithm is also explicitly tunable to any cartographic scale, such that multiple representations can be produced for multi-scale cartography. Derived cartographic products from the smoothed DEMs such as terrain shadings, slope shadings, and contour lines are produced at high quality at particular scales.\n\nThe second project consists of a novel geographic raster segmentation algorithm, termed \"water table\" segmentation. The name reflects the algorithm's simulation of terrain basin flooding by incrementally raising an idealized, planar water table. As inundated basins coalesce while the water table rises, their mergers are recorded in a segmentation tree. The algorithm borrows from existing image segmentation algorithms in computer vision, with distinctions in how the resulting segmentation tree is formed and analyzed. The segmentation tree serves as an abstraction of the partonomic structure of the terrain's landforms, thereby making landform detection and analysis possible through graph analysis. The algorithm and its resulting segmentation tree are explained and associated to points of generalization, being instances along a shrinking map scale at which map symbols fail and must be reworked, replaced, or abandoned. The water table segmentation algorithm makes cartometric analysis of landforms and their associated points of generalization possible. The chapter also focuses on the segmentation's particular usefulness when applied to land surface parameters (LSPs) derived from the DEM, such as slope or roughness.\n\nIn the final project, National Land Cover Database (NLCD) data are generalized and enhanced for use at multiple map scales, with particular emphasis on 1:24,000, a scale for which the data are too coarse. To produce an informative, generalized, and aesthetically pleasing land cover representation at large scale, the data are subjected to a series of processing steps, principle among which are upsampling, stochastic edge \"airbrushing,\" and re-coloration. Each technique is used to deliberately soften and ambiguate the location of land cover class boundaries within a narrow margin. This margin, or \"uncertainty corridor,\" is no wider than two input NLCD cells, and the deliberate visual uncertainty introduced is limited to this area. The resulting land cover map layer provides a painterly representation, and is particularly well-suited to be used as translucent and in combination with other layers such at orthoimagery and feature vectors for large-scale (approximately 1:24,000) topographic mapping.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12358], "author_name_tesi": "Raposo, Paulo ", "last_name_ssi": "Raposo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Paulo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Ann Brewer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Ann Brewer, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cartography", "raster generalization", "DEMs", "terrain generalization", "land cover", "segmentation", "landform detection", "entropy", "map generalization", "multiscale"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "MANAGING COMPLEXITY IN MASS CUSTOMIZATION THROUGH DESIGN SPACE SUBDIVISION: A CASE STUDY IN CERAMIC TABLEWARE DESIGN", "id": "14916erc15", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14916", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although design is traditionally the m\u00e9tier of designers, nowadays participation in the design process is increasingly shared with end-users.

It has been shown that iron deficiency is exacerbated by the existence of malarial infection, which may also adversely affect sleep.

Sleep quality was defined as the number of wake bouts an infant experienced and the fragmentation of sleep.\nDaytime periods between the hours of 8 AM and 11 AM and between 3:30 PM and 6:30 PM were analyzed for total activity levels.  Multiple linear regression models were used to analyze cross-sectional data from a community based sample of Zanzibari infants (n=45; 5-18 months of age).  \nThe mean hemoglobin level was 9.4 + 1.4 g/dL; the mean zinc protoporphyrin level was 161.0 + 150.4 \u00ecmol/mol heme, with 55.6 % of the sample being anemic, 66.7 % (ZPP) iron deficient, and 48.9 % iron-deficient anemic.

Similar to previous treaties on power, the current research documents the influence of cultural stereotypes on the decision-making of power holders and possible interventions aimed to attenuate race-based biases. Across several studies, people placed into leadership roles showed a preference for relinquishing their power to White men over Black men (Pilot Study, Studies 1 and 3). Thus, in-line with cultural stereotypes about who is fit to lead, leaders showed a tendency to give power to prototypical leaders with positively associated stereotypes regarding leadership (i.e., White men) rather than individuals who are underrepresented in leadership with negatively associated stereotypes regarding leadership (i.e., Black men). In addition, consistent with predictions, experimental interventions like counterstereotypic task framing (Study 2) and other-focused perspective-taking (Study 3) reduced the relinquishing power gap between White and Black co-workers. Together, these results suggest that race-based biases may be malleable and eliminated in relinquishing power decisions depending on conditions surrounding leadership.

In a series of four manuscripts, this work explores shear zones with a series of laboratory experiments on both natural and synthetic materials. I conduct shear experiments to investigate how localization of shear controls the gouge zone of faults. Experiments show that shear localizes progressively into a central zone. Localized shear can lead to a change in the RSF parameters where micromechanics of the shear zone overrides the expectations of the commonly used laws. I also find that subtle changes in the fabric of the shear zone can enhance the possibility of seismic slip. I find that slow, seismic slip can be produced in laboratory experiments as creep rupture rather than strictly RSF and stick-slip sliding. Acoustic emissions of slow-slip have a similar form to stick-slip; however, the duration is ~1s rather than ~1ks observed in laboratory stick-slip. In my experiments it is possible to propagate slow-slip in both velocity-strengthening and weakening materials. Elevated fluid pressure in gouge zones can mitigate the effects of the frictional behavior by increasing pressure and thus decreasing effective stress though thermal pressurization or by decreasing fluid pressure by dilatancy hardening. Tests on fault gouge from the San Andreas shows that the fault core has low permeability. The San Andreas would act as a barrier to fluid flow and could behaved as an undrained zone leading to dilantant hardening or thermal weakening.

Computing advancements have enabled structural engineers to perform advanced complex non-linear dynamic analyses procedures to take into consideration the uncertainties due to random ground motions in order to design robust structural systems. \n\nVarious non-linear dynamic analysis procedures, such as Incremental Dynamic Analysis, Multiple-Stripe Analysis, Cloud Analysis, can be used to perform probability-based seismic evaluation of a structure using real ground motions or simulated ground motions. Such methods can be employed to perform both a particular parameter estimation for specific probabilistic assessment, as well as direct probabilistic performance analysis. Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA) involves scaling of one or more ground motions, at various intensity levels, which generates one or more plots of response parameters versus different intensity levels. Cloud Analysis method is less restrictive in comparison to the previous method, since analyses can be performed at any level of intensity. Multiple-Stripe Analysis (MSA) is another method where non-linear dynamic analyses are performed for a suite of ground motions at a certain intensity level. This process is repeated at multiple levels of intensity, which in turn produces parameterized response at corresponding levels of intensity. The truncated MSA approach can be used to avoid excessive scaling of ground motions and reduce the computational effort. \n\nThe aforementioned methods have been analyzed in terms of ease of applicability, computational demand and accuracy of their results using non-stationary simulated ground motions. As a case study, displacement-based seismic performance of a steel moment resisting frame for an actual structure is studied. Various techniques to compute the fragility functions are discussed.

The introduction and development of laparoscopy in the late 20$^{th}$ century proved that MIS could be implemented safely and effectively.  Laparoscopy provided both an effective alternative to traditional open surgery as well as benefits including reductions in patient recovery time, pain, probability of infection, and cosmetic scaring.  In a similar fashion, a developing endoscopic MIS technique called Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) has the potential to provide surgical alternatives which completely eliminate the need for external incisions, resulting in obvious patient care benefits.  \n\nPerformance of the endoscopic tools used during endoscopic and NOTES procedures is extremely limited by strict size constraints, thereby significantly impeding the development of experimental MIS procedures.  The focus of this work is the design, analysis, and testing of a multifunctional 3.0 mm diameter endoscopic forceps for use in MIS.  Models of the proposed design predict considerable improvements in opening range and force application for both grasping and spreading when compared to currently used endoscopic forceps.  Electrocautery ability is also provided to increase tool utility; studies are conducted to evaluate cautery performance relative to commercial products.  In addition to possessing multifunctional grasping, spreading, and cautery abilities, the tool's design promotes fail-safe malfunctions, including locking prior to failure and a decreased likelihood of part fracture.  In order to increase tool utility, a means of providing articulation ability to the tool is investigated.  Increased instrument dexterity is desirable for manipulation of tissue in remote regions, but size constraints prevent practical implementation of dextrous endoscopic tools.  A practical means of classifying dextrous manipulators is presented and used to evaluate the potential for scalability to the meso level (1-5 mm diameter).  A compliant design which provides articulation ability at the meso scale is introduced and evaluated based on practical efficacy.  Results of this evaluation indicate that the concept possesses potential for articulation ability.\n\nExperimental endoscopic procedures often necessitate unique tool performance requirements which currently available tools do not meet.  Scaling current tool concepts to the meso level often results in significant performance losses, thereby hindering the development of novel medical procedures.

Pregnancy is a unique time in a woman\u2019s life that is accompanied by substantial changes in body shape and weight that are likely to impact her body image satisfaction. However, there is a paucity of research examining body image satisfaction in pregnancy with a scant understanding of the biological, psychological, and social influences that may impact women\u2019s body image throughout pregnancy. Study Purpose. The primary purpose of this thesis was to prospectively examine the moderating influence of prepregnancy weight status on the biopsychosocial determinants of body image satisfaction in pregnancy. The secondary purpose was to assess if first trimester body image satisfaction mediated the relationship between first trimester depressive symptoms, gestational weight gain, and exercise behavior and its motivational determinants and second trimester body image satisfaction. Hypotheses. It was hypothesized that group differences would be observed in both the first and second trimesters such that normal weight women would have better body image satisfaction, less depressive symptoms, less gestational weight gain, higher exercise behavior and motivational determinants for exercise than overweight/obese women. It was also hypothesized that first trimester body image satisfaction would mediate the relationship between first trimester depressive symptoms, gestational weight gain, and exercise behavior and second trimester body image satisfaction. Methods. A prospective study design was conducted in which 209 pregnant women completed measures of their body image satisfaction, depressive symptoms, gestational weight gain, exercise behavior and its motivational determinants, and demographics in the first and second trimesters. Women were classified as normal, overweight, and obese weight categories based on their prepregnancy weight status. Results. Normal weight women had significantly higher first trimester body image satisfaction compared to overweight and obese women and significantly higher second trimester body image satisfaction compared to obese women. Compared to overweight women, women of normal weight status also had a significantly greater increase in body image satisfaction from first to second trimester. Also, first trimester body image satisfaction was found to mediate the relationship between first trimester depression and second trimester body image satisfaction. First trimester body image satisfaction was also found to partially mediate the relationship between first trimester gestational weight gain and second trimester body image satisfaction. Conclusions. The preliminary findings demonstrate that body image satisfaction is experienced differently based on a woman\u2019s prepregnancy weight status. They also illustrate that explaining body image satisfaction in pregnancy may be better understood by examining trimester specific changes in body image satisfaction as well as the influences of depressive symptoms and gestational weight gain in pregnancy. Finally, a biopsychosocial approach may provide a conceptual framework for understanding and explaining body image satisfaction and its related biological, psychological, and social correlates. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1788], "author_name_tesi": "Rauff, Erica ", "last_name_ssi": "Rauff", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Erica", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Danielle Symons Downs", "Danielle Symons Downs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Danielle Symons Downs, Thesis Advisor", "Danielle Symons Downs, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["body image satisfaction", "exercise behavior", "gestational weight gain", "depression", "pregnancy"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Understanding Strategies to Manage Gestational Weight Gain in Overweight/obese Prenatal Women: Integrating Theory, Technology, and Healthcare Provider Beliefs", "id": "19901", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9384", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The overall purpose of this dissertation is to understand strategies for how to better manage gestational weight gain (GWG) in overweight and obese pregnant women (OW/OBPW). To accomplish this aim, three studies were conducted to examine the roles of theoretical determinants of GWG, technology for delivering interventions to manage weight, and OBGYN healthcare providers\u2019 preferences regarding the clinical management of GWG and the use of technology to promote healthy eating and physical activity (PA) behaviors for managing GWG.  The first study aimed to examine how the motivational determinants of PA within the framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior predicted PA intention and PA behavior across pregnancy trimesters and if the motivational determinants of PA and PA behavior predict GWG. Results from the first study suggest that the primary predictors of intention were perceived behavioral control (PBC; 1st to 2nd trimester) and attitude (ATT; 2nd to 3rd trimester). The primary predictor of PA behaviors was intention (INT; from both the 1st to 2nd and 2nd to 3rd trimesters). Weight status (normal weight vs. OW/OB) also moderated the relationship between INT, SN, and PA behavior with GWG such that subjective norm (SN) was a stronger predictor of GWG for OW/OBPW whereas INT and PA behavior were stronger predictors of GWG in normal weight women. Findings from study one provide evidence for targeting different constructs in OW/OBPW than in normal weight women, particularly focusing on OW/OBPW\u2019s SN as well as INT since INT was the most salient predictor of PA behavior The second study aimed to descriptively review e-health interventions for weight loss, weight maintenance, or prevention of weight gain in non-prenatal adults to identify unique intervention characteristics used in OW/OB adults and to determine if the effectiveness of e-health interventions differed by weight status groups. Study two findings illustrated that unique differences were observed such that interventions in OW/OB adults were more intensive and included greater face-to-face counseling, more regular contact with participants, more feedback to participants about their behaviors, and were longer in duration than those studies conducted in normal weight adults. A small number of studies in both populations were theoretically-based and few studies examined intervention fidelity or user acceptability of the technology, thus, highlighting the need to include these components in future behavioral interventions for weight loss in OW/OB adults, and particularly when considering the development of prenatal interventions for managing GWG. Finally, study three aimed to examine OBGYN providers\u2019 beliefs and preferences for incorporating e-health technology into prenatal care, barriers in using e-health technology in prenatal care, and perceptions of their patients\u2019 barriers in using e-health technology to monitor diet and PA behaviors to manage GWG. Study three results suggests that providers appear to be recommending technology (i.e., websites) for their patients even if they aren\u2019t currently using any in their clinical care or counseling with their patients. Providers\u2019 responses are important for understanding what type of tool may be feasible for providers to use (e.g., smartphone applications), how often and with what patients (e.g., high risk women such as OW/OBPW) they would be likely to use the technology with. Collectively, these studies suggest that future prenatal interventions for managing GWG in OW/OBPW should consider using e-health approaches endorsed by providers that are theoretically-based and include constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior (e.g., SN, INT, PBC) as well as measures of intervention fidelity to ensure that interventions are delivered effectively.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9185], "author_name_tesi": "Rauff, Erica ", "last_name_ssi": "Rauff", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Erica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Danielle Symons Downs", "Danielle Symons Downs", "Richard Scott Legro", "Jennifer Savage", "Melissa Jean Bopp"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Danielle Symons Downs, Dissertation Advisor", "Danielle Symons Downs, Committee Chair", "Richard Scott Legro, Committee Member", "Jennifer Savage, Committee Member", "Melissa Jean Bopp, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pregnancy", "weight gain", "technology", "theory", "provider beliefs"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "IDENTITY AS A FRAMEWORK FOR METAPHOR USE IN CANCER MESSAGES DESIGNED FOR RURAL, LOW-INCOME, OLDER ADULT WOMEN \n", "id": "7597", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2805", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-01-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Health communicators are often charged with the difficult task of communicating complex medical or scientific information to lay audiences.  In the case of Phase III cancer clinical trials, communication efforts must help audiences understand both the medical and scientific aspects of treatment. Previous research has found that aversion to the scientific component, specifically randomization to a treatment condition, is a primary reason why individuals choose not to enroll in clinical trials. As a result, healthcare providers often use metaphorical language as a linguistic strategy to increase understanding and hopefully acceptance of randomization to treatment among patients. However, the effectiveness of this message strategy to produce outcomes favorable to clinical trial enrollment is unknown. Guided by McGuire\u2019s (1972) model of information processing, this study examined outcomes associated with randomization messages including attention, comprehension, yielding, arousal, and behavioral intention among a medically underserved audience of rural, low-income, older adult women. Formative research conducted with the intended audience led to the development of stimulus videos about randomization. A four-message condition between subjects pretest-posttest laboratory study was used to empirically test the effectiveness of these messages. Culturally tailored metaphor messages were compared to a conventional metaphor, a scientific definition, or attention control on outcomes specified in McGuire\u2019s model for information processing. No main effects for message strategy were found, however, message strategy significantly interacted with attention to predict posttest behavioral intentions.  Implications of these findings for rural health message design are discussed.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2801], "author_name_tesi": "Raup-Krieger, Janice L.", "last_name_ssi": "Raup-Krieger", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Janice", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum", "Roxanne Louise Parrott", "Michael L Hecht", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa", "S.
