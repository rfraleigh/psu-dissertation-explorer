Observations can be viewed as points in a high-dimensional space with coordinates given by values of the variables. It is common for observations to have nonzero values in only a few dimensions, i.e., the data are sparse. We seek to exploit the sparsity of the data by interpreting the observations as a sparse graph and manipulating its geometry (or embedding) in a high-dimensional space. Our goal is to obtain algorithms that demonstrate high accuracy for key problems in data analysis and parallel scientific computing. \n\nThe first part of this dissertation focuses on combining geometry and sparse graph structure to yield more accurate classification algorithms for data mining. We have developed a feature subspace transformation (FST) scheme that transforms the data iteratively and provides a better selection of features to improve unsupervised classification, also known as clustering. FST utilizes the combinatorial structure of the entity relationship graph and high-dimensional geometry of the sparse data to iteratively bring related entities closer, which enhances clustering. Our approach improves clustering quality relative to established schemes such as K-Means and multilevel K-Means (GraClus). Next we consider transformations to enhance supervised classification with prelabeled data. We obtain similarity graph neighborhoods (SGN) in the high-dimensional feature subspace of the training data and transform it by determining displacements for each entity. Our SGN classifier is a supervised learning scheme that is trained on these transformed data. The goal of our SGN transform is to increase the separation between means of different classes, such that the classifier learns a better boundary. Our results indicate that a linear discriminant and support vector machine classification on these SGN transformed data improves accuracy by 5.0% and 4.52%, respectively. \n\nThe second part of this dissertation focuses on utilizing geometry and the structure of sparse graphs to enhance the quality and performance of algorithms for parallel scientific computing. We develop a parallel scheme, ScalaPart, for partitioning a large sparse graph into k subgraphs such that the number of cross edges is reduced. Our scheme combines a parallel graph embedding with a parallel geometric partitioning scheme to yield a scalable approach suitable for multicore-multiprocessors. Our analysis of ScalaPart demonstrates its scalability, and our empirical evaluation indicates that the performance of ScalaPart and the quality of cuts compares well with established schemes such as ParMetis and PT-Scotch. Next, we consider scalable sparse linear system solution which plays a key role in many applications including data mining with support vector machines and partial differential equation-based modeling and simulation. Our graph partitioning algorithm can be used to yield a nested dissection fill-reducing ordering and a tree for structuring numeric computations for the solution of sparse linear systems. We develop a hybrid linear solver that couples tree-structured direct and iterative solves for repeated right-hand side solutions. Our results indicate that our hybrid solver is 1.87 times faster than preconditioned conjugate gradients (PCG) based methods for achieving same levels of accuracy.\n\nIn conclusion, this dissertation demonstrates that by combining geometric and combinatorial properties of sparse graphs and matrices, we can enhance algorithms that are commonly used in knowledge discovery through modeling and simulation.    \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [483], "author_name_tesi": "Chatterjee, Anirban ", "last_name_ssi": "Chatterjee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anirban", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Padma Raghavan", "Padma Raghavan", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Suzanne Michelle Shontz", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Padma Raghavan, Dissertation Advisor", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Chair", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Member", "Suzanne Michelle Shontz, Committee Member", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sparse graph embedding", "sparse graph partitioning", "data mining", "sparse linear solvers"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Narcissism in the Executive Suite: Implications for Strategic Decision-making and CEO Behavior", "id": "9809", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "567", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this three-essay dissertation I explore the extent to which individual differences, specifically narcissism, in CEOs might be useful for advancing the understanding of executive behavior.

In the second essay, I investigate the impact of two different sources of CEO confidence on risk-taking behavior. I propose that in the face of a given decision, capability cues and dispositional narcissism affect a state of confidence in CEOs, which in turn leads to risk-taking behavior. I discuss three kinds of capability cues \u2013 recent organizational performance, recent media praise for the CEO, and recent CEO awards \u2013 that can contribute to CEO confidence. I find evidence that, in general, CEOs engage in greater levels of risk-taking in response to capability cues. However, less narcissistic CEOs are more sensitive to objective performance cues than high narcissistic CEOs are. High narcissistic CEOs are more sensitive to social adulation than their less narcissistic counterparts are. In the third essay, I explore the credit-taking and blame-deflecting aspect of narcissistic CEOs. I find evidence that following poor performance, departure of top managers increased much more for high narcissists than they did for low narcissists.

We are investigating the molecular mechanism underlying material-induced blood-plasma coagulation focusing on the role of the surface as a step towards prospective development of improved hemocompatible biomaterials.\nA classic observation in hematology is that blood/blood-plasma in contact with clean glass surface clots faster than when in contact with many plastic surfaces.  The traditional biochemical theory explaining the underlying molecular mechanism suggests that hydrophilic surfaces, like that of glass, are specific activators of the coagulation cascade because of the negatively-charged groups on the surface.  Hydrophobic surfaces are poor procoagulants or essentially \u201cbenign\u201d because they lack anionic groups.  Further, these negatively-charged surfaces are believed to not only activate blood factor XII (FXII), the key protein in contact activation, but also play a cofactor role in the amplification and propagation reactions that ultimately lead to clot formation.\nIn sharp contrast to the traditional theory, our investigations indicate a need for a paradigm shift in the proposed sequence of contact activation events to incorporate the role of protein adsorption at the material surfaces.  These studies have lead to the central hypothesis for this work proposing that protein adsorption to hydrophobic surfaces attenuates the contact activation reactions so that poorly-adsorbent hydrophilic surfaces appear to be stronger procoagulants relative to hydrophobic surfaces. \nOur preliminary studies measuring the plasma coagulation response of activated FXII (FXIIa) on different model surfaces suggested that the material did not play a cofactor role in the processing of this enzyme dose through the coagulation pathway.  Therefore, we focused our efforts on studying the mechanism of initial production of enzyme at the procoagulant surface.\nCalculations for the amounts of FXIIa generated at material surfaces in plasma using a mathematical model for measured coagulation responses indicate that the relative contributions of the individual pathways of enzyme generation are similar at both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, only the amounts of enzyme generated scale with surface energy and area of the activating surface.\nFurther, from direct measurement of enzyme activation at test surfaces we observed that contact activation reactions are not specific to negatively-charged hydrophilic surfaces.  Rather, the molecular interactions are attenuated at hydrophobic surfaces due to protein adsorption so that poorly-adsorbent hydrophilic surfaces exhibit an apparent specificity for contact activation reactions.\nPreliminary studies were preformed to assay the plasma coagulation response to low-fouling surfaces prepared by either grafting poly(ethylene glycol) chains or using zwitterions.  Results indicate that poly(ethylene glycol)-modified surfaces are significantly weaker procoagulants  than surfaces containing zwitterions underscoring a need to specifically evaluate the coagulation response despite similarities in observed protein adsorption to both surfaces. \nIn summary, our studies demonstrate a need to incorporate protein-adsorption competition at procoagulant surfaces into the mechanism of contact activation to account for the observed moderation of FXII activation by blood proteins unrelated to the plasma coagulation cascade.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3553], "author_name_tesi": "Chatterjee, Kaushik ", "last_name_ssi": "Chatterjee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kaushik", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Alan Siedlecki", "Erwin A Vogler", "William O Hancock", "Alan J Stenger", "Ira Joseph Ropson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Alan Siedlecki, Committee Chair", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Alan J Stenger, Committee Member", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["blood coagulation", "contact activation", "protein adsorption", "intrinsic coagulation cascade", "factor XII", "plasma proteases"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The FCC's low power FM policy: Station personnel's interpretation of policy objectives and its impact on implementation.", "id": "17603", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8457", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Social policies are means by which the government ensures every member of the community certain minimum standards of living and a degree of equality in opportunities for pursuing important life goals. However, social policies are only effective if the problems are clearly defined. Evaluation of policy implementation is an important stage of the policy process because it helps in measuring the outcomes of the policy and comparing them to policy objectives. Evaluation helps in modifying implementation of ongoing policies so that they are more successful in achieving their objectives or, in case a program that have already reached its\u2019 termination, add to the public policy knowledge base.\n The Federal Communication Commission (FCC) initiated the Low Power FM (LPFM) service in 2000 in an attempt to increase diversity and localism in the public platform. The policy launched two non-commercial services - LP10 and LP100. These low powered stations were expected to satisfy highly local interests that were not being fulfilled by the full power commercial and non-commercial radio stations. It was a means for small local community based organizations to communicate over the airwaves, encourage diverse voices and help linguistic and cultural minorities or groups with shared civic or educational interests.  It has been thirteen years since its inception and the time has come to examine if the LPFM policy is making progress in its agenda to introduce more localism and diversity in the media.\n\tIn this study, three types of LPFMs \u2013 general interest, religious and minority \u2013 have been compared to understand how these LPFMs interpret the goals of the policy and if they actively work toward achieving them. Both minority and general interest LPFMs were selected because they represented the objectives of diversity and localism in LPFM policy. Religious LPFMs were selected not only because religious organizations have carved a niche for themselves in the LPFM community, but also because their presence has been felt and debated frequently by media scholars.  \nAs part of this research, FCC\u2019s documents were studied to better understand the LPFM policy objectives in order to compare them with the goals set by LPFM licensees for their radio stations. Interviews were conducted with LPFM personnel to explore how the minority, general interest and religious communities\u2019 stations described and included their community in operations of and content creation for their radio station, whether they used the resource to provide content different from the mainstream media, and whether they have succeeded in fulfilling their community\u2019s information needs and have become media hubs for their communities. As a source of additional information, the available websites of LPFMs included in the study were examined to understand how they addressed their audience, and if their programs catered to only the entertainment needs of their community or were they providing information too, as well as how far LPFMs were involved with their communities. \nAnalysis of all the documents collected revealed that the three different types of LPFMs are using their low power radio stations differently. While religious LPFMs concentrate only on spiritual development of its listeners, general interest LPFMs either provide entertainment or are very involved with spreading social awareness on health, finance and politics. In case of minority LPFMs, some differences were observed between minority religious LPFMs \u2013 religious LPFMs that either catered to a minority community or were owned by a minority community, and non-religious minority LPFMs. While the non-religious minority LPFMs played a very important role in the community providing employment, health, religious information along with legal advice and news, the religious minority LPFMs focused on spiritual development and to a lesser degree, on education, health and family. However, unlike religious LPFMs, minority religious LPFMs were more socially aware, and more connected with their community, some of them even advertising community projects. Hence, although they were focused on religion, they also had programs about employment, health, finance, and family relationships. \nThe study concluded that minority LPFMs were most successful in providing for their community\u2019s needs while some general interest LPFMs, were relevant for their community. Religious LPFMs, however, displayed a disinterest in using their LPFMs to their full potential and were satisfied to provide gospel and religious teachings.\nThe study concluded that although LPFM policy has a lot of potential, the FCC needs to better define its goals and objectives, and put in place guidelines and parameters to help LPFMs licensees provide the service that FCC envisioned from its LPFM policy.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8364], "author_name_tesi": "Chatterjee, Nivedita ", "last_name_ssi": "Chatterjee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nivedita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Krishna Prasad Jayakar", "Amit Schejter", "Richard Denny Taylor", "Marylee Carmel Taylor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Krishna Prasad Jayakar, Dissertation Advisor", "Amit Schejter, Committee Chair", "Richard Denny Taylor, Committee Member", "Marylee Carmel Taylor, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["LPFMs", "media policy evaluation", "low power radio"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Fictive Images and the Feminist Democratic Imagination", "id": "9515", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5804", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation titled \u201cFictive Images and the Feminist Democratic Imagination,\u201d examines post-9/11 identity politics through Art Spiegelman\u2019s craft of cartooning. Using Spiegelman\u2019s work on 9/11, In The Shadow Of No Towers (2004), I study both his style of image making (cartoons) and his images (cartoon figures of animals and ghosts) to reflect on new possibilities for feminist democratic theory and politics. I use the term \u201cfictive images\u201d to describe the cartoon images that work beyond categorical oppositions of the fictional and non-fictional. Fictive images constitute a mode of visualization which in its blurring of the identity categories of the human and real, deftly illuminates the construction of these categories themselves. Wedded to deconstructive ways of knowing, fictive images are a mode of visualizing (im)possibilities that have been rendered unintelligible by dominant ways of perceiving the world. By focusing on 9/11 my dissertation situates these reflections as a response to working through the trauma of the event. It is the ethic of possibility that fuels my project, an attempt to unwrap the emancipatory potentials of feminist democratic politics in speaking to the needs of our times. What kind of feminist politics can speak to 9/11 without being trapped in its vicious circle of violence? How do we move beyond simply mirroring the present conditions where we are unwittingly legitimating the very divisions we seek to contest? Fictive images dare to dream beyond codings, and provide a prism to visualize democratic politics after 9/11. \n\nIn my dissertation I explore how the apparently simple form of cartooning illuminates complex reality with breathtaking dexterity. Through their deceptive simplicity, cartoons demonstrate the freedom to play with ideas, to reveal contradictions which necessitate thinking beyond prescriptions. By playing with normal pictures, Spiegelman\u2019s cartoons undo a singular mode of seeing or doing. Animal cartoon images are used by Spiegelman to problematize identity constructions and emphasize stereotypes. They provide a means to work through issues of accurate representation by playing on the category of \u201chuman\u201d itself. While Aristotle and other political theorists use the \u201canimal\u201d to affirm man\u2019s political identity, Spiegelman uses animals as a means of \u201cundoing identity.\u201d These animals exhibit the active tension in a politics that creates boundaries (of form, territory, and ideology). The animals haunt our notion of human differences. The cartooned ghost images work alongside the animal images. Spiegelman\u2019s ghost image in In The Shadow Of No Towers is a picture of the North Tower glowing with fire. The \u201chaunting\u201d is a means for Spiegelman to work through the trauma of the past and the present. This directs our attention to a \u201cpolitics\u201d throbbing with \u201clife\u201d in its very engagement with its \u201cghosts.\u201d \n\nI propose specter-cular democracy as counter politics to the present. Premised on a deconstructive and utopian ethos, specter-cular democracy would be in constant conversation with otherness and alterity. Blurring boundaries and boundedness, specter-cular democracy is transformative and regenerative in inspiring mobile becomings fueled by the democratic energy of incessant yearnings. I theorize on future-oriented feminist democratic politics through the prism of specter-cular democracy. This mode of doing politics would provide an antidote to the politics of binaries which encapsulate the \u201cother.\u201d It would showcase the tenuousness of our social constructions, their investments. Irreverent of the \u201creal,\u201d a future oriented feminist democratic politics would be border-crossing, borders of conventions, identities, nations, and bodies. I argue for a democratic image (ination) vibrantly alive and ebullient, conscious of its processual quality, and tuned to a constant process of becoming. My project theorizes about transformative politics through visual images. I emphasize that image (de)building can astutely showcase our world building, an indispensable analytical motivation. Living at all times with/in images, I argue that by playing with images, re-imagining them, we can re-envision democratic prospects and possibilities. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5800], "author_name_tesi": "Chatterjee, Sushmita ", "last_name_ssi": "Chatterjee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sushmita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Nancy Love", "Professor Nancy Love", "Joan Landes", "Susan Merrill Squier", "John Philip Christman", "Professor Mrinalini Sinha", "Professor P J Brendese"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof Nancy Love, Dissertation Advisor", "Professor Nancy Love, Committee Chair", "Joan Landes, Committee Member", "Susan Merrill Squier, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Professor Mrinalini Sinha, Committee Member", "Professor P J Brendese, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["visual politics", "cartoon", "transnational feminism", "democratic imagination", "art spiegelman", "9/11"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Investigating the Energy Footprints of Conventional Fac\u0327ade Systems in comparison to Modern Multi-layered Fac\u0327ade Systems", "id": "15263", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7693", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although building designers typically use components based on prescribed R- Values and U-Values from the manufacturers, the selection of components does not guarantee higher performance.

It is also concerned with the extent to which competition on the entrepreneurial side of the market and the informational environment may make such commitment sequentially rational. The final chapter studies an exchange environment with weak protection of property rights so that power is the basis of exchange. With property rights and income distribution constantly in flux, the question is whether the imperative to maintain stability can act as a constraint on classical allocative efficiency.  \n\nIn Chapter 1, a new feature pertaining to proposer's ability to implement offers is introduced in the extensive form bargaining mechanism studied in Okada (1996). This mechanism is used to analyze two classes of coalitional games with transferable utility. One class is that of strictly supermodular games; the other has the property that per capita value is increasing as a coalition adds to its members. The new feature in the mechanism is that the proposer has a choice to implement his proposal with any subset of responders who have accepted it. It is shown that for all sufficiently high discount factors, there exists an efficient subgame perfect equilibrium in pure stationary strategies (SSPE) whose limiting outcome is the core-constrained Nash Bargaining Solution. For strictly supermodular games, Core constraints are binding on Nash Bargaining Solution while for the other class they are not. Also, all efficient SSPE are payoff-equivalent in the limit as the discount factor goes to 1.\n\nIn Chapter 2, a new feature pertaining to proposer's ability to implement offers is introduced in the extensive form bargaining mechanism studied in Chatterjee, Dutta, Ray and Sengupta (1996). This mechanism is used to analyze two classes of coalitional games with transferable utility. One class is that of strictly supermodular games; the other has the property that per capita value is increasing as a coalition adds to its members. The new feature in the mechanism is that the proposer has a choice to implement his proposal with any subset of responders who have accepted it. It is shown that for all sufficiently high discount factors, there exists an efficient subgame perfect equilibrium in pure stationary strategies (SSPE) whose limiting outcome is the core-constrained Nash Bargaining Solution. For strictly supermodular games, Core constraints are binding on Nash Bargaining Solution while for the other class they are not. \n\nIn Chapter 3 which is coauthored with my advisor Kalyan Chatterjee, a simple contracting environment with a creditor who has wealth and a entrepreneur who has a two-period investment project is studied. After observing the partial completion of the project at the end of first period, the creditor may decide whether to refinance it or liquidate it. Contracting is subject to moral hazard and limited liability each period. The creditor prefers a contract that commits him not to refinance if and only if the extent of moral hazard problem is sufficiently high. Such a commitment may not be sequentially rational, however. The role of competition and hidden information in enforcing commitment is studied. When credit supply is scarce and the creditor lacks commitment, competition from other potential entrepreneurs may not be a credible deterrent against refinancing because of the wedge between the liquidation value of the output and its value as an input for second period. Sufficient conditions are developed under which hidden information makes commitment sequentially rational.  \n\nIn Chapter 4, an equilibrium existence theorem is established for a stochastic game model with discounted payoffs in which at each date every player has opportunities to redefine the prevailing state. A state in the model is a property rights allocation over an asset and a distribution of income from the asset among all the players. Property rights may be held by coalitions which may differ in terms of their power and their productivity with the asset. A transition from one state to another is feasible if the proposed owning coalition is at least as powerful as the current owning coalition and everyone in the proposed owning coalition consents to the change. State transitions in the stochastic game are endogenous because they are constrained by players' threat positions which are endogenous. A stylized example illustrates that when power is the basis of exchange, stability may be a constraint on classical allocative efficiency. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11072], "author_name_tesi": "Chaturvedi, Rakesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Chaturvedi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rakesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "James Schuyler Jordan", "Vijay Krishna", "Sona Nadenichek Golder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Dissertation Advisor", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "James Schuyler Jordan, Committee Member", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Member", "Sona Nadenichek Golder, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bargaining", "coalitions", "political economy", "contracts", "stable property rights"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "High Pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition to Obtain Step-Index and Bragg Optical Fibers", "id": "14582sqc5288", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "14582", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Optical fibers are usually made of thin glass strands that can transmit light and have become the backbone of modern communication technology. Apart from communication, they are used in medical applications, sensing, cutting and drilling, as fiber lasers etc. Traditionally optical fibers are made by drawing preforms under high temperature thereby limiting the materials that can be incorporated to mostly glass and polymers. Incorporation of other materials in optical fibers can greatly increase their functionalities and open up several other applications that were previously not possible with these fibers. Badding lab came up with an alternate strategy of high pressure chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD) inside silica capillaries to obtain multimaterial fibers. Various metals, semiconductors and insulators can be deposited inside silica capillaries using HPCVD thereby enabling new fiber functionalities. \nChapter 1 offers a brief journey into the history of optical fibers and the variety of different fibers that are currently available. Electromagnetic waves are governed by Maxwell\u2019s equations, which can be solved to understand the propagation of light through optical fibers. However, rigorous solution for different fiber structures can become complicated and hence numerical modeling methods can help understand light propagation more easily. I have used modeling using COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae software to understand light propagation in different types of optical fibers, which forms the basis of chapter 2.  HPCVD inside silica capillaries has been established as a great technique to fabricate multimaterial multifunctional fibers. However, this requires precise understanding of the deposition chemistry inside these confined capillaries under high temperature and pressure, which has been enumerated in chapter 3. The main focus of this dissertation is the fabrication of two different types of optical fibers \u2013 solid core step-index and hollow core Bragg fibers via HPCVD. The silica capillaries can be completely filled with semiconductors (such as silicon, germanium, silicon germanium) to form step-index optical fibers that guide light by total internal reflection. These semiconductors have wider transparency windows and larger nonlinear optical coefficients than silica and hence the semiconductor core fibers can have numerous optical applications, which I explain in chapter 4. HPCVD can also be used to fabricate hollow core optical fibers such as Bragg fibers. Bragg fibers have hollow cores bound by alternating concentric layers of high and low refractive index materials. Such structure can confine light of particular wavelength (depending on the geometry) in the hollow core thereby enabling low loss transmission. I talk in details about the fabrication of all-inorganic Bragg fibers using HPCVD technique. These fibers have optical transmission higher than standard polymer Bragg fibers available currently and can transmit very high peak power (density of 500 TWcm-2). They are currently being tested for high harmonic generation in the hollow cores to generate commercial tabletop X-Ray sources for imaging and ultrafast lasers.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15549], "author_name_tesi": "Chaudhuri, Subhasis ", "last_name_ssi": "Chaudhuri", "first_name_ssi": "Subhasis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John V Badding", "John V Badding", "David Allara", "Miriam Arak Freedman", "Zhiwen Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John V Badding, Dissertation Advisor", "John V Badding, Committee Chair", "David Allara, Committee Member", "Miriam Arak Freedman, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["High Pressure", "Chemical Vapor Deposition", "Optical Fiber", "Semiconductor", "Bragg Optical Fiber", "Step-index optical fiber"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Interrupt And IPC Driven Kernel Framework For Prevention Against Smartphone Malware\n", "id": "9374", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "455", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Smartphones have several network interfaces like WiFi, Bluetooth and GSM.

The computing power of such devices restricts the portability of security solutions from the desktop over to embedded systems.

Malware which attempts to perform these events tries to do so without the knowledge of the user and hence the events triggered are purely generated in software. The way to differentiate these events is to monitor the hardware interrupts generated by the keypad or touchscreen of the device, since it is the only way a real user can begin an event such as sending a message or making a call. Our framework resides entirely in the kernel and adopts a specification based prevention approach. The specification is defined by signatures of application behavior using their inter-process communication patterns. Using the hardware interrupt as a necessary event for any function of the device, followed by a signature defined communication pattern, we are able to prevent two of the most common attacks (messaging and covert audio channel attacks) found on mobile devices.

Financial participation schemes are divided into two groups first of which consists of stock options, employee share schemes, individual bonus and performance based pay and second of profit sharing and group based bonus. Based on the analysis in this study I found that the hypothesized order of expected value of that relevant financial participation schemes are used by a company, given the type of capitalism under which it operates, is not supported. A different pattern does emerge however and hence makes it desirable to study this phenomenon more analytically before doing further empirical research.

Previous studies have shown that falls occurred most frequently during walking. To identify individuals at high risk of falling, we need objective measures which are reliable, valid and easily applicable to quantify fall risk. Gait variability and local dynamic instability have been shown to be able to distinguish healthy gait and fall-prone gait. This dissertation explores gait variability and local dynamic stability of foot and trunk in human walking using accelerometers. Three studies were conducted to examine: (1) how the intra-session and inter-session reliability of gait variability and local dynamic stability was affected by the number of strides analyzed, walking conditions and calculation methods, (2) the effect of walking speed on gait variability and local dynamic stability and (3) how gait variability and local dynamic stability differs between left and right foot under different walking conditions. \nIn all three studies, the gait variability investigated were stride time variability and the variability of foot and trunk accelerations. The local dynamic instability was quantified using short-term and long-term local divergence exponents. In Study 1 and 3, four different walking conditions at preferred walking speed were examined, namely treadmill, overground on a rectangular path, clockwise and counterclockwise on a circular path. In Study 2, five different walking speeds at 60%, 80%, 100%, 120% and 140% of preferred walking speed on a treadmill were investigated. \nIn Study 1, the results suggest that the optimal reliability of the variability of acceleration and short-term local divergence exponents may be achieved with at least 75 strides. The intra-session reliability may be improved by research design that minimizes the variability in experimental settings and equipments. Overall, the reliability was better when gait variability and local divergence exponents were calculated using foot accelerations compared to trunk accelerations. Gait variability and long-term local divergence exponents were more consistent in counter-clockwise than clockwise walking, suggesting that these variables may be linked to turning preference and limb dominance. In Study 2, the results revealed that stride time variability decreased with walking speed. The variability of acceleration and long-term local divergence exponents increased with walking speed. The effect of walking speed on short-term local divergence exponents varied depending on calculation methods. Collectively, these results suggest that future studies should control walking speed when these variables are compared between different groups or conditions. In Study 3, the variability of acceleration was larger for the left foot compared to the right foot in all walking conditions except in the medial-lateral direction, implying that motor lateralization may influence the control of lower limbs motion. The short-term local divergence exponents were not different between left foot and right foot in all walking conditions except in the medial-lateral direction, suggesting that motor lateralization may not affect the control of gait stability and that gait variability and local dynamic instability are different quantities which reflect different aspect of gait characteristics.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14463], "author_name_tesi": "Chavanaves, Sakdapong ", "last_name_ssi": "Chavanaves", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sakdapong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert B.

Such a system can have immediate and substantial impact on saving lives.  Military convoys in particular often operate in dusty conditions or adverse weather, and existing radar-based collision detection systems can have degraded performance in these situations.  This thesis proposes a collision warning system that is based on a GPS receiver and wireless network for transferring data between convoy vehicles.  In order to meet the accuracy requirements outlined by others for successful collision avoidance, this work focuses on improving the vehicle velocity measurements which are not sufficient by themselves.  The GPS receiver measurements are fused with readings from a MEMS accelerometer in a Kalman filter.  The Kalman filter greatly increases the performance of the proposed collision warning system with only a slight increase in cost.

In the \u00afrst analytic stage, `concerted cultivation,' as identi\u00afed by\nLareau (2003) in a recent ethnographic study, is captured as a latent variable using in-\ndicators of (a) parental participation with school, (b) child participation in organized\nleisure activities, (c) and academic resources in the home. Using traditional SEM and\nIRT modeling techniques, these items are conceptualized as the product of a higher-order\nfactor, labeled `concerted cultivation,' which embodies a cultural logic of child-rearing.\nNot only does the evidence support a generalization of Lareau's (2003) observations from\na small local sample to the U.S. population, the factor structure of concerted cultivation\nis highly stable over time and the latent construct varies positively with increasing social\nclass and advantage on other sociodemographic characteristics, largely in accord with\nexpectations.

Findings based on three-level\npiecewise growth models with school-level \u00afxed-e\u00aeects illustrate that the measure of con-\ncerted cultivation is an important predictor of children's early academic competencies,\nparticularly at kindergarten entry, while also mediating race and class di\u00aeerences in chil-\ndren's growth.

Modified casein micelles are extensively investigated as encapsulating and delivery agents for various hydrophobic low molecular weight probes. The ability of modified casein micelles to bind hydrophobic probes may derive from the binding affinity of native casein micelles. The objective of the present work is to evaluate the binding properties of native casein micelles by evaluating their association with lipophilic phospholipids including sphingomyelins (SM) and phosphatidylcholines (PC) and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) appearing in bovine milk. SM and PC are the major source of choline needed for growth and development in newborns. On the contrary, partitioning of undesired hydrophobic API, appearing in dosed dairy animal, to casein proteins can result in accumulation of these API residues in dairy products making them unsafe for human consumption.\nNative casein micelles were separated from raw skim milk of cows (mid lactation) by using size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The extractions of casein micelle fractions for hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds followed by LC/MS analysis found 18 candidates including PC and SM showing at least 1000 times stronger peak areas associated with native casein micelles as compared to whey proteins and milk serum. Further analysis to characterize and quantify the association of  PC and SM with native casein micelles of varying sizes separated from milk of cows in early, mid and late lactations was performed. LC/MS/MS analysis of extracted native casein micelles (diameters; 149 nm \u2013 87 nm) showed that the highest concentrations of the SM d18:1/22:0 (341.1 \u00b1 17.36 \u00b5g) and PC 16:0/18:1(180.2 \u00b1 20.08 \u00b5g) per gram of casein protein were found associated with the largest casein micelles (149 nm) isolated from late lactation milk and decreased as the casein micelle size decreased. A strong positive correlation was found between the distribution of SM, PC in raw whole milk, raw skim milk and casein micelle fraction. A decreased concentration of lipophilic SM, PC with decreasing casein micelle size was positively correlated to previously report decreasing proportions of \u03b2-casein in smaller casein micelles due to decrease in hydrophobic domains available for interacting with hydrophobic compounds. Overall, contrary to the belief that lipophilic phospholipids such as SM and PC are present in significant amount in milk fat globule membrane in whole milk , 21-50% of most abundant SM and 16-25% of most abundant PC initially present in whole milk were found to appear in skim milk . Out of the total amount of most abundant SM and PC found in raw skim milk, 35-46% SM and 22-29% of PC were found associated with casein micelles. \nAnother study to evaluate the association of hydrophobic API with native casein micelles was performed using in vivo and in vitro approach. The in vitro study conducted by spiking the raw bovine milk with hydrophobic API showed ca.66 % meloxicam, ca.30% flunixin, ca.34% of metabolite 5-hydroxy flunixin, ca. 50% thiabendazole and ca.33% of metabolite 5-hydroxy thiabendazole partitioned into casein micelles. The in vivo distribution of the API meloxicam, 5-hydroxy flunixin and 5-hydroxy thiabendazole in milk collected from dosed Holstein cows (mid lactation) showed ca.30% API associated with the casein micelles. Although, the fat fraction of the bovine milk is considered to be a suitable carrier for lipophilic compounds, less than ca. 5.0% of the recovered hydrophobic API were found in fat fraction. No linear relationship between the hydrophobicities of API and their partition into casein micelles was found. \nThe present work supports the hypothesis that native casein micelles act as carriers for hydrophobic compounds appearing in bovine milk.

This analysis uses Six Sigma tools to develop an overview of the Blow Out Preventer production process and to identify key focus areas of the project. The preliminary analysis next focuses on the downstream final assembly process and identifies the assembly delays caused due to preassembly operations as the reason for long assembly lead time. These observations highlighted the need for a tool that could be used to plan, schedule and expedite activities at the assembly pad by taking the upstream delays into consideration.\nAn Assembly Delay Impact Tool (ADIT) has been created to assist in the planning and scheduling activities at the Stack Pad. This tool estimates the impact of delays on the assembly operations and hence assists in planning and expediting the upstream operations to meet the schedule. In order to develop the ADIT, assembly operations were standardized and a delay tracking tool was implemented. \nFinally the ability of the ADIT to accurately simulate the assembly schedule with delays is verified. ADIT was implemented for several BOP projects at the Assembly Pad (Stack Pad) and it was found that the final delivery date with delays was predicted with mean percentage deviation of 7.63% at a 95% confidence interval.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8879], "author_name_tesi": "Cheeran, Tebi Mathew", "last_name_ssi": "Cheeran", "middle_name_ssi": "Mathew", "first_name_ssi": "Tebi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt", "Dr Christopher Saldana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Christopher Saldana, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["custom engineered manufacturing", "process improvement", "scheduling", "MTO", "ETO"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Plant-associated Microbes For The Sustainable Production Of Faba Bean (vicia Faba L.)

It is also an essential component of the diet for many peasants in this region, as it is a source of calcium and protein. Faba bean production is limited by disease and drought in Bolivia. The major disease that affects faba production and reduces yields in Bolivia is chocolate spot, caused by Botrytis species (B. cinerea, B. fabae and B. fabiopsis). When humidity levels reach at least 90% and air temperatures are between 15-22\u00b0C the disease can harshly limit the growth of the infected plant and lead to yield losses of 50-100% (Zhang et al., 2010). Growing conditions in Bolivia are extremely conducive for Botrytis disease progression. Seed treatments of Bacillus subtilis (GB122) and B. amyloquefaciens (GB99) reduce chocolate spot disease (in green house trials) and promote faba growth (field trials) in Pennsylvania. Using these seed treatments hold promise to reduce chocolate spot in Bolivia. Currently the Bolivian government has approved registration for production and use of various Bacillus species at PROINPA. These include B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens strains that should be applied to faba seed in production fields across the Bolivian Andes.\n Over 200 Botrytis spp. isolates were collected from symptomatic tissue on of faba bean in fields in Pennsylvania. Sixteen of these isolates were selected to represent culture morphological characteristics. In order to understand disease caused by Botrytis species in Pennsylvania a phylogenetic analysis with 16 Botrytis isolates was performed. Four gene regions were sequenced; Gylceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), Heat-shock protein-60 (HSP60), RNA-dependent, DNA-polymerase subunit-2 (RPB2) and Internal transcribed spacer region 4/5 (ITS). These gene regions were used to create 4 neighbor-joining trees in MEGA. The results of this analysis indicate that chocolate spot of faba bean in Pennsylvania is caused by two distinct species, B. fabiopsis and B. cinerea. Botrytis fabiopsis was the most common isolate found in PA field trials in 2 years (2011 and 2013). This is the first report of B. fabiopsis  in Pennsylvania and the United States. Botrytis fabiopsis has similar culture growth characteristics to B. cinerea, however B. fabiopsis can only produce conidia from sclerotia (at near UV light) and on plant material. Botrytis cinerea can produce conidia from mycelium as well as sclerotia on plants.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9911], "author_name_tesi": "Cheesman, Hilary Kessler", "last_name_ssi": "Cheesman", "middle_name_ssi": "Kessler", "first_name_ssi": "Hilary", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Beth Krueger Gugino", "Paul Anthony Backman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Beth Krueger Gugino, Thesis Advisor", "Paul Anthony Backman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["faba", "sustainable agriculture", "plant-associated microbes", "Bacillus", "Andes", "Botrytis", "faba", "sustainable agriculture", "plant-associated microbes", "Bacillus", "Andes", "Botrytis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Contributions of EBNA-3C and BHRF1 to EBV latency", "id": "13757", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7013", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The strong association between Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) suggests that the virus might be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of BL. However, the role of the virus in BL pathogenesis has remained ambiguous. Deregulation of MYC appears to be the critical lymphomagenic event in the pathogenesis of BL, but disablement of apoptotic pathways is critical for the progression to malignancy. Thus, EBV could act as an infectious cofactor by blocking apoptosis. A monoclonal EBV genome is consistently detected in BL biopsies suggesting that infection occurs prior to the malignant outgrowth of the tumor. EBV uses its latency (non-productive infection) associated proteins efficiently to establish a life long survival in B cells with the potential to induce tumorigenesis under appropriate cellular environments.  Although Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) is the only viral protein known to be expressed in BL, there are additional viral proteins expressed in the recently described Wp-restricted BL, and the importance of these proteins for EBV-mediated immortalization of B cells in vitro suggests that EBV may make a greater contribution to Wp-restricted BL.  \nThe extended spectrum of EBV proteins expressed in Wp-restricted BL includes the latency associated protein EBNA-3C as well as BHRF1, a viral homologue of BCL-2 that is generally considered a lytic gene, but which is expressed early during the immortalization process of B cells in vitro. EBNA-3C is one of the six EBV latent proteins that are critical for B-cell immortalization and functions as a transcriptional regulator that represses cellular pro-apoptotic proteins such as p14ARF and BIM. To determine whether EBNA-3C or BHRF1 play a role in the development of Wp-restricted BL, we took both in vitro and in vivo approaches. First, we knocked down their expression in Wp-restricted BL cell lines using RNA interference. Interestingly, BHRF1 provided a significant growth advantage to Wp-restricted BLs. EBNA-3C had a modest effect on cell death despite the fact that loss of EBNA-3C resulted in increased levels of the proapoptotic protein BIM.  It is likely that BHRF1, which can protect cells from BIM-induced apoptosis, compensates for the loss of EBNA-3C. When E\u03bc-Myc mice were used as a model of BL, BHRF1 accelerated MYC-induced lymphomagenesis while EBNA-3C had no effect.  Because BHRF1 protected E\u03bc-myc derived pre-B cell cultures from apoptosis, the enhanced lymphomagenesis observed upon expression of BHRF1 is likely to be a result of its anti-apoptotic function. These findings suggest that BHRF1 has a critical role in the pathogenesis of Wp-restricted BL. \nIn addition to its ability to regulate apoptosis, EBNA-3C is known to affect cell cycle regulation. It has been shown that inactivation of EBNA-3C in LCLs leads to transcriptional upregulation of p16INK4a and reduction of hyperphosphorylated Rb, both which are cell cycle regulatory proteins. Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of EBNA-3C identified numerous functional domains and motifs found in many well characterized cellular transcriptional regulatory proteins. To evaluate the requirement of these functional domains of EBNA-3C for immortalization of primary resting B cells, we generated recombinant EBV carrying mutations in EBNA-3C and evaluated the ability of these viruses to immortalize primary B lymphocytes in vitro.  The RBP-J\u03ba/CBF1 and SUMO binding motif as well as bZIP domain were critical for the ability of EBNA-3C to immortalize B cells, whereas the CtBP binding motif and transactivation domain were not required. Furthermore, we determined that the RBP-J\u03ba/CBF1 binding domain of EBNA-3C is essential for the ability of EBV to downregulate the expression of BIM and p16INK4a. Further investigation is required to fully characterize the role of these domains in the immortalization of primary B cells. \nThe current study suggests that expression of BHRF1 enhances the tumorigenic potential of EBV and this finding has clinical implications. Lymphomas that carry dual translocations involving both MYC and antiapoptotic factor, BCL-2 are clinically aggressive with a very poor prognosis for the patients.  The fact that BHRF1 acts similarly to BCL-2 in accelerating lymphomagenesis in models of BL suggests that tumors expressing BHRF1 are very likely to have an aggressive clinical course. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. The identification of functional domains of EBNA-3C that are important for immortalization of B cells provides significant insight in our understanding of the essential role of EBNA-3C in EBV-mediated immortalization of B cells and eventually in BL pathogenesis.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7011], "author_name_tesi": "Cheeyancheri Chencheri, Satheesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheeyancheri Chencheri", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Satheesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clare E Sample", "Clare E Sample", "Jeffery Thomas Sample", "Jianming Hu", "Todd Schell", "Dr Jiyue Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clare E Sample, Dissertation Advisor", "Clare E Sample, Committee Chair", "Jeffery Thomas Sample, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "Dr Jiyue Zhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Epstein-Barr virus", "Burkitt lymphoma", "EBNA-3C", "BHRF1", "MYC", "Immortalization", "LCLs", "lymphomagenesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "3D multimodal image analysis for lung-cancer assessment", "id": "29568", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12670", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Integrated positron emission tomography (PET) / computed-tomography (CT) scanners give 3D multimodal data sets that provide both molecular activity and anatomical information.

How do real-world networks look like? How do they evolve over time?  How could we tell an abnormal evolving network from a normal one?   To be able to answer these questions, we proposed a novel analytical approach, lying at the intersection of graph theory and time series analysis, to study the network evolution process. Utilizing the notion of evolution formalizes a time domain in the problem.  Specifically, we model the evolution process through the creation of a sequence of sample graphs.  The idea of slicing the entire network evolution process by time stamps provides us a sequence of sampled graphs within the study period and engages the opportunity to take a time series like approach to tackle the problem.  \n\nOne of the major contributions of this thesis is to propose a novel approach, incorporating uni variate time series models into a sequence of time graphs, to solve the network evolution process.  Specifically, two algorithms: UN-TSN and DN-TSN is proposed to study the network evolution.  UN-TSN is proposed for simple network evolution process. It deals with network with unidirectional edges without multiple loops between nodes.  DN-TSN is proposed for general network evolution process. The second type of network evolution processes involves network with directional edges and with multiple loops between nodes.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work lying at the intersection of graph theory and time series analysis to study network evolution.\n\nIn addition, the proposed approaches provide the network research community an effective and efficient framework to study the evolution process of real-world networked systems.  Given general graph statistics, such as number of nodes, number of edges and node degree, the proposed model is capable of producing a reliable predictive graph preserving the respective key principles that govern the graph structures.  A predictive graph of this kind is very useful in the context of extrapolations as well as in the detection of abnormally patterns.  Specifically, our model not only helps form a basis of validating scenarios for graph evolution but also capable of continuously monitoring the evolving patterns and detecting anomalies.\n\nWe also present a valuable case study using a distinct data set: Enron corpus to validate the proposed methodology.  The collection of the data set is a touchstone, providing substantial collection of real email benchmark that is public.  We transform the temporal email communication relationship via graph representation, where each distinct email address corresponds to the node, and the presence of emails between two distinct email addresses corresponds to the edge.  Given such a sequence of time graphs, the objectives are to observe graph evolutionary patterns and generate graph prediction as null model.  Capability of generating reliable predictive graphs enables us to anticipate changes in communication patterns that emerge gradually over time, as well as discovering indirect senders and recipients within the structure. Note that although the motivation of our work is an email communication network, the proposed method is fairly general and could be applied to other domains as well.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [398], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, An-Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "An-Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "M Jeya Chandra", "Soundar R.

Amongst the many strategies used to regulate their adaptive behaviors, sigma54-dependent gene transcription often plays a crucial role. In this system, the sigma54 protein recruits bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) to sigma54-specific promoters to form a stable complex. To start transcription, this complex needs actions from a bacterial enhancer binding protein (EBP). When stimulated by specific signals, an EBP assembles into a homo-oligomeric ring via its AAA+ ATPase (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) domain. The assembled ATPase utilizes ATP hydrolysis to remodel the closed sigma54/RNAP/promoter complex and enable it to initiate transcription of the downstream genes.\n \nThis thesis mainly used small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS), gel filtration chromatography, and assay of ATP hydrolysis to explore the functional and structural details of three important aspects of this transcription regulatory system: 1) how the assembly of the ATPase is controlled; 2) how the assembled ATPase hydrolyzes ATP; and 3) how the ATPase uses ATP hydrolysis to remodel the sigma54/RNAP complex. \n\nBased on the results, first the thesis proposed a novel positive mechanism for how the assembly of an EBP ATPase is regulated by the receiver domain of two-component signal transduction, a frequent regulatory motif used by EBPs. Previous studies of two EBPs, NtrC1 and DctD, defined a negative regulation mechanism, in which the receiver domain inhibited the assembly of the ATPase while phosphorylation of the receiver domain released the inhibition and produced a constitutively active ATPase ring. However, this model failed to explain the regulation of the closely related NtrC. This study generated a low-resolution structural model that showed the receiver domain of NtrC, instead of inhibiting ring assembly, when phosphorylated actually stabilized it by associating with a neighboring ATPase subunit. The results provided the first structural model of an activated full-length EBP, explained previous biochemical and genetics data and solved the 20-year-old puzzle of the regulation of NtrC.\n\nSecond, the thesis characterized the AAA+ ATPase domain of another EBP, NtrC1, at distinct stages during an ATP hydrolysis cycle. Each hydrolysis stage of the ATPase was captured by different nucleotides or analogues at saturating concentrations [e.g. ATP, ATP&#61543;S, AMPPNP and ADP beryllium fluoride (ADP-BeFx) for the ground state, ADP aluminum fluoride (ADP-AlFx) for the transition state, and ADP for the product state]. The SAXS-derived low-resolution structures of the NtrC1 ATPase in different states revealed major conformational changes of the ATPase through the hydrolysis cycle. This work also defined a previously overlooked ATP ground state of EBP AAA+ ATPase as an important functional state for coupling conformational changes to sigma54 binding. Transitions between these conformations, especially movement of the highly conserved GAFTGA loops that are located on the top of the central pore region of the ATPase ring, were harnessed to perform mechanical work on the polymerase to initiate transcription.\n\nIn summary, work in this thesis defined a new regulation mechanism of the assembly of the EBP ATPase controlled by two-component signal transduction, unambiguously revealed large conformational changes during an EBP ATPase cycle, and revised the current view of the functional and structural roles of the ATP hydrolysis ground state of EBP ATPases.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [842], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Baoyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Baoyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["B Tracy Nixon", "Arthur Mallay Lesk", "Kathleen Postle", "William O Hancock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["B Tracy Nixon, Committee Chair", "Arthur Mallay Lesk, Committee Member", "Kathleen Postle, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["small angle x-ray scattering", "AAA+ ATPase", "two-component signal transduction", "enhancer binding protein", "sigma54", "SAXS", "NtrC", "transcription"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Topic Oriented Evolution and Sentiment Analysis", "id": "11743", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "850", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Topic modeling techniques help people to understand what is talking about in a corpus, and dramatically improve human\u2019s work on academic or business productivity.

However, real applications often have needs to explain topics using both structured and unstructured text information together. When texts have their timestamps, it is necessary to identify different topics at different timestamps and how they evolve overtime.  When sentiments or opinions are included in texts, it is necessary to identify human's opinion on certain aspects.

The first model can predict future topics in blogsphere for next 4 weeks with high precision (0.94). The second model can construct the map of research topic evolution and measure topic influence with accuracy (0.65) comparable to human ratings (0.76). The third model can significantly improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis by 5\\% compared with the state of arts methods; The fourth model can find new aspects with high precision (0.82) and recall (0.78); The fifth model can find and visualize most controversial topics and extract opinion sentences to represent opinionists\u2019 standpoints with high accuracy (0.97).", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [843], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Bi ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee", "Dongwon Lee", "Xiaolong Zhang", "Prasenjit Mitra", "Daniel Kifer", "Ji Fang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee, Dissertation Advisor", "Dongwon Lee, Committee Chair", "Xiaolong Zhang, Committee Member", "Prasenjit Mitra, Committee Member", "Daniel Kifer, Committee Member", "Ji Fang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["text mining", "topic modeling", "sentiment analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The characteristics and modelling of oil dispersion in the ocean mixed layer from underwater blowout spill accidents", "id": "14478bzc157", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14478", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Underwater oil spill accidents are the most challenging oil spills in the ocean and the ensuing oil transport is impacted by a wide range of physical, chemical and biological processes through the entire ocean column. In particular, the final fate of oil plume is strongly affected by the various scales of motions present in the ocean mixed layer (OML) (i.e. Ekman transport, submesoscale/mesoscale eddies, small-scale turbulence).\nDue to the large extension of oil plumes, the numerical prediction of oil trasnport is most often investigated by regional models, which requires turbulence models for the OML. In these models of OML, turbulence and mixing have been developed based on knowledge of atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) turbulence, because of the similarity between these two boundary layers and the lack of observation and understanding about the OML.\nRecent studies have found that the unique wave-induced phenomena (i.e. Stokes drift, Langmuir circulatons) in OML are critical for both horizontal advection and vertical mixing in the OML, but important issues related to oil transport remain unsolved. In this work, we focus on i) the modulation of turbulence field by surface gravity waves in the OML and responses of oil plumes to this modulation using the high fidelity large eddy simulation (LES); ii) a new multi-scale numerical approach to inlcude both accurate representations of small-scale turbulence and large-scale eddies; and iii) impacts of dispersant application on oil plume from an underwater blowout and the corresponding implication for remediation.\n\nThe surface gravity wave induces two phenomena--the Stokes drift and the Langmuir circulation, which are important for transport processes in the OML. Both phenomena are modulated by the misalignment angle between wind and wave. In the first work, we focus on the effects of swell waves on the modulation of turbulent flow in the OML and its impact on oil transport. Results show that when the wind-swell misalignment is small, Langmuir cells develop and significantly enhance the vertical mixing of the oil plume. Conversely, when the misalignment is large, vertical dilution is suppressed when compared to the no-swell case. Due to the strong directional shear of the mean flow within the OML, plume depth significantly impacts the mean transport direction. The size of oil droplets in the plume also plays an important role in vertical mixing and mean transport direction. \n\nOil plumes being transported in the OML experience the action of shear-generated turbulence, Langmuir circulations, Ekman transport and submesoscale/mesoscale eddies. To resolve such turbulent processes, grid sizes of a few meters are desirable while horizontal domain sizes of LES are typically restricted from hundreds of meters to a few kilometers, for LES to remain practically affordable. Yet transported oil plumes evolve to large scales extending to tens or even hundreds of kilometers. In this work, the Extended Nonperiodic Domain LES for Scalar transport (ENDLESS) is proposed as a multi-scale approach to tackle this challenge while being computationally affordable. The basic idea is to simulate the shear turbulence and Langmuir circulations on a small horizontal domain with periodic boundary conditions while the resulting transport velocity field is replicated periodically following adaptively the large-scale plume as it evolves spatially towards much larger scales. This approach also permits the superposition of larger-scale quasi two-dimensional flow motions on the oil advection, allowing for coupling with regional circulation models.\nA validation case and two sample applications to oil plume evolution in the OML are presented in order to demonstrate key features and computational speedup associated with the ENDLESS method. The results shows that the ENDLESS method is a promising multi-scale approach.\n\nThe application of oil dispersants in oil spill accidents is controversial due to the unclear effects on oil transport in a real environment and their toxicity to oceanic organisms. Because of the velocity shear in Ekman layer, the oil experiences different advection velocity in different depth, therefore, the vertical transport also impact the horizontal transport of oil. In this study, the oil transport of an idealized underwater blow-up accident is simulated by LES, which is able to resolve the high fidelity vertical mixing. The oil spill accident is simulated by two parts: i) the near-field simulation which includes the water column where the oil plume rises from the source; ii) the far-field simulation which the oil plume disperses mainly horizontally in the ocean mixed layer (OML) using the ENDLESS approach. The result from LES shows that after applying dispersants, the advection velocity of oil plume reduces to about 1/8 of its original value and the lateral diffusion is significantly enhanced.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15416], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Bicheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "first_name_ssi": "Bicheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marcelo Chamecki", "Chris E.

Franco) is a widely cultivated timber and Christmas tree species.  The Christmas tree industry plays an important role in agriculture, both within Pennsylvania as well as across the nation.  According to the 2007 census of agriculture, Pennsylvania was ranked as the 4th state in the nation in terms of Christmas tree production.  Many conifer species have been utilized for Christmas tree production, generating valuable revenue for growers and retailers.  The overall goal of this micropropagation project is to develop a true to type clonal propagation system to alleviate the cost of tree to tree variation by conventional seedling propagation.  Eventually, developed techniques can be transferred to Pennsylvania Christmas tree growers willing to utilize these techniques to enhance their profits.  This study addresses three goals associated with Douglas-fir micropropagation which include 1) to understand and characterize the demography and phenology of collected explant materials 2) to investigate factors associated with the culture vessels to ensure proper tissue culture practices, and 3) to assess specific objectives for shoot multiplication and rooting.  When explant demography and phenology were evaluated, the size of inner vegetative bud was found to be highly correlated with later explant height growth in vitro.  Explant growth performance in vitro was not only influenced by genotype but also bud collection season, bud collection position, bud type, and donor age.  To understand the physical factors associated with micropropagation, the effects of medium pH and hyperhydricity on explant growth dysfunction in vitro were evaluated.  Prolonged culturing was found to decrease medium pH and reduce explant weight growth over time.  The addition of 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), a medium pH stabilizer, resulted in better maintenance of medium pH over time, but did not necessarily alter explant growth potential.  Additionally, moisture condensation inside the culture vessel was found to be correlated with explant hyperhydricity.  A shortened culture time within the petri dish vessel and subsequent transfer to larger vessels with greater head-air space was found to reduce the occurrence of hyperhydricity of explants.  To define efficient explant multiplication and rooting protocols, a wide range (0-204.8 mg/L) of benzylaminopurine (BA) concentrations and rooting conditions were evaluated with Douglas-fir.  For efficient induction of multiple shoots from bud explants of both juvenile and mature genotypes, the optimal BA concentration was found to be 6.4-51.2 mg/L at 2-3 week induction time.  For mature genotypes, shoot organogenesis could also be induced by applying the range of 6.4-204.8 mg/L BA.  Rooting of Douglas-fir micropropagated explants is feasible by incubation in half-strength mDCR medium containing 3 mg/L naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) with 3-day complete darkness followed by 3-day complete light at 20\u00baC.  However, the efficiency of rooting was low and will require further investigation.  By understanding these influential factors and their roles in explant induction and development in vitro, healthy and vigorous shoots could be produced with which to facilitate further investigations.  These findings may contribute to an efficient micropropagation system, that will allow Christmas tree growers to avoid losses from variation from seedlings in the future.

Understanding the ways in which the Taiwanese construct their contemporary identities and the ways a study of their signs could contribute to the Taiwanese art education curriculum are the main goals of this study. \nAdopting the qualitative cultural study method, this study addressed three research questions: (1) What are the roots of Taiwanese visual culture? (2) What does one specific group of middle-class family photographs from the 1920s-1940s contribute to our understanding of Taiwanese culture and identity? and (3) What might the in-depth, multifaceted interpretation of these special forms of visual culture contribute to the content of the elementary and junior high school Arts and Humanities curriculum? I searched for interview participants who had access to plenty of family photographs taken between 1920 and 1940, who had been in school during the Japanese colonial period, and who were willing to be interviewed about their family history. The ultimate goal of this study is twofold: the first investigation examines the heritage of Taiwanese visual culture through a literature review, photographic interpretation, and ethnographic interviews; the second investigation explores the content of the Taiwanese elementary and junior high school Arts and Humanities curriculum in order to build Taiwanese visual cultural identity. \nMy research produced three main results. First, photography functioned as a window or mirror for society and enabled me to see Taiwanese visual cultural roots and cultural diversity. Second, there existed the phenomena of different depths of assimilation. In the Japanese colonial period (1895-1945) the Taiwanese were affected directly by the Japanese for about three generations. The Taiwanese were spontaneously assimilated into Japanese civilization through fashion, modern schooling, industry, medicine, hygiene, and the improvement of material life, but as far as ethnic assimilation, the spiritual domain, they were still hesitant. Third, the reflection of the cultural combination and conflicts was among the Taiwanese, the Japanese, the Chinese, and the West. The Taiwanese culture is a hybrid culture, reflecting multiple societies, and creating a new style of visual culture that is not the traditional Chinese, Japanese, nor Western culture. The Taiwanese might not be able\u00a1Xor want\u00a1Xto pursue orthodox cultural status. They accepted continual change. The Taiwanese built their own unique visual cultural identity.\n\tFamily portrait photographs reveal phenomena that exist between private and public lives\u00a1Xphenomena existing in the space between local and national culture. When we dig more deeply, we find more signs within the visual cultural web. The photographs reveal how a personal identity is built\u00a1Xhow individuals come to know their culture and be understood with who they are.

Selecting an inappropriate entry mode can lead to significant negative consequences. Entry mode selection is therefore one of the most critical decisions in international construction. The purpose of this research was to understand various entry modes and improve the selection decision for international construction companies. \n\nComparative case studies identified and defined 10 basic entry modes utilized in the international construction arena: 1) strategic alliance, 2) local agent, 3) licensing, 4) joint venture company, 5) sole venture company, 6) branch office / company, 7) representative office, 8) joint venture project, 9) sole venture project, and 10) BOT / equity project.

Hypotheses were developed centering on these factors, e.g., with other conditions being equal, contractors are less likely to use permanent entry modes for a target market with a high competitive intensity. Binary logistic regression analysis of empirical data was used to test these hypotheses. The results were interpreted and analyzed.

The cattle gastrointestinal tract is the major biological reservoir of E. coli O157:H7. Whole genome sequencing of this organism identified a total of 18 prophage and 6 prophage-like elements, which make up 16% of the chromosome. These horizontally transferred genetic elements encode most of the recognized virulence factors in E. coli O157:H7, including the phage-encoded Shiga toxin (Stx) and locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), and the pre- and post-transcriptional regulators for the expression of these virulence genes. Meanwhile, prophage regions are hot spots for genomic rearrangement in this pathogen. Therefore, the overall goal of the present study was to understand the various contributions of these prophage to the virulence and epidemiologic character of E. coli O157:H7.\n\nStx is responsible for the serious clinical manifestations of infections in humans, and Stx2 is a subgroup that is associated with highly pathogenic strains. It has been hypothesized that both the O157:H7 strain and the susceptibility of intestinal E. coli to its phage impacts Stx2 accumulation in vivo. I quantified the phage and Stx2 production by 13 E. coli O157:H7 strains and observed dramatic strain-to-strain variability. Transduction of the stx2-encoding phage from E. coli strain EDL933 into a non-toxin producing E. coli strain (C600) demonstrated that the host background affects phage and toxin production. Coincubation of E. coli O157:H7 or its lytic phage pools with E. coli C600 could increase the production of Stx2 and stx2-encoding phage particles. This effect varied with the O157:H7 strain, the stx2-encoding prophage, and the presence of the phage inducing agent ciprofloxacin. Of note, phage from two E. coliO157:H7 clade 8 strains were the most infectious of those screened, while an stx2c-encoding phage possessed limited infectivity. Additionally, one clade 8 strain designated PA2 produced limited Stx2 as a pure culture, but accumulated the highest toxin level among strains tested when co-incubated with C600. These results suggest that the intestinal microflora may impact the outcome of an O157:H7 infection, and that toxin production observed in pure culture might not accurately reflect the levels produced in vivo. \n\nSp11 and Sp12 are two tandem integrated and putatively defective prophage carried by E. coli O157:H7 strain Sakai. I identified 3 classes of deletions that occur within the Sp11-Sp12 region at a frequency of ca. 7.74 \u00d7 10-4. One deletion involved a precise excision of Sp11 and the other two spanned the junction of Sp11 and Sp12. All deletions resulted in shifts in the XbaI fragment pattern observed by PFGE. Alignment of the Sp11-Sp12 DNA sequence with its corresponding regions in other E. coli O157:H7 and O55:H7 strains suggested that homologous recombination rather than integrase-mediated excision is the mechanism behind these deletions. These observations explain in part a mechanism behind the previously reported genetic instability of this genomic region of E. coli O157:H7.\n\nData from our group suggested that the E. coli O157:H7 human isolates and isolates belonging to O serogroups that are frequently associated with foodborne outbreaks carry more copies of ileZ and argO than others. This observation supports the hypothesis that the lambdoid prophage-encoded ileZ-argN-argO operon has a regulatory effect on EHEC virulence. For the first time, I demonstrated promoter activity upstream of all seven ileZ-argN-argO operons in E. coli O157:H7 Sakai and the transcription of ileZ and argO independent of the phage late promoter. I also determined that ileZ2 encodes a functional tRNA and suggested that argN is functionally \u2018redundant\u2019. Unexpectedly, inactivation of the ileZ2-argN2-argO2 operon did not affect the production of Stx2 and the stx2-encoding phage in Sakai and phage-converted C600. These observations do not support the widespread belief that ileZ-argN-argO are required for efficient production of Stx2 and phage particles.\n\nStreptomycin binds to the ribosome of bacteria and can inhibit translation by promoting misreading of mRNA. Restrictive streptomycin-resistant (Strr) mutations increase the accuracy of the decoding process; while concomitantly decrease the rate of translation in many cases. Streptomycin is commonly used to repress the colonization resistance from intestinal microflora during investigation of the colonization and pathogenesis of E. coli O157:H7 in animal models. LEE-encoded EspA and EspB play important roles in attachment to intestinal epithelia and colonization by E. coli O157:H7. I observed a striking decrease in the secretion levels of EspA and EspB with E. coli O157:H7 Strr restrictive mutants, which carry K42T or K42I mutations in the S12 protein. However, strains carrying mutations previously defined as mildly restrictive (K87R) and non-restrictive (K42R) showed slight and indistinguishable changes in EspA and EspB secretion, respectively.

Although the topic of each chapter is different, they are linked by the question: How do players coordinate their actions through communication?  Each chapter develops a communication schema, depicts equilibrium strategies, and responds to this inquiry.\n\nIn the first chapter, I study a collective action problem in a setting of discounted repeated coordination games in which players know their neighbors'  inclination to participate as well as monitor their neighbors' past actions. I define strong connectedness to characterize those states in which, for every two players who incline to participate, there is a path consisting of players with the same inclination to connect them.  Given that the networks are fixed, finite, connected, commonly known, undirected and without cycles, I show that if the priors have full support on the strong connectedness states, there is a weak sequential equilibrium in which the ex-post efficient outcome repeats after a finite time $T$ in the path when discount factor is sufficiently high. This equilibrium is constructive and does not depend on public or private signals other than players' actions.\n\n\nIn the second chapter, I consider the three-player complete information games augmented with pre-play communication. Players can privately communicate with others, but not through a mediator. I implement correlated equilibria by letting players be able to authenticate their messages and forward the authenticated messages during communication. Authenticated messages, such as letters with signatures, cannot be duplicated but can be sent or received by players. With authenticated messages, I show that, if a game $G$ has a worst Nash equilibrium $\\alpha$, then any correlated equilibrium distribution in $G$, which has rational components and gives each player higher payoff than what $\\alpha$ does, can be implemented by a pre-play communication.

The present work studies the molecular packing and segmental dynamics in poly(ethylene oxide)/syndiotactic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PEO/PMMA) blends using molecular dynamics simulations with neutron scattering experiments as a test of the accuracy of simulation models.\nThe static and dynamic properties of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) obtained from two levels of modeling, i.e., an explicit atom model and a united atom model, are compared.  Both models accurately describe the PEO static structure factor as measured by neutron diffraction.  Hydrogen atom motion from the explicit atom model and carbon/oxygen atom motion from the united atom model closely follow the experimental hydrogen motion.  Both models also provide a good description of the orientation properties of C-H vectors measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments.  \nLocal relaxations present in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) including \u0192\u00d1-methyl rotation, ester methyl rotation, \u0192\u00d2-relaxation, and \u0192\u00d1-relaxation are successfully isolated at temperatures above the glass transition temperature using molecular dynamics simulations.  Both activation energies and relaxation times of \u0192\u00d1-methyl and ester methyl rotations are a continuous extension of those at low temperatures.  The \u0192\u00d2-relaxation is confirmed to originate from the rotation of the entire ester side group, while the \u0192\u00d1-relaxation is found to be associated with the motion of the main chain.  \nDistinct dynamics are observed in PEO/PMMA blends with PEO slowed and PMMA speeded, which is consistent with those normally found in polymer blends.  The effect of blending on the dynamics of the \u0192\u00d1-methyl rotation, the ester methyl rotation, and the ester side group rotation in PMMA are also explored.  The relaxation times and activation energies of all the three rotations in the blend are smaller than those in pure PMMA, indicating that PEO accelerates these rotations.

Recent technological advancement, global competition and world events made teamwork vitally important to the success of many organizations in both military and civilian sectors. Team training is arguably one of the most intensively studied topics for cognitive science researchers in the past decades, yet there are few effective software tools that automate team performance assessment and coaching. \nThe goal of this research is to develop an intelligent training framework where software agents are used to automate team performance assessment and coaching, with a focus on helping behavior. One of the design challenges in coaching for team training is that the performance of a team is affected by multiple factors, which include the quality of the team\u00a1\u00afs plan and each individual\u00a1\u00afs execution of the plan. To address this difficulty, our framework uses a two-phase training protocol that provides coaching for two phases: a mission planning phase and a mission execution phase. We adopt two user modeling approaches (overlay and error taxonomy) in Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for the two phases, according to different complexity involved in modeling expert behavior. In the planning phase, intelligent coaching feedback is generated based on an expert model for resource allocation. In the execution phase, coaching feedback is generated based on error taxonomy to assess team\u00a1\u00afs execution performance of their planned activities. Due to the broad scope of team training, this research stresses one important dimension of teamwork\u00a1\u00aathe helping behavior among team members, in case of an unbalanced workload and resource distribution. Coaching feedback is provided in a debriefing session at the end of each mission execution with a goal of improving trainee performance during the next mission. \nWe have implemented the framework within a team-based agent architecture and applied it to train helping behaviors for a simulated command and control (C2) task. To evaluate the effectiveness of the agent-based team training approach, we designed and conducted a human subject experiment that applied the agent-based two-phase training protocol and provided teams in the experiment group with feedback generated by the coaching agents. Results have suggested that the coaching agents have a positive impact on trainees\u00a1\u00af learning of how to effectively helping each other to achieve mission success in time-critical and complex task domains.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1144], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Cong ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Yen", "John Millar Carroll", "Brian K Smith", "Tracy Mullen", "Guohong Cao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Yen, Committee Chair", "John Millar Carroll, Committee Member", "Brian K Smith, Committee Member", "Tracy Mullen, Committee Member", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Feedback Generatioin", "Diagnosis", "Agent-based Coaching", "Performance Assessment", "Intelligent Training", "Teamwork"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on Food Environment, Food Demand, and Health", "id": "21289", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9792", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    There have been a multitude of studies estimating food demand elasticities in China, but no published study has conducted a quantitative review of this literature for China. In the first essay, a database was assembled of 670 own-price elasticities, 917 cross-price elasticities, and 855 income elasticities from 85 studies estimating demand elasticities for 19 major food categories consumed in China. Instead of using raw elasticity estimates extracted directly from these studies, we converted all values to unconditional elasticity estimates if necessary. That is, the converted elasticities are all dependent on income rather than expenditures on either food or subcategories of food. Weighted least squares (WLS) was then used to examine the determinants of those elasticity estimates accounting for the possibility of heteroskedastic errors. The results showed that this approach to data conversion substantially reduced differences between conditional and unconditional elasticity values. They also indicate that own-price, cross-price and income elasticity estimates are significantly influenced by data characteristics, the budgeting framework employed in a study, type of demand model used in a study, and the mean per capita income of the sample analyzed in study. Using the meta-analysis results, this essay estimates elasticities of food demand in China in 2011.\n    Although there has been extensive research on the adverse impacts of perceived discrimination on health, it remains unclear how perceived discrimination gets under the skin. The second essay develops a comprehensive structural equation model (SEM) by incorporating both the direct effects of perceived discrimination on self-rated health (SRH), a powerful predictor for many health outcomes, and the indirect effects of perceived discrimination on SRH through health care system distrust, neighborhood social capital, and health behaviors and health conditions. Applying SEM to 9,880 adults (ages between 18 and 100) in the 2008 Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health Survey, this essay not only confirmed the positive and direct association between discrimination and poor or fair SRH, but also verified two underlying mechanisms: 1) perceived discrimination is associated with lower neighborhood social capital, which further contributes to poor or fair SRH; and 2) perceived discrimination is related to risky behaviors (e.g., reduced physical activity and sleep quality, and intensified smoking) that lead to worse health conditions, and then result in poor or fair SRH. Moreover, the results indicated that perceived discrimination is negatively associated with health care system distrust, but there is not a significant relationship between distrust and poor or fair SRH.\n    Previous studies often employ two approaches to evaluate diet quality: one is to calculate dietary indexes/scores reflecting compliance with recommended nutrient or food intakes, while the other is to derive dietary patterns using factor or cluster analyses. Assessments of diet quality relying on data collected through individuals\u2019 recall of past consumption frequencies for specified food items are subject to various measurement errors. The third essay evaluates a new dietary assessment method and its association with diet-related health outcomes. Households in the recent IRI Consumer Scanner data (2008-2012) recorded their food purchases on each shopping trip by scanning Universal Product Codes (UPCs). The healthfulness score for each household\u2019s shopping cart measures the discrepancy between the household\u2019s monthly expenditure shares of 24 aggregated food categories defined by USDA\u2019s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion and the recommended values calculated based on the USDA Food Plan. In addition to household-level data derived from the IRI Consumer Scanner data, data was obtained on self-reported medical profiles and dietary components from household members, constituting the individual-level variables. Data from County Business Patterns and American Community Surveys were used to create food environment variables and poverty rates at the county level. Using this multilevel data set assembled from different sources, a series of multilevel models were estimated to examine the impact of individual diet quality, household shopping basket healthfulness, and food environments on overweight and obesity status. To mitigate potential endogeneity, densities of food stores and restaurants were calculated with a lag of one year. Model results showed that a higher shopping basket healthfulness score is significantly associated with reduced risk of being overweight and obese. Higher densities of supercenters in non-metro neighborhoods are found to be positively related to individuals\u2019 overweight and obesity risks, whereas greater availability of full-service restaurants and limited-service restaurants per capita is associated with lower probability of overweight and obesity status. However, these results are not consistently found across models utilizing all various population subsamples. Nevertheless, an increasing relationship between food deserts and the likelihood of being overweight and obese was more consistently found across samples, which is consistent with contextual effects on weight outcomes.

We then show how this technique is used to perturb the geodesic flows of flat Finsler tori.\n\n\nIn Chapter 4 we show how dual lens map can be used in KAM theory. The celebrated KAM Theory says that if one makes a small perturbation of a non-degenerate completely integrable system, we still see a huge measure of invariant tori with quasi-periodic dynamics in the perturbed system. These invariant tori are known as KAM tori. What happens outside KAM tori draws a lot of attention. We show two types of Lagrangian perturbations of the geodesic flow on flat  Finsler tori. The perturbations are $C^\\infty$ small but the resulting flows has a positive measure of trajectories with positive Lyapunov exponent. The measure of this set is of course extremely small. Still, the flow has positive metric entropy.

An Effective Medium Model for a composite material was found to provide a reasonable description of the spectra. Furthermore, we have learned from optical absorption studies of DWNTs and C60-peapods that the host tube and the encapsulant interact weakly; small shifts in interband absorption structure were observed. \n\nResonant Raman scattering studies on SWNTs synthesized via the HiPCO process show that the zone-folding approximation for phonons and electrons works reasonably well, even for small diameter (d < 1 nm) tubes. The energy of optical transitions between van Hove singularities in the electronic density of states computed from the zone-folding model agree well with the resonant conditions for Raman scattering. Small diameter tubes were found to exhibit additional sharp Raman bands in the frequency range 500 - 1200 cm-1 with an, as yet, undetermined origin. \n\nThe Raman spectrum of a DWNT was found to be well described by a superposition of the Raman spectra expected for inner and outer tubes, i.e., no charge transfer occurs and the weak van der Waals (vdW) interaction between tubes does not have significant impact on the phonons.

Since the mid 1990s, despite widely recognized success in economic reform and poverty alleviation, China has seen a rise of urban poverty in absolute numbers and in percentages. A close look reveals that the rise of urban poverty is a result of the state\u2019s retreat from urban full employment and welfare provisions, multiplied by the effects of an exceptionally low urban poverty rate in the socialist era due to a manipulated class structure and maintained urban privileges. Along with the rise in rural-urban migration, this spatial relocation of poverty to urban areas has combined with the increasing heterogeneity among the poor, and both poor migrants and native urbanites face growing spatial isolation.\nThis research responds to the \u201cmarket transition\u201d debate among sociologists such as Victor Nee and geographers, and it critiques structuralist perspectives on third-world migration and development and regional geographic studies on poverty and inequality. It proposes instead a multi-level and multi-actor approach, to analyze pre-existing socialist institutions and market-oriented changes as structures, and to analyze local governments, communities, and families as agents. This study examines how these structures and agents shape the urban poverty spaces in China. I address three questions: (1) how spatial inequality and deprivation in China are shaped at the national level; (2) how the spaces of urban poverty in China are shaped at the intra-city level by urban policies accompanying market-oriented social and economic reforms; and (3) how the livelihood and life chances of rural migrant family households compare with native urban family households.\nThrough a national level census data analysis, a case study of Nanjing, and a case study of housing tenure for poor family households based on survey and interview data, this research explains the nature of urban poverty in China at three levels: (1) at the state level, urban poverty is emerging as a form of moving opportunities and relative deprivations across space; (2) at the city level, the (re)location and concentration of urban poverty is due to migration control and urban redevelopment in the local institutional context; and (3) at the community and individual levels, urban poverty is an outcome associated with individual characteristics and individuals\u2019 connection with the state, conditioned by family and community-based support.\nThese findings suggest that urban poverty exists not simply as the consequence of individual incapacity in the face of marketization or due to the existence of biased national policies towards rural migrants, but argues instead that rising urban poverty is largely a reaction to the emergence of transforming institutions characteristic of a hybrid economy with strong state and local interventions.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2084], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Guo ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Guo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amy K Glasmeier", "Lakshman S Yapa", "Leif Jensen", "Chris Benner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Amy K Glasmeier, Committee Chair", "Lakshman S Yapa, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member", "Chris Benner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Economic Reform", "China", "Deprivation", "Spatial Inequality", "Urban Poverty", "Rural-Urban Migration"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THREE ESSAYS ON CEO REPLACEMENT IN TURNAROUND SITUATIONS", "id": "8645", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2128", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of three essays on CEO replacement in turnaround situations. The first essay aims to understand the antecedents of CEO dismissal in turnaround situations. I develop a model of CEO dismissal as a social framing contest, in which key plays try to convince and mobilize others to accept their respective claims about the wisdom of replacing or retaining the CEO. When mixed indicators of performance problems surface, the likelihood and speed of CEO dismissal becomes a function of how vigorously social arbiters personalize the poor performance by blaming the CEO, how actively the incumbents argue for their retention, and which side investors and directors try to bolster. The framing contest model substantially supplements the prevailing view that CEO dismissal is propelled by objective performance conditions and agency factors, and it will lead to much more accurate predictions of whether, and when, CEOs will be forced out. \nThe second essay focuses on the consequences of CEO replacement, by empirically investigating whether CEO replacement helps or hurts firms in turnaround situations. Drawing from the \u00a1\u00b0fit-drift/shift-refit\u00a1\u00b1 idea introduced by Finkelstein and Hambrick (1996), I develop a concept of context-person fit, and address its critical role in understanding the performance consequences of CEO replacement. Specifically, the presence of predecessor\u00a1\u00afs misfit with contextual requirements will make a change of CEO particularly valuable for a troubled firm; and the successor\u00a1\u00afs fit with context tends to address the troubled firm\u00a1\u00afs needs and thus will substantially improve firm performance. With 140 CEO replacements in 223 turnaround situations for S&P 1500 index companies, I find that the stock market in general positively responds to the CEO replacement announcement in turnaround situations. However, CEO replacement per se does not have any effect on troubled firm\u00a1\u00afs subsequent performance. In addition, I find considerable empirical support for the context-person fit arguments: the presence of the predecessor\u00a1\u00afs misfit and the successor\u00a1\u00afs fit with the context has positive performance implications.\nThe third essay represents a logical extension of the second essay by studying the initial compensation package of new CEOs hired in turnaround situations. Because of greater job demands, a more complex task, and a riskier position for successors, I argue that firms in turnaround situations pay their new CEOs more than do comparable firms that are not in turnaround situations, and they tend to use a higher percentage of stock-based pay. Such relations are stronger for externally appointed CEOs. I further argue that a higher pay attracts talented executives who are more capable, experienced, and well connected to acquire critical resources, thus will improve post-succession performance. Results based on 94 new CEOs hired in turnaround situations and 431 peers in non-turnaround situations provide empirical support.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2109], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Guoli ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Guoli", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald C Hambrick", "Timothy Grant Pollock", "Wenpin Tsai", "Michelle Lowry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald C Hambrick, Committee Chair", "Timothy Grant Pollock, Committee Member", "Wenpin Tsai, Committee Member", "Michelle Lowry, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CEO replacement", "Turnaround situations"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "GENETIC ANALYSIS OF PAPILLOMAVIRUS VIRION MORPHOGENESIS\n\n\n", "id": "8003", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2390", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Papillomavirus (PV) are small, nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses that contain two late open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the viral major and minor capsid proteins, L1 and L2, respectively. PV comprise of a large family of viruses containing more than one hundred different human PV (HPV) types. Both HPV16 and HPV18 share similar biological and pathological activities including being mucosotropic, evolutionarily-related, and high-risk viruses. Our previous studies showed that a chimeric HPV18/16 DNA, made of the structural genes of HPV16 and the nonstructural genes of HPV18, was able to produce infectious virus in organotypic raft cultures. We were then interested in determining whether the functional interaction between the structural genes of HPV16 and nonstructural genes of HPV18 for virion morphogenesis is unique to these two similar types or also occurs for disparate PV types. We extended the chimeric HPV18/16 study by replacing the structural genes of HPV18 with the corresponding sequences from a panel of PV including low-risk, high-risk, cutaneous and even evolutionarily distant-related animal viruses. Our data suggests that there is an absence of a barrier for functional interaction between structural and nonstructural genes of different PV types. Although different biological activities were observed for these PV chimeras, our results showed that all the PV chimeras were able to propagate infectious viruses showing that at least at a basal level structural genes are interchangeable among PV. In addition, we have exchanged the HPV18 L2 or L1 gene with that of HPV16. Our preliminary data showed that exchange of the HPV18 L1 gene with HPV16 L1 created genomes that were able to efficiently replicate and produce infectious virus. In contrast, genomes containing an exchange of the HPV18 L2 gene for HPV16 L2 failed to produce infectious virus. These findings suggested that type-specific functional sequence might exist to interfere with the proper interaction between the HPV18 L1 protein and the HPV16 L2 protein during viral replication. Using chimeric constructs of these capsid proteins, we have identified a type-specific sequence in the HPV18 L1 N-terminus. Furthermore, using a panel of conformation-dependent L1 neutralizing antibodies and an anti-L2 antibody, L2 was shown to affect the structure of L1 and vice versa. The results raise many interesting hypotheses to the copy number and location of the L2 in a viral capsid. These studies shed light on the importance of interactions between structural genes, and structural and nonstructural genes during virion morphogenesis. Finally, a HPV16 African type 2 variant was cloned from a patient biopsy and shown to preferentially replicate in female host cells. This is the first study propagating a HPV variant infectious virus in vitro, providing a foundation for future studies of HPV variants in raft cultures.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2374], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Horng-Shen ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Horng-Shen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Matthew Meyers", "Neil David Christensen", "Richard John Frisque", "David Joseph Spector", "John Warren Wills"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Chair", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CHIMERIC VIRUS", "VIRION MORPHOGENESIS", "PAPILLOMAVIRUS"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Women\u2019s Perceptions of Skin Color and Sun-Related Behaviors: A Cross-cultural Study ", "id": "14558hxc257", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14558", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Skin color, the product of evolution by natural selection and the human body\u2019s most visible phenotype, profoundly influences our social interactions. However, the meanings and values associated with skin color are culturally variable, as evidenced by the contemporary preference for tanned skin among Euro-American women and for lighter skin among Chinese women. Such culturally-grounded values and beliefs toward skin color can influence daily decisions and leisure behaviors, such as applying tanning lotions and engaging in recreational sun tanning in Euro-American culture, and using skin-lightening products and partaking in sun-protection practices (e.g., wearing long sleeves, holding parasols) in Chinese culture. The formation and construction of individual attitudes toward skin color can be especially complex when two or more distinct cultures interplay. In this study, the relationship between perceptions of and preferences for skin color, as well as sun-related behaviors that occur in leisure contexts, was explored in a \u201cnatural experiment\u201d setting with assistance from three groups of Chinese women, who ranged from those who presumably adhered most to those who adhered least to Chinese culture. The three groups included the following: (1) 15 Chinese women who grew up in China until they were at least 18 years old and who currently live in the US; (2) 15 second-generation Chinese Americans who grew up in first-generation Chinese immigrant families; and (3) 18 Chinese American adoptees who were adopted in infancy and grew up in Euro-American families (i.e., international adoption). \n\nThe unique setting of genetically Chinese individuals from different cultural backgrounds enables me to explore the dynamic interactions between the Chinese and Euro-American cultural values toward skin color that shape personal attitudes and associated behaviors, such as sun-seeking, sun-avoidance, sunscreen usage, and indoor versus outdoor leisure preferences. Using ethnographic approaches, including visual and scenario elicitation and in-depth interviews, this study helps (a) understand how personal attitudes and perceptions of skin color are constructed, evolve, and develop in different sociocultural contexts; (b) elicit personal skin color aesthetics and preferences; (c) unfold the possible relationship between preferences for skin color and daily behavior; (d) compare and contrast skin color aesthetics, preferences, and sun-related behavior among Chinese women, Chinese Americans, and Chinese adoptees; and (e) uncover whether these aesthetics, preferences, and sun-related behaviors reflect different cultural backgrounds. \n\nThe results not only shed light on how attitudes toward skin color are constructed in a complex sociocultural context, as well as how behaviors may reflect personal attitudes and cultural values, but they also provide the first step to elucidate how leisure emerged as an important source of and vehicle for cultural socialization (e.g., entertainment, movies, music, films, events, festivals, heritage tourism). Leisure contexts also play an important role in unpacking the complex relationship between cultural perceptions of and preferences for skin color and behaviors. More specifically, the results demonstrate how many sun-related behaviors occur in leisure contexts, how leisure activities related to skin color preferences translate into daily life, and how sociocultural values and meanings shape people\u2019s attitudes by manifesting through decision-making in leisure contexts. Such original efforts to connect the cultural aspects of skin color preferences to daily life, particularly in leisure contexts, aim to represent an important contribution to the leisure field. Additionally, since sun exposure is essential to health outcomes (e.g., bone density, vitamin D absorption, skin cancer), the results will contribute to interdisciplinary knowledge of how cultural perceptions translate into people\u2019s day-to-day lives and shape health and well-being.

To achieve this objective, an integrated noise prediction system is constructed, namely GenHel--MFW--PSU-WOPWOP.  This noise prediction system includes a flight simulation code, a high fidelity free vortex-wake code, and a rotor acoustic prediction code. By using this noise prediction system, rotor maneuver noise characteristics are identified.  Unlike periodic rotor noise, a longer duration is required to describe rotor maneuver noise.  The variation of helicopter motion, blade motion and blade airloads are all influencing the noise prediction results in both noise level and directivity in the maneuvering flight.  In this research, two types of rotor maneuver noise are identified, steady maneuver noise and transient maneuver noise.  In the steady maneuver, rotor noise corresponds to a steady maneuver condition, which has nearly steady properties in flight dynamics and aerodynamics.  Transient maneuver noise is the result of the transition between two steady maneuvers.  In a transient maneuver, the helicopter experiences fluctuations in airload and helicopter angular rates, which lead to excess rotor noise.  Even though the transient maneuver only exists for a fairly short period of time, the corresponding transient maneuver noise could be significant when compared to steady maneuver noise.  The blade tip vortices also present complex behaviors in the transient maneuver condition.  With stronger vortex circulation strength and the potential for vortex bundling, blade vortex-interaction (BVI) noise may increase significantly during a transient maneuver.  In this research, it is shown that even with small pilot controls, significant BVI noise can be generated during a transient flight condition.

However, the objects found within this information, such as people, places, dates, and firms, form a tangled and complex relationship\nthat is usually challenging to untangle.\n\nIn this dissertation, we aim to unravel the relationship among objects to the finest extent: what are the similarity levels between any pairs of objects.  Discovering similar objects can be the foundation of several research problems and applications.  For example, objects can be clustered into several groups by merging similar objects together.  This merging process can be recursively performed such that a hierarchical structure of these terms is constructed.  In addition, the hidden relationship among objects can be inferred by examining the similar objects that do not explicitly interact with each other.\n\nThis dissertation examines the problem of discovering similar objects in two different settings: (1) discovering similar objects based on the interaction among them, and (2) discovering similar objects based on their meta-data.  We will mainly focus on the first setting.  The interactions among objects are\nmodeled by a network structure, in which each node represents one object, and an edge is presented if the two objects have interacted with each other.  In the second setting, we examine the similarity problem where additional information other than interacting history is available.  In the second setting, we targeted\ndigital library objects, such as papers, authors, published venues (i.e., the published conference or journal), etc.  The meta-data of these objects could be, for example, the citation counts of the paper, the affiliation of the author, and the topics of the conference.  These meta-data are utilized to infer the similar objects, such as similar terms, similar venues, or relevant authors given a topic.\n\nTo validate our proposed models and methodologies, we conducted various experiments on several different data sets to discover the hidden relationship among the target objects.  This includes (1) the relationship between the\nauthors, papers, and venues in the given digital library, (2) the actors, actresses, and the movies in the given movie information, and (3) the diseases and the genes of patients.

Rice MAP kinase 5 (OsMPK5), an orthologue of Arabidopsis AtMPK3, is an abscisic acid- and stress-inducible kinase that positively regulates rice tolerance to abiotic stresses but negatively modulates host resistance to pathogen infection. However, it is unknown how OsMPK5 regulates downstream signaling components and influence rice biotic and abiotic stress responses. To elucidate the mechanism of OsMPK5-mediated signal transduction in rice, therefore, it is critical to identify its potential protein targets or substrates. In this study, an in-situ solid phase phosphorylation screen was conducted to isolate potential OsMPK5 substrates. A rice protein expression library was screened using purified recombinant OsMPK5 and 32P \u00e3-ATP. The phosphorylation screen yielded over a dozen putative substrates with potential roles in apoptosis, ion transportation, transcription, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, etc. Strikingly, many of these putative substrates or their orthologues from other plant species have been previously shown to be involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses. In this study, two of the putative substrates were further characterized by a combination of molecular, biochemical and genetic approaches.\nThe first putative substrate is a transcription factor called OsEIL1, which is an important signaling component of ethylene signal transduction. In vitro protein binding and kinase assays reveal that OsMPK5 interacts with and phosphorylates OsEIL1 in vitro. In addition, OsMPK5 protein kinase activity is negatively correlated with the OsEIL1\niii\nprotein level and downstream OsERF1 and OsPR5 expression in transgenic rice. In addition, transgenic analysis showed that OsEIL1 positively regulated OsERF1 and OsPR5 expression and increased rice disease resistance against the rice blast infection.\nThis suggests that OsMPK5 mediates biotic stress responses by negatively regulating OsEIL1 stability and ethylene signaling transduction.\nThe second interacting protein is a rice calcium-dependent protein kinase (OsCDPK5) which belongs to a large family of protein kinases with diverse roles in plant growth and development as well as biotic and abiotic stress responses. In vitro kinase assays demonstrated the phosphorylation of OsMPK5 by OsCDPK5 in a calcium-dependent manner. The autophosphorylation activity of OsCDPK5 as well as its ability to phosphorylate OsMPK5 were positively regulated by calcium concentration in vitro. Furthermore, OsCDPK5 was found to physically interact with OsMPK5 in vitro and in vivo. RT-PCR and RNA blot analyses showed that the expression of OsCDPK5 in rice was up-regulated by ACC and wounding but down-regulated by ABA. To determine the potential role of OsCDPK5 in plant stress tolerance, transgenic RNAi lines were generated via the Agrobacterium-mediated rice transformation. Similar to the silencing effect of OsMPK5 in rice, suppression of OsCDPK5 enhanced the expression of ethylene-responsive defense genes, suggesting that OsCDPK5 may potentially regulate rice biotic and abiotic stress tolerance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3043], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Jianping ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jianping", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yinong Yang", "Yinong Yang", "Richard Cyr", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Timothy W Mcnellis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yinong Yang, Dissertation Advisor", "Yinong Yang, Committee Chair", "Richard Cyr, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CDPK", "ethylene signaling", "phosphorylation screening", "OsMPK5", "stresses"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Coexistence of Hyperbolic and Non-hyperbolic Behavior in Smooth Dynamical Systems", "id": "15207", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7488", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We investigate the essential coexistence of hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic behavior\nin dynamical systems, which was numerically observed in classical mechanics but\ntheoretically remains an important open problem.

The VDR KO CD8+ T cell pathogenicity resulted from uncontrolled proliferation of CD8+ T cells in general and na\u00efve CD8+ T cells in particular. In addition, VDR KO CD8+ T cells produced more IL-2 than WT CD8+ T cells. My data suggest that the absence of the VDR resulted in the generation of pathogenic CD8+ T cells that contributed to the development of IBD. \nThe second objective was to determine how the VDR regulates host resistance to C. rodentium and the development of inflammation in the gut. My study showed that VDR KO mice were resistant to C. rodentium infection. Increased expression of RegIII\u03b3, Ang-4 and Muc2 contributed to the colonization resistance of VDR KO mice.  Disrupting the gut microbiota with antibiotics or the absence of acquired immunity in T and B cell double Rag/VDR KO mice eliminated C. rodentium colonization resistance. The results suggest that the VDR plays a role in regulating the gut microbiota and C. rodentium colonization.\nLastly, I used the C. rodentium model in vitamin D-sufficient (D+) and deficient (D-) WT or 1,25(OH)2D3 deficient (Cyp27B1, Cyp) KO mice.  D+ WT and D+ Cyp KO mice cleared a primary infection with identical kinetics indicating that the ability to produce 1,25(OH)2D3 is not required for clearance of C. rodentium.  D- WT mice cleared a primary infection more slowly than D+ mice. D- Cyp KO mice developed a severe infection that spread systemically and resulted in the premature lethality of 40% of the mice.  The increased susceptibility of the D- Cyp KO mice was associated with increased Ifn-\u03b3 and Il-17A in the colon compared to the D- WT and the D+ mice at d14 post-infection.  Decreased levels of antibody, CD4+ T cells, IgA+ plasma cells and IL-22-producing innate lymphoid cells (ILC) in D- Cyp KO mice correlated with the increased susceptibility of these mice to C. rodentium infection. Although the response of the D+ WT and D+ Cyp KO mice to primary C. rodentium infection could not be differentiated, D+ Cyp KO mice cleared a secondary infection with C. rodentium more slowly than D+ WT.   Overall this study shows that vitamin D and 1,25(OH)2D3 regulate susceptibility and resistance to C. rodentium infection. Together, the work presented in this thesis shows the critical role of vitamin D and the VDR in gut homeostasis and host susceptibility to C. rodentium infection through the regulation of gut microbiota and host immunity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9570], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Jing ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Na Xiong", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Yu Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Dissertation Advisor", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Chair", "Na Xiong, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Yu Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vitamin D", "inflammatory bowel disease", "CD8+ T cell", "Citrobacter Rodentium"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "PHOTOREFRACTIVE NONLINEARITY IN PURE AND DOPED LIQUID CRYSTALS", "id": "6975", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3624", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A detailed analysis of the photorefractive (PR) effect in liquid crystals (LC) is presented. The photorefractive nonlinearity arises from the formation of spatially modulated space charge field. Two main mechanisms contribute to the\nformation of space charge field in liquid crystals. One comes from the formation and the subsequent dissociation of charge transfer\ncomplexes between the liquid crystal and the dopant, which produces free charge carriers. The drift and diffusion of carriers under the combination action of external dc voltage and\ninhomogeneous illumination forms the space charge field. Second source comes from the so-called Carr-Helfrich effect, which states\nthat transverse space charge field can be induced by liquid crystal dielectric and conductivity anisotropy under external\napplied field. Assisted by the space charge field, large nonlinearity of liquid crystal can be obtained.\n\nThe doping effect, especially for single walled nanotubes (SWNT) doped liquid crystal, is studied. SWNT doping can significantly\nenhance the photorefractive nonlinearity of liquid crystals. We believe strong photorefractive response of SWNT-doped LC is mainly due to the high conductivity anisotropy of SWNT. The photorefractive property of SWNT doped LC as a function of doping concentration is also investigated. Dynamic scattering is found to be further inhibited in LC samples with higher doping concentration. SWNT dopants seem to form loosely connected network and encumbrances ion flow induced dynamic scattering, which makes it possible to obtain supra photorefractive nonlinearity using\noverdrive and undershoot voltage effect.\n\nThe photorefractive effect in pure LC samples is also investigated, with our focus on the surface induced effect. Theoretical models were derived to identify the photorefractive threshold voltage. The PR threshold voltage can be substantially lowered with the increase of incident light intensity, which is mainly due to inhomogeneous interface ions distribution induced\nsurface torque. The thickness dependence of threshold voltage lowing effect was also measured, which allows us to estimate the\npenetration depth of surface torque. Our result shows surface effect strongly affects photorefractive properties of LC.\n\nBased on our preliminary work. several potential further researches are proposed, which are all related to photorefractive effect, yet fall into three categories . First is to further study\ndoping effect: increase SWNT doping concentration using functionalized nanotubes and try other novel doping materials such as nanometals. Second is to continue the investigation of surface effect in doped LC samples. We anticipate more interesting surface\neffect exists in doping system.

We also report the investigation of fragility in granular materials using controlled cyclic temperature variation, or thermal cycling that induces microscopic changes in the size of the grains and the container.\n\tWhen placed under sinusoidal vibration, the flow rate or flux from an unjammed container decreases with the peak velocity of the vibration, and becomes a constant at the highest peak velocities. The flux under vibration follows a 5/2 power scaling rule to corrected orifice diameter, the same scaling rule that is also observed in the absence of vibration. Under vibration, granular flux is no greater than the flux without vibration. Density dilution of granular packs under vibration is likely the cause for such reduced flux, and can be described by a model based on energy balance at the vibrating boundary. The eventual saturation of flux at the highest peak velocities signifies a possible transition from granular fluid to granular gas, as the density decreases and inter-grain interaction changes. \n\tBrief flows can be initiated from a jammed container using mechanical impacts. The number of grains flowing out of the container as well as the duration of these flows follows an almost exponential decay distribution. The probability that a flow can be initiated by an impact increases with impact intensity and ratio the diameters of the orifice and the grain. The possible container size and filling depth dependence are also discussed. \n\tFor the thermal cycling measurement, data show that the packing fraction of granular samples increases under thermal cycles regardless of the relative thermal expansions of the grains or the container. A heavy intruder, when passing a density threshold, sinks in a granular pile under thermal cycles. The results show that the bulk property of granular materials can be impacted by microscopic changes orders or magnitudes less, and without the input of mechanical energy.

The spheroids fabricated by our 3D acoustic tweezers can be cultured for a whole week with good cell viability. We further demonstrated that spheroids fabricated by this method could be used for drug testing. Unlike the 2D monolayer model, HepG2 spheroids fabricated by the 3D acoustic tweezers manifested distinct drug resistance, which matched existing reports. By co-culturing HepG2 spheroids with HMVEC cells, we found that spheroids tended to accelerate angiogenesis and tube formation process in Matrigel compared with isolated single cells.

The massively parallel second generation sequencing technologies applied to DNA samples highly enriched for TF occupancy (ChIP-seq) enables comprehensive and accurate mapping of epigenetic features at reasonably high resolution. With the increasing volume of such data being generated, one challenge is to develop computational methods that incorporate multiple relevant datasets to better understand gene regulatory mechanisms. \n\nTherefore, in this dissertation, we describe two novel computational approaches to detect TF binding features by incorporating multiple relevant ChIP-seq datasets. The first method is called PASS2 (Poisson Approximation for Significance version 2). While the traditional methods utilize ChIP-seq data from only one experiment to detect binding occupancy, PASS2 combines relevant biological features (e.g. co-binding information) to detect TF binding of a target protein. The idea behind this is that the binding of a target transcription factor can be partially learned from the co-binding proteins and so including the relevant data can improve the power of protein-binding detection. \n\nIn addition to detecting protein binding occupancy, identifying differential binding regions across conditions (cell lines, time points, and individuals) is also beneficial to us to understand gene regulation. Consideration of such approaches is still very limited, and thus we develop a second method: Cross-CaP (Cross Conditions and Proteins), which is designed to identify any differential and condition-specific TF occupancy across multiple conditions and features (e.g. TFs). The method is general and can be applied to datasets with at least two conditions and one feature. It also works when only a few or no biological replicates available. We apply the above two methods on both simulated and real datasets to demonstrate their robustness and power of data integration.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9213], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Kuanbei ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kuanbei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Webb Colby Miller", "Webb Colby Miller", "Dr Yu Zhang", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Padma Raghavan", "Kamesh Madduri"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Webb Colby Miller, Dissertation Advisor", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Chair", "Dr Yu Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Kamesh Madduri, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Computational Biology", "Bioinformatics", "Peak-Calling", "ChIP-seq", "Gene regulation", "Comparative Genomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ACTIVITY-ORIENTED CONTEXT MODEL FOR ADAPTIVE MOBILE GIS SYSTEM DESIGN \n\n\n\n", "id": "9683", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3578", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mobile GIS has been used to support many human activities such as tourism, navigation, and crisis management.

First, context models are inadequate in a sense that they merely deal with physical factors and fail to take into account the dynamics of cognitive factors. Second, the adaptation mechanisms for geovisualization often deal with context changes in isolation to user\u2019s activity resulting in missing the target of adaptation. \n\tIn this study, I believe that geovisualization should be situated in user\u2019s ongoing activities and dynamically present the most relevant information to the user.

The ability to survive and recover from these insults is critical to maintaining a healthy and functional nervous system. The goal of my study is to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind two axon injury responses, self-protection and axon regeneration, and study the relationship between\nthe two. \n  I have established a conditioning lesion assay in Drosophila larval sensory neurons to identify an endogenous protective response. I have discovered that traumatic axon injury protects dendrites against a secondary injury, and this protection requires DLK-JNK-fos-dependent upregulation of microtubule dynamics. Furthermore, the microtubule nucleation protein \u03b3Tub23C\nis important for injury-induced microtubule dynamics and protection. Strikingly, this microtubule-based protection is activated in two types of chronic stresses including expressing poly-Q neurodegenerative disease proteins and compromising kinesin-3-mediated axonal transport. In both scenarios, microtubule dynamics antagonize long-term neurodegeneration.\nTherefore, neurons may utilize upregulated microtubule dynamics as a general survival strategy to resist a variety of acute and chronic neuronal insults.\n  Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (Nmnats) are well-established neuroprotective factors. I have found that endogenous Nmnat is required for axon injury-induced protection. Genetic analysis suggests that Nmnat is subject to positive regulation by the DLK-JNK-fos pathway and negative regulation by a caspase cascade downstream of mitochondrial\nfission. Together, these results reveal a high degree of signaling complexity in Nmnat regulation.\n  Why is Nmnat so tightly regulated? Protection is an early axon injury response and axon regeneration occurs after its inactivation. Hyperactivation of Nmnat caused by JNK and fos overexpression or reduction of the initiator caspase Dronc, however, results in abnormalprotection in conjunction with axon regeneration defects. These defects can be rescued by reducing Nmnat. This suggests that (1) completion of neuroprotection is necessary for axon regeneration; (2) coordination between protection and axon regeneration relies on a tight control of Nmnat activity.\n  In summary, my results suggest that axon injury responses can be divided into multiple steps, such as protection and regeneration, and each step involves distinct regulatory mechanisms. As a beginning effort to untangle the complex regulatory networks of this multi-step model, I have uncovered that the DLK pathway protects neurons through Nmnat and microtubules early after axon injury, and later inactivates Nmnat through mitochondrial fission and caspases to turn protection off and allow axons to regenerate.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10950], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Li ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Li", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Rolls", "William O Hancock", "Richard W Ordway", "Douglas Cavener", "Zhi Chun Lai"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Rolls, Dissertation Advisor", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["axon regeneration", "neuroprotection", "microtubules", "gamma-tubulin", "Nmnat", "DLK", "JNK", "fos", "caspases", "mitochondria"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "SENSOR PERFORMANCE OF ADVANCED PHOTOCONTROL SYSTEMS\n", "id": "19943", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8918", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research was designed to establish better guidelines for photocontrol systems in common daylighting applications. The guidelines are based on a statistical analysis of the correlation between two control system calibration parameters: photosensor signal and the preferred dimming level. The ideal dimming level for a controlled lighting zone was the light output required to achieve the desired target illuminance at all points within the space. A 36\u2019 by 25\u2019 classroom was studied. Fa\u00e7ade orientation, different daylight delivery systems, interior shading devices, furniture and photosensor characteristics were included in this research as study variables. Energy consumption and system calibration were carefully explored with a focus on the accuracy of photosensor system\u2019s performance.\nFor a specific situation, scatter plots of the optimal dimming levels versus the photosensor signal for a specific situation numerically and graphically describe the sensor\u2019s response to the daylight conditions. A tightly clustered optimal dimming level versus signal band indicates high correlation and better tracking of the daylight level with the space. A calibration condition that produces limited over-dimming across the work plane analysis points can be determined given the control algorithm. Points located on the calibration line at low dimming levels are suggested commissioning conditions. The background information on these points, such as the shading condition, the time of the day, sky condition and so on, can be obtained to support the commissioning process. \nIn this work, three metrics are applied to evaluate system performance: the correlation coefficient between the sensor signal and the work plane illuminance; the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the ideal dimming levels and those predicted by the calibration line, and the energy savings  provided by the calibration compared to the optimum.\nAccording to the simulation results, the S/E ratios between different interior shade setting heights serve as the key to photosensor performance.  These ratios largely depend on the setting of the interior shading devices. A photosensor location with a relatively constant S/E ratio across different shade settings is desirable. Light shelves, in many cases, help to improve photosensor performance. In spaces with light shelves, a sensor with a wider spatial sensitivity distribution usually provides acceptable performance, while a sensor with a narrower spatial sensitivity distribution is better for spaces without light shelves. A sensor with its maximum sensitivity angled toward the interior back wall reduces daylight S/E ratio fluctuation. In most applications, the photosensor response to daylight has a higher S/E ratio than for electric light, and thus the daylight signal dominates. However, in cases when luminaires with indirect lighting are in use, the electric light signal can dominate the system and lead to system malfunctioning. So, one should avoid placing the sensor within the direct view of luminaire. Given that higher S/E ratios are generally achieved for daylight than for electric light, a constant setpoint control algorithm, although widely applied, is not recommended. \nGeneral guidelines are provided based on the results of simulations and statistical analysis. Interaction between variables in a photocontrol system is relatively hard to predict and avoid, given the subtle differences that occur in real spaces. A simulation is strongly recommended during system design and specification to acquire important performance information for a particular daylit space. A system evaluation that takes the control algorithm into consideration is crucial. The RMSE for a preferred calibration line is shown to be directly correlated to both the photosensor performance and system energy savings. This metric is recommended to serve as a primary photocontrol system simulation evaluation metric. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8759], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Ling ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "first_name_ssi": "Ling", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard George Mistrick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard George Mistrick, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Daylight", "Photocontrol", "Control Algorithm", "RMSE", "Guidelines"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Performance Analysis of Photocontrol Systems Across Shade Settings", "id": "14118luc164", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14118", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Daylight-responsive photocontrol systems have been commercially available for over two decades. Technological advancements have improved the performance and decreased the cost of these systems. Implementing daylight responsive photocontrol systems has been recognized as good design practice for energy-efficient buildings and are now promoted by energy codes, but a combination of dynamic daylighting conditions and control device operation makes the prediction of the system performance difficult to assess. Past research reveals that reliable photocontrol system operation requires proper configuration, such as the sensor aiming direction, the directional sensitivity (type), and the position of the photosensor, as well as proper system calibration. Most past studies were conducted assuming no shades or a fixed shade position. Few studies have explored the impact of window shading on system performance. \nRecent developments in daylight simulations have introduced Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Functions (BSDF) that improve the accuracy of simulation results for complex fenestration systems, provide more accurate simulations of the direct sun, and apply matrix-based simulation methods, which allow the reuse of the calculated matrices and provide efficient simulations for parametric modeling. Taking advantage of these developments, this study focuses on the evaluation of photocontrol system performance across different shade settings. The signal to work plane illuminance (S/E) ratios are assumed to be constant in most linearly controlled systems. The S/E ratio was employed as a key response measure in this study.\nStatistical analysis procedures are introduced to explore the significance of the independent variables - environmental variables and system configurations. ANOVA models fitted for the system performance across shade settings in this study explain about 90% of the response variance. The results show that shade setting is one of the most important factors in photocontrol system performance. A clear sky condition has been considered the primary cause of large response variations in system with a fixed shade setting, but, in systems integrated with multiple shade settings, the variance in S/E ratios introduced by the sky conditions is shown to be not as significant as that due to the shade operation. When window shades were lowered to a fixed position, the variance of S/E ratios in a system with low angle exterior obstructions was higher than that in a system without exterior obstructions, but the impact of the obstruction was comparably weak in a system with dynamically controlled shade. \nA number of system configuration variables were major contributors to the system performance when taking the shade settings into account. The aiming direction of the photosensor was ranked highest in importance. Directing the photosensor away from the window delivered high quality system performance. A photosensor located at a mid-depth (daylight zone) 7 ft (2.1 m) achieved better response accuracy over a photosensor located closer to the window and received higher signal than a deeper photosensor position, which delivered similar performance to the mid-depth photosensor. The directional sensitivity of the photosensor has a relevant weak contribution to the photocontrol system performance. A mid-depth cosine-corrected photosensor is generally preferred.

In such networks, the system resources are limited: the terminals are constrained in energy, bandwidth, storage, and processing capabilities. As a result of the decentralized and possibly large scale network structure, resource management becomes a prominent design issue for wireless ad hoc networks. In this dissertation, we investigate resource management, with an emphasis on power, for various ad hoc networks including wireless sensor networks, parallel relay networks and multiuser two-way relay networks. We aim at providing efficient communication strategies that will fully utilize the limited resources to improve the Quality of Service (QoS) that ad hoc networks can offer.\n\nWe first study efficient scheduling for a delay-constrained wireless sensor network. We consider a two-tiered model of clustered sensors, whose data collection includes intra- and inter-cluster communications. We first find the optimum schedule with polynomial complexity for intra-cluster communications, which minimizes the total power of all sensors while maintaining a short term average throughput at each sensor. Next, we show that the proposed scheduling protocol provides a near-optimum solution for inter-cluster communications where multi-antenna technique is employed.\n\nNext, we consider resource management for two types of relay-assisted ad hoc networks: parallel relay networks where the communication from a source to a destination is assisted by a number of intermediate relay nodes over orthogonal channels; multiuser two-way relay networks where multiple pairs of users exchange information with their pre-assigned partners via the help of a single relay node. Both relay networks in consideration are the building blocks of the future ad hoc networks.\n\nFor the parallel relay networks, we first propose a distributed decision mechanism for each relay to make decisions on whether to forward the source data. Next, we identify the optimum power allocation strategy, based on limited channel state information, that minimizes the total transmit power while providing a target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the destination with an outage probability constraint. In addition,  We consider two simpler distributed power allocation models, where the source does not contribute to the relay selection in the first one, and single relay is employed in the second one.\n\nFor the multiuser two-way relay networks, frequency/time/code division multiple access (F/T/CDMA) techniques can be employed to support multiuser communications. When F/TDMA is employed to provide orthogonal channels for each user pair, we investigate the optimum relay power allocation problem for various relay forwarding mechanisms to maximize the arbitrary weighted sum rate of all users. When CDMA is employed which results in an interference limited system, we design the multiuser two-way relaying scheme that allows each pair of partners to share a common CDMA spreading signature, and solve the interference management problem by constructing the iterative power control and receiver updates that converge to the corresponding unique optimum.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4374], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Min ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aylin Yener", "Aylin Yener", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "Thomas F Laporta", "Guohong Cao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aylin Yener, Dissertation Advisor", "Aylin Yener, Committee Chair", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Member", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wireless communications", "wireless ad hoc networks", "relay networks", "resource management", "power allocation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "STRATEGIES FOR THE SCALE-UP OF THE U.S. CELLULOSIC BIOFUELS INDUSTRY: INTEGRATED BIOREFINERY & BUYER-SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS", "id": "13382muc283", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13382", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The world\u2019s growing population is demanding increasing energy and materials, currently dominated by non-renewable fossil fuels. The U.S. biofuels industry development is responding to consumer demand for environmentally-friendly products.  A thorough review reveals that in the United States, corn-grain ethanol and biodiesel have served as the major alternatives for petroleum-based gasoline and diesel over the past few decades. However, first generation biofuels are often criticized on their implications on food price and land use change. Second generation (cellulosic) biofuels avoid the food-fuel controversy, but have yet to become widely commercialized. As a result, existing literature has signaled that the integrated production of cellulosic biofuel and bio-based chemicals is a potential strategy to provide financial incentives and competitive advantage to cellulosic biofuel biorefineries (BRs). Another strategy for cellulosic biofuel BRs to consider is to form relationships with downstream customers which may solidify the supply chain and bring stability to commercialization plans. \nHowever, no existing literature was found to quantitatively evaluate potential factors confronting the commercialization of the U.S. cellulosic biofuels industry and integrated cellulosic BRs/integrated production of both cellulosic biofuels and biochemicals. Also, less is known about the relationships between biofuel suppliers and their downstream customers. The present study was designed to bridge the gap in the literature to provide empirical evidence of 1) quantifying (rating and ranking) the importance/degree of drivers and barriers to the commercialization of the U.S. cellulosic biofuels industry and integrated cellulosic BRs and 2) examining the types of biofuel customers, identifying variables characterizing biofuel buyer-supplier relationships, and exploring strategies strengthening the relationships. \nThis study\u2019s online and paper-based surveys resulted in 228 or 34 percent of the 678 experts from seven USDA-National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) Coordinated Agricultural Projects (CAPs) and two industrial conferences between July and November 2015 to address the first objective.

However, they can cause severe or fatal toxicity problems when their concentrations in the body exceed certain ranges1\u20133. To mitigate their toxic effects on the body, a myriad of antidotes have been developed. Of them, nanoparticles (e.g., liposomes) have recently attracted the most attention because nanoparticles can act as a sink to sequester toxic molecules more efficiently 4,5. Despite their promise, most nanoparticles have relatively low affinity in sequestering target molecules and slow sequestration rates. Moreover, currently available nanoparticle antidotes cannot be actively regulated to control their capability of sequestering target molecules. As a result, when nanoparticles are applied to sequester endogenous signaling molecules, these molecules may be over eliminated, which can also cause severe effects or even fatality. Thus, it is important that nanoparticle antidotes provide molecularly controllable target sequestration, which has never been studied before. \n\nThis dissertation research explores the concept of bidirectional molecular recognition control for the development of an open, programmable nanoscale antidote. This nanoscale antidote can not only sequester target molecules effectively and rapidly, but also release target molecules via molecular interactions on demand. To construct the antidote, DNA oligonucleotides were used as programmable building blocks and affinity ligands (i.e., nucleic acid aptamer) for the synthesis of both linear and branched affinity DNA polymers (DPs). A magnetic nanoparticle was used as a nanoscaffold to support the growth of the DPs on its surface. Each repeating unit of the DP has the capability of target sequestration. The sequestration functionality of this programmable nanoparticle antidote was evaluated by using both a small molecule drug and large molecule protein. This novel antidote was also examined by evaluating its capabilities in mitigating the biological effects of the drug and the protein. Moreover the reversing of target sequestration via molecular regulation was validated. \n\nThis dissertation has four major chapters. In Chapter 1, current strategies for developing nanoparticle-based antidotes are systematically reviewed. In Chapter 2, the synthesis of affinity DNA polymer-functionalized nanoparticles is introduced. In Chapter 3, the functionalities of the programmable antidote for detoxification is demonstrated in vitro. In Chapter 4, the ability to program the function of the antidote via molecular regulation is validated. The data suggest that this antidote can sequester both small molecules and large proteins. Importantly, this antidote can be programmed via strand displacement to control the molecular sequestration.\n \nThe success of this study has opened a new avenue for the development of antidotes for safe and effective detoxification of either endogenous or exogenous molecules. Moreover, the programmable antidote explored in this dissertation research holds great potential as a smart nanomaterial for other biomedical applications, such as molecularly regulated drug delivery.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10449], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Niancao ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Niancao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yong Wang", "Yong Wang", "Jian Yang", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Manish Kumar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yong Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Yong Wang, Committee Chair", "Jian Yang, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Manish Kumar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aptamer", "Nanoparticle", "detoxification"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Orienting visual attention in space: Is capture of attention purely stimulus-driven or contingent upon goal-driven settings?", "id": "7579", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5037", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Visuospatial attention refers to the selection of stimuli that appear in the location to which attention is oriented.

The present study focuses on the question: Is attention captured by any and all salient stimuli, or only by stimuli that contain the attribute that defines the target?  Two hypotheses have been presented to answer this question. Contingent Capture argues that a stimulus can only capture attention when it contains some attributes in common with the target or what is currently relevant to the task.  In opposition to Contingent Capture, Rapid Disengagement posits that stimuli that do not contain the target-defining attribute can capture attention but rather briefly.  Two independent experiments were conducted.  The behavioral experiment provided findings consistent with Contingent Capture.  However, the psychophysiological experiment did not provide an answer to the addressed question.  Therefore, evidence up to this point favors Contingent Capture over Rapid Disengagement.

Another example is poly( vinylidene fluoridechlorotrifluoroethylene)\ncopolymer, P(VDF-CTFE), which can store and release\nelectrical energy density of higher than 25J/cm2. This thesis presents a study\non the application of these polymers in tunable optical devices and high energy\ndensity capacitors.\nAs an example of tunable optical devices, an electrically tunable long-period\nfiber grating (LPG) with P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) terpolymer as a second cladding\nhas been demonstrated. A theoretical model has been developed to study the\ndevice performance. Computer simulation results indicated that the indium tin\noxide (ITO) layer which acts the inner electrode for the terpolymer significantly\nincreases the tuning range of the LPG. Furthermore, the tuning range of the LPG\ndepends on the native refractive index of the terpolymer and maximum tuning\niii\nrange can be achieved if the native index is increased by about 0.02.\nA fabrication process for the tunable LPG has been developed which included\ndip coating of polymer on fiber. In order to increase the native refractive index of\nthe terpolymer to achieve maximum tuning range, a nanocomposite approach has\nbeen employed where small amount of high refractive index zinc sulfide nanoparticles\nwere added into terpolymer matrix. With a properly designed chemical synthesis\nroute the nanocomposite exhibited increased refractive index while maintaining\nhigh transparency and relatively large E-O effect. Based on the nanocomposite a\ntunable LPG with tuning range of 50nm has been demonstrated, which is sufficient\nto cover an entire optical communication band.\nIn energy storage capacitors, not only high energy density but also high efficiency\nand reliability of the polymer films are required. For P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)\nterpolymers, electrical breakdown is an important concern that affects both the energy\ndensity and reliability of dielectric capacitors. It has been observed that both\nthe breakdown electric field and conduction current of the terpolymer depends on\nthe type of metal electrode, which indicates that both processes are controlled by\nmetal-polymer interface. Aluminum and chromium showed considerably higher\nbreakdown field and lower current density compared to gold and silver. In addition\nto the effect of metal work functions, another factor that contributes to the\ninterface effect is the formation of interfacial layer.

We investigate rotator phase formation in PE and iPP \nby developing simulation techniques that allow one to measure thermodynamic and spectroscopic properties of bulk phases. First, we examine the melting transitions of polymer crystal and rotator phases by presenting a simple method to accurately simulate polymer melting points. Next, we demonstrate an approach to predict the Raman spectra of bulk structures from MD simulation, that can be used to identify the spectral signatures of rotator phases. Lastly, we develop a novel ``plunger\" method to measure the polymer crystal-melt interfacial tension, which is a key parameter that governs the nucleation barrier. Using the above methods, we provide support for mesomorphic phase transitions in the nucleation pathway of iPP, which at present is not well-characterized experimentally. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16120], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Qin ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "first_name_ssi": "Qin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott Thomas Milner", "Scott Thomas Milner", "Enrique Daniel Gomez", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Robert John Hickey III"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott Thomas Milner, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott Thomas Milner, Committee Chair", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Committee Member", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Robert John Hickey III, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Crystallization", "polyethylene", "polypropylene", "strobl", "rotator phase", "nucleation", "mesomorphic phase", "molecular dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ENSILING CORN STOVER WITH ENZYMES AS A FEEDSTOCK PRESERVATION METHOD FOR BIOCONVERSION", "id": "9311", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5065", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-01-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Energy sustainability and environmental protection are two great challenges that face humanity. Biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass have been recognized as a potential solution for both of these interrelated issues. However, there is a serious bottleneck to economical and efficient ethanol production: the recalcitrance of lignocellulosic biomass due to lignin.  This bottleneck has to be solved before cellulosic biofuels can play a significant role in a renewable energy society. To produce biofuels sustainably from lignocellulosic biomass, it will be necessary to store preserve large amounts of feedstock from seasonally harvested fields.  Wet storage, and specifically ensilage, could serve as a promising platform for biological pretreatment, since saccharification of the cell wall occurs naturally by organic acids and amended enzymes during the ensilage process. In this study, the impact of the interaction between corn stover harvest seasons and cell wall degrading enzymes was investigated.  These investigations included both experimental studies and model simulations of the impacts of feedstock, storage conditions and enzymes, including cellulase and hemicellulase or laccase, on the characteristics of stover silage.  The objectives were to obtain a low pH, minimize dry matter losses, and create beneficial biochemical changes in the stover that would facilitate downstream pretreatment and bioconversion. \nIn temperate climates, the corn stover harvest can extend from early fall to early winter, during which time the chemical composition of stover varies significantly and influences the ensilage process. Identifying the optimum harvest period can help maximize utilization of stover as a feedstock for bioethanol. The first investigations explored the effects of harvest date and enzyme addition along with possible interactions on the characteristics of corn stover silage. Corn stover was harvested five times in 2005 and eight times in 2006 throughout early fall and early winter. Samples 500g were subsequently ensiled at 37\u00baC with and without the enzyme treatments at both field moisture and 60% moisture (w.b.). Dry matter loss, pH, water soluble carbohydrate and monosaccharides were analyzed on days 0, 1, 7, and 21. Samples were also subjected to reduced severity dilute acid pretreatment to quantify the conversion to simple sugars. Results demonstrated that harvest date had a significant impact on the quality of stover silage for bioconversion. The moisture content of corn stover, cob and corn were significantly influenced by harvest date, and at later harvest dates, moisture addition was critical for obtaining high quality silage.  Results indicated that early fall was the best harvest time in terms of pH, dry matter, water soluble carbohydrate and monosaccharide as well as xylan conversion percentage. With respect to corn stover silage, the addition of enzymes significantly enhanced the positive effects.\nThe presence of lignin in ligninocellulosic biomass constrains and challenges the improvement of bioconversion techniques. A second set of investigations were performed to explore the influence of the lignin-degrading enzyme, laccase, on enzymatic ensiled corn stover. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) thermochemolysis and Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) results documented molecular signals of lignin decomposition in laccase-treated stover. Cellulose conversion through enzymatic hydrolysis improved with an increase in the laccase loading rate.  This enhanced cellulose digestibility is believed to result from better exposure of cellulose to cellulase through structural changes of lignin, which makes more cellulase available for cellulose hydrolysis. The findings suggest that ensilage might provide a platform for biological pretreatment platform, partially hydrolyzing cellulose and hemicellulose into soluble sugars during the enzymatic ensilage process, and thus facilitating laccase penetration into complex biomass to enhance lignin degradation. These results serve as a first step to understanding the addition of multiple enzyme combinations during ensilage to maximize the utilization of corn stover as a biofuel and biochemical feedstock.\nThe final quality of enzymatically ensiled corn stover was significantly affected by its initial chemical composition, microbial population dynamics, enzyme activities, and thermal and physical conditions of silage fermentations. A comprehensive experimental study to better understand how the interactions of these factors govern silage quality requires a large number of trials and intensive analysis. A predictive enzymatic ensilage model, which was initially developed in a series of papers by Pitt and his colleagues in the late 1980s, was enhanced and then applied to simulate the dynamic behavior of pH, water soluble carbohydrates (WSC), cellulose, and the effects of enzyme additives on the major biochemical and microbial changes during the ensilage process. Estimated final pH, WSC and cellulose concentrations are in agreement with enzymatic silage experimental results. The simulation results also demonstrated that the cellulose loading rate had a significant positive effect on the change of WSC.  Results showed enzyme additives in the silage process enhanced the stability of long term storage. The optimal experimental conditions to obtain a high quality enzymatic corn stover silage can be achieved by adjusting the cellulase loading rate and operation temperature. The enhanced model could serve as a guide in designing silage systems (with or without enzyme additives) for large amounts of plant-based biomass.\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrated harvest seasons and cell wall degrading enzymes have strong effects on the characteristics of stover silage, and that ensilage technology was an effective preservation and pretreatment strategy for bioconversion of corn stover biomass. In order to further improve ensilage as a partial substitute for expensive and energy-intensive thermal and chemical pretreatment technologies, future work should focus on using biological strategies to deconstruct the recalcitrant structure of lignocellulosic biomass.  If successful, such efforts could thereby improve bioconversion efficiency dramatically. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5041], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Qin  ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qin ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Lehman Richard", "Thomas Lehman Richard", "Ali Demirci", "Ming Tien", "James Landis Rosenberger", "Corey W Radtke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Lehman Richard, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Lehman Richard, Committee Chair", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member", "Corey W Radtke, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["corn stover", "enzyme", "laccase", "ensilage", "harvest date", "lignin depolymerization", "pretreatment", "bioconversion", "modeling."]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Molecular Evolution of Influenza Viruses", "id": "10009", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5341", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite intermittent historical pandemics caused by the cross-species transmission of avian influenza viruses (AIV), our knowledge of how influenza viruses evolve, transmit and persist in the wild bird population is obscure.  In particular, since RNA viruses normally have very rapid evolutionary rates due to the error prone character of RNA depended RNA polymerase coupled with large population sizes, the often stated idea that AIVs exhibit \u201cevolutionary stasis\u201d is highly questionable.  In addition, the impact made by natural selection and reassortment on the evolution of AIVs is obscure.  Finally, although bird migration is believed to play an important role in the transmission and spread of avian influenza viruses in natural situations, our current understanding of how AIVs transmit among birds along their migration flyways, or how genetic diversity accumulates through space and time, as well as the interactions among viral strains with different subtype or genome constellations, is inadequate. \nThanks to greatly increasing numbers of AIV genome sequences and newly developed methods of bioinformatic analyses, these questions are now explored in detail, for the first time, in different chapters of the thesis.  First, I observed rapid rates of nucleotide substitution \u2013 ranging from 1.8 \u2013 8.4\u00d710-3 nucleotide substitutions per site, per year \u2013 among different avian species (including both wild aquatic birds and poultry), gene segments and serotypes of a broad range of AIVs.  These rates are similar to those seen in most other RNA viruses.  Second, extensive phylogenetic analyses of genome sequences revealed 1) frequent reassortment events among a diverse range of AIVs, 2) geographic segregation between Eurasian/Australian and North American strains (although with some limited gene flow among these regions), and 3) contrasting phylogenetic patterns between segments encoding surface glycoprotein or nonstructural proteins (HA/NA/NS), and those encoding the internal proteins (PB2/PB1/PA/NP/M).  Specifically, the HA/NA/NS are characterized by distinct clades/subtypes and extensive genetic diversity, whereas the PB2/PB1/PA/NP/M segments comprise a single gene pool with much shallower genetic diversity.  By estimating the time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) of each segment, we found that the current genetic diversity of the internal gene segments has a surprisingly recent origin, only ~100 (95% HPD: 74 \u2013 170) years ago, and hence similar to the individual subtypes of HA, NA and NS.  In marked contrast, the total MRCAs for HA, NA and NS are much older, dating back from ~500 (NS) to more than 1000 (HA and NA) years ago.  As a result of these distinct evolutionary processes I suggest that the population genetic structure of the internal segments is the result of a complex process of serial hitch-hiking among competing viral strains characterized by differing antigenicity, coupled with rapid gene flow on both the continental and global scales.  In a complementary study I examined the transmission pattern of AIVs in North America using a parsimony mapping approach.  This revealed that the evolution of AIV is significantly shaped by geographic location and time of sampling, but not by host avian species, indicative of frequent cross-species transmission.  Finally, as a counterpoint to my work on influenza A virus, I also considered the evolutionary patterns and dynamics of human influenza B virus.  This revealed a complex process of divergence and competitive evolution between antigenically different strains, as well as a likely interaction between influenza A and B viruses.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5336], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Rubing ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rubing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Edward Holmes", "Bryan T Grenfell", "Edward C Holmes", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Anthony Paul Schmitt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin Edward Holmes, Dissertation Advisor", "Bryan T Grenfell, Committee Chair", "Edward C Holmes, Committee Member", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Member", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Molecular Evolution", "Avian influenza virus", "Phylogenetics", "Reassortment", "Transmission"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Heterogeneous Recurrence Analysis of Vectorcardiogram Signals ", "id": "15242rxc91", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15242", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent advancement of sensing technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity for screening of Vectorcardiogram (VCG) signals. This type of signals monitor both spatial and temporal cardiac electrical activities along three orthogonal planes of the body. Therefore, they offer a unique opportunity to study the Myocardial Infarction (MI), one of the leading causes of death throughout the world. Traditionally, recurrence analysis is considered for analyzing VCG signals and characterizing MIs. However, this method relies on the assumption of homogeneity and is limited in the ability to reveal hidden patterns of VCG signals. Noted, heterogeneous recurrences are more related to the variations of recurrence states in terms of state properties and the evolving dynamics of VCG signals. Very little work has been done to study the heterogeneous recurrence behavior of the VCG signals. This paper presents a novel approach of heterogeneous recurrence analysis to study the hidden patterns in VCG signals and thereby characterizing the MIs. First, a nonlinear state space is reconstructed and the state space is then recursively partitioned into a hierarchical structure. Next, extracted quantifiers are effectively characterized the state transitions among segmented sub-regions by fractal representation. Then, the Dirichlet process model as a nonparametric method is utilized to cluster the quantifiers. Finally, a multivariate monitoring method is considered to detect MI behaviors in VCG signals according to the orthonormalized variables in each cluster. The proposed methodology is evaluated and validated with real-world data from human subjects. Experimental results show that the proposed approach not only perfectly captures heterogeneous recurrence patterns of VCG signals through the fractal representation but also successfully monitors and reveals the MIs changes in the dynamics of the signals.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16721], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Ruimin ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "first_name_ssi": "Ruimin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hui Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hui Yang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heterogeneous recurrence analysis", "Vectorcardiogram", "Processing monitoring and control"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Projecting the influence of climate change and daily temperature range on insect phenology and risk period of vector borne diseases\n", "id": "12060", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5933", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding how climate change would influence the life history and population dynamics of insects is a key component needed to evaluate the impact of climate change on ecological and epidemiological systems, since insects are relatively sensitive to their surrounding environment, especially ambient temperature. Previous research has demonstrated that rising mean temperatures can influence voltinism,\ngeographic distribution, and vectoring capacity. However, the distributional change among life stages for specific climate scenarios, and the importance of the daily temperature range (DTR), or daily temperature fluctuations, has not been emphasized. \n\nIn this thesis we employed an agroecosystem and an epidemiological system and quantitatively study how changes in daily temperature range, as well as in mean temperature, would shift pest/vector insect phenology.\n\nIn the first chapter (chapter II) following the introduction chapter (chapter I), I developed an individual based Monte Carlo simulation method to project grape berry moth (Paralobesia viteana) life history (e.g. number of generations per year, mean and distribution of emergence time for each generation) under two different climate change scenarios, A1fi and B1, which represent upper and lower global warming conditions,\nrespectively. The results showed that under A1fi condition the number of generations per year would increase nonlinearly after an initial lag of approximately 35 years (from 2009), and by the end of this century we might expect almost one more generations per year on average and a 5th generation would be more common. \n\nI then further investigated how changes in the daily temperature range would influence degree day accumulation and consequently P. viteana phenology in chapter III. I discovered that mean temperature alone could not sufficiently and accurately compute degree day accumulation, and\nvarious daily temperature range conditions substantially influences degree day accumulation. Large changes in daily temperature fluctuations around current climatic conditions were sufficient to allow the voltinism of P. viteana to approach that simulated to occur in at the end of this century. The simulations based on different daily temperature ranges and mean temperature conditions revealed that, even when mean temperature decreased, larger daily temperature ranges could compensate the effect of\ndecreasing mean temperature, resulting in a similar number of generations per year.\nThese results confirmed that daily temperature range should be an important factor in\nmodeling insect phenology and population dynamics.\n\nIn chapter IV I considered an epidemiological system and investigated if degree\nday models could predict West Nile virus (WNV) incidence dates in Pennsylvania. The original degree days model did not consider a temperature-dependent extrinsic incubation period or longevity changes in vector mosquitoes (Culex spp.), and did not capture virus transmission period well in four locations (Harrisburg, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Williamsport) in Pennsylvania from 2002 to 2008. By treating decreasing the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) at the beginning of the season, and incorporating adult mosquito longevity a variable as well, model performance was increased significantly. I also demonstrated that mosquito species composition should be an important factor for\npredicting WNV transmission period. The calibrated models performed well to predict\nWNV emergence period in Pennsylvania, with a success rate of more than 70% compared to less than 30% in the uncalibrated model. \n\nIn the successive research in chapter V I demonstrated that mean temperature alone did not provide enough information to compute degree day accumulation and predict disease transmission period well. I quantified WNV transmission period by comprehensively exploring combinations of\nchanging daily temperature range and mean temperature in four locations: Harrisburg,\nPhiladelphia, Pittsburgh, and Williamsport in Pennsylvania. I investigated vector mosquito life history change according to these different climate change conditions. The results again showed that even when the mean temperatures remained the same, a large daily temperature variation results in more degree day accumulation and consequently a longer transmission period. Increasing mean temperature with increasing or decreasing the daily temperature range would yield earlier first incidences and later last incidences. I also demonstrated that increasing daily temperature range would impact disease\ntransmission more dramatically in relatively cooler areas (Williamsport, Harrisburg, and\nPittsburgh) than relatively warm areas (Philadelphia). These results showed how daily\ntemperature range alters WNV epidemics quantitatively and confirmed that I need to\nconsider daily temperature range in our research in addition to mean temperature.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5927], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Shi ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shelby Jay Fleischer", "Shelby Jay Fleischer", "Michael Craig Saunders", "Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Matthew Brian Thomas", "John Fricks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shelby Jay Fleischer, Dissertation Advisor", "Shelby Jay Fleischer, Committee Chair", "Michael Craig Saunders, Committee Chair", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Member", "Matthew Brian Thomas, Committee Member", "John Fricks, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vector borne diseases", "insect phenology", "daily temperature range", "climate change", "risk period"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A COMPARISON OF CHEMICAL MECHANISMS BASED ON TexAQS-2006 FIELD DATA\n\n", "id": "8737", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5809", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " Several chemical mechanisms have been developed to describe the chemistry of troposphere. Although model calculations using different mechanisms have been compared before, they have not also been compared to measurements during a field campaign. In this study, a comparison of several widely used mechanisms (RACM, CB05, LaRC, SAPRC-99, SAPRC-07, and MCMv3.1) has been conducted based on TexAQS-2006 field data. The concentrations of hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxy (HO2) radicals (called HOx collectively) were calculated by a zero-dimensional box model with\neach mechanism and then compared with OH and HO2 measurements.\n The OH and HO2 calculated by the different mechanisms show similarities and differences with each other and with the measurements. For daytime, CB05 predicts the highest values and SAPRC-99 predicts the lowest. The median modeled-to-observed ratio is 0.82 and 0.77 (CB05), 0.81 and 0.66 (RACM), 0.78 and 0.61 (LaRC), 0.70 and 0.66 (MCMv3.1), 0.65 and 0.77 (SAPRC-07), and 0.59 and 0.54 (SAPRC-99) for OH and HO2, respectively. For nighttime, the highest nighttime OH and HO2 mixing ratios are\npredicted by RACM and CB05 with modeled-to-observed ratios of only 0.16 and 0.40, respectively. In general, OH and HO2 were underestimated by all mechanisms. The modeled and measured ratio of HO2/OH suggests good simulation when NO is about 1 ppbv, although it is too high when NO was less and too low when NO was more, in agreement with previous studies.\n OH concentrations are determined by its production and loss, which are in balance on time scales of a few seconds. The former can be calculated based on measurements, and was controlled by the reaction of HO2 with NO for this campaign. The latter is the product of the OH concentration and the OH reactivity (the inverse of the OH lifetime), which was also measured during this campaign. The calculated OH reactivity based on each mechanism generally agrees with the observation to within the observational uncertainty, although the largest discrepancy can reach up to 20% of the observed value for the morning peak time. This agreement between measured and\ncalculated OH reactivity indicates that (1) all important OH reactants were measured; (2)\ndifferent lumping methods of organic species in these mechanisms lead to little difference in OH loss. In addition, OH production and loss agree to within measurement uncertainties for most days and for most times of the day. However, OH production was overestimated by a factor of up to 3 at morning rush hour when NO has average peak\nconcentration of 14 ppbv, as has been seen in other studies. This overestimated OH production is difficult to understand.\n Mechanism-mechanism discrepancy and model-measurement difference were sensitive to the environmental conditions. The deviation of modeling results by each mechanism reduces under polluted condition but the modeled-to-measured ratio increases slightly under clean condition. The overall under-prediction of HOx still occurs under different conditions for all mechanisms, which further underestimate O3 production in the model because lower-than-measured HO2 was calculated.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5805], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Shuang ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shuang", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Henry Brune", "William Henry Brune"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Henry Brune, Thesis Advisor", "William Henry Brune, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["OH", "HO2", "radical", "chemical mechanism", "comparison", "modeling", "atmosphere"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF CHEMICAL MECHANISMS BASED ON FIELD DATA", "id": "12177", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13283", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ozone air pollution damages the health of humans and ecosystems; it has been the focus of decades of research and regulatory action. Despite the success of these efforts in the cores of several cities, ozone persists as a problematic pollutant through much of the world. The atmospheric processes causing ozone are complex and contain hundreds of chemical reactions, including reactions of reactive gases hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO2). Chemical mechanisms describe these complex chemical reactions mathematically and hence are essential for air quality modeling. Our previous study of a comparison of box model simulations with five chemical mechanisms indicated that modeled OH and HO2 amounts were generally lower than the measurements conducted during the TRAMP field campaign in Houston TX, 2006 (Chen et al., Atmospheric Environment, 44, 4116-4125, 2010). \nIn this study, as a first step toward improving model performance, sensitivity analysis was applied to study the effect of the uncertainties in all model constraints and inputs on the uncertainties in OH, HO2, and ozone production predictions. Uncertainties in hundreds of model parameters were assigned in a reasonable manner for measured amounts of model constraints, photolysis rates and kinetic rates, and the product yields, typically ranging from about 10% to a factor of two. 28,500 Monte Carlo runs were made with given sets of different initial conditions based on the measurements of this field campaign. The most influential model parameters contributing to the predictive uncertainty were investigated by a global sensitivity analysis method called Random Sampling High Dimensional Model Representation (RS-HDMR).\nThe model-measurement discrepancies were examined based on over 100 base cases from 16 days of field data. The relative uncertainty (\u00c2\u00b11&#963;) exhibits a persistent diurnal pattern: high uncertainty at morning rush hour (about 35%), low uncertainty in the afternoon (about 20%), and intermediate uncertainty at night (about 25%). The sources of model uncertainty are dominated by the uncertainties in chemical schemes (30-60% from kinetic rates and 10-40% from product yields), while the uncertainties in measurements are less influential. The most important model parameters are generally associated with the amounts of monoterpenes and acetaldehyde, the photolysis of HONO and HCHO (&#8594;HO2), and the reactions of OH with NO2, HO2 with NO, internal alkenes with ozone, and xylenes with OH. As indicated by the modeled-to-observed ratios, the relative impacts on OH and HO2 by the adjustments of the ten most important model parameters were analyzed. A test simulation using their adjusted values generates 11% and 39% higher values of OH and HO2. Compared to the original model results with average modeled-to-observed ratios of 0.73 and 0.59, overall better agreement was achieved with the adjusted model, which gave average modeled-to-observed ratios of 0.84 and 0.80 for OH and HO2, respectively. \nThe effect of uncertainties of model parameters on the prediction of whether ozone production is limited by nitrogen oxides (NOx) or by volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) was examined for over 30 transition cases between NOx-sensitive and VOC-sensitive regimes. The impacts of the most important parameters on ozone production limitations by NOx or VOCs were quantified. The greater values of the NO amount, the reaction rates of NO2 + OH, NO + HO2 and ISOP (isoprene peroxy radicals) + NO rather more VOC-sensitivity, while the higher values of higher aldehydes and nonoterpenes, and kinetic rates associated with reactions of OH with aldehydes and xylenes, internal alkenes with O3, and ISOP with HO2 rather more NOx-sensitivity of ozone under the studied conditions. The test adjustments of the ten key model parameters to obtain better modeling-measurement agreement would lead to a shift of O3 production limitation toward NOx-sensitive regime.\nThe mechanism-mechanism differences in model predictions were examined based on about 30 cases from four typical days of data. The difference in kinetic rates is the major source (averaged 53-91%) for nighttime when the mechanism-mechanism discrepancy is larger, while the difference in product yields are more important (averaged 49%) during daytime when the discrepancy is smaller. The major contributors were revealed to be associated with the reactions of internal alkenes with O3, alkenes/xylenes/ aldehydes with OH, and organic peroxy radicals with HO2 or NO. \nModel sensitivity of OH and HO2 was also examined by varying each model parameter by a factor of three one-at-a-time to test the model response if the uncertainties in some model parameters were greatly underestimated. Thirty-one model parameters were considered influential with the corresponding percentage of HOx variation greater than 10%. For most of these important model parameters, both small and large perturbations of their constrained values lead to significant variations of OH and HO2. However, some model parameters were found influential only when larger variations were assumed, but not influential within their assigned uncertainties. Such model parameters included the amounts of ozone and several internal alkenes, and product yields of peroxy radicals generated from reactions of HC3 with OH and RO2 with NO.  \nThe sensitivity analysis applied in this study helps evaluate model uncertainty comprehensively and improve model performance by quantifying the uncertainty sources from the model parameters associated with chemical mechanisms. The model parameters and photochemical processes that have great impacts on simulation results help to establish priorities for further kinetic or experimental studies. These results can then be used to improve chemical schemes to better represent the complex atmospheric processes and to achieve better model-measurement agreement eventually. With a better understanding of these complex atmospheric processes, more effective regulatory action can then be taken to reduce the ozone air pollution and improve the air quality.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12830], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Shuang ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shuang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William H.

However, current Li-S  \nfrequently suffer from low practical energy density, poor cycle life, low efficiency, and high self-discharge. Those issues mainly stem from the poor\nconductivity of sulfur and its lithiated products, the dissolution and side-reactions of intermediate lithium polysulfides, and the unstable lithium-electrolyte interface.\n\nThis dissertation focuses on development of high-sulfur-fraction carbon/sulfur composite cathode materials and efficient electrolyte systems for Li-S batteries, aiming to improve both their practical energy densities and electrochemical performance. In Chapter 3, hollow carbon (HC) spheres with extremely high specific volume (>10 cm3 g-1) are shown to accommodate ultrahigh sulfur fraction (~90 wt%) in their nano-scale pores. The obtained HC/S composites enable high areal sulfur loading of up to 6.9 mg cm-2 in the cathode electrode using industry-adopted coating techniques. In addition, a new hydrofluoroether-based electrolyte is shown to significantly mitigate polysulfide dissolution and also to facilitate the electrochemical\nreactions of sulfur cathodes. Combined with this new electrolyte, the\nhigh-sulfur-fraction and high-areal-loading HC/S composite cathode can achieve exceptional performance, which can significantly improve both the cyclability and the practical energy density of the Li-S batteries. In chapter 4, substituting soluble Li polysulfides for conventional Li salts in the commonly used Li-S electrolyte is found to not only contribute extra capacity but also significantly improve the cycling performance of Li-S cells. In chapter 5, a new functional electrolyte system using electrochemically active organosulfides (e.g., dimethyl disulfide) as co-solvents is shown to reduce the required electrolyte amount while at the same time increasing cell capacity. The organosulfides lead to a new reaction pathway for sulfur cathodes, which involves the chemical reactions between organosulfides and sulfur to new intermediate organopolysulfides, followed by their subsequent electrochemical reactions during cell cycling. Through this new mechanism, the functional organosulfide electrolyte not only contributes a significant amount of capacity, but also enables good cathode cyclability by way of an automatic discharge shutoff mechanism. This new functional electrolyte system thus promises high energy density for Li-S batteries.\n\nIn the appendix, the development of silicon-carbon yolk-shell nanocomposite materials is discussed.

The aim of this study is to develop a numerical model to effectively and reliably assess seismically-induced slope deformations that typically involve large deformations and complex soil constitutive behaviors. A numerical model based on the meshfree Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method has been developed by implementing various advanced constitutive models into the SPH formulations. The developed model is validated by two readily available and well-documented experiments: axisymmetric collapses of granular columns and model slope tests on a shaking table. For the former, the non-dilatant Drucker-Prager (D-P) constitutive relationship with perfect plasticity is used. The developed model precisely reproduces the experimentally-observed three regimes of flow patterns based on the initial aspect ratio of the granular column. In addition to the flow patterns, the simulated final deposit height and run-out distance along with the non-deformed region after the collapse of granular columns are in excellent agreement with experimental data in the literature. For the latter, a constitutive model that combines the strain-softening viscoplasticity and Modified Kondner and Zelasko (MKZ) rule is implemented and utilized to account for the effects of wave propagation in the sliding mass, cyclic nonlinear behavior of soil, and progressive reduction in shear strength during sliding, which are not explicitly considered in various Newmark-type analyses widely used in the current research and practice in geotechnical earthquake engineering. The initiation of slope failure and subsequent progressive development of the sliding surface are successfully captured by the developed SPH model. A localized shear band along the failure surface and a bulge near the toe of the model slope are observed in the simulations, showing a good agreement with the experimental observations. The simulated failure mode, displacement time histories, and acceleration response spectra at several monitor locations along the model slope also agree well with the experimental recordings. \n\tBased on the validated SPH model, a parametric study is followed to investigate the effects of spatial parameters including both particle spacing and smooth length on the accuracy of SPH simulations. The parametric study also investigates the effects of material strength and shear modulus along with boundary conditions on the seismically-induced slope deformations, providing insights into the mechanisms of earthquake-induced slope deformations. It is thus suggested that the proposed SPH model is an effective tool for assessing the seismic performance of soil slopes. It may be also used to advance the computational capability of modeling geotechnical engineering phenomena involving large deformations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7942, 7943], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tong Qiu", "Tong Qiu", "Daniel G Linzell", "Prasenjit Basu", "Shelley Marie Stoffels", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tong Qiu, Dissertation Advisor", "Tong Qiu, Committee Chair", "Daniel G Linzell, Committee Member", "Prasenjit Basu, Committee Member", "Shelley Marie Stoffels, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Method; Large Deformation; Dynam"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DETECTION AND ESTIMATION IN ULTRAWIDEBAND MIMO NOISE RADAR\n", "id": "11146", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6545", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In radar systems, the wider the bandwidth, the better is the range resolution. While a variety of transmit waveforms can be used, noise and noise-like waveforms are preferred from the standpoint of covertness and immunity to jamming and interference. Moreover, multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) spatial diversity radar significantly improves radar detection and estimation performances. Based to the above advantages, ultrawideband (UWB) MIMO noise radar systems are garnering more and more attention recently. In this dissertation, two issues concerning detection and estimation in UWB MIMO noise radar are investigated in detail.   \nFirst, we consider the problem of estimating target directions in UWB MIMO noise radar. In our system, transmitters are sufficiently separated and transmit UWB independent noise waveforms to satisfy the requirements of MIMO spatial diversity. Receivers are assumed to be spaced half-wavelength apart to eliminate directional ambiguity. We apply the tapped-delay line (TDL) based beamforming technique to concentrate on receiving signals from a certain direction, and to efficiently suppress the interferences from the others. According to the TDL outputs, the CLEAN-sense conditional generalized likelihood ratio test (CGLRT) is applied for detecting the targets given the average of the square of the absolute value of the residual signal resulting from the CLEAN algorithm. Then, we propose a new mechanism called the iterative CGLRT (ICGLRT) to determine their directions by implementing these two techniques iteratively. Simulation results show that ICGLRT is able to sequentially detect the targets and improve target direction estimation accuracy even when their reflections are seriously interfered with by others.\nThen, with some simplifications to the system model, we analyze the mean square error (MSE) of target velocity and location estimation in UWB MIMO noise radar. The ambiguity function (AF) formulation is applied to implement the estimations. Since the maximum of the AF is attained when the time-delay and Doppler stretch of replica signals are exactly matched with the ones corresponding to the reflections, this estimation is also a peak localization problem. When noise is added, the peak may be located in a different place causing error. In this dissertation, we develop probability density functions (pdfs) to approximate the distributions of coherent and non-coherent ambiguity functions (CAFs and NCAFs) and apply the pdfs to analyze MSE of their estimates. Based on the analyses, we explain and demonstrate that the NCAF is the better estimation approach in spatial diversity MIMO radar. Finally, the error floor resulting from NCAF approach is further discussed. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6544], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Wei-Jen ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei-Jen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Ram Mohan Narayanan", "John F Doherty", "Julio Urbina", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ram Mohan Narayanan, Dissertation Advisor", "Ram Mohan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "John F Doherty, Committee Member", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["TDL BEAMFORMING", "MIMO", "ULTRAWIDEBAND", "GENERALIZED LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATION OF OPTICAL STRUCTURES FOR \nENHANCING THE LIGHT EXTRACTION FICIENCY OF WHITE LED\n\n\n", "id": "10039", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6612", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recently, phosphor-conversion has been widely used in producing white light-emitting diodes (LEDs).

Although, conventional granular activated carbon (GAC) has a very limited capacity for removing perchlorate, it was found that ammonia thermal tailoring could enhance its bed life.\nFor carbon tailoring, first, a commercially available bituminous GAC was subjected to thermal treatment with ammonia at temperatures of 500-800\u201eaC. Elemental analysis results showed that nitrogen was incorporated into the carbon matrix during the thermal treatment  The ammonia treatment caused an increase in positive surface charge density, reflected in a higher pHpzc and pHIEP. This was attributed to the more basic nature of the carbon surface after its treatment in ammonia. Ammonia-tailored carbon achieved as much as a 4-fold improvement in bed life for adsorbing perchlorate as determined by rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCT) using groundwater from City of Redlands with perchlorate concentration 70-78 ppb. The RSSCTs simulated full-scale operation with high reproducibility between runs. Increased perchlorate adsorption corresponded to increased positive surface charges. Ammonia-tailored activated carbons also exhibited an increase in TOC removal. \nActivated carbon could also be tailored electrochemically while using ethylene diamine as the reagent. Results indicate that electrochemical treatment effectively incorporated nitrogen-containing groups onto carbon surface without damaging the carbon\u00a1\u00a6s surface area and pore volume. The resultant carbons had two times the adsorption capacity for perchlorate as compared with its non-tailored counterpart.\nAn essential factor in applying activated carbon to water treatment is regeneration after exhaustion. The author also tested chemical regenerations by both calcium thiosulfate and a base/acid method in small-scale for perchlorate-exhausted conventional carbon. RSSCT results indicate that base/acid regeneration was an effective way to restore the adsorption capacity of carbon. Full-scale regeneration with base/acid did not restore as much capacity as has bench-scale RSSCTs. It was believed that short-circuiting and carbon damage by the base solution would have been this distinction. \nAnother frequently used regeneration method is thermal regeneration. Thermal regeneration was focused on ammonia-tailored carbon.  To address this, the author tested whether ammonia-tailored GAC could be regenerated after the tailored GAC had adsorbed perchlorate. Thermal regeneration tests indicated that reactivations by CO2 and NH3 at 600-800\u201eaC for 10-20 minutes restored the perchlorate adsorption capacity of the tailored carbon. In comparison, steam regeneration at temperature >700 appears to be too harsh and reduction in carbon bed life was observed. As indicated by proximate analysis, the steam reaction removed the nitrogen that the ammonia tailoring had affixed, and this destroyed the surface chemistry characteristics that had been created during the ammonia tailoring process. It was these characteristics that are improving perchlorate adsorption.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6608], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Weifang ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Weifang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "Tze Chiang Chung", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon, Committee Chair", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Member", "Tze Chiang Chung, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ammonia", "tailoriong", "granular activated carbon", "regeneration"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A gradient model for studying genotype-\nenvironment interactions\n\n", "id": "11889", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6573", "abstract_tesi": "The genetic architecture of how genes interact with the environemnt to determine\ncomplex phenotypes remains eclusive.

Roots of most plants cooperate with mycorrhizal fungi in nutrient acquisition. The nutrient-rich patches may be actively foraged by symbioses comprising roots and mycorrhizal fungi. Thus, predicting the foraging strategies that enable mycorrhizal root systems to exploit these hotspots can be critical to the understanding of plant nutrition and ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. However, the foraging behaviors of the symbionts are often experimentally uncoupled in previous studies. Compared to the findings in nutrient foraging by roots, the foraging by mycorrhizal hyphae is much less studied. Predictions of nutrient foraging strategies from specific mycorrhizal root traits are often vague. We investigated the nutrient foraging of root and mycorrhizal fungi among common temperate tree species that varied in the thickness of their absorptive roots, including trees associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi. We found when nutrient availability is patchy, thinner root species (e.g., maple, oak) alter their foraging to exploit patches, whereas thicker root species (e.g., tulip poplar, pine) do not. Moreover, there appear to be two distinct pathways by which thinner root tree species enhance foraging in nutrient-rich patches: AM trees (e.g. maple) produce more roots, whereas EM trees (e.g. oak) produce more mycorrhizal fungal hyphae. We also investigated the concurrent foraging for nutrient hotspots by plant species with diverse root traits in a species-rich forest. We found that thin-root species increase substantially in dominance in the soil nutrient patches when competing with thick-root species. Moreover, EM hyphae strongly proliferated in the nutrient hotspots whereas AM hyphae exhibited only modest proliferation. Lastly, we tried to link plant functional traits with mycorrhizal fungal community structure. We found that root diameter only weakly predicted community structure of mycorrhizal fungi, as well as fungal functional traits such as EM exploration types. Community diversity and functions of mycorrhizal fungi may be more regulated by whole-plant traits than by root morphological traits. Collectively, these results indicate that strategies of nutrient foraging are often complementary among tree species with contrasting mycorrhiza types and root morphologies. These findings can pave the way for a more holistic understanding of root-fungal function, which is critical to plant growth, plant competition, community dynamics and biogeochemical cycles in forested ecosystems.

It is considered a possible means to equalize educational opportunity as well as to achieve educational excellence. The expansion of school choices is an ongoing trend, and so is the debate over school choice\u2019s effect on students' academic outcomes. Catholic and magnet schools are two school choices evaluated most often. This study improves previous literature on the Catholic and magnet school effects in the following respects: (1) I use a nationally representative sample that allows for greater generalizability than do local samples; (2) I apply the propensity score matching method to study the school choice effects and their heterogeneity across groups; and (3) I am able to analyze the effect of school choice at the policy levels - state and school districts that are identified with the help of the Geographic Information System (GIS). \n\tUsing data from the Educational Longitudinal Study, 2000 Census, Common Core of Data, Private School Universe Survey, and School District Demographics System, the following conclusions are reached. First, Catholic schools benefit students in math learning. Such effect is especially significant for students who are least likely to attend Catholic schools. This Catholic school effect is not uniformly found among all racial/ethnic groups.  White and Hispanic students benefits from choosing Catholic schools but Blacks do not. Second, within states, Catholic students, especially Whites and Hispanics, gain more than do their public school peers in math achievement. Third, students with low propensity of attending Catholic school gain more within school districts. The within-school district effect is larger and more significant in the districts where public aid for Catholic schooling is available as compared with other districts. Fourth, there is heterogeneity of Catholic school effects by national origin among Hispanics. The effect is especially large for non-Mexican Hispanics, who come from higher SES families than do Mexicans.  The Catholic school effects is also larger among immigrants than natives. Fifth, no significant effect of magnet school on math achievement is obtained. \n\tSeveral policy implications are discussed in the dissertation.  First, within a large school district that serves a large body of minority and low-income students, making Catholic schooling more available for those students is a way to improve student learning.  Second, it is essential to make Catholic schooling more accessible for students who would like to participate in quality schools across school district boundaries.  Third, the information about quality school choices should be distributed to as many families as possible.  Fourth, learning from Catholic school experience can benefit academic achievement for public school students. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6570], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Wen-Chun ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wen-Chun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suet Ling Pong", "Suet Ling Pong", "Gerald K Letendre", "Barrett Alan Lee", "Glenn A Firebaugh", "George Farkas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suet Ling Pong, Dissertation Advisor", "Suet Ling Pong, Committee Chair", "Gerald K Letendre, Committee Member", "Barrett Alan Lee, Committee Member", "Glenn A Firebaugh, Committee Member", "George Farkas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["immigrant education", "school choice effect", "school choice policy", "Catholic school", "magnet school", "race/ethnicity", "math achievement"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "An Investigation into the Perceptions of Nursery School Directors and Teachers Towards Use of An Assessment Instrument in Early Childhood Education/Care Evaluations of Nursery School Quality in Taiwan\n\n\n", "id": "6970", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6543", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines perceptions of directors and teachers regarding nursery school assessment instrument application, and the interrelationships of government, directors, teachers, parents, and children to an open systems model. The study\u00a1\u00e5s survey includes participants, 39 directors and 39 teachers, who have experience in being assessed by the 2002 Kaohsiung City Nursery School Assessment initiative, have at least four-year\u00a1\u00e5s teaching experience. All participants completed a nursery school assessment instrument survey which contained 106 questions related to critical issues of early childhood education. \nA gap exists between the bases of \"formally important,\" which is the governmental evaluation standard for nursery schools and \"informally important\" which is what directors and teachers actually think about their schools' situations regarding a nursery school assessment instrument. More nursery schools utilized packaged instructional materials a main part of curricula, and applied self-designed activities as a minor part of curricula. The teaching of Chinese phonetic signs (97.4% of schools) and writing (88.5% of schools) was widely adopted in the respondents\u00a1\u00e5 schools. Eight-six percent of participants did not agree with prohibiting talent lessons in nursery schools. An open systems model explains that nursery schools\u00a1\u00e5 directors and teachers understand the external demands that influence schools\u00a1\u00e5 operation. These governmental requirements result in personal views which contrast with the formal criteria. \n\tDirectors\u00a1\u00e5 and teachers\u00a1\u00e5 teaching experience significantly and positively affected confidence in professional capability. Curriculum adoption and documentation confidence has a significantly relationship to the school size. The school size also has effects on directors\u00a1\u00e5 and teachers\u00a1\u00e5 confidence with regard to the nursery school assessment instrument, as well as on the outcome of the 2002 Kaohsiung City Nursery School Assessment. The scores of nursery schools assessments could depend greatly on the completion of documentation which is directly related to the school size.\nIn addition to the better known nursery school assessment, the survey is an important predictor of feasible assessment instruments. The data recommends that government officials, professional authorities and practitioners should encourage teaching of Chinese phonetic signs, writing, talent lessons, and packaged instructional materials; emphasis in evaluation should be on process quality instead of passively excluding these activities. Moreover, program evaluation should focus on observation of real situations and process quality than mostly examining documentation.\n\tFurther studies might conduct a longitudinal study on learning of Chinese phonetic signs, writing, and talent lessons between nursery schools and elementary schools to investigate whether they have a longitudinal effect on children\u00a1\u00e5s academic development. Furthermore, additional research should employ efficient training of assessing members and decreasing the relevance gap, if any, among assessing members, directors, and teachers.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6542], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Wen-ling ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wen-ling", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Daniel Yawkey", "Jamie Myers", "Roger C Shouse", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Daniel Yawkey, Committee Chair", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Government Regulations", "Three Systems Models", "Assessment Instruments", "Early Childhood Curriculum", "High-quality Nursery Schools", "Early Childhood Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Moduli Interpretations for Noncongruence Modular Curves", "id": "6w924b80w", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12585", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We define the notion of a ``Teichmuller level structure'' (or simply G-structure) for punctured elliptic curves, which are associated to finite 2-generated groups G.

Nanotechnology has emerged as promising strategy to overcome impasses in several science branches. Liposome, polymer sphere, carbon nanosphere, and metallic particles have been used for nanomedicine development. Doxil, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, is the first FDA approved nanodrug to treat cancers in 1995. Doxorubicin is believed to confer cytotoxicity to cancer cells by 1) intercalation in DNA to disrupt topoisomerase II-mediated DNA repair and 2) generating free radicals to damage cell membrane, DNA, and proteins. Compared to free doxorubicin, Doxil greatly improves the pharmacokinetics of doxorubicin, reduces cardiotoxicity, and increases efficacy by passive targeting. However, Doxil is constantly on FDA\u2019s shortage list. Due to manufacture complexity, even the FDA approved generic \u201cDoxil\u201d is costly to make. Therefore, I want to invent a high efficient and low toxicity nanomedicine that is simple to prepare and easy to scale up. \nIn this dissertation, I present a novel strategy for preparing nanoparticles that are effective for drug resistant cancers. Among a series of \u03b2-carboline derived small molecules, Nano-6E kills cancer cells in micromolar range while is safe for normal human fibroblast (NHF) cells. Nano-6E accumulates more and/or metabolizes slower in cancerous U2OS cells compare to NHF cells. In addition, Nano-6E spontaneously assembles into nanoparticles. Nano-6E induces severe ER stress, disrupts cytoskeleton, and inhibits autophagy in U2OS cells. Interestingly, Nano-6E disturbs cytosolic calcium and affects autophagosome lysosome fusion.  To achieve effective inhibition of multidrug resistant tumors, I combined Nano-6E with many clinical used anticancer drugs. Nano-6E and doxorubicin showed synergistic cytotoxicity to multi-drug resistant uterine sarcoma MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Dox-6E activates p53 and leads to apoptosis in MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Further investigation of Nano-6E and doxorubicin reveals that doxorubicin and Nano-6E forms dual-drug nano-particles range from 3.4 nm to 60.1 nm in diameters. The optimized size range enable Dox-6E particles to demonstrate enhanced permeation and retention effects, leading to 1) extend blood circulation time of doxorubicin; 2) accumulate more in tumor tissue and less in heart and kidney; and 3) significantly inhibit tumor growth in xenograft model of MES-SA/Dx5. \nIn summary, I have designed a novel way to prepare nanoparticles adding another layer to current big molecular based nanotechnology.

Reducing building energy consumption and creating a better indoor thermal environment have becoming a more and more important topic among policy makers, building scientists/engineers, and the masses. To achieve this target, great efforts have been made in several aspects including but not limited to using better thermal insulation materials, integrating renewable power sources, developing intelligent buildings, and creating better and more efficient building climate control systems.\n\nWith the ever increasing computation power, advancements in building modeling and simulation, and accurate weather forecast, model predictive control (MPC) reveals its power as one of the best control methods in building climate control to save energy and maintain high level of indoor comfort. Although many researchers have investigated extensively on how to use building\u2019s active or passive thermal storage along with accurate weather forecast and occupants\u2019 schedule prediction to reduce energy consumption or shift loads, not much research has been done on how a better thermal comfort model used in MPC would help reducing energy usage and improve comfort level. Furthermore, unlike lighting control in which occupants have plenty of opportunities to adjust lights and blinds so that visual comfort can be improved, centralized and automated building thermal control systems take away users\u2019 ability to intervene the control system directly. \n\nIn this dissertation, we study occupant augmented MPC control design in which feedback information from occupants is used to adaptively update the prediction given by a data-driven dynamic thermal sensation model. It is demonstrated both in simulation and chamber experiment that including users directly in the feedback loop of MPC control design provides opportunity to significantly save energy and still maintain thermal comfort. \n\nWe propose a data-driven state-space dynamic thermal sensation (DTS) model based on data collected in a chamber experiment. The developed model takes air temperature as input, and the occupant actual mean thermal sensation vote as an output. To account for cases in which indoor environmental or occupant associated conditions deviate from the nominal condition conducted in the chamber experiment, a time-varying offset parameter in the model is adaptively estimated by an extended Kalman filter using feedback information from occupants.\n\nWe develop two different MPC controls based on the proposed DTS model: a certainty equivalence MPC and a chance constrained MPC. By using this thermal comfort model in the MPC design, users are included directly in the feedback loop. We compare the DTS model based MPC with predicted mean vote (PMV) model based MPC. Simulation results demonstrate that an MPC based on occupant feedback can be expected to produce better energy and thermal comfort outcomes than an MPC based on PMV model. The proposed chance-constrained MPC is designed to allow specifying the probability of violation of thermal comfort constraint, so that a balance between energy saving and thermal comfort can be achieved.\n\nThe DTS model based MPC is evaluated in chamber experiment. A hierarchical control strategy is used. On the high level, MPC calculates optimal supply air temperature of the chamber\u2019s HVAC system. On the low level, the actual supply air temperature of the HVAC system is controlled by the chiller and heater using PI control to achieve the optimal level set by the high level.

For tactical networks, we elaborate our study about operational trust management and attack-resilient reputation management. \nSpecifically, we first present Zigzag, a partial mutual revocation based trust management scheme, which allows rapid impeachment of identified malicious nodes, and then propose GlobalTrust, an attack-resilient reputation system for tactical networks, which aims at optimizing reputation assessment by identifying malicious nodes, and meanwhile, providing the consistency and resiliency.\n\nFor mobile phone networks, we first present DroidLid, an automated functionality-aware privacy leakage analysis for Android applications. Prior approaches to detecting privacy leakage on smartphones primarily focused on the discovery of sensitive information flows but did not justify whether the leaked sensitive information flow is intended or not. In this study, we formulate it as a justification problem, which aims to justify the purpose of every sensitive information transmission in an app. We solve the justification problem by bridging the gap between the sensitive information transmission and application functions.\nMoreover, we propose SweetDroid, a calling-context-sensitive, fine-grained privacy policy enforcement framework for Android OS.\nOur policy enforcement framework is able to distinguish sensitive data requests at different calling contexts and applies different policy rules automatically. The policy enforcement framework takes an important step towards applying the contextual integrity theory for mobile applications.\n\nThe design, implementation, demonstrations, and evaluation of proposed studies are elaborated in the dissertation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11540], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Xin ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu", "Sencun Zhu", "Guohong Cao", "Wang Chien Lee", "Le Bao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Chair", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member", "Le Bao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Trust management", "Tactical networks", "Android security", "Mobile privacy", "Static taint analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "demand response and generation capacity investment in the electricity market", "id": "19632", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9075", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Demand Response (DR) plays an important role in electricity markets by reducing peak load, deferring costly infrastructure upgrades and enhancing system reliability. Most DR programs rely on a historically determined customer baseline load (CBL). Such CBLs may be vulnerable to undetermined consumer manipulation.\n\nOn the supply side, many U.S. states have restructured their electricity systems and created open markets in electricity generation. Concerns have been raised about whether restructured markets will create sufficient incentives for investment. In response, several Regional Transmission Organizations have created markets for capacity to induce investment. At the same time, many states have imposed renewable portfolio standards, proponents of which assert that the investment of renewables has a benefit of reducing the investment of thermal capacity.  Yet the effects of restructuring, capacity markets, and renewable energy on thermal generation capacity have not been empirically tested.\n\nThe first chapter examines a DR data set from the energy market in southeastern Pennsylvania in PJM between 2010 and 2011. Results shows that the CBL can be systematically higher than DR participants\u2019 estimated load, indicating the existence of the implementation of DR manipulation strategies.\n\nThe second chapter also simulates over-consumption and idiosyncratic-demand bidding manipulations in the DR process. The simulation result indicates that FERC Order 745 increases over-consumption incentive by 10 times and increases the manipulation profit 10 to 100 times compared with the LMP minus retail rate (RR) payment. In light of the incentives for manipulation, the order may need to be reconsidered.\n\nIn the third chapter, we employ the state level capacity investment data in the U.S. between 1990 and 2010 to analyze the state-level investment behaviors. Our results imply that restructured states do not have significantly different per-capita capacity investment levels compared with regulated states. Results fail to support the hypothesis that capacity markets increase electricity generation investment. Indeed, results from six regressions show that less investment is expected in states with higher capacity payments. Our results also do not support the argument that wind and solar renewables reduce thermal capacity investment.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8903], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Xu ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Nathan Kleit", "Seth Adam Blumsack", "Zhen Lei", "George Young"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Nathan Kleit, Dissertation Advisor", "Seth Adam Blumsack, Committee Member", "Zhen Lei, Committee Member", "George Young, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Demand response", "Customer baseline load (CBL)", "Market manipulation", "Electricity markets", "electricity restructuring"]}]
