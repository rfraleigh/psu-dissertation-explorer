This reactor is uniquely useful to gain insight into the ALD process because of the combination of its precise, controllable, and quantified dosing/microdosing capability; its in-situ quadrupole mass spectrometer for gas composition analysis; its pair of highly-sensitive in-situ quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs); and its complete spectrum of pressures and operating conditions --- from viscous to molecular flow regimes. Control of the dose is achieved independently of the conditions by allowing a reactant gas to fill a fixed volume and measured pressure, which is held at a controlled temperature, and subsequently dosed into the system by computer controlled pneumatic valves. Absolute reactant exposure to the substrate and QCMs is unambiguously calculated from the molecular impingement flux, and its relationship to dose size is established, allowing means for easily intentionally reproducing specific exposures. Methods for understanding atomic layer growth and adsorption phenomena, including the precursor sticking probability, dynamics of molecular impingement, size of dose, and other operating variables are for the first time quantitatively related to surface reaction rates by mass balance. Extensive characterization of the QCM as a measurement tool for adsorption under realistic ALD conditions has been examined, emphasizing the state-of-the-art and importance of QCM system features required. Finally, the importance of dose-quantification and microdosing has been contextualized in view of the ALD literature, underscoring the significance of more precise condition specification in establishing a better basis for reactor and reactant comparison.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7725], "author_name_tesi": "Larrabee, Thomas James", "last_name_ssi": "Larrabee", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Lawrence Allara", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Miriam Arak Freedman", "Roman Engel Herbert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Lawrence Allara, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Dissertation Advisor", "Miriam Arak Freedman, Committee Member", "Roman Engel Herbert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["atomic layer deposition", "quartz crystal microbalance", "quadrupole mass spectrometer", "in-situ diagnostics", "adsorption", "reactivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "SPECTROSCOPIC CHARACTERIZATION OF THIN FILM SEMICONDUCTING MATERIALS ", "id": "29531", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12568", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The detailed characterization of thin films for use in semiconducting photovoltaic devices is critical in assisting the development of novel materials and processing conditions.

The overall objectives of this work were to overcome this limitation by:  (1) increasing protein product titers in cell suspensions and hairy root cultures by harnessing A. tumefaciens to efficiently deliver replicating RNA viral vectors, and (2) identifying the physical and physiological factors important for reproducible, high-level transient expression in cell suspensions.\n\nReplicating vectors derived from Potato virus X (PVX) and Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) were modified to contain the reporter gene beta-glucuronidase (GUS) with a plant intron to prevent bacterial expression. In cell suspensions, a minimal PVX construct retaining only the viral RNA polymerase gene yielded 6.6-fold more GUS than an analogous full-genome PVX vector. Co-delivery of the minimal PVX vector with p19 of Tomato bushy stunt virus and HC-Pro of Tobacco etch virus increased transient GUS expression by 40-80%. In hairy roots, a vector derived from TRV that was capable of systemic movement increased GUS accumulation by 150-fold relative to the analogous PVX vector.\n\nA modified TRV-based vector and a transgenic host with integrated suppression of post-transcriptional gene silencing were investigated as strategies to further increase transient expression in hairy roots. A TRV vector was modified to retain the viral helper protein 2b, which is required for nematode transmission. In N. benthamiana hairy roots, the modified TRV vector resulted in GUS expression levels comparable to the control vector without the 2b gene. In contrast, Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi hairy roots transgenic for HC-Pro yielded 5-fold more GUS from the modified TRV vector than control roots.\n\nPrior to the development of the TRV vectors, a study was conducted to determine if movement-deficient PVX vectors could be complemented in trans by the Tobacco mosaic virus 30K movement protein (MP). Unexpectedly, transient co-delivery of TMV MP with the minimal PVX vector resulted in reduced transient GUS expression in cell suspensions and hairy roots of N. benthamiana.\n\nImproved productivity in plant cell suspensions was achieved by manipulating the host, co-culture environment, and non-replicating expression vectors to produce conditions more favorable for Agrobacterium-mediated transient GUS expression. Modification of the N. glutinosa cell suspension host by transformation with Agrobacterium rhizogenes did not have a significant effect on average transient GUS expression across multiple independent cell lines. In N. benthamiana, doubling the concentration of potassium phosphate resulted in a 5-fold increase in transient GUS expression. Removal of the plant selectable marker cassette from a non-replicating vector with a constitutive promoter decreased the T-DNA size by one-third and increased transient GUS expression by almost 50%.\n\nThis work established the feasibility of utilizing Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of replicating RNA viral vectors for amplified heterologous protein expression in plant tissue cultures. A TRV vector capable of systemic movement represents the first and only vector to achieve transient GUS expression levels in hairy roots comparable to those observed in plant cell suspensions. Considering the inconsistent absolute transient expression levels intrinsic to plant cell suspensions, hairy root cultures may be a preferable host for reproducible transient protein expression. The advantages and limitations of this approach are discussed in the context of engineering a safe, cost-effective, and scalable protein production platform.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3266], "author_name_tesi": "Larsen, Jeffrey ", "last_name_ssi": "Larsen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis", "Wayne Roger Curtis", "Charles Peter Romaine", "Esther Winter Gomez", "Andrew Zydney", "Timothy W Mcnellis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis, Dissertation Advisor", "Wayne Roger Curtis, Committee Chair", "Charles Peter Romaine, Committee Member", "Esther Winter Gomez, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plant tissue culture", "transient expression", "agrobacterium tumefaciens", "viral vectors", "hairy roots", "cell suspensions"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Formulation and Characterization of Paraffin-based Solid Fuels Containing Novel Additives for Use in Hybrid Rocket Motors", "id": "15176", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7650", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In an attempt to improve the mass burning rates of solid fuels for hybrid rocket motors, this investigation examines the impact of including various additives to paraffin wax. Several paraffin-based formulations, with additives including lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), diisobutylaluminum hydride (DAH), triethylaluminum (TEA), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT), and RDX, were cast and tested. Most solid-fuel formulations were cast into paper phenolic motor casings to be tested in the Long-Grain Center-Perforated (LGCP) hybrid rocket motor located at the Pennsylvania State University\u2019s High Pressure Combustion Lab. Casting of fuel grains containing TEA, DAH, and LiAlH4 was performed at the Aerospace Corporation. After testing a first batch of solid-fuel grains containing LiAlH4 in the LGCP hybrid rocket motor, it was determined that the particles of LiAlH4, coupled with a wax that had too low a melting point, were causing unstable, non-uniform burning. New fuel grains with ball-milled LiAlH4 \u00acparticles and a higher melting point wax demonstrated much more uniform burning. It was found that with 10% LiAlH4 in paraffin, the solid-fuel grains showed improved linear regression rates (7-10%) over baseline paraffin. The grains also demonstrated increased mass burn rates. Fuel samples containing MWNT were sent to the University of Texas \u2013 Austin\u2019s Center for Nano and Molecular Science and Technology for DSC, SEM, and TGA testing. SEM results showed good dispersion of MWNT in the paraffin; however, there was local clumping of MWNT. Testing of a paraffin/MWNT fuel grain in the LGCP hybrid rocket motor showed that the paraffin/MWNT fuel grain had slightly lower regression that baseline paraffin. However, fuel grains containing MWNT have the potential for improved mechanical properties over pure paraffin. Finally, several methods of dispersing RDX in paraffin wax were attempted, but in each case, the RDX particles came out too large. The particles sank in the melted paraffin, creating a heterogeneous mixture not suitable for casting into a casting to be used in a hybrid rocket motor.

Further, few studies have tried to study or to determine what factors might impact such willingness. The absence of studies that focus on understanding PFLs and community concerns as well as PFLs willingness to participate in harvesting biofuels for energy is in part traceable to two basic, but untested, assumptions regarding communities and forest landowners: (1) PFLs are able and willing to participate in the production of raw materials with few obstacles; and (2) they will make the transition because of the opportunity to increase profits. While the technical/economic aspects are clearly important, little attention has been paid to those social and cultural factors that may impact the viability of such activity.

The subsequent pH drop solubilizes various metals, namely iron, trace metals, and sulfate. The oxidation of Fe(II) at low-pH is catalyzed by acidophilic organisms creating terraced iron formations (TIFs) which can remove Fe from solution. TIFs serve as an attractive remediation technique for acid mine drainage (AMD), however as sediment depth increases, Fe(III) reduction in anoxic subsurface areas may compromise treatment effectiveness. To address this problem, the rates of Fe(II) oxidation were measured multiple times at seven sites in the Appalachian Bituminous Coal Basin and three sites in the Iberian Pyrite Belt (IPB). Mean first-order Fe(II) oxidation rate constants ranged from 0.035 \u2013 0.465 min-1 at the Appalachian sites and 0.003 \u2013 0.010 min-1 at the IPB sites. Laboratory rates of Fe(II) oxidation were measured with TIF sediments and emergent AMD collected from the seven Appalachian sites. First-order laboratory rates normalized to sediment biomass concentrations (measured by phospholipid fatty acids) were positively correlated to first-order field rates. A zero-order lab-based removal rate for dissolved Fe(T) was used to calculate performance criteria of 2.6 \u2013 8.7 g Fe day-1 m-2 (GDM) for both natural and engineered TIFs. \nThe available free energy of the emergent AMD source predicted relative rates and extents of changes in geochemistry downstream. The extent of \u0394pH across a TIF correlated to the thermodynamic favorability of Fe(II) oxidation coupled to production of soluble Fe(III)(aq) versus solid schwertmannite calculated from geochemical conditions at the emergent AMD sources. Faster rates of Fe(II) oxidation were measured at two sites (one in Appalachia and one in IPB) where Fe(II) oxidation was favored over oxidative precipitation. Chemostatic laboratory Fe(II) oxidation experiments paralleled field observations, strengthening the validity of the model\u2019s assumptions. \nTo investigate subsurface pore-water geophysics and geochemistry, near-surface electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) was used with in-situ pore-water samplers to spatially resolve bulk conductivity changes within a TIF formed in a stream emanating from a large abandoned deep clay mine in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, USA. Because of the high fluid electrical conductivity of the emergent AMD (1860 \u03bcS/cm), fresh water (42 \u03bcS/cm) was added as a dilution tracer to visualize the spatial and temporal extent of hyporheic exchange and to characterize subsurface flow paths. Pore-water concentrations and speciation of iron, pH, and redox potential differed between subsurface flow regimes. The greatest extent of hyporheic exchange was beneath the center of the stream, where a shallower (< 10 cm) Fe(II)-oxidizing zone was observed. Meanwhile, less hyporheic exchange was observed near the channel banks, concurrent with a more pronounced, deeper (> 70 cm) Fe(II)-oxidizing zone. At these locations, relatively slower groundwater exchange may promote biotic Fe(II) oxidation and improve the long-term stability of Fe sequestered in TIFs.\nUnder low-pH conditions, the formation of schwertmannite (Fe8O8(OH)4.50(SO4)1.75) has been observed meta-stable with respect to goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH), and the transformation is highly dependent on pH and solution composition.  Pore-water, mineralogical, and sediment composition profiles were measured with depth beneath an AMD-impacted stream in western Pennsylvania. Distinctly different vertical pore-water profiles were measured beneath the stream banks as compared to the stream center. Similar minerals were observed at both the stream bank and stream center regardless of stark differences in subsurface geochemical conditions and hydrodynamic conditions. Surface and near-surface sediments (0 \u2013 5 cm depth) were approximately >80% schwertmannite and <20% goethite in both the stream bank and stream center. In contrast, subsurface sediments (20 \u2013 70 cm depth) were approximately 25% schwertmannite and 75% goethite in both locations. Trace metal sediment concentrations (Al, Ba, Cu, Mn, Ni, Si, Zn) increased up to 3x from the surface to subsurface sediments, demonstrating that goethite was more effective at sequestering trace metals relative to schwertmannite. The results display Fe(III) mineralogical transformations were similar regardless of localized hydrobiogeochemical conditions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9131], "author_name_tesi": "Larson, Lance N", "last_name_ssi": "Larson", "middle_name_ssi": "N", "first_name_ssi": "Lance", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William D Burgos", "Jennifer Macalady", "Dr Chris Gorski", "Dr Michael Gooseff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William D Burgos, Dissertation Advisor", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member", "Dr Chris Gorski, Committee Member", "Dr Michael Gooseff, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Iron Mineralogy", "Low pH Fe Oxidation", "Passive Treatment", "Acid Mine Drainage", "Hyporheic Exchange"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Long-term Treated Wastewater Irrigation Effects on Hydraulic Conductivity and Soil Quality at Penn State's Living Filter\n", "id": "10807", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6958", "abstract_tesi": "Increased awareness of the impacts of eutrophication on streams and estuaries from the disposal of treated waste water (TWW) has resulted in finding alternate means for effluent disposal that will improve water quality.  Concerns about water quality have become particularly important within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed, with states committing to reduce the discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus from point and non-point sources within the bay.  As a means of renovation TWW irrigation has been utilized worldwide to address those concerns with the added benefit of meeting crop water demands and acting as a source of groundwater recharge.   \n\nPenn State\u2019s Office of Physical Plant has been using The Living Filter to irrigate crop and forest land with TWW for over 40 years and it has served as a research site for the soil\u2019s ability to remove nutrients.  However, physical changes that occur due to the irrigation of over 250 cm of TWW per year in addition to 100 cm of rainfall has not been as well researched.  Most research concerning soil physical properties under TWW irrigation has been performed on soils of arid lands, with a focus on issues resulting from high sodium concentrations in TWW or naturally occurring in the soil.  Far less research has been performed in temperate regions and under their vastly different soils.\n\nLand use managers at The Living Filter reported that there appeared to be an increase in runoff of irrigation from the site than when it was first developed.  It was hypothesized that soil water infiltration rates declined due to the long term application of TWW.  Therefore, in 2008 8 sampling blocks were laid out radiating from sprinklers, encompassing irrigated and non-irrigated areas of the Living Filter.  Infiltration rates of both areas were compared using a tension infiltrometer at the soil surface and the top of the Bt1 horizon.  In addition, surface soil bulk density and surface horizon clay and organic matter contents were evaluated with respect to distance from the sprinklers.  Finally, soil cores were taken in 2009 and comparison of irrigated and non-irrigated areas were made between soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), total organic carbon (TOC) and clay content for each identified soil horizon.  All experiments were arranged in a complete block or split-plot design.\n\nResults suggest that irrigated areas have greater surface horizon hydraulic conductivities than comparable non-irrigated areas.  Analysis of Bt horizon hydraulic conductivity rates revealed that there was no difference between irrigated and non-irrigated areas.  Analysis of bulk density suggests that distance from the sprinkler head has an effect on 0-10 cm bulk density, with areas within the sprinkler irrigated radius having lower bulk densities.  Increases in soil structure resulting form increased soil microbial production, increased plant rooting and a greater number of freezing-thawing cycles many be causes for the differences between treatments for Ap horizon hydraulic conductivity and bulk density.  Additionally, distance from the sprinkler head had an effect on clay content, with reduced clay contents within the irrigated area.  Although this suggests that irrigation is translocating clay to lower horizons, further analysis needs to be performed before any conclusion can be made.\n\nAnalysis of soil cores revealed that soil pH was approximately 1.0 unit greater in the irrigated area than the non-irrigated area for all identified horizons, with irrigated-area pH values reflecting that of the irrigation water.  Soil EC was also greater in the irrigated area, with the greatest differences between areas occurring in the Bt2 through Bt4 horizons. Soil SAR was greater in the irrigated area when compared to the non-irrigated area, with SAR increasing with depth throughout the profile.  This suggests a removal of sodium from the Ap horizon and the consequent movement and deposition of sodium deeper in the soil profile.  The increased SAR values combined with relatively low EC values may result in reductions in hydraulic conductivity in the Bt2 through Bt4 horizons and monitoring should be performed to determine if the higher sodium concentrations are negatively impacting the soil. \n\nInitial findings suggest that TWW irrigation does not have a negative effect on soil hydraulic conductivity.  Also, soil quality appears to have improved with TWW irrigation, resulting in a greater potential for increased water renovation and crop yields.  When considering the lack of negative effects of TWW irrigation, one can see that the Living Filter should continue to serve as a viable way of eliminating nutrient discharge into local waterways and demonstrates that TWW irrigation can be an effective alternative for the tertiary treatment of wastewater.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6955], "author_name_tesi": "Larson, Zachary Marcus", "last_name_ssi": "Larson", "middle_name_ssi": "Marcus", "first_name_ssi": "Zachary", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Earl Watson", "John Earl Watson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Earl Watson, Thesis Advisor", "John Earl Watson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Living Filter", "Treated wastewater irrigation", "Effluent irrigation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "OPTIMIZING NUTRIENT UTILIZATION OF A PRECISION FEEDING SYSTEM FOR DAIRY HEIFERS USING LOW AND HIGH FORAGE DIETS", "id": "12268", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2054", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Four experiments were conducted to optimize the nutrient composition of diets used for a precision feeding system for dairy heifers. The main focus of this work is to understand the relationships between forage to concentrate ratios and dietary components when nutrients are provided precisely to meet the requirements of growing dairy heifers. \nIn summary, these results indicate that precision feeding HC diets can be utilized with dairy heifers to achieve similar growth rates as LC and achieve an increased DM, OM, and NDF digestibility which at the same time results in a decrease in excretion parameters. Inclusion of dietary fiber to HC diets that have a F:C higher that 20:80 seems to be beneficial in moderate levels to increase nutrient utilization and microbial protein flow to the duodenum while detrimental for heifers receiving an already higher fiber ration in when F:C ratios are high. Responses to nitrogen degradability in precision feeding systems for dairy heifers are dependent in the F:C ratio and it can be affected by the level of fiber in the ration mainly through differential retention time, fractional passages rates and microbial protein synthesis and lysis in the rumen. The use of a precision feeding system under tropical environments using a different fiber source as sugarcane was feasible and using a slow rumen degradable non protein nitrogen source, a potentially more economical source of N allowed for adequate nutrient utilization under these conditions. The costs of the various diets will dictate usage of either protein source. Finally, negative effects of feeding rapidly fermented non structural carbohydrates have been observed in dairy cows, heifers and calves when higher concentrate diets are fed. These two different sources of rapidly fermented carbohydrates precision-fed to dairy heifers resulted in no differences in nutrient total tract apparent digestibility even when rumen fermentation profiles were different. These results suggest the feasibility of using CPP to replace corn in the diet used for dairy heifers. Precision fed heifers were challenged to two sources of rapidly fermented carbohydrates to identify an optimal dose of YC and improve understanding of the mode of action and efficacy of this direct fed microbe on dairy heifer nutrition. Yeast culture had a greater impact in OM, NDF, ADF and hemicellulose digestibility when supplemented at a daily dose of 30g/d regardless of the rapidly fermented carbohydrate source, but the effects on ruminal fermentation patterns, pH, and microbial population are diet dependent, showing an improved fermentation profile in low starch diets at 30g/d and 10g/d for high starch diets.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2036], "author_name_tesi": "Lascano, Gustavo J.", "last_name_ssi": "Lascano", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Gustavo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Jud Heinrichs", "Kevin John Harvatine", "Alexander Nikolov Hristov", "Robert John Vansaun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Dissertation Advisor", "Jud Heinrichs, Committee Chair", "Kevin John Harvatine, Committee Member", "Alexander Nikolov Hristov, Committee Member", "Robert John Vansaun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heifers", "forage to concentrate ration", "fiber", "protein degradability", "yeast", "saccharomyces cerevisiae", "slow release urea", "starch", "soluble fiber", "bacteria", "microbial protein synthesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION OF DIATOM PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION IN LAKE ERIE BENTHOS: IMPLICATIONS FOR SEASONAL HYPOXIA\n\n", "id": "9558", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "355", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rapid sedimentation of phytoplankton cells following surface blooms is common in the Great Lakes, yet the fate of these cells is uncertain, particularly in Lake Erie, where hypoxia occurs seasonally.  I sampled benthic stations seasonally inside and outside of the hypoxic area for differences in chlorophyll-a concentrations, physiological condition (cell viability), and rejuvenation rates (from enclosure experiments).  During summer stratification I expected the oxygen rich areas to support lower chlorophyll-a concentrations, faster diatom rejuvenation rates, and superior physiological capabilities, compared to hypoxic environments.  Hypoxic areas did sustain higher chlorophyll-a concentrations, but diatom growth and physiological capability did not differ significantly.  Hypoxic areas exhibited exponential growth rates as high as 0.56 d-1 (compared to oxic station at 0.53 d-1) and physiological conditions as high as 0.30 \u00b5g L-1 d-1 (compared to oxic station at 0.36 \u00b5g L-1 d-1).

However, there are a variety of health concerns associated with mining. Exposure to respirable silica dust is one of the sources of health risks in surface mines. A variety of respiratory diseases and other ailments, including silicosis and other non-malignant respiratory diseases, may be caused by exposure to respirable silica dust. \nThe Mine Act of 1977 requires the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) to inspect mines every year. While one goal of these inspections is to ensure compliance with occupational health and safety regulations, Congress\u2019s overall intent was to improve the safety and health of America\u2019s mine workers. MSHA conducts a vigorous respirable dust sampling program to ensure compliance with its regulations as part of its deterrence and compliance mandate. MSHA inspections are resource intensive and consume a significant percentage of the agency\u2019s annual appropriation. The question of whether MSHA\u2019s compliance-sampling program is accomplishing the intended outcome is one of continued interest to the Government Accountability Office, taxpayers, organized labor, industry, and mine workers. \nThe goal of this research is to determine the efficacy of the MSHA compliance-sampling program for respirable silica dust in surface metal and nonmetal mining operations. It is difficult to evaluate the efficacy of the program in reducing silicosis among mine workers because of the incomplete knowledge of health outcomes among miners and many confounding variables. The consequences of excess silica exposure can take years to develop. It is often impossible to accurately determine where and when exposures occurred, and whether exposures are fully attributable to occupational sources. Therefore, other surrogate metrics are required to assess the extent to which MSHA\u2019s sampling program and enforcement activity is contributing to the intended outcome. Two surrogate measures, including deterrence effect and exposure reduction, can be used to inform this assessment.\nThe objectives of this research include: (i) to determine the deterrence effect associated with the sampling program, (ii) to determine the extent to which mine worker exposure has changed, and (iii) to examine the MSHA compliance-sampling database for opportunities for improving the health of mine workers through the use of this database. \nThese objectives will be achieved through analysis of the compliance-sampling database for the following specific aims: (i) to quantify the change in compliance over the period of the program, (ii) to determine the relationship, if any, between the number of samples taken in any inspection year (annual sampling load) and noncompliance frequency, (iii) to quantify the change in worker exposure over the period of the program, (iv) to explore evidence that the current sampling strategy could be changed to better identify overexposed occupations, and (v) to find evidence of gaps in knowledge, practices, or technologies that could reduce overexposure.\nThe MSHA Compliance-sampling database for surface metal and nonmetal mining operations during the 19-year period from 1997 to 2015 was used in this study. Characteristics and limitations of the MSHA compliance-sampling database were considered in selecting the methods to analyze the database. Descriptive statistics of the database were used to determine if deterrence and exposure reduction effects exist. This method was also employed to determine relationships between annual sampling load and noncompliance frequency. As a part of the fourth specific aim, the database was examined for signs of unusual overexposures. Commodities and occupations with the highest and lowest noncompliance record were identified through Classification and Regression Tree analysis. \nA field study was planned to assess the potential value of the database to improve the health of mine workers by testing to determine whether the knowledge gained from the MSHA database analysis could be useful to identify gap areas knowledge, practices, or control technologies that could reduce overexposure. Personal and area samples were collected from several dimension stone cutting shops during the field trip, using Helmet-CAM tool, gravimetric samplers, and passive dust monitors. \nThis research has determined that the MSHA compliance-sampling program fails to meet in many cases its intended purpose of improving health of mineworkers by insuring compliance and reducing exposure. In recent years, the noncompliance frequency percent (percentage of overall samples that are noncompliant) and average exposure level fluctuate from year to year with no strong downward trend. Therefore, deterrence and exposure reduction effects do not exist throughout the years. Deterrence and reduction in exposure exist only for some occupations and commodities, during short periods of time. Many other occupations showed a fairly constant level of noncompliance and exposure over the past years. There are also a few occupations and commodities that exhibited upward trends for noncompliance and exposure levels. \nFor many occupations, the annual sampling load did not correlate to the annual noncompliance frequency. There are low-risk occupations (occupations that demonstrate relatively lower rate of overexposure) that are very frequently sampled by MSHA inspectors. The increase in the annual sampling load for low-risk occupations did not result in capturing more noncompliant samples. In addition, there are high-risk occupations that are less frequently inspected. The increase of sampling load in the case of high-risk occupations resulted in capturing more noncompliant samples. This indicates a lack of efficient sampling resource allocation, and also indicates that opportunities exist to improve MSHA sampling resource allocation based on knowledge generated using the database. \nThe results of this study indicated that occupations such as stone cutter/polisher, bagging operator, and cleanup man are among high-risk occupations. On the other hand, there are occupations with very low probability of over-exposure that are very frequently sampled. Front-end loader operator, truck driver and backhoe operator are among those low-risk occupations. This study shows that data-driven methods could be useful tools to suggest improved sampling strategies that more effectively target high-risk occupations and commodities. \nThis field study showed that the MSHA database could be used to determine occupations and commodities that are more often overexposed. Then, detailed exposure assessment methods can be used to determine areas and tasks that contribute to elevated exposure rates. Finally, the offending areas/tasks can be investigated to determine potential gaps \u2013 including a gap in proper practice of existing control technologies, lack of effective control technology, or a gap in knowledge regarding sources of elevated exposure. It can also help in determining modifications that could be made to improve the health of mine workers through reducing their exposure level. \nThe results of this study can help make certain inferences about the utility of the MSHA database for the purposes of: improving MSHA\u2019s sampling resource allocation; identifying gap areas (including gaps in knowledge, technology, or proper practice of existing interventions); and developing interventions that effectively target the true sources of exposure.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14958], "author_name_tesi": "Lashgari, Ali ", "last_name_ssi": "Lashgari", "first_name_ssi": "Ali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffery Kohler", "Jeffery Kohler", "Jeremy M.

In an attempt to commercialize and implement the new battery technologies, machine manufacturers must determine the capacity, durability, and performance of these batteries over critical and tough conditions in underground mining operations. Study of the duty cycle of underground haulage units is the basis by which verification of the need and demands for power for such units can be determined for the purpose of sizing suitable batteries. This thesis discusses the measurement of duty cycles of coal mine shuttle cars in two underground coal mines in central Pennsylvania along with the discussion and analysis of the measured duty cycles. Observations and measurements were made to quantify/differentiate the performance of the shuttle cars under different road conditions and mine operating requirements. The measurement of the duty cycles for various shuttle cars was mostly performed by recording the available machine information through the vehicle on-board communication ports such as CAN bus interfaces.  Each work cycle includes real time power consumption during different work segments (e.g., loading, loaded tramming, dumping, and empty tramming), mean power for the entire duty cycle, order and duration of peak powers, and required energy for the entire cycle and different work segments. Moreover, cycle timing and intermittent delays occurring during each work segment are included in the duty-cycle study. The required energy by work cycle is summed over the course of each work shift and then correlated with utilization.\nAnalysis of the data has allowed for evaluation of these parameters and quantification of the arithmetic average, root mean square, and dispersions of related parameters such as cycle time, delay times, average power and energy consumptions, peak power and energy consumptions, and finally the proportion of power consumption in each segment of the duty cycle as well various functions. Statistical analysis is used to develop formulas for estimation of operating parameters of such haulage units based on the distance, weight of the haulage units, and road conditions.  The statistical models include average and peak power and energy consumptions.  Also a separate analysis was performed to estimate the amount of machine utilization and delay times for each component of the work cycle. The observations and developed models allow for estimation of the required battery power and storage capacity for underground haulage units and expansion of the results to similar operational conditions with different panel geometries.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10095], "author_name_tesi": "Lashkari, Hamed ", "last_name_ssi": "Lashkari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hamed", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamal Rostami", "Dr Larry Grayson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamal Rostami, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Larry Grayson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["duty cycle", "shuttle car", "room and pillar", "battery", "energy", "power", "haulage cycle"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Essays on Price and Quality in International Trade", "id": "22701", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10430", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Each of the three chapters in this dissertation is based on an empirical research paper. The collective goals of these, rather independent, papers is to present an alternative and unifying theory of international specialization. A theory suitable for analyzing international trade at various levels and between a broad set of countries.\n\nThe first chapter develops a new theory of international specialization that tractably com- bines all aspects of North-North and North-South trade into one model. The new theory also provides an alternative explanation for many other well-established facts, most notably the \u201cWashington apples\u201d effect. The theory builds upon, and retains the central elements of Krug- man [1980]. In the new framework, North-North trade is governed by national product dif- ferentiation. North-South trade is governed by a new channel of across product specialization that has been overlooked in the literature. Specifically, there are many products and each prod- uct comes in different varieties. Products differ in how (horizontally) differentiated they are. Monopolistically competitive firms charge a higher markup for varieties of highly differenti- ated products. In equilibrium, rich countries specialize in highly differentiated\u2013high markup products, while poor countries specialize in less differentiated\u2013low markup products. To quan- tify the gains from trade, I estimate the structural parameters of the model using disaggregated data. Incorporating the new channel of across-product specialization into the Krugman model magnifies the gains from opening to trade by around 200%. Despite trading less, low-income countries experience the largest gains from trade liberalization.\n\nThe second chapters provides the first empirical confirmation of the iceberg trade cost as- sumption. The assumption is embodied in all major models of International trade. However, empirical evidence to support this rather conventional assumption is lacking. This paper pro- vides such evidence by developing a simple model of international transportation. The model links shipping cost to the f.o.b. price of the shipment, and demonstrates that shipping cost per count is more iceberg-like than shipping cost per kilogram \u2013 existing studies have generally\n\nlooked at shipping cost per kilogram for goods that are measured primarily in counts (e.g. TVs, cars). To address this finding, I first calculate price and shipping cost on a per-count basis for goods that report count as the primary unit of measurement in US import data. Then, I estimate the dependence of shipping costs on f.o.b. price. Estimation results strongly support the iceberg specification. Specifically, for every 1% increase in f.o.b. price (per count), the ship- ping cost (per count) increases by 0.91%. The paper then estimates the \u201cWashington apples\u201d effect: the dependance of export f.o.b prices on shipping costs. The effect is estimated to be stronger in industries where shipping costs are more iceberg-like. This suggests that, contrary to common belief, per-unit trade costs cannot be the only driving force behind the \u201cWashing- ton apples\u201d effect. The paper then proceeds to find strong empirical support for an alternative force.\nThe third chapter provides a simple framework to analyze the three main components of international trade flows: (i) the number of goods traded, (ii) the quantity of each good that is shipped, and (iii) the prices they are sold for. While gravity equations are massively suc- cessful in explaining the overall value of trade, they do not provide much insight about the decomposition of trade. In this paper I develop a novel framework that provides, consistent with data, predictions about not only the value of trade but the composition of trade values. I relax the conventional assumption that consumers are identical, and allow for demand hetero- geneity across consumers. I also allow for quality heterogeneity across varieties. The model explains the effect of distance and per capita income on trade along the intensive margin, the extensive margin and the price margin\u2014all of which are well-documented in the empirical literature. It also provides a novel theoretical foundation for the higher price of tradables in developed countries. To further asses the model, I evaluate two predictions, of the model, re- garding the price of traded goods and one prediction regarding the extensive margin of trade. The exercise confirms that all three predictions are borne out in the data. The model provides a framework to investigate the (across-consumer) distributional effects of trade liberalization. I show that, despite the aggregate gains, the poorest consumers experience losses in face of trade liberalization.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10090], "author_name_tesi": "Lashkaripour, Ahmad ", "last_name_ssi": "Lashkaripour", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ahmad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan W Eaton", "Stephen Ross Yeaple", "James R.

I look at firms in the emerging but core-stigmatized medical cannabis industry, and examine how those firms use substantive and symbolic actions in an attempt to influence audience perceptions. For entrepreneurial firms that contend with the liabilities of newness (Stinchcombe, 1965) and smallness (Aldrich & Auster, 1986), core stigma creates an additional burden that further threatens their survival. Core stigma is the \u201cnegative social evaluation by some audience(s) of an organization because of certain organizational attributes, such as core routines, core outputs, and/or core customers\u201d (Hudson, 2008: 252). As such, core-stigmatized organizations find it either difficult or impossible to sufficiently transform themselves to gain mainstream approval (Hudson & Okhuysen, 2009), since the stigma challenges central attributes such as their identity and projected image (Hudson, 2008). \n\nOnly a few studies have considered the actions of firms operating in core-stigmatized industries (e.g., Hudson & Okhuysen, 2009; Vergne, 2012), and even fewer have considered the strategic actions that are necessary to reduce core stigma (e.g. Helms & Patterson, 2014). Hudson and Okhuysen\u2019s (2009) study of bathhouses showed that their survival efforts centered on safeguarding stakeholders from stigma transfer, while Vergne (2012) found that organizations managed core stigma by straddling both stigmatized and non-stigmatized categories, thereby diverting attention from their contested activities. These studies conceptualized core stigma as an organizational reality to be managed instead of removed. Conversely, Helms and Patterson (2014) counter-intuitively argued that some organizations benefit from stigma. They demonstrated that mixed martial arts organizations co-opted stigmatizing labels to draw public attention and support, then engaged in \u201cconstructing practices\u201d to change the specific factors that lead to their negative evaluations. \n\nCollectively, these studies inform our understanding of core stigma, but also make salient that much remains unknown about organizational stigma, particularly for entrepreneurial firms. This dissertation contributes to this lacuna. I explore the strategic actions of entrepreneurs who are building enterprises around a plant that not only has a negative public perceptions built over decades, but that is also federally illegal. In the first essay I use a qualitative methodology to examine how entrepreneurial firms attempt to destigmatize. I show that they do so through morality infusion, where they use narratives and substantive actions to connect themselves and their industry to an alternative set of values, and to create an identity and image that resonates with important audiences. In the second essay, I combine content analysis with fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to analyze how firms configure their narratives to account for the resources that they have at their disposal, and the ultimate effectiveness of those configurations. This study is situated in the context of nascent firms that are applying for licenses to operate medical cannabis dispensaries in newly legal Massachusetts. Overall, I develop theory to explain the entrepreneurial de-stigmatization and legitimation processes, thus contributing to the literatures on entrepreneurship and core stigma. Furthermore, I also contribute to the literature on entrepreneurial storytelling.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10651], "author_name_tesi": "Lashley, Kisha ", "last_name_ssi": "Lashley", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kisha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Management - Business Adminstration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy Grant Pollock", "Timothy Grant Pollock", "Glen Kreiner", "Forrest Scott Briscoe", "Susan G Strauss", "Ted Baker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy Grant Pollock, Dissertation Advisor", "Timothy Grant Pollock, Committee Chair", "Glen Kreiner, Committee Member", "Forrest Scott Briscoe, Committee Member", "Susan G Strauss, Committee Member", "Ted Baker, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["entrepreneurship", "organizational stigma", "entrepreneurial storytelling", "qualitative", "Qualitative Comparative Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Offense Specialization and Versatility as Predictors of Recidivism\n", "id": "19936", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9475", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recidivism studies vary widely in their methods, samples, and outcomes, but few have tested the effect of offense specialization on rate of re-offense.

I use a large sample of serious offenders (N=7,935), convicted and released in Pennsylvania, to construct and validate a risk assessment instrument and analyze the relationship between race, risk score, and recidivism. In the first part of the analyses, I introduce an approach to develop a static risk assessment instrument that judges can use at sentencing. Using the development sub-sample, a series of bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses are used to identify significant covariate patterns among convicted individual with a new arrest or parole revocation within three-years of release. I identify eight parsimonious risk factors associated with recidivism and use a modified Burgess scoring method to construct an 11-point additive risk scale. Scores are collapsed into Low, Medium, High, and Very High risk levels to maximize interpretability. Finally, the instrument is validated on the validation sub-sample. The area under the curve values (AUC) for the risk score are .72 for the full validation sample and .70 for both the White and Black offender sub-samples \u2014 showing a medium to strong ability to discriminate between recidivist and non-recidivism. \nIn the second part of the analyses, I conduct disparate impact and instrument bias analyses to determine the instrument\u2019s predictive utility across race. I use a series of bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models to examine the extent to which race is associated with recidivism, net of other factors, and to test for instrument fairness and interaction effects between risk factors and race. Results show that Black offenders receive higher average risk scores on the instrument than White offenders, mostly due to differences in their criminal histories. However, the instrument slightly under-predicts the recidivism rate for Black offenders, and over-predicts the recidivism rate for White offenders, because race is significantly correlated with recidivism, but not included in the scoring model. I situate the consideration of risk in the focal concerns perspective of sentencing and discuss the policy implication of using actuarial risk assessment tools to structure sentencing decisions. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15459], "author_name_tesi": "Laskorounskaia, Julia A", "last_name_ssi": "Laskorounskaia", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Julia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Criminology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Todd Ulmer", "Jeffrey Todd Ulmer", "Gary Zajac", "Eric P Baumer", "Christopher Jon Zorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Todd Ulmer, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey Todd Ulmer, Committee Chair", "Gary Zajac, Committee Member", "Eric P Baumer, Committee Member", "Christopher Jon Zorn, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sentencing", "judges", "recidivism", "pennsylvania", "race", "risk assessment"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "WOMEN\u2019S POST MARITAL NAME RETENTION AND THE COMMUNICATION OF IDENTITY", "id": "7103", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3326", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A growing body of research in the field of communication has focused on identity, and has paralleled studies in psychology, family studies, and gender studies on the significance of women\u2019s naming practices after marriage.

Magnetic nanoparticles are particularly attractive because their inherent superparamagnetic properties make them highly desirable for medical imaging, magnetic field assisted transport, and separations and analyses. With such applications on the horizon, synthetic routes for quickly and reliably rendering the surfaces of magnetic nanoparticles chemically functional have become an increasingly important focus. This dissertation describes synthetic routes for making and functionalizing magnetic nanoparticles and also discusses their characterization and initial applications in magnetic field induced separations.\n     Herein, the synthesis of a trifluoroethylester-PEG-thiol ligand (TFEE-PEG-SH) and its use to create water soluble, chemically functional Au metal and FePt magnetic nanoparticles is discussed in Chapter 2. The trifluoroethylester terminus facilitates attachment of any primary amine containing molecule via amide bond formation at room temperature without the use of coupling agents. Three possible routes of nanoparticle functionalization are demonstrated: synthesis of Au nanoparticles in the presence of functionalized R-PEG-SH; ligand exchange of R-PEG-SH onto both Au and FePt nanoparticles; and exchange of TFEE-PEG-SH onto Au nanoparticles, followed by subsequent amide condensation. A series of primary amine containing molecules, including biotin and fluorescamine, are easily attached to the water soluble particles and the resulting materials are characterized by NMR, UV Visible absorption and emission spectroscopies.\n     In terms of characterization, significant changes to the morphology of amorphous metal oxide (Fe, Co, and Ni) nanoparticles caused by exposure to the high energy electron beam of a transmission electron microscope (TEM) are reported in Chapters 3 and 4. The studied particles were synthesized via literature methods and fully characterized by X-ray powder diffraction and time-resolved TEM. As a result of electron beam irradiation, these particles are observed to transform from an initially solid particle to one with a core/void/shell structure eventually leading to a hollow nanoparticle. These results indicate that TEM-induced structural evolution is a general observation and not unique to one specific system. These data have significant implications for the structural analysis of nanomaterials via TEM.\n     The purification and analysis of magnetic nanoparticles using capillary magnetic field flow fractionation, which utilizes an applied magnetic field oriented orthogonal to the capillary flow, is also discussed in Chapter 5. To validate this approach as a separation method for nanometer-scale particles, samples of magnetic nanoparticles composed of either &#947;-Fe2O3 (maghemite) or CoFe2O4 with average diameters ranging from 4 to 13 nm were prepared and characterized by transmission electron microscopy and SQUID magnetometry. Retention of the samples on the capillary was investigated as a function of solvent flow rate and the nanoparticle size and composition; the elution times of the nanoparticles are strongly dependent on their magnetic moments. The use of this method to separate a mixture of nanoparticles into size monodisperse fractions is demonstrated. The magnetic moments of the particles are calculated based on analysis of the retention parameters and are compared to values obtained in separate SQUID magnetometry measurements.\n     Finally, the manipulation of magnetic nanoparticles between microfluidic channels by the application of an external magnet is discussed in Chapter 6. Two orthogonal channels were prepared using standard PDMS techniques with pressure driven flow used to deliver the mobile phase. To study the ability to control magnetic nanoparticles within micrometer-sized channels, Fe2O3, MnFe2O4, and Au nanoparticle samples were compared. For the magnetic particles, transfer between flow streams is greatly increased by placing a permanent magnet beneath the intersection of the channels, but no change is observed for the nonmagnetic Au particles. More nanoparticles are magnetically transferred into the orthogonal channel as the solvent flow rate decreases. The ability to use this technique to perform multiple injections of plugs of magnetic particles by periodic application of a magnetic field is also demonstrated.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [133], "author_name_tesi": "Latham, Andrew Howard", "last_name_ssi": "Latham", "middle_name_ssi": "Howard", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Ayusman Sen", "Peter E Schiffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member", "Peter E Schiffer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microfluidics", "Magnetism", "Nanoparticles", "Iron Oxide", "TEM"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "An Ontology for Interactive Workspaces and Their Use Cases within Collaborative Design and Construction Practices", "id": "28931", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12126", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With increased demand for high performance buildings and more specialized expertise for design and construction professionals, there is a demand in the building industry to develop new methods to support collaboration. One collaborative technology is building information modeling (BIM), which uses data and model sharing software to generate and share content across disciplines and organizations facilitating conveyance of building design information. For project teams, which typically contain newly formed relationships with unfamiliar individuals, and for integration of complex specialized knowledge, BIM by itself is not enough to engage participants in collaborative practices. There are both industry and research focus into developing interactive workspaces, technology and media-enabled collocated communication spaces, which are used by project teams to access and leverage digital content associated with a project design. These facilities can support large-scale visualization of models, multi-modal interaction, and aid collaboration of team members.\nThis research investigates interactive workspaces currently used by architectural, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry teams, and their relative use cases in the design and delivery process. The steps in the research process were: (1) document the facilities; (2) develop a deeper understanding of their feature sets, attributes, and use cases; (3) develop an ontology of the interactive workspaces and use cases; and (4) validate the ontology with industry members. Documentation of facilities occurred by documenting known facilities and content search in literature and publicly available resources. Twelve interviews were conducted with interactive workspace owners/managers. Documentation of the similarities and differences in feature sets and use cases was used to develop a list of critical elements in the ontology development.  The ontology was generated based on content analysis of the documented facilities and interviews with experts who have experience with using interactive workspaces. The ontology was validated through two focus group sessions with architecture, engineering, and construction industry members.\nThe results of this research contribute to an understanding of interactive workspaces, their attributes and their use cases in collaborative project teams in the AEC industry. Through review of literature and publicly available information, 84 facilities across 60 organizations were documented: 9% government, 35% industry, 6% vendor and 50% academic. The ontology was developed to relate core concepts of interactive workspaces to use cases. The main entities include: interactive workspaces, goal, meetings/workshops, use cases, users, methods, functional capabilities, and components. The ontology presents the relationship between these entities as well as categorization types and instances.

Finite state automata are used to model how agents take actions to move them between different conditional states. Agent software must effectively encode this behavior and facilitate optimal agent collaboration. Often, complexity of the behavior and the unforeseeable nature of emergent agent interaction makes for difficult a priori development of intelligent controllers. An evolutionary learning method was constructed to derive intelligent control rules for heterogeneous or homogeneous agents to accomplish individual and system goals. These collaborative agents rely on sensor information to inform their actions instead of relying on centralized tactical coordination or interagent communication.\nThe evolutionary learning program required the instantiation of a pool of intelligent controller solutions. A set of probabilistic vectors was selected as the format of the intelligent controller solution. This format was chosen with an eye towards potential continued adaptation once deployed in real-life autonomous scenarios. This solution form also allowed for application of numerous genetic operators during the reproductive phase, as well as reinforcement learning, during and after the simulation fitness evaluation. Rules associated with condition states were only added as those states that were encountered during simulation evaluation, thus maintaining compactness and tractability of the method. Because the iterative genetic process is so closely intertwined with the simulation process, a pre-existing simulation software package could not be used. This required the programming of both the evolutionary method as well as the simulation testbed, which included the modeling of all agents and the environment as well.\niv\nA problem scenario was chosen wherein multiple automated guided vehicles process parts through a manufacturing cell. Method validation was accomplished by evolving intelligent control rules which resulted in optimal behavior of the multi-agent system. Numerous experiments were then performed to optimally allocate controller types to agents, or to overcome sensor or agent faults.\nThere is an increasing need to address real-world autonomous multi-agent applications which require flexible controllers that can adapt to changing circumstances in remote environments.

This includes the removal of endotoxins, host cell proteins, RNA, and DNA fragments, as well as the separation of the desired supercoiled isoform from the open-circular and linear isoforms generated by a nick / break in one or both strands of the DNA double helix.  The objectives of this dissertation were to examine the potential of using membrane ultrafiltration (UF) for purification of the supercoiled plasmid and to compare the behavior of the different plasmid isoforms in UF with that in size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and agarose gel electrophoresis.\nThe effective size of the different plasmid isoforms was examined by evaluating the radius of gyration (RG) of different sized plasmids using static light scattering.  For any given plasmid size, the RG of the linear isoform was greater than that of the open-circular which was in turn greater than that of the supercoiled.  A new analytical expression was developed for the radius of gyration of the supercoiled isoform, providing accurate estimates of the RG values over a wide range of plasmid size.\nExperimental data for the partitioning of plasmid DNA isoforms in SEC were obtained over a wide range of conditions.  The partition coefficient (Kp) for each isoform decreased with increasing plasmid size, with the behavior for the different isoforms consistent with the measured RG values and with theoretical calculations for the partitioning of different polymer structures in slit-shaped pores.  However, the very low resolution between the different plasmid DNA isoforms made separations using SEC extremely challenging.\nThe main focus of this work was to develop a fundamental understanding of the factors affecting transmission of the different plasmid DNA isoforms through UF membranes, including the role of filtrate flux, plasmid size, pore size, and solution ionic strength.  At all conditions, the extent of plasmid transmission was a very strong function of the filtrate flux, with the sieving coefficient increasing from near zero at low flux to nearly 100% transmission at filtrate flux values well above the critical filtrate flux for plasmid transmission.  This behavior was explained in terms of the deformation / elongation of the plasmid in the converging flow field above the UF membrane pores.  A modified form of the classical elongational flow model for polymer transmission was developed and shown to be in good agreement with experimental data over a wide range of conditions.  \nFor any given plasmid size, the critical filtrate flux was lowest for the linear isoform followed by the supercoiled and then the open-circular isoform.  These surprising  differences in critical flux provided a unique opportunity for the separation of the plasmid DNA isoforms based on a completely novel strategy that relies on differences in molecular flexibility.  The results from sieving and diafiltration experiments with binary and ternary mixtures of the plasmid isoforms clearly demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, providing an initial framework for the design of novel membrane processes suitable for the large-scale production of DNA therapeutics.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1537], "author_name_tesi": "Latulippe, David ", "last_name_ssi": "Latulippe", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney", "Andrew Zydney", "Patrick Cirino", "William O Hancock", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Patrick Cirino, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["radius of gyration", "sieving coefficient", "DNA elongation", "open-circular", "supercoiled", "plasmid DNA", "partition coefficient"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "MODIFICATION OF THE ORDER PICKING AND REPLENISHMENT POLICY IN A DISTRIBUTION CENTER", "id": "11860", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "517", "abstract_tesi": "As the global standard to fulfill orders is now expected to be within a 24 hour period, distribution centers have become an important part in the supply chain in order for businesses to stay competitive. A distribution center is important because it is a point where products are consolidated to serve ever-changing customer demand faster and efficiently. The goal of this thesis is to improve productivity by studying and suggesting alternatives to the two most time- consuming activities in a distribution center: order picking and replenishment. The warehouse studied in this paper is a regional distribution center which fulfills orders for laboratory supplies from industries and universities within the United States. In the forward area of the distribution center, customer orders are picked one at a time and replenishments are done concurrently with the order picking. Replenishment sources sometimes are located on a productive or reachable area instead of on the top of the racks. Hence, in the current replenishment procedure, a picker replenishes from a productive area to another productive area, which is inefficient. To improve productivity, the order picking process is modified to batched order picking process and replenishment operation is modified by assigning direct picking from productive replenishment sources. The existing and modified systems are modeled using simulation to estimate the total pick times. The total pick times are compared using two-way ANOVA to identify the effects of the modifications on the two factors, the order picking process and replenishment operation, to the total pick time. The statistical analysis shows significant improvements of the total pick time when these two factors are altered. Based on the analysis, the greatest reduction on the total pick time is achieved when both the order picking process and replenishment operation are modified to batched picking process and direct picking from replenishment.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [514], "author_name_tesi": "Latumena, Anita ", "last_name_ssi": "Latumena", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anita", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah Jean Medeiros", "Deborah Jean Medeiros"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah Jean Medeiros, Thesis Advisor", "Deborah Jean Medeiros, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["replenishment", "replenishment optimization", "order picking", "picking", "batched picking", "zone based", "distribution center", "warehouse"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Lamp and In-duct Device modeling for UVGI System Performance Prediction ", "id": "9897", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3084", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) is one of the most promising technologies for control of airborne indoor bio-contaminants, such as viruses and bacteria, in health care, security, and general air quality applications. UVGI is the use of radiation, mainly from the UVC band, to inactivate microorganisms. For a given level of control, UVGI can significantly reduce requirements for ventilation rate and filtration efficiency, which makes it an attractive alternative or complement to those established methods of ventilation and filtration. However, there is a lack of information and well validated models in the literature for UV lamp performance and UVGI device design in in-duct application. The present study attempts to develop a better basis for selecting, designing and commissioning in-duct UVGI systems.  \n\nThis research investigated the performance of UVC lamps and in-duct UVGI devices under a range of operating conditions encountered in HVAC system applications. Three low pressure mercury, UVC lamp types were selected for experiments. Lamp \u201cType 1\u201d is a Philips \u2013 TUV 25W standard output hot cathode lamp. Lamp \u201cType 2\u201d is a Philips \u2013 TUV PLL 60W HO/4P high output hot cathode lamp.  Lamp \u201cType 3\u201d is a Light Sources 782L10 standard output cold cathode lamp. The outputs of the lamps were monitored in the lamp depreciation and life tests. Twenty-one combinations of different current levels, cycling rates, and lamp types were measured over 5500 hours in a burn-in room. The impact of the cycling rate on output was not clearly shown in these lamps. The impact of current was shown in \u201cType 1\u201d and \u201cType 2\u201d lamps. Operating standard output lamps (Type 1) at above rated current slightly increases the depreciation rate on lamp output. Operating high output lamps (Type 2) at reduced current decreases the depreciation rate on lamp output. \n\nWith the results from the ambient respond tests, the impacts of ambient conditions (air velocity and temperature) and flow orientation on UV lamp output were significant. The experimental results showed UVC lamp output variation was very significant (> 70%) over the range of conditions typically encountered in in-duct UVGI applications due to convective \u201cwind chill\u201d effects. In addition, analytical heat transfer models were used to develop calibrated heat transfer models which require a relatively small amount of experimental data to predict the lamp output in new conditions with good agreement (< 8.5%). It was more accurate and effective than the purely empirical model for an interpolation and a near-range extrapolation. These calibrated heat transfer models could be used as design tools for considering the impacts of operating conditions and selecting the appropriate lamp type and orientation.\n\nPrevious investigations of UVGI irradiance fields have used inverse square law and view factor methods. Both of these approaches have significant limitations, particularly when geometry is complex. This research applied the Monte Carlo (ray tracing) methods to fluence distribution in a UVGI device considering the reflectivity of surfaces and lamp configuration. After including the anisotropic reflection properties of the duct surfaces and adjusting the thermal impacts on the lamp output, the simple ray-tracing computer model provided a reasonable (&#61617;17%) prediction of planar irradiance measurements that were recorded in the test section of the UVGI device.  Finally, this study evaluated some possible procedures for estimating the spherical irradiance within a UVGI device base on the planar irradiances on a cube.\n\nWith this study, the output variations of the UVC lamps that commonly used in the in-duct UVGI device were thoroughly investigated for the factors of age and thermal conditions. The impact of these factors in a system were demonstrated in a case study at the end, which found that a potential magnitude of error (20% under-estimation bio-contaminant concentration in a space) may result from failure to account for ambient effects on the output reduction of a typical UVGI device.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3073], "author_name_tesi": "Lau, Josephine ", "last_name_ssi": "Lau", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Josephine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William P Bahnfleth", "William P Bahnfleth", "James Freihaut", "Richard George Mistrick", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William P Bahnfleth, Dissertation Advisor", "William P Bahnfleth, Committee Chair", "James Freihaut, Committee Member", "Richard George Mistrick, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["air disinfection", "UVGI", "UVC lamps", "thermal tests", "aging tests", "bioaerosals"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "STRESS RESPONSE PATHWAYS INDUCED BY PEPTIDOGLYCAN DAMAGE", "id": "10717", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4093", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The bacterial cell envelope is the cell's first defense against changes in the environment. Bacterial cells have developed many pathways to sense and respond to damage to the cell envelope. In Escherichia coli at least five cell envelope stress response pathways have been identified, but until recently none of them were shown to sense damage to the peptidoglycan layer. The major objective of my dissertation research was to identify and examine stress response pathways E. coli use to sense and respond to peptidoglycan damage. Microarray analysis was employed to identify genes with increased expression in response to treatment with the &#946;-lactam antibiotics cefsulodin and mecillinam as well as the combination of both antibiotics. The Rcs phosphorelay was identified as an important stress response activated in response to &#946;-lactam-induced peptidoglycan damage. The Rcs phosphorelay was shown to be important for E. coli to survive in the presence of cefsulodin and mecillinam. Rcs-mediated survival was investigated to determine the gene or genes responsible for increasing the ability of E. coli to grow in the presence of antibiotics. Capsular synthesis was found to have no role in the increased survival in the presence of the antibiotics. The Rcs phosphorelay also does not affect survival in the presence of the antibiotics by activating the general stress response factor &#963;S or by altering the permeability of the membrane. Previous studies of the Rcs regulon suggested that the Rcs phosphorelay was involved in regulating genes other than those encoding colanic acid biosynthesis machinery. In this work, microarray analysis was employed to identify genes with increased expression in response to treatment with &#946;-lactam antibiotics that were regulated by the Rcs phosphorelay independently of the capsular synthesis. This approach identified a large number of genes that had not previously been identified as Rcs-regulated. Strains containing a deletion of each individual gene identified as Rcs-regulated were constructed and tested for the ability to grow in the presence of the antibiotics to determine which genes may have a role in Rcs-medicated survival. Two genes, iap and ygdR, were identified with a strong effect on growth in the presence of the antibiotics. No single gene was responsible for the Rcs-mediated survival in the presence of the antibiotics. Strains containing double and triple deletions of Rcs-regulated genes had more severe defects in survival. However, none of the combinations of deletions reduced growth to the extent of the deletion of the Rcs phosphorelay, suggesting that other factors remain to be identified. Microarray analysis suggested that the Fur repressor and Cpx two component signal transduction system were activated in response to &#946;-lactam antibiotics. Both pathways also contribute to survival in the presence of the antibiotics. Microarray analysis of E. coli treated with the combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam, as well as with mecillinam alone, revealed a few &#963;E-regulated genes with increased expression. One of these genes, htrG, was examined more closely. HtrG is predicted to be an inner membrane protein with bacterial SH3 and coiled coil protein interaction domains. Deletion of htrG did not affect growth of E. coli; however, when HtrG is over-expressed from a strong promoter cells grow as spheres and lyse. Over-expression of htrG from a weak promoter also led to growth as spheres but cells did not lyse. This suggests that the effect of HtrG is likely due to an intrinsic property of HtrG. We have proposed that HtrG is involved in cell shape determination based on the results of our experiments.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4071], "author_name_tesi": "Laubacher, Mary Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Laubacher", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Mary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Ellen Ades", "Sarah Ellen Ades", "Paul Lee Babitzke", "Kathleen Postle", "Eric Thomas Harvill", "Chitrita Debroy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Ellen Ades, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarah Ellen Ades, Committee Chair", "Paul Lee Babitzke, Committee Member", "Kathleen Postle, Committee Member", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Member", "Chitrita Debroy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Escherichia coli", "antibiotics", "stress response pathways", "cell envelope", "Rcs phosphorelay", "HtrG"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Suspension of Reason in Hegel and Schelling\n", "id": "7563", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1150", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Countering the common depiction of Hegel and Schelling as uncritical champions of reason\u2019s triumph in the modern world, I analyze the significance of their respective claims that reason must be \u201csuspended\u201d (aufgehoben) in both its theoretical and practical employments.

In an effort to further our\nunderstanding of fluid distribution in the forearc, I first develop a fluid budget using a numerical\nmodel parameterized by a combination of data obtained through ocean drilling, and laboratory\ntesting of recovered sediments, which estimate the compaction behavior during subduction, and\nassociated permeability reduction. Previous efforts to quantify the fluid budget did not include\npermeable splay faults, despite geochemical and geophysical evidence that they represent regions\nof focused flow, and provide a hydraulic connection from the source of fluids at the plate\nboundary, to the seafloor. The model results suggest that faults capture up to 35% of the total\nflux, and modeled flow rates are highly consistent with studies of both seafloor seeps, and flow at\nthe trench, suggesting a quantitative link between the underlying permeability architecture of the\nforearc and flow rates at the seafloor. The results highlight the importance of these features in\nefficiently channeling heat and solutes from depth.\niii\nThe second study examines the importance of faults in the determining the distribution of\nfluid pressures and deeply sourced fluids by coupling the results of dehydration modeling with a\nflow and transport model. The dehydration derived freshwater effectively acts as a tracer to\nconsider the role of faults in distributing deeply sourced fluids, and translating fluid pressures\naway from the plate boundary. Model results indicate that faults are efficient translators of fluids,\nand capture deeply sourced fluids before they reach the trench. Overpressures develop at the base\nof the slope sediments, regardless of the permeability architecture employed, suggesting a\npotential mechanism for the formation of mud volcanoes, spatially correlated with faults that\npenetrate the forearc.\nThe results of a comprehensive heat-flow campaign offshore Costa Rica\nsuggests plate boundary temperatures are much lower than previously thought, with dehydration\nreactions shifted farther down-dip, into regions of further depleted porosity. The third project in\nCosta Rica uses this new thermal structure to evaluate the spatial distribution of dehydration\nreactions along a 500-km segment of the plate boundary, from North of Nicoya, to north of Osa\npeninsula. I find that peak dehydration sources are spatially correlated with the rupture patch of\nall major earthquakes since 1950, and LFEs and slow-slip occur immediately down-dip of the\nreaction midpoint where the mole fraction of Smectite-Illite in the mixed layer clays is 50%\nSmectite and 50% Illite. I find that the transition from aseismic to seismic behavior correlates\nwell with the temperature range associated with the precipitation of silica produced through\nsmectite transformation, which stiffens the sediment through chemical compaction, and\nsuggests a potential chemical mechanism for the onset of seismicity.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8946], "author_name_tesi": "Lauer, Rachel Mollie", "last_name_ssi": "Lauer", "middle_name_ssi": "Mollie", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Demian Saffer", "Demian Saffer", "Chris Marone", "Donald Myron Fisher", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Demian Saffer, Dissertation Advisor", "Demian Saffer, Committee Chair", "Chris Marone, Committee Member", "Donald Myron Fisher, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["subduction zone", "hydrogeology", "earthquake mechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of a Dual-frequency Radar Cloud Liquid Water Content Retrieval Algorithm", "id": "22577", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10341", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cloud microphysical properties, including liquid water content, greatly impact the Earth's radiation budget but have high uncertainties in global climate models. Although today's three-channel microwave radiometers provide the most trusted liquid water path retrievals, reliable liquid water content retrievals are not yet available. New efforts to improve the retrieval of cloud liquid water contents are underway. One such effort that retrieves cloud liquid water content using a dual-frequency radar differential absorption approach with total variation regularization techniques is evaluated here. \n\nOne benefit of this method is that it only depends on differences in attenuation between the two frequency radars so there is no need for the radars to be calibrated. Differences in attenuation are proportional to the path-integrated liquid in the cloud and, therefore, can be used to retrieve liquid water contents at every height inside a cloud. This method is unreliable when ice particles or large drops with maximum dimensions greater than one third of the W-band wavelength of approximately 3 mm are present because the attenuation can appear to increase due to resonant scattering and not by absorption. Therefore, we limit the test cases in this study to low-level clouds consisting of only liquid water drops with diameters less than one third of the W-band wavelength. \n\nUsing 65 test cases obtained from four different Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Program Research Facilities, we were able to reproduce the results of an earlier study based on a single case study period in which the radar-retrieved cloud liquid water paths fall within $\\pm 0.3\\,{\\rm mm}$ of those retrieved from microwave radiometer measurements. The standard deviation of the differences between the radar- and microwave radiometer-retrieved cloud liquid water paths was 0.12 mm once outliers were removed. Analyzing the differences of the radar- and microwave radiometer-retrieved cloud liquid water paths as a function of the microwave radiometer-retrieved cloud liquid water paths, we found that the standard deviation of 0.12 mm was relatively constant for differences partitioned by microwave radiometer-retrieved cloud liquid water path. This implies that relative errors in radar-retrieved cloud liquid water paths were much larger for small values than for large ones. As a result, these retrievals are not sufficient for radiation studies in low liquid water path clouds but may be sufficient for some studies of clouds with large cloud liquid water paths.\n\nWe found that radar-retrieved cloud liquid water contents were sensitive to the a priori profiles of cloud liquid water content used to initialize the retrieval. Several unphysical features in the radar-retrieved cloud liquid water content fields can be attributed to these a priori estimates and methods for removing them are discussed. Finally, this retrieval approach highlights the deleterious effects of errors in beam pointing. Improving the pointing accuracy of the W- and Ka-band radars would lead to the greatest improvements in the accuracy of the radar-retrieved cloud liquid water contents.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10014], "author_name_tesi": "Laughlin, Courtney Danielle", "last_name_ssi": "Laughlin", "middle_name_ssi": "Danielle", "first_name_ssi": "Courtney", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eugene Edmund Clothiaux"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cloud liquid water content", "cloud liquid water path", "dual-frequency radar"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Understanding Heat Resistant Structure Formation in White Chocolate", "id": "16261", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8251", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Heat resistant chocolate is of much interest to confectionery companies for marketing in tropical areas where the weather is not conducive to the sale and consumption of regular chocolate.

The overall goal of this research was to explore different instrumental and imaging techniques for studying heat resistant structure formation in white chocolate cured at 83% RH and 29\u00b0C. \n\nScreening studies were performed to determine curing conditions for standard white chocolate (30% whole milk powder, 44% sucrose, and 26% cocoa butter) and for the individual ingredients including amorphous lactose, whole milk powder, sucrose, and milk protein isolate. Chocolate bars were cured at 83% RH and 29\u00b0C for 7 days, while individual ingredients were cured at the same RH and temperature for 4 hours. In order to understand the role of different emulsifiers in structure formation, white chocolate was made with 0.1% polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), 0.3% lecithin, or no added emulsifier. \n\t\nInstrumental techniques measured physical and textural properties of individual ingredients and white chocolate bars before and after curing. Physical properties of white chocolate samples measured were moisture content using Karl Fischer, fat content using Mojonnier method, and force required to penetrate at 29\u00b0C using a texturometer. The changes in individual ingredients after curing were evaluated by monitoring moisture content using Karl Fischer as well as phase changes using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and mid-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Image analysis was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM).\n\t\nTexturometer results showed that post-cured bars required significantly more force to penetrate than pre-cured bars, indicating structure formation had occurred. XRD patterns showed crystallization of lactose by itself and within the whole milk powder particles after curing. Milk protein isolate and sucrose did not exhibit any major phase changes. FTIR spectra corresponded well with XRD patterns. \nIdentification of individual ingredients in SEM images of white chocolate samples was difficult, so structure formation was inferred based on information from SEM images of individual ingredients. SEM images showed lactose transitioned from its glassy state, became sticky enough to \u2018glue\u2019 molecules together, and crystallized into a welded mass. Whole milk powder SEM images also showed lactose crystallization, while milk protein isolate and sucrose SEM images did not show any structural differences after curing. No discernable visual differences in structure were detected based upon emulsifiers used.\n\nThis study showed that high humidity is useful in creating heat resistant structure in white chocolate. Analyses of individual ingredients showed that the stickiness observed in lactose within whole milk powder provided the adhesion necessary between lactose molecules and other ingredients to establish a structure in white chocolate. The complimentary nature of XRD and FTIR measurements with SEM showed the usefulness of combining instrumental and imaging techniques to better understand heat resistant structure formation in white chocolate.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8173], "author_name_tesi": "Laughter, Julie Amanda", "last_name_ssi": "Laughter", "middle_name_ssi": "Amanda", "first_name_ssi": "Julie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["heat resistant", "chocolate", "humidity", "structure", "texturometer", "stickiness", "whole milk powder", "lactose"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Cross-Functional Project Teams in Construction: A Case Study", "id": "13703jzl6016", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13703", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For many years traditional project delivery systems have been utilized in the construction industry, but new delivery systems such as Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) are being developed to answer the need for more integrated approaches.

However, many factors influence the need for evolving cross-functional project teams (CFPTs) as project needs change and the addition of new participants to the project. This research presents IPD experts\u2019 interviews and a case study of an IPD project delivered at the Pennsylvania State University for a mixed-use laboratory, office and classroom building. The objective is to demonstrate the composition and evolution of the CFPTs organization, from the beginning of the design through early construction. The discussion focuses on the changes in structure and alignment as they relate to project objectives at key stages of the project, shifting engagement of the team members and disciplines within the CFPTs, and the internal and external factors that influence the process. This study finds that the CFPTs should be created at the very early stages of the design in conjunction with a Target Value Design (TVD) approach.  The CFPTs and TVD should focus on the main building systems. While the number of CFPTs vary with the project complexity, scope, and scale, overall number should be in the range of four to 10. The personnel for each CFPT should be targeted around four to six people, with some variance based on the objectives and tasks they undertake, and leadership that brings both cross disciplinary knowledge to communicate with other CFPTs as well as strong facilitation skills.  Furthermore team performance, thus far, has been assessed primarily by the CFPTs\u2019 capacity to meet commitments. Finally, the CFPT organization combined with the IPD contract structure allows using the team flexibility to leverage the full potential of individuals to best suit the project needs as the project evolves, with little administrative burden as a barrier to getting the best team.

The spatio-temporal velocity variations drive nonsteady loadings on wind turbines that contribute to premature wind turbine component fatigue failure, decreasing the levelized cost of (wind) energy (LCOE).  The aims of the current comprehensive research program center on the quantification of the characteristics of the nonsteady loads resulting from the interactions between the coherent energy contain gin atmospheric turbulence eddies within the lower ABL as the eddies advect through the rotor plane and the rotating wind turbine blade encounter the internal turbulence structure of the atmospheric eddies.\n\nWe focus on the daytime atmospheric boundary layer, where buoyancy due to surface heating interacts with shear to create coherent turbulence structures. Pseudo-spectral large eddy simulation (LES) is used to generate an equilibrium atmospheric boundary layer over flat terrain with uniform surface roughness characteristic of the Midwest on a typical sunny windy afternoon when the ABL can be approximated as quasi-steady. The energy-containing eddies are found to create advective time-responses of order 30-90 seconds with lateral spatial scales of order the wind turbine rotor diameter.  Different wind turbine simulation methods of a representative utility scale turbine were applied using the atmospheric turbulence as inflow.\n\nWe apply three different fidelity wind turbine simulation methods to quantify the extent to which lower order models are able to accurately predict the nonsteady loading due to atmospheric turbulence eddies advecting through the rotor plane and interacting with the wind turbine.  The methods vary both the coupling to the atmospheric boundary layer and the way in which the blade geometry is resolved and sectional blade forces are calculated. The highest fidelity simulation resolves the blade geometry to capture unsteady boundary layer response and separation dynamics within a simulation of the atmospheric boundary layer coupling the effect of the turbine to the atmospheric inflow.  The lower order models both use empirical look-up tables to predict the time changes in blade sectional forces as a function of time changes in local velocity vector.  The actuator line method (ALM) is two-way coupled and feeds these blade forces back into a simulation of the atmospheric boundary layer.  The blade element momentum theory (BEMT) is one-way coupled and models the effect of the turbine on the incoming velocity field.  \n\nThe coupling method and method of blade resolution are both found to have an effect on the ability to accurately predict sectional blade load response to nonsteady atmospheric turbulence. The BEMT cannot accurately predict the timing of the response changes as these are modulated by the wind turbine within the ABL simulations. The lower order models have increased blade sectional load range and temporal gradients due to their inability to accurately capture the temporal response of the blade geometry to inflow changes.    \n\nTaking advantage of horizontal homogeneity to collect statistics, we investigate the time period required to create well converged statistics in the equilibrium atmospheric boundary layer and find whereas the 10-minute industry standard for `averages' retains variability of order 10%, the 10-minute average is an optimal choice. We compare the industry standard 10-minute averaging period. The residual variability within the 10-minute period to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Gearbox Reliability Collaborative (GRC) field test database to find that whereas the 10-minute window still contains large variability, it is, in some sense, optimal because averaging times much longer would be required to significantly reduce variability. \n\nTurbulence fluctuations in streamwise velocity are found to be the primary driver of temporal variations in local angles of attack and  sectional blade loads. Based on this new understanding, we develop analyses to show that whereas rotor torque and thrust correlate well with upstream horizontal velocity averaged over the rotor disk, out-of-plane bending moment magnitude correlates with the asymmetry in the horizontal fluctuating velocity over the rotor disk.  Consequentially, off-design motions of the drivetrain and gearbox shown with the GRC field test data are well predicted using an asymmetry index designed to capture the response of a three-bladed turbine to asymmetry in the rotor plane. The predictors for torque, thrust and out-of-plane bending moment are shown to correlate well to upstream rotor planes indicating that they may be applied to advanced feed-forward control methods such as forward-facing LIDAR used to detect velocity changes in front of a wind turbine. This has the potential to increase wind turbine reliability by using controls to reduce potentially detrimental load responses to incoming atmospheric turbulence and decrease the LCOE.

The effects of terbacil and other herbicides were evaluated on strawberry plant net photosynthesis (Pn) and growth of four commonly grown cultivars.  Terbacil, a commonly used herbicide, was applied foliarly to strawberry plants at concentrations ranging from 160 to 1600 mg\u2022L-1, a.i.  Terbacil reduced Pn of young leaves, but did not reduce Pn of older leaves. Terbacil reduced leaf number and whole plant dry mass at higher concentrations.  \n\tTerbacil at 400 mg\u2022L-1, a.i. was foliarly applied to four strawberry cultivars, \u2018Darselect\u2019, \u2018Earliglow\u2019, \u2018Honeoye\u2019, and \u2018Jewel\u2019.  \u2018Darselect\u2019 was least susceptible to terbacil.  \u2018Darselect\u2019 leaves had a 75.1 percent reduction in Pn after application, and herbicide injury was observed on 38.6 percent of leaves.  \u2018Earliglow\u2019 was generally less susceptible to terbacil and had an 80.0 percent reduction in Pn with herbicide injury on 50.8 percent of leaves.  \u2018Honeoye\u2019 had the highest reduction in Pn of 94.9 percent, and 53.6 percent of leaves had herbicide injury. \u2018Jewel\u2019 was the most susceptible cultivar and had an 86.7 percent reduction in Pn and herbicide injury on 71.2 percent of leaves.  \n\tOther commonly used herbicides, sethoxydim, clethodim, and clopyralid, were applied foliarly to \u2018Jewel\u2019 strawberry plants alone and in combination with terbacil.  Terbacil reduced Pn in strawberry plants, but other herbicides did not. Sethoxydim did not suppress plant vigor when applied alone or in combination with terbacil, and treated plants had more runners than the control.  Clethodim and clopyralid reduced leaf and total plant dry mass, and the combination of clethodim and clopyralid with terbacil reduced leaf and total dry mass more than terbacil alone.  \n \tThe effect of terbacil and Rhizoctonia fragariae were observed on strawberry growth and the development of black root rot (BRR) symptoms under various environmental stresses. Terbacil applied at 160 mg\u2022L-1, a.i. did not affect root health or growth of \u2018Jewel\u2019 strawberry plants inoculated with R. fragariae anastomosis groups (AG) A, G, and I and an uncharacterized strain isolated from symptomatic plants in Pennsylvania.  Inoculated strawberry plants were not more susceptible to black root rot when terbacil was applied or when plants were treated with drought and waterlogged soil conditions.  \n \tThe effect of soil type, compost level, and root injury were also observed when plants were inoculated with R. fragariae from Pennsylvania (PA) and Connecticut (CT).  \u2018Jewel\u2019 strawberry plants inoculated with the R. fragariae strain AG-A from PA, had more structural roots, higher percentages of structural roots with lesions, and higher crown and root dry mass than plants inoculated with other PA isolates.  When grown in Hagerstown-2 and sandy loam soils, plants inoculated with AG-A isolates from CT and PA had higher root dry mass than non-inoculated plants.  Plants inoculated with AG-A  from CT also had higher total dry mass compared to other inoculation treatments when grown in all compost rates of 0, 10, 20, and 30 percent.  Plants inoculated with R. fragariae had more growth when roots were injured by scraping and crushing.  Plants inoculated with the CT strains, AG-A and AG-G, and the PA strain AG-A, had a higher percentage of plant survival than plants inoculated with the PA strain AG-G, or non-inoculated plants. \n\tOur results suggest that terbacil, at low concentrations, does not negatively affect plant growth.   However, terbacil applied in combination with clethodim and clopyralid may reduce plant vigor. To minimize reduction in Pn from terbacil application, growers can plant less susceptible strawberry cultivars such as \u2018Darselect\u2019 and \u2018Earliglow\u2019, or apply terbacil when many old leaves are present on plants.  At low concentrations of 160 mg\u2022L-1, terbacil did not affect root health or development of black root rot symptoms when plants were inoculated with PA isolates of R. fragariae, AG-A, AG-G, AG-I, and an uncharacterized strain.  \n\tEnvironmental factors of soil temperature, moisture level, and root injury did not affect root health or development of BRR symptoms when plants were inoculated with R. fragariae isolates from PA or CT.  Percent compost of 10 or higher in soil may be detrimental to plant growth although BRR symptoms on structural roots were not affected by addition of compost.  Soil type impacted plant growth where plants grown in the Hagerstown-2 loam and sandy loam had the highest dry mass.  Plants grown in the poorly drained Hagerstown-1 loam had significantly more structural roots with lesions in non-inoculated and R. fragariae inoculated plants which suggests that soil type may be an important factor involved in BRR symptom development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8491], "author_name_tesi": "Lavely, Emily Kay", "last_name_ssi": "Lavely", "middle_name_ssi": "Kay", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard P Marini"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard P Marini, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fragaria x ananassa", "black root rot", "terbacil", "photosynthesis", "environmental stress", "root injury"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Pertussis on the Rise: Population Dynamical Effects of Waning Immunity \n\n", "id": "12493", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3015", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Incidence of whooping cough, or pertussis, caused primarily by the bacteria <i>Bordetella pertussis</i> and secondarily by <i>B. parapertussis</i>, has been increasing for the past two to three decades in most developed countries despite high vaccine coverage.  In addition to an overall increase in cases, there has been a shift in the age distribution with a much larger number and proportion of cases now found in teenagers and adults.  However, the age group most at risk of severe disease and death is infants, and they are not fully protected by the vaccine until after the third dose of vaccine, given between six and twelve months of age in most places.  It is therefore important to design vaccine policy to maximize indirect protection of infants.  \n\nA number of hypotheses have been put forward to explain the recent changes in pertussis epidemiology.  The three primary ones involve evolution of the pathogen population, importance of age-specific contact rates, and loss of population-level herd immunity through waning individual immunity combined with reduced exposure to circulating pathogen.  The work presented here primarily explores evidence for the third of these hypotheses using a two-pronged approach: (1) statistical modeling of contemporary age-specific incidence and vaccine history data from Massachusetts and Norway, and (2) mechanistic modeling that connects the within host immune dynamics to population level epidemiology in contemporary Massachusetts and pre-vaccine era Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\nI show that in both Norway and Massachusetts the seasonality of pertussis infections varies between age groups, with school-age children experiencing peak incidence in the winter, infants in the summer, and adults less clearly defined, showing that chains of transmission partially age-segregate.  There is consistent evidence from the two regions of temporary vaccine-induced immunity that lasts 5-10 years.  Moreover, infections are occurring more quickly after vaccination now than they did ten or fifteen years ago in both locations.  I hypothesize that these changes can be explained by low incidence in the current era providing little natural immune boosting (the anamnestic response), thereby allowing immunity to wane fully, such that clinical disease and transmission occur more frequently upon re-exposure.  \n\nI evaluate this hypothesis by encapsulating it in a pair of mathematical models, one deterministic, one stochastic, and compare its predictions regarding age, total incidence, and dynamics against historical pre-vacine and contemporary data.  I find that the deterministic, unforced model with a rapid anamnestic response predicts the shift in age distribution and increase in incidence with high vaccine coverage.  The seasonally forced, stochastic model is able to recapitulate the observed dynamics from Copenhagen in the prevaccine era.  We find that the presence of rapid boosting allows for a shorter duration of immunity, thereby reconciling current clinical estimates of the duration of infection-induced immunity with prevaccine-era dynamics.  Additionally, we show that the intermittent large outbreaks observed in prevaccine-era Copenhagen may result from highly intermingled basins of attraction for ghosts of multiannual cyclic attractors.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3006], "author_name_tesi": "Lavine, Jennie Sara", "last_name_ssi": "Lavine", "middle_name_ssi": "Sara", "first_name_ssi": "Jennie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ottar N Bjornstad", "Andrew Fraser Read", "Ottar N Bjornstad", "Timothy Reluga", "Eric Thomas Harvill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ottar N Bjornstad, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Fraser Read, Committee Chair", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Member", "Timothy Reluga, Committee Member", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Disease Dynamics", "Mathematical Models", "Epidemiology", "Whooping Cough"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Granivorous invertebrates and weed seed predation:  An ecological approach to weed management", "id": "16175", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8095", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this dissertation is to better understand invertebrate agricultural weed seed predation and determine if predator olfaction and seed imbibition are important aspects of this interaction.  Equally important, this project independently examines the use of a minimum tillage regime and as part of a larger integrated weed management strategy, including cover crops, to determine the influence of these management tactics on invertebrate activity-densities and weed seed predation.  The minimum tillage regime did not reduce weed seed predation by invertebrates when compared to a no-till system.  The majority of granivorous invertebrates had significantly higher activity-densities in minimum tillage plots when compared to no-till plots.  However one species, Harpalus pensylvanicus DeGeer, an abundant seed predator, had a significant decrease in activity-density in min-till plots when compared to no-till.  The integration of cover crops into a minimum tillage corn/soybean cropping system resulted in an increase in beneficial invertebrate activity-densities but did not increase surface seed predation when compared to no-till and organic systems.  Through a novel application of a stable isotope, 15N,  it was shown that H. pensylvanicus individuals frequently eat both velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic) and giant foxtail (Setaria faberi Herrm) seeds in a no-till field.  Imbibition of seeds altered H. pensylvanicus seed selection and the amount of seed eaten.  All 7 weed seed species used in the study were eaten in significantly greater amounts when imbibed than when dry.  Substantial amounts of large-sized seeds were eaten when imbibed but not when dry.  Further illustrating the importance of imbibition, H. pensylvanicus individuals were shown to find imbibed velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic) and giant foxtail (Setaria faberi Herrm) seed through olfaction but were unable to locate dry seed.  Ethylene and carbon dioxide were released from dry seeds with greater amounts of these two chemicals released when seeds were imbibed.  However, H. pensylvanicus beetles showed no attraction response when exposed to these chemicals in y-tube olfactometry assays.  This research shows that the application of a minimum tillage regime is not detrimental to the granivorous invertebrate community or seed predation when compared to a no-till system.

Mast cells are central effector cells of allergic inflammation.  Therefore, impaired calcium signaling, which correlates with decreased activation, in mast cells results in markedly attenuated allergic responses.  Nonetheless, the molecular mechanisms of how calcium homeostasis is regulated in mast cells remain poorly characterized.  In particular, the identity of the players involved in the gating of store-operated Ca2+ channels has eluded biochemical definition.\n\tA tool that could potentially elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) is the immunosuppressant compound 3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl pyrazole (BTP).  Recently, our laboratory identified the actin-reorganizing protein drebrin as a target of BTP and demonstrated a novel role for this protein in the regulation of SOCE in T cells.  These findings implicate the involvement of actin-binding proteins in the regulation of Ca2+ mobilization in mast cells and downstream allergic responses.  Nevertheless, the effects of BTP on mast cells have yet to be properly characterized, and the role of its target drebrin in the biology of these immune cells has not been determined.\n\tHere, we demonstrate that treatment with the BTP derivative N-(4-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)phenyl)-4-methyl-1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-carboxamide (BTP2) potently inhibits the release of mast cell-specific inflammatory mediators that initiate and propagate allergic responses.  In the context of in vitro and in vivo models, our studies have determined that BTP2 suppresses the release of preformed mediators, such as histamine, and cytokines through the attenuation of SOCE.  Moreover, our analysis of the structure-activity relationship of BTP identified the trifluoromethyl group at the carbon 3 (C3) position of the core BTP pyrazole ring as the chemical moiety principally responsible for its inhibitory activity on mast cell activation and effector responses.  \n\tIn corroboration, using a novel knockout murine model, we show that the BTP-targeted protein drebrin is required for Ca2+-dependent allergic responses.  In vivo, sensitized drebrin-/- mice release less histamine upon antigenic challenge.  Importantly, in drebrin-/- mice, the development of mast cells from bone marrow precursors is intact, but the survival of bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) is reduced in vitro.  Levels of serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) are normal in these mice, and drebrin-/- BMMCs express normal levels of surface high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc&#949;RI).  Moreover, drebrin deficiency does not alter phosphorylation events downstream of the Fc&#949;RI.  The activation of tyrosine kinases and the mitogen-activated protein kinases Erk1/2, JNK, and p38 is unchanged.  However, drebrin is involved in Fc&#949;RI-induced Ca2+ mobilization.  In mast cells from drebrin-/- mice, Fc&#949;RI-induced degranulation, as well as cytokine secretion, is diminished.  Thus, drebrin is selectively required for the mast cell-mediated allergic response, and it is is a novel player in Ca2+ mobilization and mast cell activation.\n\tWe propose that, upon depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores, drebrin aggregates into macromolecular complexes that induce cytoskeletal rearrangement.  In conjunction with other modulators of the cytoskeleton in these complexes, drebrin facilitates the juxtaposition of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) and the subsequent interaction of SOCE-associated components and insertion of store-operated Ca2+ channels into lipid raft domains of the PM.  Through this role, drebrin plays an integral part of the calcium signaling pathway in mast cells.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4479], "author_name_tesi": "Law, Mankit ", "last_name_ssi": "Law", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mankit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Avery August", "Avery August", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Robert Paulson", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Graham Hugh Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Avery August, Dissertation Advisor", "Avery August, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Member", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Drebrin", "BTP2", "mast cell", "calcium"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Supplier Selection under Product Breakdown Structure Constraints", "id": "14006", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7200", "abstract_tesi": "The defense industry, like many manufacturing industries, suffers from lengthy product lifecycles due to inflexible manufacturing facilities and high design variability. Each time a new product is proposed or a product is changed, the firm completes a design-build-test-redesign iteration, significantly adding to the product lifecycle of the final product. With the goal of developing a \u201cflexible, programmable, potentially distributed production capability capable of accommodating a wide range of systems and system variants with extremely rapid reconfiguration timescales,\u201d DARPA has proposed a foundry-style model of manufacturing, which minimizes design-build-test-redesign iterations (DARPA).\nIn such a model of manufacturing, a final product design is decomposed into a set of subsidiary products, which may represent components, subassemblies and processes required to manufacture the final product. As the final products often involve multiple components, subassemblies and processes, a product breakdown structure provides an effective means to organize the subsidiary products. The computation of certain performance criteria (e.g. makespan) may be influenced by the product breakdown structure, making it an important consideration. Supplier selection involves choosing a supplier, which in principle, represents a combination of resources (e.g. machines, personnel, tools, parts, etc.) to source each product. A foundry represents the full assignment of a supplier to each subsidiary product of the final product design. In essence, the foundry generation problem is a supplier selection problem under product breakdown structure constraints.\nNo research has considered the supplier selection problem under product breakdown structure constraints. The primary objective of this thesis is to formulate the supplier selection problem under product breakdown structure constraints and to contribute a solution procedure to solve the problem. The solution procedure proposed integrates all steps involved in the supplier selection problem and is capable of identifying a solution in the solution space close to the performance criteria goals set by the decision maker. The main mechanism of the solution procedure is a non-preemptive goal program, which facilitates supplier selection under product breakdown structure constraints by minimizing the summation of weighted deviations from performance criteria goals set by the decision maker.\nTo illustrate the solution procedure and non-preemptive goal program, a case study for sourcing the components, subassemblies and processes required to manufacture a ground vehicle is presented. The case study demonstrates the non-preemptive goal program\u2019s effectiveness at returning solutions near multiple (criteria) goals set by the decision maker. The solve time of the non-preemptive goal program was benchmarked against a random generation technique, which rapidly returns feasible solutions by randomly contracting suppliers to produce the products. A full factorial experiment with five replications was performed with performance criteria as the factors and solve time as the response for both the non-preemptive goal program and a random generation technique. The results of the full factorial were analyzed using three techniques: comparison of means, comparison of variance and analysis of variance.\nSeveral key findings arise from employing these techniques. First, the non-preemptive goal program has a significantly lower mean solve time than the random generation technique for all trials with multiple criteria goals. Second, the non-preemptive goal program is more robust (i.e. contains less solve time variability) than the random generation technique at solving the supplier selection problem with multiple criteria goals. Third, all performance criteria, with the exception of PPC, PPC/M, M/NR, IC/PPC/NR and IC/PPC/M/NR, appear to be significant predictors of the non-preemptive goal program\u2019s solve time. A regression model was presented, which can be used by the decision maker to approximate the solve time of the non-preemptive goal program. Finally, the random generation technique can return solutions that meet specified single criterion goals faster than the non-preemptive goal program, but is significantly slower when dealing with multiple criteria goals. The two techniques complement each other as the random generation technique is adept at rapidly returning feasible solutions while the non-preemptive goal program is adept at returning a solution nearest multiple criteria goals set by the decision maker (i.e. a solution with the minimum summation of weighted deviations from criteria goals set by the decision maker). Together, the techniques provide the decision maker with an effective approach to solving the supplier selection problem under product breakdown structure constraints. This thesis, for the first time in literature, shows that firms that effectively make supplier selection decisions while considering product breakdown structure constraints will have a better chance at surviving in the competitive, global marketplace.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7193], "author_name_tesi": "Lawit, Aitan Salamon", "last_name_ssi": "Lawit", "middle_name_ssi": "Salamon", "first_name_ssi": "Aitan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supplier Selection", "Product Breakdown Structure", "Non-preemptive Goal Programming"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Mercury Accumulation in Soils of Depressional Wetlands in Central Pennsylvania", "id": "22580", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9933", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mercury is an environmental pollutant of global concern, affecting ecosystems and human health.   Emissions of mercury to the atmosphere from fossil fuel combustion and other sources can travel for long distances in the air, affecting even remote locations. Pennsylvania is located downwind of many emissions sources, and receives inputs of mercury from atmospheric deposition. In this study, I explored the accumulation of mercury in depressional wetlands, otherwise known as vernal pools. These unique wetlands are widely recognized as important ecosystems because of the critical habitat they provide for plant and wildlife communities; in particular amphibians. Vernal pools are isolated from streams and rivers, and have a seasonally fluctuating water level, typically drying out for part of the year. Given that vernal pools have large inputs of water via precipitation yet do not have any stream discharge outflows, they are likely spots within the landscape to accumulate pollutants entering via atmospheric deposition.  \n\nSoil samples were collected from 12 Central Pennsylvania vernal pools, located in relatively undisturbed forested settings. Firstly, I measured the distribution of mercury with depth in the soil profile of each vernal pool. The highest mercury concentrations were found in the Oe organic soil horizon, with a majority of the mercury accumulated within the upper 15 cm of soil, suggesting relationships between mercury accumulation and organic carbon contents of the soil profiles. Secondly, I compared levels of mercury accumulation within the vernal pools to the uplands directly surrounding them. There were generally higher soil Hg concentrations within pools compared to their adjacent uplands, suggesting the importance of hydrology (i.e., the concentration of water in the concave pool settings) in affecting the distribution of mercury. Thirdly, I compared levels of mercury accumulation between the two dominant physiographic provinces of Central Pennsylvania, the Ridge and Valley and the Allegheny Plateau regions. Variations in mercury accumulation between provinces likely stem from differences in climate (e.g., more mercury accumulation in regions of higher precipitation) and differences in soils (e.g., more mercury accumulation in soils with higher organic carbon contents). Lastly, mercury concentrations measured in the vernal pools of Central Pennsylvania were compared to concentrations reported for other forested and wetland regions based on published studies, revealing that vernal pools likely act as Hg \u201chot spots\u201d within forested environments.

In particular, the reverberation of a room can influence a listener\u2019s overall preference to the musical passage. Reverberation has the potential to affect how the auditory and reward networks in the brain respond to auditory signals, but very little work has studied how room acoustics affects these responses even though much research has examined the effect of music. The overall goal of this doctoral work is to investigate the neural response to room acoustics stimuli using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Four studies were conducted with express objectives to: 1) substantiate fMRI as an appropriate tool to examine the reward response to room acoustics, 2) establish a concert hall stimulus set to effectively evoke a reward response, 3) investigate the auditory and reward responses to liked and disliked room acoustic conditions, and 4) further explore the auditory response to coherent and incoherent auditory information presented by room acoustics.\nThe first experiment, an fMRI pilot study, was first completed with five subjects to ascertain whether a reward response could be detected in the brain due to variations in room acoustic conditions. The individual- and group-level analyses identified that a reward response to preferred concert hall conditions may be significant with the inclusion of more subjects and a set of concert hall stimuli that more readily elicits listener preferences. \nThe second study, a conventional subjective listening test outside of the MRI scanner with 71 subjects, sought to establish specific musical motifs and room acoustic conditions to improve the stimulus selection process for neuroimaging experiments. Within that objective, the conventional listening study also examined the effect of participant listening expertise on preference to identify suitable candidates for recruitment based on the ability to discriminate between stimuli and the reliability of their preference ratings of reverberant stimuli. A k-means clustering analysis revealed that five groups exhibited starkly different preferences, prompting the selection of individualized stimulus sets for MRI experiments and the recruitment of only expert listeners, defined as musicians. \nThe third and fourth experiments evaluated the auditory and reward responses to the room acoustics stimuli with fMRI. In the third study, auralizations of each individual\u2019s most liked and most disliked room acoustics conditions as well as anechoic musical motifs were presented to 18 participants in an MRI scanner. The results showed that the left and right primary auditory cortices (PAC) activated more so for clearer, simpler stimuli than for the more reverberant, complex stimuli. Specifically, the superior temporal gyri (STG) and Heschl\u2019s Gyri (HG) exhibited higher activations in the presence of the anechoic musical motifs (no room acoustics effects) than the most-liked and most-disliked stimuli. Furthermore, a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of the caudate nucleus and NAcc revealed significant activations in the contrast of the most-liked and most-disliked stimuli as well as the contrast between the most-liked and anechoic stimuli, which were also disliked by the participants. These activations decisively indicated that room acoustics can evoke a reward response.\nThe fourth study aimed to narrow down the cause of the auditory cortex sensitivity to reverberation, defined as incoherent acoustic information, by presenting all 16 subjects with the same room conditions. The experiment also examined the auditory cortical response to coherent acoustic harmonic content by contrasting the neural responses to the same melody comprised of pure sine tones and trumpet tones, respectively. The results showed that only the presence of reverberation and not the level of the incoherent acoustic information degraded the response of the auditory cortex. Conversely, the presence of coherent harmonic information bolstered the response of the auditory cortex. Since there were no significant interaction effects between the presence of coherent and incoherent acoustic information, these two neural mechanisms were determined to be independent.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16598], "author_name_tesi": "Lawless, Martin Stephen", "last_name_ssi": "Lawless", "middle_name_ssi": "Stephen", "first_name_ssi": "Martin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle Celine Vigeant", "Michelle Celine Vigeant", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "Daniel Allen Russell", "Nanyin Zhang", "Pamela Marie Cole", "Charles Limb"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle Celine Vigeant, Dissertation Advisor", "Michelle Celine Vigeant, Committee Chair", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member", "Daniel Allen Russell, Committee Member", "Nanyin Zhang, Outside Member", "Pamela Marie Cole, Outside Member", "Charles Limb, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["room acoustics", "functional neuroimaging", "music", "concert hall", "reverberation", "psychoacoustics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL METHODOLOGY TO DETERMINE THE FUNCTIONAL ROLE OF DISORDER IN THE FCP1/RAP74 BINDING INTERACTION", "id": "19334", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9314", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Modern structural biology currently holds the paradigm that structure determines function. Intrinsically disordered proteins are a unique class of proteins that forces the structure/function paradigm to be expanded. IDPs, unlike globular proteins, have no unique secondary or tertiary structure and yet carry out vital biological functions such as transcription, translation, and cellular signal transduction. The unique structural properties associated with IDPs are due to a sequence bias towards charged, hydrophilic amino acids and away from hydrophobic amino acids. Given of this bias, there are little to no hydrophobic amino acids to be removed from the protein/solvent interface to form a hydrophobic core, which is the primary motivation for protein folding. However, IDPs are known to undergo a cooperative folding upon binding process during protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions. Here we will study FCP1, which is one such IDP that gains helical structure upon its interaction with RAP74, a globular protein.\nTFIIF-associating RNA Polymerase II C-terminal domain phosphatase (FCP1) is an IDP that plays a vital role in the RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription cycle. During the elongation cycle of transcription the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII becomes increasingly phosphorylated and until it becomes dephosphorylated RNAPII cannot undergo another round of transcription. Interaction with the winged helix domain of RAP74, a subdomain of TFIIF, brings FCP1 into contact with CTD so that it may carry out this dephosphorylation. The residues that compose the binding interface of FCP1 have been shown in the literature to adopt an \u03b1-helical structure while in complex with RAP74. However, there is little information regarding the structure and dynamics of FCP1 in its disordered unbound state and what role that disorder plays in the overall binding mechanism. \n13C-direct detected NMR provides an alternative to traditional 1H-detected NMR for the study of IDP structure and dynamics. Due to the low sequence complexity known for IDPs and the low chemical shift dispersion associated with the 1H nucleus, the NMR spectra of IDPs suffer from severe overlap. This property has prevented many IDPs from being structurally and dynamically characterized by NMR. 13C-direct detected NMR, on the other hand, has been shown by our lab and others to have a large chemical shift dispersion. Using 13C direct-detected NMR methods our lab has been able to acquire full chemical shift assignment FCP1 in the unbound state. Here we will show that even in the apo-state of FCP1, the residues that lie within the RAP74 binding interface show nascent helical structure through CD and recently developed 13C-direct detected NMR.  We will also show that FCP1 remains disordered while in 30% Dextran and HeLa cell extract, representing a cellular environment. Given the highly flexible nature of FCP1 in its disordered state, it is necessary to be able to characterize the local dynamic information of FCP1. We will show through the development of novel 13C-direct detected experiments CON(T1)-IPAP and CON(T2)-IPAP accurate T1 and T2 relaxation times can be measured for FCP1 in both the apo and holo-state. After analysis of the relaxation data, only the residues of FCP1 in the RAP74 binding region experience a change in dynamics. Additional 15N spin relaxation of RAP74, studied in parallel to FCP1, show that RAP74 experiences only a limited amount of ordering upon association with FCP1. In order to determine what role disorder plays in the binding interaction, the FCP1/RAP74 binding interaction was characterized by ITC.\nITC is a powerful method that allows one to determine the thermodynamic parameters that govern a binding interaction. Here we will show that the FCP1/RAP74 binding interaction is dominated by the removal of hydrophobic surface from solvent, characterized by the large, negative \u0394CP associated with complex formation. Additionally, regardless of the entropic penalty associated with FCP1 acquiring structure, the overall interaction is entropically favorable. We will also show through the use of osmolytes to stabilize secondary structure, that pre-formed helical structure in the binding region of FCP1 has a large effect on the overall binding interaction.\nTo fully understand the behavior of IDPs in solution one must be able to generate a structure. However, IDPs do not exist as a statically folded globular domain, but, instead, exist as an ensemble of rapidly interconverting conformers. The experimental data reported is only reflective of the ensemble average of FCP1 and not of any of the individual conformers that make up its ensemble structure. So, ensemble modeling then becomes the preferred approach to structurally characterize the FCP1 ensemble. we will show that through a combination of SAXS and the ensemble modeling software EOM, flexible-meccano, and ENSEMBLE that the overall ensemble structure is dominated by the by completely disordered N-terminus and that a random coil model, with a locally fixed structural propensity is sufficient to describe it.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9118], "author_name_tesi": "Lawrence, Chad William", "last_name_ssi": "Lawrence", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Chad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott A Showalter", "Mary Beth Williams", "Carsten Krebs", "John H Golbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott A Showalter, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Beth Williams, Committee Member", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FCP1", "Intrinsically Disordered Proteins", "IDP", "NMR", "13C-direct detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Self-Assembly and Chemical Patterning on Germanium(100)\n", "id": "11097", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2530", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\nThe focus on faster, smaller, and more diverse electronic devices has prompted research into new materials.  The search is on for semiconductor substrates with superior electronic capabilities.  Germanium has emerged as a semiconductor material capable of producing desired performance.  Current methods of thin-film deposition, once intended for applications involving alternative substrates, must be altered to improve upon germanium\u2019s inherently unstable surface.  This thesis investigates the adolescent mechanism of self-assembly and chemical patterning on Ge(100).  Our preliminary research offers insight into applicable techniques for depositing stabilizing and chemically functionalized, patterned adsorbate layers on germanium. It is our belief that the examination of sample preparation will lead to reproducible and cost-efficient techniques for use in industry.  This dissertation will address possible candidates for successful monolayer deposition on germanium, and the appearance of and possible solutions to additional limitations.  \nGermanium suffers from an inherently unstable surface, a result of its native oxide layer.  Until this time, instability has limited germanium\u2019s capacity for integration into electronic devices.  Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) offer a method for controlling interfacial properties, through formation of highly ordered, single-molecule thick structures on surfaces, transferring their chemical attributes to the interface.  Successful deposition of SAMs on germanium can address its intrinsic limitations.  Through manipulation of SAM deposition techniques, used primarily for patterning alkanethiols on gold, formation of high-quality monolayers becomes possible, improving the surface stability of germanium.  \nHigh-dielectric materials, due to their ability to resist leakage resulting from electron tunneling, are necessary for producing functional components of nanoscale dimensions.  These materials may be limited in their ability to interact with relevant substrates, making device fabrication difficult. Chemical patterning techniques exhibit the ability to place an array of species selectively, otherwise limited by surface diffusion, bonding capacity, etc., onto semiconductor surfaces.

The plastic nuggets, called Plastofuel\u2122, were 3.8 cm (1.5 in) wide, 3.8 cm (1.5 in) high, and were cut to a length of 5.1 cm (2 in).  \n    All aspects of machine operation, with the exception of feedstock loading, were automated and controlled by an onboard microprocessor.  The machine was equipped with two data loggers to collect hydraulic system metrics and electrical energy usage.  Component positions, electric power consumption, and hydraulic system pressure were recorded and converted to total energy consumption for all production runs.\n    Energy content of the Plastofuel\u2122 formed using clean household plastic and unused mulch film was 45.5 MJ/kg (19500 BTU/lb).  Plastofuel\u2122 formed with used mulch film and used plastic pots and trays had an energy content of 38.8 MJ/kg (16700 BTU/lb).  The average density of the individual PlastofuelTM nuggets formed was 708 kg/m3 (44.1 lb/ft3).  The bulk density of PlastofuelTM was 378 kg/m3 (23.6 lb/ft3).\n    An energy ratio was determined by dividing the combined hydraulic and electric energy used for PlastofuelTM formation into the potential energy stored in all plastic nuggets formed for a single test run.  The highest energy ratio (Eout/Ein) from all test runs was 47.  During this test run, the electrical system consumed 30% of the total input energy to melt the PlastofuelTM perimeter, and the hydraulic system consumed 70% of the total input energy to process the plastic feedstock.  The maximum Plastofuel\u2122 production rate achieved with the machine was 27.6 kg/hr (61 lbs/hr).  \n    A mathematical model was derived to predict a relationship between the die surface temperature, the plastic residence time in the die, and melt depth achieved around the PlastofuelTM exterior.  The 99% confidence interval on the mean difference between actual and predicted melt depth was -0.08 mm (-0.003 in) to 0.1 mm (0.004 in) (P = 0.8). \n    Twelve additional test runs were run to isolate the effect of temperature and residence time on melt depth.  Both factors significantly affected (P < 0.05) melt depth.  Increasing die residence time with a fixed temperature was shown to increase melt depth, and increasing die temperature with a fixed residence time was shown to increase melt depth.\n    A theoretical analysis of electrical energy used to heat the unmelted interior of each nugget was performed and indicated that 18% of the total electrical energy consumed by the machine was used to heat the nugget interior.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4152], "author_name_tesi": "Lawrence, Matthew Jack", "last_name_ssi": "Lawrence", "middle_name_ssi": "Jack", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Elvin Buffington", "Dennis Buckmaster", "James William Hilton", "William James Lamont Jr.", "Ronald Hedden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Elvin Buffington, Committee Chair", "Dennis Buckmaster, Committee Chair", "James William Hilton, Committee Member", "William James Lamont Jr., Committee Member", "Ronald Hedden, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy recovery", "plastics", "plasticulture", "waste to energy"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Sassy Cows and Magical Juju: Representations of Race and Ethnicity on Three Nicktoons Programs", "id": "16052", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7831", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis critiques programming on the children\u2019s media channel Nicktoons for patterns of racial representation -- including the presence of stereotyping -- in characters.

The craniofacial skeleton is a complex structure in which anatomical variation among species is related to changes in functions as diverse as communication, diet, defense, olfaction, intelligence, vision, posture, and locomotion.  Adaptive changes to the skull are well documented in the fossil record.  However, until the molecular factors underlying these changes are identified, our understanding of craniofacial evolution is limited.  The goal of this dissertation is to use comparative genomics methods to improve current understanding of the molecular underpinnings of craniofacial growth and development.\nTo examine how craniofacially affecting genes have changed over phylogenetic time, I use whole-genome sequence alignments of human, chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, and dog to estimate rates of amino acid change in orthologous craniofacial genes across approximately 75 million years of evolution.  As a set, these craniofacially affecting genes show strong evidence for unusual evolutionary constraint, with significantly fewer amino acid changes than other genes used as a comparison set.  Amino acid sites in individual craniofacial genes that have a high probability of having undergone adaptive evolution across these five lineages tend to be located on the surface, or most solvent accessible, regions of a protein.  Known human disease-associated mutations are found at the most highly constrained sites, and most amino acid changes associated with dysmorphogenesis are radical with respect to chemical property.  \nWhile change in protein coding sequence undoubtedly affects craniofacial growth and development, it has long been speculated that adaptive changes in gene regulation underlie many of the phenotypic differences between humans and other primates.  Thus identification of non-protein coding regions bearing the signature of either adaptive or constrained selection is an important step in understanding the evolutionary history of humans and of other species.  I have modified the standard McDonald-Kreitman test (1991) to examine molecular evolution in non-protein coding regions of human DNA, using repeat sequences ancestral to catarrhine primates to represent neutrally evolving sequence.  \nResults of this test (called the MKAR test) are used to find non-protein coding regions throughout the human genome that are candidate targets of natural selection over the past 23Myr (comparisons with macaque) or 6Myr (comparisons with chimpanzee) of primate evolution.  These are potentially functional sequences, some of which may be regulatory regions.  Non-neutral MKAR regions show several intriguing associations.  For example, segmental duplications are highly enriched in MKAR regions with footprints of adaptive non-protein coding evolution.  Additionally, non-neutral MKAR regions show little overlap when divergence is determined with chimpanzee versus macaque, reflecting different adaptive histories among these lineages, as well as highlighting the episodic nature of natural selection.  Follow-up of the candidate MKAR regions in the vicinity of craniofacially affecting genes promises to be a fruitful area of further investigation.  \nIn collaboration with the Genomics of Cranial Morphology Project, I have identified human regions homologous to the genomic regions for a group of pedigreed and genotyped baboons, Papio hamadryas, that significantly correspond to landmarked craniofacial distances.  These regions are interrogated for genes demonstrated to affect craniofacial growth and development in model animal, human association, and /or familial linkage studies.  These candidate craniofacially affecting genes are then examined for both coding and noncoding DNA sequence changes, using available multi-species genomic alignments and the MKAR test.  Additionally, genes within 25kb of non-neutral MKAR regions are examined for expression in the head.  This project uniquely combines comparative genomic data with phenotypic observations of a non-traditional model organism highly relevant to human biology. \nIn this dissertation, I show how modern genomic and bioinformatics approaches, combined with experimental results, can begin to fill a gap in our understanding of craniofacial genetic mechanisms and their evolution.  This work highlights the predictive power of comparative genomics and demonstrates the utility of an interdisciplinary approach to examining DNA sequence affecting a highly complex and evolutionarily critical structure.  Furthermore, while highlighting genomic regions associated with craniofacial phenotypes that may have been targets of selection in primate evolution, this dissertation also highlights the many challenges of deciphering genotype \u2013 phenotype relationships.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2155], "author_name_tesi": "Lawson, Heather Alane", "last_name_ssi": "Lawson", "middle_name_ssi": "Alane", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Monrad Weiss", "Anton Nekrutenko", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Webb Colby Miller", "Joan Therese Richtsmeier", "Alan Walker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Monrad Weiss, Committee Chair", "Anton Nekrutenko, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Member", "Joan Therese Richtsmeier, Committee Member", "Alan Walker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["genomics", "primate", "molecular evolution", "craniofacial", "genotype", "phenotype"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Gendered occupational aspirations and initial occupational choices: The role of parents and children's attributes during late childhood", "id": "22357", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10153", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite recent gains made by women in the U.S. labor market, gendered occupational segregation continues to be prevalent not only in the United States (Hegewisch, Liepmann, Hayes, & Hartmann, 2010), but across the world (Anker, 1998). Gendered occupational segregation has negative implications at the individual, employer, and societal levels. The present dissertation aimed to better understand the development and correlates of gendered occupational aspirations and initial occupational choices, including the role of children and parents\u2019 attributes. The dissertation consists of three interrelated papers with the following goals: (1) To examine the consistency between gendered occupational aspirations in late childhood, adolescence, and initial occupational choices in young adulthood (including the role of children\u2019s attributes in occupational aspirations and initial occupational choices); (2) To test whether parents\u2019 attitudes and behaviors, measured when their children were in late childhood, predicted the gender typicality of occupations acquired in young adulthood; and (3) To review past literature examining parent and child occupational consistency, propose mechanisms that may account for this consistency (including the consistency in the gender typicality of parents and children\u2019s occupations), and to make recommendations for future research. Results of the first paper suggested that for boys, gendered occupational aspirations in late childhood and adolescence were associated with occupational choices acquired in young adulthood. In contrast, girls desired less sex-typed occupations than they obtained in young adulthood. Sex-typed attributes in late childhood\u2014including attitudes toward women\u2019s roles, personal qualities, interests, and skills\u2014predicted the gender typicality of occupational aspirations in late childhood and/or adolescence, but not initial occupational choices. Results of the second paper indicated that socialization experiences in late childhood \u2013 namely mothers\u2019 attitudes towards women\u2019s roles and mothers and fathers\u2019 time spent with children \u2013 were associated with the gender typicality of initial occupations acquired 15 years later in young adulthood. However, many of the findings were moderated by child\u2019s gender. Overall, the gender typicality of occupational aspirations and initial occupational choices were related to both children and parents\u2019 attributes reported during late childhood, suggesting that the gendered distribution of the labor force may be, at least in part, the result of early socialization practices.

The dog and other macrosmatic (keen-scented) mammals have evolved a complex nasal anatomy that facilitates the efficient aerodynamic sampling of inspired odorant molecules. Here, airflow and odorant transport patterns in the canine nasal cavity are studied through a set of flow visualization experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations.\n\nAn anatomically-correct experimental model of the canine nasal cavity, based on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans, was designed and fabricated using a rapid prototyping technique. Dye-injection flow visualization experiments were performed using this model to characterize the canine's internal nasal airflow patterns. The results from these experiments illustrated the complex three dimensional flow patterns throughout the nasal cavity. The experimental results also confirmed the existence of distinct olfactory and respiratory airflow paths and were used to study the transition between laminar and turbulent flow domains. Moreover, these experiments were used to both qualitatively and quantitatively validate previous and current CFD simulations of canine nasal airflow.\n\nSteady and unsteady CFD simulations of odorant transport and deposition in the nasal cavity were performed. The simulations modeled the transport of odorant from the external environment, through the nasal airways, across the olfactory mucus layer, and to ORNs sites. Steady simulations were performed to study the relationship between odorant solubility and odorant deposition patterns (i.e. odorant flux patterns) across the canine's olfactory region. Highly-soluble odorants were deposited mainly along the entrance to the olfactory region. Moderately-soluble and insoluble odorant fluxes to the olfactory epithelium are significantly lower than those for highly-soluble odorants. However, these less soluble odorants are deposited more uniformly across the olfactory epithelium. The canine's nose apparently utilizes odorant absorption over a large surface area to compensate for the lower absorption rate of insoluble odorants. \n\nPhysiologically-realistic sniffing was simulated to examine the effects of unsteady airflow on odorant transport. The unsteady simulations showed that the airflow is unidirectional in the olfactory region during inspiration and stagnant on expiration. Unsteady odorant transport patterns for highly-soluble and moderately soluble odorants were observed to become temporally fully-developed after a single sniff. Accordingly, the steady and unsteady odorant deposition patterns are qualitatively similar for these odorants. Insoluble odorant transport and deposition patterns however continue to develop over the course of many sniff cycles.\n\nThis work shows that the canine has evolved a complex nasal anatomy that creates odorant-specific deposition patterns. These patterns allow the canine's nose to separate the components of a complex scent, as in chromatography, in order to possibly improve neurological olfactory pattern recognition. The lessons learned on efficient aerodynamic sampling techniques are also used to suggest biomimetic design principles to improve artificial olfaction devices.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4153], "author_name_tesi": "Lawson, Michael J", "last_name_ssi": "Lawson", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Stuart Settles", "Gary Stuart Settles", "Eric Paterson", "Robert Francis Kunz", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Stuart Settles, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary Stuart Settles, Committee Chair", "Eric Paterson, Committee Chair", "Robert Francis Kunz, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["computational fluid dynamics (CFD)", "flow visualization", "canine olfaction"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Simulations of Multi-Phase Particle Deposition on Film-Cooled Turbine Sections\n", "id": "11627", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5486", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-01-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The demand for clean, efficient energy has driven the motivation for improving the performance standards for gas turbines.  Increasing the combustion temperature is one way to achieve the best possible performance from a gas turbine.  One problem associated with increased combustion temperatures is that impurities ingested in the fuel and air become more prone to deposition with an increase in turbine inlet temperature.  Deposition on aero-engine and land based turbine components caused by particle ingestion can impair turbine cooling methods and lead to reduced component life.  It is necessary to understand the extent to which particle deposition affects turbine cooling in regions where heat transfer from the hot gases to the cooled turbine components is most critical.\nFor this study, a novel approach was developed to dynamically simulate particle deposition on turbine component models such that the effects of deposition on film-cooling were quantified.  To simulate both solid and molten particulate matter in the hot gas path, low melting temperature wax was injected into the mainstream gas path of a low speed wind tunnel used to test film-cooling effectiveness on turbine cascade models.  Results showed deposition could reduce film-cooling effectiveness by as much as 30% depending on cooling condition, particle phase, and location of cooling holes.  Cooling effectiveness after deposition decreased with an increase in blowing ratio on the airfoil pressure side and leading edge.  For all endwall cooling configurations tested, effectiveness after deposition increased with an increase in blowing ratio.  \nExperiments were also conducted to determine if film-cooling geometries could be modified to mitigate the negative effects of deposition.  Various configurations were tested and results showed that embedding cooling rows in transverse trenches could reduce the negative impact of deposition on cooling effectiveness.  With the use of trenches, the maximum effectiveness reduction caused by deposition was 15% as compared to 30% with no geometric modification.  Deposition was simulated in a film-cooled turbine cascade model with and without endwall contouring.  Experimental results showed that strategic placement of cooling holes on a contoured endwall could prevent deposition around film-cooling holes and thus mitigate the negative effects of deposition on cooling-effectiveness.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5477], "author_name_tesi": "Lawson, Seth A", "last_name_ssi": "Lawson", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Seth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole", "Cengiz Camci", "Karen Ann Thole", "Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Savas Yavuzkurt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole, Dissertation Advisor", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Chair", "Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adiabatic effectiveness", "heat transfer", "gas turbine", "particle deposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ENCAPSULATING FATTY ACID ESTERS OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN STARCH\n", "id": "10554", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6369", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Interest in the use of many bioactive compounds in foods is growing in large part because of the apparent health benefits of these molecules.  However, many of these compounds can be easily degraded during processing, storage, or their passage through the gastrointestinal tract before reaching the target site.  In addition, they can be bitter, acrid, or astringent, which may negatively affect the sensory properties of the product.  Encapsulation of these molecules may increase their stability during processing, storage, and in the gastrointestinal tract, while providing controlled release properties.\n\nThe ability of amylose to form inclusion complexes and spherulites while entrapping certain compounds has been suggested as a potential method for encapsulation of certain molecules.  However, complex formation and spherulitic crystallization are greatly affected by the type of inclusion molecules, type of starch, and processing conditions.  The objectives of the present investigation were to: a) study the effect of amylose, amylopectin, and intermediate material on spherulite formation and its microstructure; b) investigate the formation of amylose and high amylose starch inclusion complexes with ascorbyl palmitate, retinyl palmitate, and phytosterol esters; c) evaluate the ability of spherulites to form in the presence of fatty acid esters and to entrap ascorbyl palmitate, retinyl palmitate, and phytosterol esters; and d) evaluate the effect of processing conditions on spherulite formation and fatty acid ester entrapment.\n\nHigher ratios of linear to branched molecules resulted in the formation of more and rounder spherulites with higher heat stability.  In addition to the presence of branches, it appears that spherulitic crystallization is also affected by other factors, such as degree of branching, chain length, and chain length distribution.\n\nAmylose and Hylon VII starch formed inclusion complexes with fatty acid esters of ascorbic acid, retinol, or phytosterols.  However, only retinyl palmitate formed a complex with amylopectin.  In general, ascorbyl palmitate resulted in the highest complexation, followed by retinyl palmitate and phytosterol ester.  The presence of native lipids in Hylon VII starch did not inhibit complex formation.  On the contrary, native lipids appear to increase the complexation yield and thermal stability of the starch-fatty acid ester inclusion complexes, possibly due to the formation of ternary complexes.\n\nFrom the three fatty acid esters studied, only ascorbyl palmitate was entrapped in starch spherulites.  Various structures including round spherulites, various sizes of torus-shape spherulites, non-spherulitic birefringent and non-birefringent particles, \u201cballoon\u201d morphologies, and gel-like material were formed depending on processing conditions.  However, only the torus-shape spherulites, and some non-spherulitic birefringent and non-birefringent particles showed ascorbyl palmitate entrapment.  The % yield of the precipitate increased with higher % of added Hylon VII, and decreased with higher heating temperature and faster cooling rates.  The amount of entrapped ascorbyl palmitate in the starch precipitate seems to be governed by the amount of this compound added during processing.\n\nThis study showed that starch can form inclusion complexes with fatty acid esters which may be used for the delivery of certain bioactive molecules.  In addition, encapsulation of fatty acid esters in starch spherulites may be a good potential delivery system for water soluble bioactive molecules.  However, further research is necessary to gain a better understanding of the type of molecules that can be entrapped in starch spherulites, and the factors affecting spherulitic crystallization and bioactive compound entrapment.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6369], "author_name_tesi": "Lay Ma, Ursula Vanesa", "last_name_ssi": "Lay Ma", "middle_name_ssi": "Vanesa", "first_name_ssi": "Ursula", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gregory Ziegler & John Floros", "Gregory Ray Ziegler", "John D Floros", "Joshua D Lambert", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gregory Ziegler & John Floros, Dissertation Advisor", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Committee Chair", "John D Floros, Committee Chair", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["encapsulation", "inclusion complex", "spherulite", "starch", "fatty acid esters", "bioactive compounds"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Association Leisure Boredom with Risky Sexual Debut During Adolescence", "id": "15248eml5482", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15248", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Early sexual debut and accompanying risky sexual behaviors (e.g., casual sex, substance use, transactional sex, and condom non-use) are associated with increased risk of HIV transmission, unintended pregnancy, and risk taking in future sexual events.

In turn, the nanofibers had a higher sensitivity to glucose than the films and also retained a larger percentage of that sensitivity over time.  Finally, the nanofibers showed less of a loss in charge storage capacity over time, which was further enhanced by the use of lower polarization potentials.  These biosensors serve as a proof of concept such sensor design in the detection of other neurochemicals and neurotransmitters.  \n      \nThe second part of this research was the fabrication and characterization of conductive hydrogel nanofibers using a method that does not require a hard metal substrate.  Nanofibers were fabricated from a blend of varying amounts of conducting polymer nanoparticles and hydrogel.  The morphology, swelling ratio, and electrical impedance of such nanofibers were measured and compared to films of similar material.  Increasing amounts of conducting polymer nanoparticles led to reduced swelling ratios and larger reductions in impedance.  Additionally, the film and nanofiber morphologies had distinctly different impedance specta in the low frequency ranges.  Such conductive hydrogel nanofibers could find future application in drug delivery or neural tissue engineering.        \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9867], "author_name_tesi": "Layton, Kelly Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Layton", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Kelly", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mohammad Reza Abidian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mohammad Reza Abidian, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Poly(3", "4-ethylene dioxythiophene)", "Nanofibers", "Conducting Polymers", "Biomaterials", "Neural Interfaces", "Glucose Detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Applications of Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Study Brain Pathology and Function \n", "id": "6452", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3190", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Magnetic resonance imaging utilizes magnetic fields to non-invasively manipulate atomic nuclei to allow creation of images from regions within a body otherwise obscured from sight.  Here we use the power of magnetic resonance imaging to gain new insights into perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (H/I), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children, adult H/I, the third leading cause of mortality and leading cause of disability in adults and visceral pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), afflicting an estimated 10-22% of adults.  \n\tTo complete part of this work, it was necessary to develop a novel hexagonal coil for simultaneous imaging of multiple small animals.  The hexagonal coil design is based on a coaxial cavity, and utilizes the magnetic field formed between two coaxial conductors with hexagonal cross-sections.  The construction scheme of the coil, simple methods for tuning and matching, the neonatal animal holder, and the anesthesia manifold for equal delivery of anesthetics are described.  The design is intended for in vivo animal studies, and in the case of drug studies it allows 3 control and 3 treated animals to undergo identical experimental conditions.  In vivo spin echo images of six 7-days old rat pups acquired simultaneously demonstrate uncompromised signal-to-noise ratio required for microimaging.  The described hexagonal coil and MR imaging was used to study the evolution of brain injury following hypoxia-ischemia (H/I) in the neonatal rat before and after a pharmacological interventions.  We tested the hypothesis that repetitive administration of aminoguanidine (inducible nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) and minocycline (interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) converting enzyme, iNOS inhibitor, p38 kinase inhibitor, calcium chelator and caspase 3) will provide significant neuroprotection, when administer following hypoxia-ischemia.. The volume of the hyperintense diffusion weighted (DW) signal (cytotoxic edema) before administration of the drug was compared to the T2-weighted hyperintense signal (vasogenic edema) volume at 7 days following the recovery from H/I.  A significantly reduced hyperintense signal volume was observed on T2-weighted images compared to initial hyperintense signal volume on DW images (p<0.0005) for both drug-treated and control (saline and PBS injected) animals.  When the amount of hyperintense signal reduction was compared among different treatment groups the minocycline had tendency toward maximal hyperintense signal reduction, although this tendency was not statistically significant.  The neuroprotective mechanism of minocycline is hypothesized to be due to its anti-inflammatory effects and inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and independent of its antimicrobial actions.\n To further investigate the role of inflammation in neurodegeneration following hypoxia-ischemia, we focused on IL-1 signaling in the adult mouse model.  Signaling through the IL-1 type 1 receptor (IL-1R1) is necessary for microglial activation and based on previous studies, which have implicated microglia as effectors of neurodegeneration, we hypothesized that inactivating the IL-1R1 would decrease the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines caused by a hypoxic-ischemic insult.  We further hypothesize that abrogated IL-1R1 signaling will result in failure to recruit macrophages, resulting in lower levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and consequently decreased free radical damage following H/I.  Magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine infarct size post H/I in wild type (WT) and IL-1R1 null mice.  The IL-1R1 null mice had significantly reduced infarct size at 24 h and 48 h post HI.  The induction of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines was significantly reduced in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the IL-1R1 null mice compared to wild-type mice at 72 h following H/I.  Levels of iNOS protein and iNOS mRNA were severely curtailed in the IL-1R1 null mice.  The induction of glutamate aspartate transporter GLAST at 48 h following H/I, was similar for both mice types, indicating independence of IL-1R1 signaling. The sensory motor function of IL-1R1 null mice was normal at one month following H/I.  The present findings incriminate the IL-1R1 as a master pro-inflammatory cytokine receptor, and suggest that IL-1R1 signaling contribute to neurodegeneration following mild H/I via recruitment of inflammatory cells, as well as iNOS mediated free radical damage.  In conclusion we demonstrate that reducing the inflammation consequent to a mild hypoxic/ischemic insult will prevent brain damage and preserve neurological function. \nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was applied to study brain areas activated in response to the colorectal distention (CRD) in adult anesthetized rats.  The aim of the study was to determine and compare the areas of brain activated in response to the noxious visceral stimuli using fMRI and c-Fos protein expression.  For the fMRI study, visceral pain was simulated with rectal balloon inflated to different pressures (40, 60 and 80 mm Hg) in a phasic manner: 90 s deflation period followed by 30 s inflation period for 16 min.  The anesthetized rats underwent phasic colorectal distention, synchronized with the acquisition of fMRI images.  For c-Fos experiments the stimulus was a rectal balloon distended to 80 mm Hg in a phasic manner with 30 s inflation and 90 s deflation, for 2 h.  fMRI imaging revealed activation in the amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, and trigeminal nucleus. In a smaller number of animals, activation was also observed in the nucleus of the solitary tract, parabrachial nucleus, superior colliculus, striatum and the insular, piriform, retrosplenial, sensory association, and perirhinal cortices.  Significant increases in c-Fos expression compared to control animals, (p=0.05), was observed in the pontine parabrachial nucleus and the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus.  The correlation of increased fMRI signal and c-Fos expression indicates involvement of the spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid pathway in response to visceral nociception.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3178], "author_name_tesi": "Lazovic, Jelena ", "last_name_ssi": "Lazovic", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jelena", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Smith", "Teresa L Wood", "Timothy John Mosher", "Nadine B Smith", "Ann Ouyang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Smith, Committee Chair", "Teresa L Wood, Committee Member", "Timothy John Mosher, Committee Member", "Nadine B Smith, Committee Member", "Ann Ouyang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["iNOS", "cytokines", "microglia", "inflammation", "IL-1R1", "IL-1", "hypoxia-ischemia", "RF coil", "MRI", "c-Fos", "visceral pain", "colonic distention"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "A population and quantitative genetic analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster antibacterial immune response", "id": "6020", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "763", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-09-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Insects respond to microbial infection with a potent generalized immune response that has cellular and humoral components.  Recognition of invariant microbial compounds triggers both phagocytosis of the invading microorganism and the synthesis of extracellularly circulated antibiotic peptides.  This is an evolutionarily ancient and conserved approach to immunity, and many of the proteins involved have homologs in vertebrate innate immune systems.  In this thesis, I consider population-level variability in Drosophila melanogaster antibacterial immune responses from three distinct, but related,  perspectives.  In the most focused experiments, I survey polymorphism in genes encoding inducible antibacterial peptides in a North American D. melanogaster population sample.  I find evidence for recurrent gene conversion between tandemly repeated Attacin genes and an apparent excess of non-conservative amino acid polymorphism in processed peptide domains.  Patterns of nucleotide polymorphism suggest that natural selection and demographic history have shaped the evolution of peptide genes as a functional class.  In a more inclusive approach, I measure phenotypic variation in the ability suppress pathogenic infection among flies sampled from the same North American population.  I then employ candidate gene based association tests to identify naturally occurring alleles of 13 genes that contribute to phenotypic variability in immunocompetence.  The strongest associations are found in pathogen recognition genes, with many associations being sex-limited or affected by circadian day.  In the most ecological study, I examine the frequency of bacterial infection in the sampled D. melanogaster population in both September and October of 1998 and 2001, culturing and identifying isolated pathogens.  I find that ascertained infection declines between early and late fall, and identify 18 bacterial species in 15 genera as potential Drosophila pathogens.  I show that several of the isolates can induce Drosophila mortality and a few persist in the hemolymph for days after artificial infection. As a whole, this thesis presents a comprehensive look at natural variation in the antibacterial immune responses of D. melanogaster, addressing several fundamental questions about variability in such systems and raising topics for further research.

The probability of re-default among loans modified by the former is over 6.9 percentage point lower than the latter. Further tests show that the differences in modification success likely come from the soft information acquired during the origination process. These findings suggest that the loss of soft information in mortgage securitization can impose a substantial cost on mortgage servicing, which raises important policy implications for government regulations in this market.\nThe second essay examines the effect of peer firm sentiment on firm investment decisions using data from public homebuilders in the U.S. over 2003Q1-2016Q3. Peer sentiment is measured by the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index, derived from a monthly survey of homebuilders\u2019 perceptions about the conditions of the single-family housing market. I find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the peer sentiment index induces homebuilders to increase their land inventory by 8.4%-12.6%. In addition, big builders are just as prone to peer sentiment as small firms. Consistent with the catering theory, homebuilders held by more short term investors are more likely to follow their peers than those held mainly by institutional shareholders. Interestingly, firms that overbuild compared to their peers have lower stock returns in the next quarter while underbuilding is rewarded with higher stock prices, but this effect decreases as the magnitude of underbuilding increases.\nFinally, the third essay investigates the effect of separating real estate from the Financials sector in the Global Industry Classification Standard. Since Sep 1, 2016, real estate became an independent sector instead of being an industry group under the Financials sector together with banks and insurance.

The reduction in their connection occurred first at announcement and again at implementation. In addition, REIT returns became as much as 60% less volatile than before.

However, blend systems suffer from morphological instability and disorder near metal contacts which hamper device performance and lifetime. We demonstrate potential strategies to improve performance of organic photovoltaics via contact doping with polymer electrolytes and controlling the active layer morphology using fully conjugated block copolymers. \nWe demonstrated that polymer acids can act as p-type dopants near electrode interfaces for active layers containing poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT). By varying the pendant acidic groups across different backbones, we find the effectiveness of doping the conjugated polymer at the interface depends on the strength of the pendant acid group with stronger acid moieties being capable of creating more carriers in the doped system. Nevertheless, strong pendant acid groups also cause phase separation between dopants and conjugated polymers, thus hindering the doping effectiveness. The overall doping efficacy near electrodes therefore depends on the interplay between the strength of pendant acid groups and miscibility between polymeric dopants and conjugated polymers. \nTo better control the active layer morphology and address morphological instability problem, we employed fully conjugated block copolymer composed of donor and acceptor blocks as active layer material. Previously, we have demonstrated that poly(3-hexylthiophene)\u2212block\u2212poly-((9,9-dioctylfluorene)-2,7-diyl-alt-[4,7-bis(thiophen-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole]-2\u2032,2\u2033-diyl) (P3HT-b-PFTBT) can self-assemble into 10 nm lamellae with alternating electron donor and acceptor domains. The resulting solar cell performance is approximately 3% which clearly outperforms blends of the same component obtained due to the self-assembly of the block copolymers. Nevertheless, one of the challenges in controlling the self-assembly of fully conjugated block copolymers is controlling the interplay between crystallization of the P3HT block and microphase separation between the donor and acceptor. To this end, we have examined the kinetics of the morphological evolution during two processes: solution casting and thermal annealing. We find that during film drying, P3HT crystallization happens on a much faster time scale than phase separation of the two blocks but the crystallization is significantly suppressed with respect to neat materials, enabling the microphase separation to proceed at time scales after crystallization of P3HT takes place.  This enables the mesoscale structure to develop during processes such as thermal annealing, because self-assembly of the lamellar structure takes place before the crystallization of P3HT is complete. We also discover there is competitive crystallization between P3HT and PFTBT. In P3HT-b-PFTBT, P3HT crystallization dominates while PFTBT crystallization is either delayed or completely subdue, depending on the volume fraction of P3HT. The overall device performance strongly depends on the interplay between order phase formation in both P3HT and PFTBT. \nTo further understand morphology evolution in block copolymer, we employed polarized resonant soft X-ray scattering (PSOXS) to study the interfacial molecular alignment in P3HT-b-PFTBT block copolymer. Using two different batches of block copolymer with different degree of P3HT crystallization, we found that in block copolymer where P3HT strongly crystallize, it\u2019s harder to achieve lamellar morphology due to the formation of P3HT crystallites within a kinetically trapped P3HT and PFTBT amorphous matrix after solvent casting. High thermal annealing is required to provide enough energy to promote nanoscale phase separation and lamellae formation. However, the lamellar domains that formed at high temperature are highly-ordered with P3HT crystallites embedded inside. Here, P3HT chains aligned parallel with respect to lamellae domain interface. PSOXS also reveals the molecular orientation of P3HT crystallites within the P3HT lamellar domain. In block copolymer where P3HT crystallization is suppressed, weak P3HT crystallization allows for easier lamellae formation at low annealing temperature but at the cost of well-ordered phase separated domains.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12739], "author_name_tesi": "Le, Thinh Phuc", "last_name_ssi": "Le", "middle_name_ssi": "Phuc", "first_name_ssi": "Thinh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Enrique Daniel Gomez", "Enrique Daniel Gomez", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Michael John Janik", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Enrique Daniel Gomez, Dissertation Advisor", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Committee Chair", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["organic photovoltaics", "organic semiconductors", "polarized resonant soft X-ray scattering", "PSOXS", "Morphology control", "contact doping", "crystallization control", "polymer crystallization"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A STRUCTURAL EMPIRICAL MODEL OF INVENTORY INVESTMENT, FIRM HETEROGENEITY AND INDUSTRY EVOLUTION \n", "id": "8312", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6117", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    This paper develops and estimates a structural model of production and inventory behavior for manufacturing plants in two Colombian industries, metal products and plastic product, from 1977 to 1991.

It has also been shown that, under the hypothesis of non-speciation of salts during transportation, the use of the brighter emitter sodium (Na) as a surrogate for Cl enables the detection of Cl down to a few milligrams per meter square. The conclusion of this work is that a functional integration of LIBS into the overall multi-sensors robot should be achieved by the end of the year.\nThe results that are presented in this thesis were achieved through team collaboration. The author was especially in charge of the samples benchmarking using independent techniques (Chapter 2). The work on the open-beam fiber delivery configurations (Chapters 3 and 4) was carried out with the collaboration Xuan Xiao and Kyle Hartig (Pennsylvania State University). The results on double-pulse configuration (Chapter 5) were obtained working together with Xuan Xiao (Pennsylvania State University). The latest advancements toward field deployment presented in Chapter 6 were mainly carried out at University of Michigan by David Fobar, Patrick Skrodzki, and Milos Burger.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14345], "author_name_tesi": "Le Berre, Samuel ", "last_name_ssi": "Le Berre", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Samuel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Motta", "Arthur Motta", "Michael Tonks", "Igor Jovanovic"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Motta, Thesis Advisor", "Arthur Motta, Committee Member", "Michael Tonks, Committee Member", "Igor Jovanovic, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nuclear spent-fuel", "stress corrosion cracking", "laser induced breakdown spectroscopy", "fiber delivery", "double-pulse", "chlorine detection", "sodium surrogate", "dry storage canister"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Tem Examination Of Oxides Formed On Zirconium Alloys", "id": "19961", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9377", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis research, oxide layers formed on Zr-based alloys in high temperature water autoclave environments are characterized, in an effort to understand the mechanism resulting in the variations of corrosion rate observed before and during the first kinetic transition. The study included oxides formed on Zircaloy-4 and ZIRLO when exposed to 360 \u00b0C pure water at saturation pressure, with samples archived just before and just after the first kinetic transition. From these oxides, thin foil samples are prepared from precise locations using the Focused Ion Beam In-Situ Lift-Out technique. These electron-transparent foils are then characterized using transmission electron microscopy.\nThe study characterizes the oxide grain size and morphology, oxide texture, incorporation of metallic precipitates and the evolution of these with respect to the distance to the oxide/metal interface. The results are found to be in good agreement with previous research: the oxide is mainly monoclinic, with a small fraction of tetragonal phase. A preponderance of columnar oxide grains is observed, which extend to the oxide/metal interface. Equiaxed grains can be seen near the oxide/water interface (first oxide grown) and in the region corresponding to the oxide grown at the onset of transition. Lateral in-plane cracks are seen in these regions as well. Electron diffraction results show that the small equiaxed grains are associated with the tetragonal phase. \nPrecipitates are incorporated in metallic form in the oxide. They later become oxidized, forming small equiaxed oxide grains in Zircaloy-4 with high tetragonal content, or amorphous precipitates in the oxides grown on ZIRLO. \nSpecial attention was given to the oxide/metal interface to determine the phases present, and measure the evolution of oxygen content in the oxide precursor layers. The interface exhibits an intermediate layer identified as ZrO, a discontinuous layer of \u201cblocky\u201d Zr3O grains embedded in the ZrO layer, and a suboxide layer identified as an oxygen saturated Zr phase on the metal matrix side. All these phases have an oxygen content comprised between the content in the oxide (66 O at%) and in the \u03b1-Zr phase (29 O at%). The oxide/metal interface evolves with exposure time, the width of the intermediate layers increasing until the transition. The oxide/metal interface structure is significantly affected by transition, during which the intermediate layers are consumed, causing their widths to decrease significantly. \nCombining EELS scans and Atom Probe Tomography results to obtain the evolution of the oxygen content across the interface, with TEM observations to characterize the different phases and diffusion layers allowed us to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the mechanisms driving the corrosion.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9178], "author_name_tesi": "Le Taillandier De Gabory, Benoit ", "last_name_ssi": "Le Taillandier De Gabory", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Benoit", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Zirconium", "Zircaloys", "Zircaloy-4", "ZIRLO", "oxide", "corrosion", "TEM", "microscopy", "microstructure", "texture", "precipitate", "interface"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Essays in Political Marketing\n\n\n", "id": "9189", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1521", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Political marketing sits at the nexus of two disciplines, political science and marketing, but is not entirely accepted by either.

Coregulatory processes influence the development of child self-regulation skills and thus have mental health implications (Cole & Hall, 2008). Most research examining emotion coregulation has involved infants, but more recently its importance during other periods has been considered (e.g. Feng, Shaw, Skuban, & Lane, 2007). The proposed study focuses on toddlerhood because it is marked by rapid developmental changes, including heightened incidence of child assertion of goals that conflict with parental goals. How these developmental changes contribute to changes in coregulatory processes is not well understood.\n\nThis thesis assesses the degree of coregulation of emotion in mother-toddler interaction in a context that optimizes participants having divergent goals: over an 8 minute period toddlers waited to open a gift until mothers completed work. Employing second-by-second coding, the thesis examined the overall number of seconds and percentage of time in which toddlers and mothers expressed emotions and the number of times their task orientation and emotions changed (i.e., shifted from one emotion to another, or decreased or increased in expression intensity) during the task. We aimed to establish the frequency of (1) child emotion and behavior changes as precursors to mothers\u2019 orienting toward the child, and (2) change in expression in one interaction partner occurring after a change in the other while the two were oriented toward each other.\n\nResults indicated that mothers oriented toward toddlers for about 20% of task time. They were more expressive overall and shifted their expressions more when oriented toward their toddlers than when working. Toddlers expressed more intense emotions, overall happiness, and focus on the gift, and showed fewer shifts in emotion expression, when mothers were oriented\ntoward them compared to when mothers worked. \n\nWhen we examined precursors to mothers\u2019 orienting toward toddlers, we found that changes in toddler anger expressions and focus on the gift were more likely to prompt the mother to orient toward their toddler than shifts in happy expressions. Once oriented toward toddlers, mothers expressed anger infrequently (about 10% of the time). Mothers\u2019 anger expressions evoked toddler anger expressions. However, toddler anger expressions were not as evocative for mothers, who were more likely to stop, rather than start, expressing anger after toddlers expressed anger.\n\nResults are discussed in terms of providing evidence for mutual, reciprocal, and bi-directional influences of mother-toddler emotion expressions during a frustrating task in which dyadic partners have competing goals. The thesis provides a rich descriptive picture of the emotional nature of the challenging wait, and demonstrates how mothers and children influence each other\u2019s emotional expressions over the course of the task at a more micro-analytic level than most prior studies.

Centimeter-scale granitic veins and segregations formed in many samples, but overall, melts remained stationary on the hand specimen scale.

Reducing the energy density (kcal/g) of the diet has been shown to be an effective approach to moderate energy intake in adults, but whether this strategy will be effective in moderating the energy intake of young children has yet to be determined. A series of studies was developed to test the effects on young children\u2019s ad libitum energy intake of lowering the energy density of foods and beverages. The findings from these experiments demonstrate that reducing the energy density of foods and beverages may be an effective approach to moderating energy intake in young children.\n\tStudy 1 tested the effect of reducing the energy density of an entr\u00e9e on children\u2019s ad libitum energy intake from the entr\u00e9e and from the meal. In this within-subjects crossover study, 2- to 5-year-old children (37 boys and 40 girls) were served a test lunch one day per week for six weeks. Two versions of a macaroni and cheese entr\u00e9e were formulated to differ in energy density while maintaining similar palatability. Each version was served to children three times. The higher-energy-density version of the entr\u00e9e had 2.0 kcal/g and the other entr\u00e9e was 30% lower in energy density with 1.4 kcal/g. Lunch, consumed ad libitum, also included broccoli, applesauce, and milk. Decreasing the energy density of the entr\u00e9e by 30% significantly (P<0.0001) reduced children\u2019s energy intake from the entr\u00e9e by 25% (72\u00b18 kcal) and total lunch energy intake by 18% (72\u00b18 kcal). Children consumed significantly more of the lower-energy-density entr\u00e9e (10\u00b14 g; P<0.05). Therefore, decreasing the energy density of a lunch entr\u00e9e resulted in a reduction in children\u2019s energy intake from the entr\u00e9e and from the meal.\n\tStudy 2 tested the effect of simultaneously reducing the energy density and portion size of an entr\u00e9e on children\u2019s ad libitum energy intake from the entr\u00e9e and from the meal. In this within-subjects crossover study, 3- to 5-year-old children (30 boys and 31 girls) were served a test lunch one day per week for four weeks. Two versions of a pasta entr\u00e9e were formulated to differ in energy density while maintaining similar palatability. The amount and type of vegetables and cheeses incorporated into the sauce of the pasta entr\u00e9e were manipulated to create two versions that varied in energy density by 25% (1.6 or 1.2 kcal/g). Across the weeks, each version of the entr\u00e9e was served to the children in each of two portion sizes (400 or 300 g). Lunch, consumed ad libitum, also included carrots, applesauce, and milk. Decreasing the energy density of the entr\u00e9e by 25% significantly (P<0.0001) reduced children\u2019s energy intake from the entr\u00e9e by 25% (63\u00b18 kcal) and total lunch energy intake by 17% (61\u00b19 kcal). Increasing the proportion of vegetables in the pasta entr\u00e9e increased children\u2019s vegetable intake at lunch by half of a serving of vegetables (P<0.01). Decreasing portion size of the entr\u00e9e by 25% did not significantly affect children\u2019s total food or energy intake at lunch. Therefore, reducing the energy density of the entr\u00e9e resulted in a reduction in children\u2019s energy intake from the entr\u00e9e and from the meal in both portion size conditions.\n        Study 3 tested the effect of lowering the energy density of multiple foods on children\u2019s ad libitum energy intake over two days. In this within-subjects crossover study, 3- to 5-year-old children (10 boys and 16 girls) were served test breakfasts, lunches, and afternoon snacks two days per week for two weeks. During one week, foods and beverages served at these meals were reduced in energy density by an average of 27% (range, 19%-33%) compared to those served during the other week. Energy density reductions were achieved by decreasing fat and sugar, and by increasing fruits and vegetables. Dinner and evening snack were sent home with children, but these meals were not varied in energy density. The same 2-day menu was served in both conditions. Children consumed a consistent weight of foods and beverages over two days in both conditions, and therefore, children consumed significantly less energy (14%; 389\u00b172 kcal) in the lower-energy-density condition (P<0.0001). Differences in energy intake were significant at breakfast on Day 1 and accumulated at manipulated meals over two days (P<0.01). Children\u2019s energy intake is influenced by the energy density of foods and beverages served over multiple days. These results strengthen the evidence that reducing the energy density of the diet is an effective approach to moderate children\u2019s energy intake.\n        The results of the present three studies indicate that, like adults and school-aged children, preschool children consume a similar weight of food at meals, even when the food is reduced in energy density. Therefore, when the energy density of food is reduced, children consume significantly less energy at individual meals and over the course of up to two days. The results of the present research also demonstrate that children consume a consistent weight of beverages at individual meals and over the course of two days, and therefore, consume significantly less energy when the energy density of beverages is reduced. Additionally, the present research demonstrates the effectiveness of several different strategies to reduce the energy density of foods served to children: reducing the fat or sugar content of foods, combining fat reductions with increases in the vegetable content of foods, increasing the fruit content of foods, and combinations of these approaches. The lower-energy-density foods and beverages were well-accepted by the children as indicated by both the taste tests and the consistent amounts consumed of the different versions of the foods and beverages. Overall, the results of the present research extend previous findings on the effects of energy density on ad libitum energy intake to a younger age group.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3382], "author_name_tesi": "Leahy, Kathleen Erin", "last_name_ssi": "Leahy", "middle_name_ssi": "Erin", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Jean Rolls", "Leann L Birch", "Cynthia J Bartok", "Michael J Rovine", "Jennifer O Fisher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Jean Rolls, Committee Chair", "Leann L Birch, Committee Chair", "Cynthia J Bartok, Committee Member", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member", "Jennifer O Fisher, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy intake", "energy density", "preschool children", "food intake"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Real-time Vehicle Pose Estimation Utilizing Monocular Vision and Lane Marker Maps", "id": "15291rdl5025", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15291", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary focus of this work is to develop a vehicle pose estimation algorithm using a-priori knowledge of the environment.

Research in this area has predominantly examined associations between trait mindfulness and relational and sexual satisfaction. However, even individuals who are mindful in daily activities, as assessed by trait mindfulness, may find it difficult to remain mindful during a sexual experience due to additional obstacles such as sexual anxiety, distraction, expectations of performance, sexual goals, inhibition, or self-criticism. Thus, it is important to consider associations between sexual mindfulness, a form of state mindfulness, and relational and sexual satisfaction. \n\tThe purpose of this dissertation was to examine factors that may contribute to midlife relational and sexual health by developing a new measure of sexual mindfulness, examining the contributions of mindfulness and desire discrepancy to relational and sexual satisfaction, and examining the roles of culture and gender in relational and sexual satisfaction. To address these questions, I collected data on 1445 midlife adults (ages 35 to 60, 45% female) from the U.S., Ukraine, and Turkey. In Paper 1, I developed a measure of mindfulness during sexual experiences, the Sexual Mindfulness Measure (SMM). The SMM proved to be a two-factor measure\u2014observation and non-judgment of experience. The SMM showed reliability across gender, age groups, and marriage lengths. The SMM also showed explanatory value above and beyond trait mindfulness. In Paper 2, I used this newly constructed measure to evaluate whether trait and sexual mindfulness moderate the association between sexual desire discrepancy and relational and sexual satisfaction. Being mindful by observing during sexual experiences moderated the association between desire discrepancy and sexual satisfaction. In Paper 3, I examined cross-cultural differences in sexual health in the U.S., Ukraine, and Turkey, as well as examined how cultural differences may interact with gender. I found that adults in the U.S. kissed more, had vaginal and oral sex less frequently, felt more satisfied with their romantic relationships and their sex lives, and were less judging of sexual experiences than adults in Ukraine and Turkey. Gender differences did not vary by country. Across the three studies, findings indicate that context is an important aspect of midlife relational and sexual health. Midlife adults are influenced by factors at both the macro and micro level. Sexual mindfulness may provide skills that encourage midlife adults to let go of sexual expectations or goals and judgments that diminish their satisfaction with sexual experiences. Future research should consider further cross cultural validation of the SMM and continued examination of how sexual mindfulness contributes to both relational and sexual health.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15142], "author_name_tesi": "Leavitt, Chelom Eastwood", "last_name_ssi": "Leavitt", "middle_name_ssi": "Eastwood", "first_name_ssi": "Chelom", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eva S.

In normal adults, LGLs represent 10-15% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and can be classified into two distinct lineages, as either CD3+ CTLs or CD3- NK cells. Both cells types play important roles in the immune system. LGLs become activated through antigen recognition and undergo significant expansion with subsequent death by apoptosis upon antigen clearage. In LGL leukemia, these LGLs persist. Clinically, LGL leukemia can present with varying disease severity ranging from a slowly progressive indolent and chronic disorder to a highly aggressive acute and fatal leukemia. A high proportion of patients also present with a range of autoimmune conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis. Immunosuppressive regimens using methotrexate, cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine are utilized as front-line treatments in LGL leukemia but are not curative. The aggressive LGL variants have no effective treatment and are refractory to conventional chemotherapy. The lack of effective and targeted therapies results from an incomplete picture of survival mechanisms that contribute to the pathogenesis of leukemic LGLs.\nIn this study, we investigated sphingolipid metabolism and its role in the survival of leukemic LGLs. Sphingolipids are a group of bioactive lipids that maintain cellular integrity and can also mediate signal transduction. The balance between pro-apoptotic sphingolipids, such as ceramide and sphingosine, and pro-survival sphingolipids, such as sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), has been shown to regulate cell survival and is known as the \u201csphingolipid rheostat.\u201d  The sphingolipid rheostat is dysregulated in many types of cancer, including LGL leukemia. We identified that the S1P-producing enzymes, sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1) and sphingosine kinase-2 (SPHK2), are both upregulated in LGL leukemia patients. We investigated the role of SPHK1 and SPHK2 in leukemic LGL survival and resistance to apoptosis. We show that SPHK1 inhibition with both SPHK1 siRNA and pharmacologic inhibitors (SKI-II, SKI-178) decreases cell viability and induces apoptosis in leukemic LGLs through the targeting of multiple signaling pathways including p38 MAPK, JNK, JAK/STAT and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2). Additionally, SPHK2 inhibition with both SPHK2 siRNA and ABC294640, a SPHK2-specific inhibitor, also decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis through the downregulation of myeloid cell leukemia differentiation protein-1 (Mcl-1), an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member. Furthermore, we identify Mcl-1 as an important survival protein in LGL leukemia through direct inhibition with Mcl-1 siRNA and recently developed Mcl-1specific small molecule inhibitors, maritoclax and KS18. Finally, we demonstrate that FTY720 (Fingolimod), a potent immunomodulatory agent, induces apoptosis in leukemic LGLs through the downregulation of acid ceramidase (AC, ASAH1), an enzyme that metabolizes ceramide into sphingosine. We further show that antitumor effects of FTY720 are dependent on autophagy. \nTaken together, we show that the sphingolipid metabolizing enzymes, SPHK1, SPHK2 and AC, are all important for leukemic LGL survival and are novel potential therapeutic targets. Targeting these enzymes restores the sphingolipid balance to a pro-apoptotic state through the increase of ceramide and decrease in S1P. We also demonstrate for the first time that FTY720 downregulates AC in LGL leukemia. Collectively, these data support SPHK1, SPHK2 and AC as putative targets to develop novel targeted therapies for the incurable disease LGL leukemia.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11895], "author_name_tesi": "Leblanc, Francis R", "last_name_ssi": "Leblanc", "middle_name_ssi": "R", "first_name_ssi": "Francis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\"", "Charles H Lang", "Hong Gang Wang", "Edward Joseph Gunther"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\", Dissertation Advisor", "Charles H Lang, Committee Chair", "Hong Gang Wang, Committee Member", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["LGL", "large granular lymphocyte", "sphingosine kinase", "S1P", "sphingolipid"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Practical Sprayed-on Transducer Composites for High Temperature Applications", "id": "27209", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11960", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent work at the Pennsylvania State University has developed the materials and fabrication techniques for in-field applying of sprayed-on ferroelectric composite films, to be used as integrated transducers tolerant of high temperature environments.

The current study uses a structural equation modeling technique to examine social self-concept as a mediating mechanism as well as the potentially buffering role of high levels of parental communication on the association between experiencing bullying and psychosocial maladjustment using a nationally representative sample of US students in grades 6 through 10 (N = 14,039), the Health Behavior in School-Aged Children Survey 2001/2002 (HBSC).  Findings indicate that experiencing bullying contributes to adolescents\u2019 psychosocial maladjustment, in part through the negative influence of bullying on adolescents\u2019 social self-concept, which additionally contributes to poorer adjustment.  Gender differences exist in this association; overall bullying is more consequential for adolescent females\u2019 adjustment.   Parental communication acts as a buffer against the negative effects of bullying on psychosocial adjustment by moderating the impact that bullying has on adolescent social self-concept.  Findings from this study suggest that further research is warranted on how bullying might differentially affect the adjustment and psychological well-being of adolescent males and females, as well as what aspects of the parent-child relationship may be protective for bullied adolescents.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4485], "author_name_tesi": "Ledwell, Margaret J.", "last_name_ssi": "Ledwell", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Margaret", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Valarie Elizabeth King", "Valarie Elizabeth King"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Valarie Elizabeth King, Thesis Advisor", "Valarie Elizabeth King, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["bullying", "adolescence", "parent-child relationship", "communication", "gender"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Family Demographic Influences on the Timing and Stability of First Cohabiting Unions", "id": "22117", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10090", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nonmarital cohabitation is an increasingly common union experience for individuals and a context for family building, both as a pre-cursor to marriage and a site of childbearing.   Several factors may push or pull individuals into a first cohabiting union and impact the stability of their unions thereafter, including prior experiences in the family environment as well as concurrent behavior relating to childbearing and educational attainment.  Much of the research looking at cohabitation formation and outcomes, however, has concentrated on cohabitation in early adulthood or focused on the experiences of women.  Furthermore, in this literature there is often an implicit assumption that the influence of predictors on cohabitation timing or stability is constant across age at union entrance or cohabitation duration.  The current thesis extends work in this area by examining the timing of entering into first cohabitations and the outcomes of these unions for both men and women, from adolescence through young adulthood, and considers whether the factors shaping these processes operate consistently across this age range.  The analytic sample comes from nationally-representative data from Waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.  \nSeveral dimensions of the family environment during adolescence and concurrent behavior across the transition to adulthood are considered as predictors of behavior in cohabiting unions.  This thesis also examines whether these family and sociodemographic factors affect the risk of entering cohabiting unions in similar ways during adolescence, early adulthood, and later into young adulthood, and if these factors affect the risk of transitioning to marriage or breaking-up in similar ways across the duration of first cohabitations.   Results indicate that exposure during adolescence to family instability, parental cohabitation, lower parental SES, and low family belonging are associated with elevated risk of entering into cohabiting unions, but primarily during adolescence and early adulthood.  At older ages, many of these family factors are no longer associated with an elevated rates of cohabiting, as individuals from a variety of family backgrounds are increasingly likely to cohabit.  Family factors, including having a low sense of belonging to one\u2019s family, are also associated with the stability of first cohabitations, contributing to a lower likelihood of transitioning to marriage and a higher likelihood of union dissolution.  \nResults also indicate that pregnancy and childbearing may motivate entrance into first cohabitations and contribute to the likelihood that these unions transition to marriage or end in a break-up.  However, the influence of pregnancy and childbearing on entering a cohabitation as well as their effect on the outcome of that union differs depending on the age of the individual and when in the cohabitation the childbearing occurs.  Furthermore, results point to important gender and race differences in the role that pregnancy and childbearing plays in shaping first cohabitation experiences.  \nFindings from this thesis highlight the linkage between the adolescent family environment and first cohabitation experiences, lending support to a life course perspective which emphasizes the enduring influence of earlier experiences for later behavior.  Additionally, results contribute to the existing literature on cohabitation and highlight the importance of considering the shifting influence of predictors across age and cohabitation duration. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9784], "author_name_tesi": "Ledwell, Margaret J.", "last_name_ssi": "Ledwell", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Margaret", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Valarie Elizabeth King", "Paul Amato", "Melissa Hardy", "David Eggebeen", "Alan Booth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Valarie Elizabeth King, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Amato, Committee Member", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Member", "David Eggebeen, Committee Member", "Alan Booth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cohabitation", "family", "union formation", "family demography", "transition to adulthood", "event history analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Fluid-Structure Interaction of Large Amplitude Structure Vibrations and Moderately High Reynolds Number Turbulent Flows", "id": "25672", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11038", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) eff\u000bects often must be considered when flexible structures are subjected to unsteady flows.

Most challenges in SST service encounters encompass difficulty with building relationships with customers and lack of the recovery strategies. This dissertation investigates customers\u2019 perceived causal attribution, expected recoveries, and evaluations of firms following three different types of service failures. The three different types of service failures include failure by non-Internet SST, failure by employees, and failure by a company\u2019s procedures/policies. \nThis study manipulates scenarios through a 3 x 2 experimental factorial design with three service failure types and two levels of failure severity. The research design consists of two stages, pretest, and main study to examine the proposed hypotheses. The study\u2019s paper-based questionnaire surveys 300 staff members of randomly selected departments at a northeastern university. A total of 182 usable surveys represent a response rate of 62 percent. \nThe result of the data analysis shows that customers encountering a procedure failure considered the service failure to be a repeat problem and assigned the most overall causal attribution to a company. In the results of the effects of failure severity on overall causal attribution, consumers exposed to severer service failures were more likely to assign overall causal attribution to firms than were customers who encountered mild service failures. In terms of recovery strategies, customers expect an apology for service recovery more than any other recovery actions such as refund or intent to complain when the level of causal attributions is high. The results also show positive relationships between causal attributions and overall evaluations such as dissatisfaction, complaint intent, and negative word-of-mouth (WOM). A negative relationship exists between causal attributions and return intent.\nThe findings of this research suggest that, in customers\u2019 perceptions of a company\u2019s management, procedures are the equivalent of the company. Thus, testing the procedure/policy with customers is important to determine whether or not customers like the procedure/policy or to determine if the procedure/policy  is acceptable  before managers use it. Once established and the procedure/policy becomes a problem, then the perception will always be the existence of a problem. Furthermore, customers do not perceive causal attributions between non-Internet SSTs failure and employee failure to be different. However, with regard to overall causal attribution (overall blame) to a company, an interesting finding is that customers who experienced a non-Internet SST failure placed a higher degree of overall causal attribution (blame and responsibility) on the firm than did those who experienced an employee failure. Consequently, when customers place overall responsibility on the company rather than attributing on each failure type, they are more likely to blame the firm in a service failure by non-Internet SST than in that by an employee.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [803], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Bo-Youn ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bo-Youn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Hotel, Restaurant, and Institutional Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Allen Cranage", "David Allen Cranage", "Carolyn U Lambert", "Daniel John Mount", "S.

A prominent mechanism of MDR is the overexpression of the multidrug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which decreases the intracellular accumulation of many anticancer drugs leading to increased tumor growth.  Intensive efforts are underway to develop clinically useful MDR modulators that inhibit the function of P-gp for use in combination with established anticancer drugs.  To study the in vivo systemic effects of P-gp-specific inhibitors on reversing P-gp-mediated MDR, we developed a solid tumor model utilizing immunocompetent animals.  Using in vitro cytotoxicity and drug accumulation assays, two transformed murine cell lines, JC and TIB-75, were found to demonstrate the P-gp-mediated MDR phenotype.  In contrast, two similar lines did not express functional P-gp.  Western blot analyses confirmed the expression of P-gp and the lack of expression of the closely related drug efflux protein MRP1 in the JC and TIB-75 cell lines.  The JC cell line displayed excellent tumorgenicity and consistent growth kinetics when implanted into immunocompetent Balb/c mice.  Animals treated with a combination of a known MDR modulator, cyclosporin A, and a cytotoxic drug, doxorubicin, exhibited significantly reduced tumor growth compared to untreated controls or animals treated with either cyclosporin A or doxorubicin alone.  Therefore, this syngeneic solid tumor model provides a new in vivo system that can be used to evaluate the efficacy of P-gp inhibitors in an immunocompetent host and should provide improved prediction of the clinical utility of these compounds.\nIn our search for improved MDR modulators, we identified a novel series of substituted pyrroloquinolines that selectively inhibits the function of P-gp without modulating multidrug resistance-related protein 1 (MRP1).  These compounds were evaluated for their toxicity towards drug sensitive tumor cells (i.e. MCF-7, T24) and for their ability to antagonize P-gp-mediated drug resistant cells (i.e. NCI/ADR) and MRP1-mediated resistant cells (i.e. MCF-7/VP).  The in vitro cytotoxicity and drug accumulation assays demonstrated that the dihydropyrroloquinoline analogs inhibit P-gp to varying degrees without any significant inhibition of MRP1.  One of the analogs, PGP-4008, showed the highest level of P-gp inhibition (P-gp antagonism score &#8776; 17) in vitro and was further evaluated in vivo.  PGP-4008 inhibited tumor growth in the JC murine syngeneic P-gp-mediated MDR solid tumor model when given in combination with doxorubicin.  The dose of PGP-4008 (100 mg/kg) and the route of administration (intraperitoneal) used in the tumor model resulted in rapid systemic absorption with plasma concentrations exceeding the in vitro effective dose (0.8 \u00b5g/ml) for 2 h after administration.  PGP-4008 did not alter the plasma distribution of concomitantly administered anticancer drugs.  Furthermore, signs of systemic toxicity were not seen with the P-gp selective modulator, PGP-4008, as seen in comparison with a non-selective inhibitor, cyclosporin A.  Because of their transport-selectivity, these substituted dihydropyrroloquinolines may be more effective MDR modulators than non-specific modulators in a clinical setting.  \nWe also identified a series of quinoxalinones that could reverse MDR through the inhibition of P-gp, thereby increasing the efficacy of anticancer drugs in P-gp-expressing tumor cells.  One compound in this series, 2-benzyloxy-3-methyl-quinoxaline (termed BMQ), displayed a surprising result when administered with actinomycin D.  Actinomycin D is a peptide-containing antitumor drug isolated from Streptomyces that inhibits RNA synthesis by intercalating into DNA.  It is currently thought that actinomycin D enters cells by passive diffusion through the plasma membrane.  However, studies described herein demonstrate that actinomycin D uptake by cells is saturable, temperature-dependent and energy-dependent, suggesting an active transport mechanism.  BMQ markedly increased the accumulation of actinomycin D within cells overexpressing P-gp, as well as a variety of cell lines that do not express this drug efflux protein.  This increased accumulation of [3H]actinomycin D by BMQ was not due exclusively to the inhibition of efflux of the drug from the cell.  Treating the cells with antimycin A, 2-deoxyglucose and sodium azide, which depleted intracellular levels of ATP by at least 75%, abolished the effects of BMQ on the cellular accumulation of actinomycin D.  In addition, decreasing the temperature from 37&#730;C to 4&#730;C blocked the effects of BMQ.  These studies suggest that the facilitation of actinomycin D transport by BMQ is not due to inhibition of efflux, and that actinomycin D transport is energy-dependent, temperature-dependent, and saturable.  Overall, these studies suggest that a membrane transporter is responsible for the passage of actinomycin D across the cellular membrane, and that BMQ can potentiate this influx mechanism.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [651], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Brian D.", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "D.", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles D Smith", "Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Robert G Levenson", "Jong Kak Yun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles D Smith, Committee Chair", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["P-glycoprotein", "multidrug resistance", "in vivo tumor model", "actinomycin D transport"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Simulation-based Performance and Life-Cycle Cost Evaluation of In-duct Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Systems", "id": "9668", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "892", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In-duct ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) systems treat moving airstreams in heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems to inactivate airborne microorganisms.

The results are also compared to those provided by ventilation and filtration.\n\nFor the reference case of inactivating S. aureus, UVGI air treatment results in lower predicted space concentrations than those provided by elevated ventilation with respect to ASHRAE Standard 62.1, and similar levels to those achieved by high-efficiency filtration at a lower cost. Cost increases proportionally with performance; therefore, it is very important to ensure the performance target is marginally met for the desired percentage of time to avoid over or under sizing the UVGI system in order to control cost. This design methodology can possibly only be done with a simulation-based evaluation procedure. Uncertainties in modeling assumptions result in uncertainties in the simulated performance and life-cycle cost. Sensitivity analysis provides an insight into the amount of possible variation around the predicted values.\n\nThe results of the parametric study suggest that a simulation-based evaluation procedure is an indispensable tool in the design process of UVGI systems. The procedure presented in this research can be further refined and incorporated into design practice in the future.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [884], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Bruno ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bruno", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William P Bahnfleth", "William P Bahnfleth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William P Bahnfleth, Thesis Advisor", "William P Bahnfleth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation", "UVGI", "UVC lamp performance", "Airborne contaminant control", "Indoor air quality", "Life-cycle cost analysis", "LCC"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "QUANTITATIVE MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING AND SPECTROSCOPY STUDIES OF  RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME: \nCEREBRAL IRON, MORPHOLOGY AND METABOLISM \n\n", "id": "11398", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "808", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder that has 5-10% prevalence in  Western countries. Its clinical symptoms are characterized by sensorimotor dysfunction, such as uncontrollable urges to move the legs and uncomfortable sensations, causing sleep disturbances at night. Although a number of studies have suggested that brain iron deficiency is strongly coupled with RLS pathophysiology, the exact mechanism of how iron deficiency affects brain function in RLS subjects remains unclear due to inconsistent findings from single imaging data sets. For this reason, in this study multimodal neuroimaging techniques were applied using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS), respectively, in order to investigate the impact of iron deficiency on brain structural changes and neurochemical metabolism in RLS. \nTwenty-four RLS patients and 24 age-matched controls were studied for the acquisition of multimodal data sets. Multi spin-echo T2 images, high resolution T1 images, and proton MR spectra were acquired in order to quantify iron levels, brain morphology, and neurometabolite levels, respectively. \n\tMRI analysis revealed that iron deficit was significantly involved in the sensorimotor regions in RLS subjects. Additionally, brain morphological structure and callosal thickness in RLS patients were significantly reduced in these regions as compared to control subjects. The proton MRS data showed significantly increased concentrations of various metabolites in RLS subjects. Based on the roles of iron in myelin synthesis in the brain, the reduced brain volume could be caused by a myelin deficit (hypomyelination) due to iron deficiency. This could also result in a decrease in the thickness of the corpus callosum, which requires high myelination of its fibers. The MRS results are particularly notable in that they show increased levels of the neurometabolites N-acetylaspartate and myo-inositol. Since these compounds are used in myelin production, higher levels of these metabolites may suggest that glial cells increase the production of NAA and myo-inositol in an attempt to rescue myelin deficits. \tTherefore, the fusion of multi-modal imaging data provides a realistic approach to understanding the mechanism underlying RLS, and is clinically useful for its early diagnosis and interpretation of the pathological basis of RLS. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [801], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Byeong-Yeul ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Byeong-Yeul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qing X Yang", "James Robert Connor", "Christopher Collins", "Paul Joseph Eslinger", "Qing X Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qing X Yang, Dissertation Advisor", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Christopher Collins, Committee Member", "Paul Joseph Eslinger, Committee Member", "Qing X Yang, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["voxel-based morphometry", "iron deficiency", "RLS", "restless legs syndrome", "magnetic resonance imaging", "magnetic resonance spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Essays in Game Theory\n\n", "id": "11169", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "811", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chapter 1:<br/>\nI modify two-player simultaneous-move games with a unique payoff-dominant strategy profile by allowing each player to publicly discard any of her original strategic options in turn before play begins. In this setting, I show that extensive-form rationalizable (EFR) profiles, as defined in Pearce (1984), have payoff-dominant outcomes. Furthermore, a strategy profile in which no player makes any commitments is EFR. Thus, the model is interpreted as one of payoff-dominant focal-point formation via forward induction, which is captured by EFR. The result is analogous to that in Ben-Porath and Dekel\u2019s (1992) model of money-burning games. That the order of beliefs required to obtain payoff-dominant outcomes is uniformly bounded at three across all games is an advantage of the model in this paper over the money-burning approach, which may require the use of arbitrarily high orders of beliefs to obtain the same result. A limitation of this paper, which is also shared by the money-burning model, is that the prediction of payoff-dominant play is not robust to the addition of players.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChapter 2:\n<br/>\nI provide an epistemic characterization of iterated elimination of inadmissible---that is, weakly dominated---strategies.

Solving a long-standing puzzle of Samuelson (1992), BFK gave an epistemic characterization of finite rounds of elimination of inadmissible strategies. However, they also gave a negative result showing that RCAR is impossible in a complete lexicographic type structure with continuous mappings. This seemed to cast doubt on the possibility of RCAR as a natural candidate for the desired epistemic condition, but our results revive this possibility. I examine the differences between our positive result and their negative result in isolation, and arrive at the surprising conclusion that a lexicographic type structure contains more information than previously thought.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [804], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Byung Soo ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Byung Soo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward James Green", "Edward James Green", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Tymofiy Mylovanov", "Stephen George Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward James Green, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward James Green, Committee Chair", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member", "Tymofiy Mylovanov, Committee Member", "Stephen George Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["extensive-form rationalizability", "forward induction", "iterated admissibility", "game theory", "complete type structures", "epistemic condition"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "How Two Kindergarten Teachers\nPerceive and Meet the Needs of\nThe 2.5 Generation Korean Children", "id": "26297", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11447", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tKindergarten teachers must meet the needs of the relatively new 2.5 generation of Korean children (children with one foreign-born parent) and help them overcome their difficulties as students in South Korean schools and later on as adult members of Korean society.

The objective of the first experiment was to investigate the effects of a low-protein diet [metabolizable protein (MP) below the requirements (NRC, 2001)] and coconut oil supplementation on N utilization and production in lactating dairy cows. The hypothesis was that a partial defaunation of the rumen by feeding coconut oil would increase microbial protein synthesis in the rumen, thus compensating for potential MP deficiency. The experiment lasted for 10 wk with 36 cows in a randomized complete block design. Cows were fed a MP-adequate diet (AMP), a MP-deficient diet (DMP), or DMP supplemented with coconut oil (DMPCO). Supplementing with coconut oil decreased rumen protozoal counts up to 60% compared with DMP. Milk yield was decreased by DMP compared with AMP. The DMPCO further decreased milk yield as a consequence of depressed dry matter intake (DMI). The DMP- diets increased the efficiency of dietary N utilization for milk protein synthesis (milk protein-N \u00f7 N intake) by reducing urinary N excretion compared with AMP. Overall, the MP-deficient diets decreased N losses, but also decreased milk production. Supplementation with coconut oil decreased feed intake and therefore could not have a positive impact on milk production in this experiment. \nThe objective of the second study was to investigate the effects of feeding a low-protein diet supplemented with rumen-protected (RP) Met on dairy cow performance and ammonia emissions from manure. Two experiments were carried out. In experiment 1, 36 dairy cows were fed the AMP, DMP supplemented with RPLys (DMPL), or DMPL supplemented with RPMet (DMPLM) diets. In experiment 2, 120 Holstein cows were grouped in pens of 20 cows and were fed AMP supplemented with RPLys (AMPL), or AMP supplemented with RPMet (AMPLM). Each experimental period lasted for 10 wk (2 wk adaptation and 8 wk experimental periods) following a 2-wk covariate period. The hypothesis of the first experiment was that a MP-deficient diet supplemented with RPMet would sustain milk production and composition similar to a MP-adequate diet, provided Lys requirements were met, with the environmental benefits of reduced N excretion. The hypothesis tested in the second experiment was that RPMet supplementation would increase milk and milk protein yields in cows fed MP-adequate, but Met-deficient diet. The MP-deficient diets had no effects on DMI and milk yield. Compared with AMP, DMPL decreased milk protein content and milk protein yield, but DMPLM showed no statistical difference in milk protein content. Urinary N losses decreased with the DMP- diets compared with AMP. Plasma Lys and Met concentrations were not affected by treatment while His concentration was lower for the DMP- diets compared with AMP. In Exp. 2, the AMPLM diet resulted in lower milk yield than AMPL due to a numerical decrease in DMI while no other production effects were observed. Overall, feeding MP-deficient diets, supplemented with RPLys and RPMet sustained milk yield in dairy cows in this experiment. However, without RPMet supplementation, milk protein content was decreased compared with AMP. Based on plasma amino acids (AA) profile, we concluded that His may be limiting milk production in MP-deficient, corn silage and alfalfa haylage-based diets. There were no production benefits of supplementing the AMP diet with RPMet.\nThe objective of the third experiment was to investigate the effects of a low-protein diet supplemented with RPHis in addition to RPLys and RPMet on N utilization and cow performance. The hypothesis of this experiment was that feeding the MP-deficient diet supplemented with RPHis in addition to RPLys and RPMet would sustain milk production of dairy cows similar to AMP with environmental benefits by decreasing N losses. The experiment was conducted for 10 wk following a 2-wk covariate period with 48 lactating dairy cows fed 4 treatment diets: AMP, DMP, DMPLM and DMPLM supplemented with RPHis (DMPLMH). Compared with AMP, DMI tended to be lower with the DMP diet but was similar for the DMPLM and DMPLMH diets. Milk yield was decreased by DMP, but was similar to AMP for the DMPLM and DMPLMH diets, following the trend in DMI. Milk protein yield followed the trend in milk yield response and was not different from AMP for the DMPLM and DMPLMH diets. In conclusion, DMP decreased DMI and milk yield in dairy cows. Supplementating with RPLys and RPMet diminished the difference in milk yield compared with AMP, and addition of RPHis eliminated the difference. This experiment indicated that His is likely one of the limiting AA in dairy cows fed MP-deficient diets.\nThe objective of the fourth experiment was to investigate the effects of a low-protein diet on ammonia (NH3) and greenhouse gas (GHG; nitrous oxide, methane, and carbon dioxide) emissions from fresh dairy cow manure incubated in controlled storage conditions (Experiment 1) and from manure-amended soil (Experiment 2). Feces and urine were obtained from the cows fed AMP and DMP diets. Manure was produced by mixing feces and urine (1.7:1) immediately before incubation (Exp.1) and application to lysimeters containing soil (a Hagerstown silt loam; fine, mixed, mesic Typic Hapludalf) (Exp. 2). In Exp. 2, manure was applied to 21 lysimeters (including 3 blank lysimeters: without manure) at 277 kg of N/ha application rate. In Exp. 1, cumulative emissions and emitting potential (EP) of NH3 were greater for AMP compared with DMP manure. The EP and cumulative emissions of GHG were not different between AMP and DMP manure. In Exp. 2, the NH3 EP was greater for lysimeters amended with AMP than with DMP manure. The EP of methane was increased and that of carbon dioxide tended to be increased by DMP compared with AMP manure. The cumulative carbon dioxide emission was increased with manure from the DMP diet. Nitrous oxide emissions were low in this experiment and did not differ between treatments. In conclusion, fresh manure from dairy cows fed a low-protein diet had substantially lower NH3 EP, compared with manure from cows fed a high-protein diet. The DMP manure increased soil methane EP due to a greater mass of manure added to meet plant N requirements compared with AMP manure. \nLastly, a series of laboratory experiments were conducted to establish the relationship between N isotope composition of cattle manure and NH3 emissions, potential contribution of nitrogenous gases other than NH3 to manure N volatilization losses, and to determine the relative contribution of urinary- vs.fecal-N to NH3 emissions during the initial stage of manure storage. Intensive NH3 volatilization losses from manure coincides with a very rapid loss of urinary urea. The dynamics of manure- and emitted NH3-\u03b415N indicated that the intensive N isotope fractionation occurred during NH3 volatilization. The experiments demonstrated that the main source of NH3-N volatilized from cattle manure is urinary-N, representing on average 90% of the emitted NH3-N. The contribution of fecal-N was relatively low, but gradually increased to about 10% by day 10. There appears to be substantial emissions of nitrogenous gases other than NH3, most likely dinitrogen gas, which may account for up to 25% of N losses. This finding may be indicative of overestimation of NH3 emissions from cattle operations by the current emissions factors.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7245], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Chanhee ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chanhee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexander Nikolov Hristov", "Alexander Nikolov Hristov", "Gabriella Anne Varga", "Kevin John Harvatine", "Curtis James Dell", "Gary W Feyereisen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexander Nikolov Hristov, Dissertation Advisor", "Alexander Nikolov Hristov, Committee Chair", "Gabriella Anne Varga, Committee Member", "Kevin John Harvatine, Committee Member", "Curtis James Dell, Committee Member", "Gary W Feyereisen, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metabolizable protein", "coconut oil", "rumen-protected amino acids", "NH3 volatilization", "manure", "dairy cow"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "GENOME-WIDE ANALYSIS OF NELF: NELF IS LINKED TO PROMOTER PROXIMAL PAUSING THROUGHOUT THE DROSOPHILA GENOME\n\n\n", "id": "8518", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1251", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Negative elongation factor, NELF, has been shown to cause RNA polymerase II to pause in the promoter proximal region of the hsp70 gene in Drosophila and of several genes in human cells. To investigate the global role of NELF and promoter proximal pausing in transcription regulation, I determined the genome-wide distribution of NELF in Drosophila cells using ChIP-chip. NELF was detected at the promoter region of over 2,000 genes. I used these data to identify locations in the Drosophila genome where paused Pol II might reside. Using permanganate genomic footprinting for detection of transcriptionally engaged Pol II, I analyzed the association of Pol II with 61 genes where NELF was detected and 4 genes where NELF was not detected. Paused Pol II was detected at 51 genes associated with NELF, revealing that there is a good correlation of NELF and promoter proximal pausing. Based on these ChIP-chip and permanganate footprinting results, I estimated that at least 1,000 genes in Drosophila cells harbor paused Pol II. \nTo determine if there are cis-DNA elements near such paused Pol II, I used the MEME algorithm to analyze the sequences of 51 promoter regions at which permanganate footprints had been detected. The search for conserved sequence elements identified a 35 nucleotide long motif with similarity to a combination of initiator element, DPE, and MTE. Each of these elements is reported to be recognized by TFIID. The 35 nucleotide long motif was enriched on genes associated with NELF and paused Pol II. This conserved promoter element might contribute to pausing by increasing the affinity of TFIID to the promoter and establishing a promoter architecture for pausing. \nSequence analysis also showed that GAGA elements were enriched at genes with paused Pol II. This observation, together with previous studies suggesting that GAGA factor is involved in establishing paused Pol II on the hsp70 gene, led me to analyze the distribution of GAGA factor in the Drosophila genome. Using ChIP-chip analysis, I determined that GAGA factor was associated with the promoters of 1,566 genes in the entire genome. Comparison of the distribution of NELF and GAGA factor revealed that 832 of 2,111 genes with NELF associated with GAGA factor. This result suggests that GAGA factor is linked to NELF and promoter proximal pausing. \nTo further investigate the mechanism of promoter proximal pausing, I analyzed the locations of permanganate footprints of 51 genes. A composite of all the permanganate footprints revealed that paused Pol II typically resided in the region 20 to 50 nucleotides downstream from an initiator element. This indicates that Pol II pauses after transcribing approximately 30 nucleotides, extruding at least a 10 nucleotide-long transcript from the elongation complex. The exposed nascent transcript might provide a possible site for NELF-E binding. Therefore, these results strongly support the proposed mechanism by which NELF mediates promoter proximal pausing by restricting the movement of Pol II through the association of NELF-E with the nascent transcript. \nSince NELF has been reported to repress expression of several genes in Drosophila and human cells, I determined if NELF correlates with transcription repression. Using the previously reported genome-wide expression data for Drosophila cells, I determined that many of genes associated with NELF are actively transcribed. This indicates that NELF is not necessarily acting as a repressor of transcription.  Whereas NELF might serve to inhibit expression of some genes, in the majority of cases, NELF could generate a limiting-step during gene activation and function as a checkpoint for proper RNA processing and the recruitment of elongation factors. This suggests that the control of early transcription elongation by NELF may be an important step in the overall regulation of gene expression of many genes.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1240], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Chanhyo ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chanhyo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Gilmour", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Joseph C.

These phases were grown by reactive molecular-beam epitaxy (MBE) on different substrates: (001) (LaAlO3)0.29(SrAl0.5Ta0.5O3)0.71 (LSAT), (001) SrTiO3, (110) DyScO3, and (110) GdScO3 to establish the effect of biaxial strain and dimensionality on the dielectric properties of these layered relatives of SrTiO3. \n\nWith the aid of shuttered reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) intensity oscillations, the strontium-to-titanium ratio can be precisely calibrated to within ~1% of stoichiometry. Such accurate compositional control is required for the growth of Sr(n+1)Ti(n)O(3n+1) phases that are non-equilibrium phases, i.e., with 3 < n < \u221e. To form these phases, precise monolayer doses of SrO and TiO2 are sequentially deposited onto a substrate to create Sr(n+1)Ti(n)O(3n+1) phases with n as high as 10. X-ray diffraction (XRD) \u03b8-2\u03b8 scans reveal that each sample contains all 002l peaks at the expected positions, corresponding to phase-pure single crystalline Sr(n+1)Ti(n)O(3n+1). XRD rocking curves confirm the high structural perfection of the films; the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Sr(n+1)Ti(n)O(3n+1) films is <23 arc sec (<0.007\u00b0), comparable to the rocking curve FWHM of the underlying substrates. Nonetheless, annular-dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) images of selected films revealed the existence of stacking faults and vertically running Ruddlesden-Popper defect layers (double SrO layers). Such defects are not resolved in the \u03b8-2\u03b8 scans and most likely stem from inexact supply of constituent species in the shuttered doses, i.e., imperfect composition control, during film growth. The density of defects was seen to increase with n. A histogram analysis by bright-field STEM of the layering disorder in an n = 6 Sr(n+1)Ti(n)O(3n+1) film grown on DyScO3 reveals that 65% of the layers in the growth direction have the desired 6 perovskite layers. The remaining layers have spacings that are harmonics of n = 6, i.e., locally n = 12, 18, and 24 which are well lattice matched to the surrounding n = 6 matrix. These harmonic n layer spacings and the vertically running Ruddlesden-Popper defect layers likely form to accommodate local stoichiometry variations encountered during growth. \n\nFor the Sr(n+1)Ti(n)O(3n+1) phases deposited on LSAT (n = 1\u20135 and 10), we investigated the dependence of the optical band gap on dimensionality [n of the Sr(n+1)Ti(n)O(3n+1)] in the series measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry, optical transmission, and cathodoluminescence. First-principles calculations gave insight into the origin of this change in band gap. The thermal conductivity along the c axis of the same phases were measured by time-domain thermoreflectance and compared to atomic-level simulations. For the Sr(n+1)Ti(n)O(3n+1) phases deposited on DyScO3 and GdScO3 (n = 1\u20136), we studied strain-induced ferroelectricity. Density function theory predicts the emergence of a ferroic ground state for n \u2265 3 on DyScO3, which is in agreement with experimental findings. Dielectric properties of these strained thin films were measured over the frequency range from 1 kHz\u2013125 GHz with a broadband, on-wafer technique. The n = 6 Sr(n+1)Ti(n)O(3n+1) film grown on DyScO3 showed a dielectric tunability around 20% with an exceptionally high figure of merit (\u2206K/(K tan \u03b4)) at room temperature (~50 at 10 GHz and ~100 at 5 GHz) that rivals all known tunable microwave dielectrics.\n\nFinally, with meticulous control of the film stoichiometry we establish the intrinsic dielectric properties of SrTiO3 thin film commensurately strained to DyScO3. Direct comparisons of the structural and dielectric properties of stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric films grown on (110) DyScO3 were made. In contrast to non-stoichiometric samples, the stoichiometric film shows the shortest out-of-plane lattice constant, narrow rocking curves, a dispersion-free low-frequency permittivity, a sharp permittivity maximum at the ferroelectric phase transition temperature, and pronounced soft mode behavior.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7997], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Che-hui ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Che-hui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen", "Long Qing Chen", "Zi Kui Liu", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Renee Denise Diehl", "Darrell Schlom", "Xiaoxing Xi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Chair", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Renee Denise Diehl, Committee Member", "Darrell Schlom, Special Member", "Xiaoxing Xi, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MBE", "oxide", "Ruddlesden-Popper", "strain", "tunable dielectrics"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "ERGONOMIC DESIGN AND EVALUATION USING A\nMULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH:\nAPPLICATION TO HAND TOOLS\n", "id": "6745", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1297", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis developed a multidisciplinary design approach for integrating ergonomics and engineering design technology (QFD). A modified HoQ (House of Quality) matrix adapted from QFD was proposed and utilized to systematically identify the critical ergonomic design area corresponding to functional user requirements as well as affective needs of user. A case study of screwdriver design was conducted to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed design methodology. As a result, 26 user satisfaction attributes were identified and classified into 3 user satisfaction dimensions (performance, physical interaction, affective image/impression) based on survey data using a total of 57 participants. With respect to level of experience, participants were divided into two groups. The result of comparison of two groups revealed that there was a clear distinction between two groups in terms of user needs or expectation. Regarding the relative importance of user needs or expectation, inexperienced users focused on the affective image/impression-related user needs while experienced users relatively focused on functionality-related user needs rather than affective image/impression. However, ranks of the user needs were significantly correlated between two groups. Interestingly, design priority of experienced users was distinctly divided while that of inexperienced users scattered across 25 product design attributes. Among the 25 product design attributes, physical handle characteristics were identified as critical ergonomic design areas. This thesis also developed a comprehensive ergonomic evaluation methodology comprising objective measurements and subjective measures associated to user satisfaction. A case study of screwdriver evaluation was conducted in order to prioritize five different screwdriver designs using two experimentations (maximum torque task and constant torque task) and a product-interactive questionnaire. The result, based on data using a total of 15 participants, indicated that the priority of screwdrivers varied over objective measurements and subjective evaluation. An integrated design priority measure, which incorporated 4 objective measures into subjective evaluation criteria corresponding to 26 user satisfaction attributes, was proposed and successfully accessed the priority of five different screwdriver designs from a holistic perspective. Finally, it is expected that the proposed ergonomic design and evaluation methodology could be applied to other hand tools.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1286], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Cheol ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cheol", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds", "M Jeya Chandra", "Ling Rothrock", "Joel B Haight"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds, Committee Chair", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Joel B Haight, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hand tools", "Ergonomic evaluation", "Ergonomic design", "QFD", "Screwdriver"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Viral polymerase mechanism-based strategies for viral attenuation and vaccine development", "id": "24871", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10914", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "RNA viruses replicate as a heterogenous population of mutants dubbed \u2018quasispecies.\u2019 Some of the most life-threatening diseases today are caused by RNA viruses including, Ebola, hepatitis c virus, dengue, west nile and influenza. While some progress has been made over the years, at this time no effective vaccines exist for these pathogens, and demand is high. The RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is responsible for viral genetic diversity. Although a high mutation rate can lead to deleterious changes in the genome, this offers an advantage to the virus: the ability to quickly adapt to a complex host environment, and evade barriers to establishing disease. This adaptability poses a unique challenge, for example, when it comes to developing antiviral drugs and vaccines.\nIn this dissertation, studies on altering the fidelity of the poliovirus (PV) polymerase, 3Dpol, are described using biological evaluation of four 3Dpol derivatives: Ser-64 (G64S), Arg-273 (H273R), Arg-359 (K359R) and Arg-273,Arg-359 (H273R-K359R). Previous biochemical and biological studies performed on PV RdRp have shown that G64S is a high fidelity polymerase and that functions at WT levels and creates less genomic diversity relative to the WT polymerase. In the PV transgenic animal model (cPVR) G64S was attenuated. From this discovery, it was hypothesized, that lack of diversity in the viral population leads to attenuation. However, in our hands the G64S is virulent. At the same time we performed studies with the low fidelity polymerase, H273R. H273R has a 2-3 fold increase in ribonucleotide misincorportation frequency relative to WT, which translates into a 2-3 fold mutation frequency in cell culture. Quantitative increase in mutation frequency, measured by CirSeq, confirmed the mutator phenotype and also suggested RdRp-independent factors may contribute to the generation of the viral quasispecies. H273R was attenuated in the cPVR model and induced neutralizing antibodies. This result suggested that the WT PV RdRp is at the optimal fidelity for virulence. \nLys-359 is a conserved residue in the active site that serves as a general acid catalyst. With the K359R mutant we observe an increase in polymerase fidelity and decrease in replication kinetics relative to WT PV. This resulted in attenuation in mice and generated a protective immune response. Given that this residue is conserved in many RdRps, this study suggests that a universal mechanism-based strategy for vaccine development is possible for RNA viruses. \nWe reasoned that if fidelity is the primary cause of the attenuated phenotype, then a double fidelity mutant combining both a high and low fidelity mutant will have restored virulence. Double polymerase mutants G64S-K359R, G64S-H273R and H273R-K359R were created using existing fidelity mutants. G64S-K359R did not produce any virus by infectious center assay (ICA) and G64S-H273R was unstable after transfection into HeLa cells. The serine-64 reverted back to glycine leaving a H273R PV. H273R-K359R was stable over 4 passages at a low MOI. This double mutant has faster replication kinetics compared to K359R alone, although it still has decreased replication kinetics relative to WT and H273R. We see a restoration of WT fidelity in vitro but not in vivo. H273R-K359R is attenuated in the cPVR transgenic mouse model despite having similar WT fidelity. Attenuation of H273R-K359R in vivo suggests viral replication kinetics plays an integral role in viral virulence. \nTogether, these studies confirm that fidelity, as well as replication speed, are integral to viral virulence and provide insight on rational strategies for vaccine development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10502], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Cheri Annette", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "Annette", "first_name_ssi": "Cheri", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Eugene Cameron", "Richard John Frisque", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Avery August"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Eugene Cameron, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Avery August, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["RNA dependent RNA polymerase", "polymerase fidelity", "poliovirus", "RNA virus", "picornavirus", "vaccine"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Efficient Information Access for Location-Based Services in Mobile Environments", "id": "9936", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1298", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The demand for pervasive access of location-related information (e.g., local traffic, restaurant locations, navigation maps, weather conditions, pollution index, etc.) fosters a tremendous application base of Location Based Services (LBSs). Without loss of generality, we\nmodel location-related information as spatial objects and the accesses of such information as Location-Dependent Spatial Queries (LDSQs) in LBS systems. In this thesis, we address the efficiency issue of LDSQ processing through several innovative techniques.\n\nFirst, we develop a new client-side data caching model, called Complementary Space Caching (CSC), to effectively shorten data access latency over wireless channels. This is motivated by an observation that mobile clients, with only a subset of objects cached, do not have sufficient knowledge to assert whether or not certain object access from the remote server are necessary for given LDSQs. To address this problem, our CSC requests each client to cache a global data view, that is composed of (i) cached spatial objects and (ii) complementary regions that cover the locations of all the non-cached objects. With a global data view cached, CSC enables clients to assert the completeness of LDSQ results locally. Second, we investigate two new types of complex LDSQs, namely, Nearest Surrounder (NS) Queries and Skyline Queries. Both of them have a wide application base. An NS query returns spatial objects along with disjointed angular ranges within which they are the nearest to a given query point. A skyline query retrieves non-dominated spatial objects. An object o is said to be dominated if there is another\nobject o' that is strictly better than o for at least one attribute and is not worse than o for all the other attributes. We conduct in-depth analysis and propose novel techniques to efficiently answer these new queries. Third, we propose an LDSQ processing framework, namely ROAD,\nto support efficient access of spatial objects on a road network. ROAD adopts a search space pruning technique that has not been explored before in this context. In ROAD, a large road\nnetwork is organized as a hierarchy of interconnected regional sub-networks called Rnets, i.e., search subspaces. Further, with two novel concepts, namely, (i) shortcuts, that allow jumps across Rnets to accelerate the search traversal, and (ii) object abstracts, that provide search guidance during traversals, searches supported by ROAD can bypass those Rnets that contain no object of interest. Also, ROAD is flexible to support various LDSQs and objects. \n\nWe conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate the performance of our proposed approaches.

Although WTe2 has been studied for decades, its structure and electronic properties have only recently been correctly described. We explored WTe2 synthesis via chemical vapor transport (CVT) method for bulk crystal, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) routes for thin film material. We employed both experimental and theoretical techniques to investigate its structural, physical and electronic properties of WTe2, and verify that WTe2 has its minimum energy configuration in a distorted 1T structure (Td structure), which results in metallic-like behavior. Our findings confirmed the metallic nature of WTe2, introduce new information about the Raman modes of Td-WTe2, and demonstrate that Td-WTe2 is readily oxidized via environmental exposure. These findings confirm that, in its thermodynamically favored Td form. From our approach of developing WTe2 thin film materials via CVD processes, we have noticed that more reactive tungsten precursors could be the key to carry out WTe2 growth due to hydrogen reduction is the dominant reaction for tungsten trioxide (WO3) tellurization process.

A train accident can causes serious casualties and property damage. Many factors could lead to a train disaster and the defects in rail are one of the major problems. Detection of defects and proper maintenance action for a rail is therefore essential.\n\n     There are two kinds of typical defects in a rail head. They are shelling and transverse defects. Shelling is a horizontal plane defect generated by the sliding and/or rolling the wheel over the rail from shear reversal and is usually located just below the top surface of the rail. The transverse defects are usually generated and grown inside the rail head from the shelling region down into the head. Shelling is not fatal but transverse defects are. Conventional ultrasonic tests (the normal incident technique and the oblique incident technique) have difficulties in detecting the transverse defects under the shelling, because most of the ultrasonic energy is reflected from the shelling. For this reason, the guided wave ultrasonic technique is potentially a suitable method for detecting defects under the shelling. The cross-sectional area of the shelling is much smaller than that of the transverse defects in the guided wave propagation direction. \n\n\tThe purpose of this study is therefore to find an appropriate guided wave mode and frequency for the detection of a transverse defect under the shelling. The phase velocity and group velocity dispersion curves are calculated numerically using a semi-analytical finite element method (SAFE). From the phase velocity dispersion curves, the spacing of the elements in an electromagnetic acoustic transducer (EMAT), an important feature in EMAT design, is determined to generate the appropriate guided waves for reliable defect detection. Characteristics of the guided wave propagation is also explored at various points in the phase velocity dispersion curves using ABAQUS/Explicit, a commercially available finite element method (FEM) package with a simulation of a Lamb type EMAT. Finally, the aspect of the wave scattering of guided waves from several types of defects along with the shelling located in the rail head is examined. \n\n\tThis research provides a new modeling technique to simulate the EMAT loading and can suggest guide lines for a new inspection technique for finding defects in the rail head under shelling using EMATs. Furthermore, the research area can be extended to a study of various types of defects, different location of the defects, different loading positions, various welding zones, and overall changes in rail boundary conditions. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1285], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Chong Myoung ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chong Myoung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Eduard E Ventsel", "Albert Eliot Segall", "Sunil K Sinha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Eduard E Ventsel, Committee Member", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Member", "Sunil K Sinha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ultrasonic", "arbtrary corss section", "guided wave", "rail inspection"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "DATA DEPENDENT OPTIMIZATION VISION ARCHITECTURE", "id": "13507csl180", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13507", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the cardinal problems in computer vision is information overload.

This study utilizes sum frequency generation (SFG) vibration spectroscopy which can selectively detect crystalline cellulose within intact plant biomass, due to the unique requirement of non-centrosymmetric ordering. In this work we found that SFG is sensitive to the molecular structure, crystal structure and mesoscale structure of cellulose inside plant biomass. Obtaining such structural information spanning multiple length scales is not achievable by conventional analytical methods. Therefore, SFG presents a unique opportunity to study the hierarchical structures of cellulose in plant cell walls which are designed for specific biological functions. \nAt the nanoscale, the molecular and crystal structures of cellulose are determined by the covalent bonds as well as hydrogen bonding networks between glucan chains. The peak positions in the SFG spectra of native cellulose I\u03b1 and I\u03b2 were identified through comparison to the vibration frequencies calculated with density functional theory with dispersion corrections (DFT-D2). The frequencies from DFT-D2 calculations allowed the full assignments of the dominant SFG peaks. These are the localized CH2 symmetric (2850, 2886 cm-1) and asymmetric (2920, 2944, 2968 cm-1) stretching vibrations, and the coupled 2O-H (3270 cm-1), 2,3,6O-H (3300\u20123330 cm-1) and 3O-H (3370 cm-1) stretching vibrations. The observation that O-H stretching vibration modes are highly coupled through hydrogen bonds lead to new assignments for the O-H peaks which replaced the incorrect assignments propagating in the literature for more than two decades. These advances in spectral interpretation of cellulose vibrational spectra are critical to utilize SFG analysis for the identification of cellulose crystal structures. \nSFG was employed to distinguish between the native crystal structures (I\u03b1 and I\u03b2) from the artificially-induced polymorphs (cellulose II, IIII and IIIII). This study showed that SFG is sensitive to cellulose crystal structure; due to the non-centrosymmetric ordering of polar cellulose chains within the crystallographic unit cell at the nanometer length scale. The SFG intensity in the O-H stretching region was strong for crystals containing parallel chains (I\u03b2 and IIII) and quite weak for antiparallel chains (II and IIIII) due to the symmetry cancellation of the OH stretching vibrations. \nThe SFG intensity is also dependent on the non-centrosymmetric ordering of functional groups or crystallites over the SFG coherence length which is approximately hundreds of nanometers to microns. Two reference samples of purified cellulose I\u03b2 were used: uniaxially-aligned crystallites and  randomly-packed or aggregated crystallites. It was found that the overall SFG intensities and peak shapes of the alkyl (C-H) and hydroxyl (O-H) stretch modes correlate with the lateral packing and net directionality of cellulose microfibrils at the mesoscale. Cellulose SFG spectra of cell walls from various plant species could be identified into two groups based on the (C-H/O-H) intensity ratios. The first group included antiparallel-packed cellulose microfibrils as found in textile fibers and secondary cell walls of dicots and monocots. The second group included non-antiparallel packed cellulose as found in primary cell walls, algal cell walls, bacterial biofilms and tunicate mantles. This study showed that SFG can distinguish between cellulose within the (primary) walls of actively growing cells and cellulose within (secondary) walls of matured and lignified cells. The (C-H/O-H) intensity ratio was utilized to study the development of cotton fibers from two species, G. hirsutum and G. barbadense, which had different lateral packing at the mesoscale depending on the natural drying process that takes place during the maturation stage. The (C-H/O-H) intensity ratio was also used to determine the mesoscale packing of bacterial cellulose pellicles produced from two strains of G. xylinus. The packing pattern of crystalline cellulose was found to be different on the upper and lower portions of the pellicle and culture time of the bacteria. \nA broadband sum frequency generation spectrometer combined with a microscope (BB-SFG-M) was constructed in order to visualize the heterogeneous nature of cellulose across plant tissues with different cell types.

This study addresses the simultaneous influence of fracture orientation, rock and fluid properties, and flowing conditions on multiphase flow in fractured permeable media at laboratory scale. Displacement of a non-wetting phase (gas or liquid) by capillary imbibition was monitored using X-ray computed tomography (CT). Results were then mimicked using an automated history matching approach to obtain representative relative permeability and capillary pressure curves to further investigate the impact of matrix homogeneity/heterogeneity and boundary shape on the response of the imbibition front. Sensitive analyses, in combination with direct experimental observation, allowed us to explore relative importance of relative permeability and capillary pressure curves to saturation distribution and imbibing font evolution.\nExperimental observations combined with simulation results indicated the impact of fracture orientation on imbibition front evolution was minimal for the time- and length-scales considered in this investigation. While different injection rates and fluid types showed significant differences in the shape of the imbibing front, breakthrough time, and saturation profiles. The speed and shape of imbibing front progressions were found to be sensitive to matrix water relative permeability, capillary pressure contrast between matrix and fracture, and degree of rock heterogeneity. Results from this work also demonstrated conditions that favor co-current, counter-current, and the coexistence of both displacement mechanisms during imbibition. Co-current flow dominates in the case of water displacing air, while counter-current flow dominates in the case of water displacing\nkerosene. The balance of capillarity and relative permeabilities has a significant impact of the shape on the invasion front, resulting in periods of co-current and counter-current imbibition. This work presents direct evidence of spontaneous migration of wetting fluids into a rock matrix embedding a fracture. These observations and conclusions are not limited by the geometry of the system and have important implication for water flooding of naturally fractured reservoir and leak-off retention and migration after hydraulic fracture treatments.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1168], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Chung-Hao ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chung-Hao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Turgay Ertekin", "Derek Elsworth", "Yilin Wang", "Kamini Singha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn, Dissertation Advisor", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Chair", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Yilin Wang, Committee Member", "Kamini Singha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Imbibition", "Computed Tomography", "Fractures", "Capillarity"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "DETERMINATION OF FLUID TRANSPORT PROPERTIES FROM CONE PENETROMETER SOUNDING DATA", "id": "7113", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1651", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work examines the hypothesis that the form and magnitude of the pore fluid pressure field, which develops around an advancing penetrometer, is conditioned by in-situ permeability; correspondingly penetration-induced pore pressures may be used to estimate permeability distribution, on-the-fly. Mechanistic models are developed to describe the steady, partially-drained, fluid pressure field which develops around an advancing penetrometer. These models are used to rationalize the recovery of in-situ permeability profiles ( ) from the cone metrics of excess pore pressures ( ), end-bearing ( ), and sleeve friction ( ), recovered during penetration. The determination of permeability is possible only if penetration-generated pore pressures are partially drained. To enable permeabilities to be recovered from uCPT data gathered on-the-fly, plausible limits are defined for the transition from partially-drained to undrained behavior during penetrometer advance (Chapter 1). These show that permeability may be determined from the excess pore pressures through a relation of the form   for   where the penetration response is both partially drained and steady.\nWhere the penetration-induced pore pressure field is undrained, tip-local permeabilities cannot be determined. Instead, the undrained pore pressures may be used to recover undrained pore pressure coefficients from the instantaneous pressure data, and consolidation coefficients from their dissipation. To represent this behavior, anomalous pore pressure dissipation records are accommodated in cavity expansion models in terms of pore pressures developed as a result of undrained dilation in the soil within the tip process zone (Chapter 2). These results reveal that the consolidation coefficient, undrained strength and shear modulus may be determined directly from the dissipation response, and confirmed against independent measurements.\nSteady models for the excess pore pressure field are applied to define continuous profiles of permeability based on pore pressure data from uCPT profiles. These predictions are validated against independent measurements of permeabilities from slug tests, direct-push permeameter (DPP) profiling, and grain-size correlations completed at an unusually well characterized field site in Nauen, Germany (Chapter 3). These confirm that permeabilities may indeed be estimated from cone metrics, with the estimates of average permeabilities of the order of   higher than those measured from direct-push permeameter (DPP) profiling.\nPermeabilities interpreted from cone metrics recovered on-the-fly are also compared with a dense suite of measurements from a variety of independent methods. These include measurements by standard direct-push permeameters, by low-disturbance thin-tipped permeameters, and through grain size correlations recovered from high-quality Vision-CPT. These characterizations, completed at the Geohydrologic Experimental and Monitoring Site (GEMS), Kansas (Chapter 4), show that sample disturbance during penetration by a standard uCPT is minor; permeabilities measured at the tip of a standard cone (60\u00a1\u00c6 tip and 10 cm2 area) are therefore representative of in situ permeabilities. Furthermore, direct-push permeameter measurements, show remarkably close agreement with the relation  , where undrained data are excluded.\nThese results indicate that within feasible ranges where steady penetration by uCPT will be partially drained, permeability magnitudes may be recovered directly from cone measured metrics recovered during active penetration. The proposed evaluation of permeability, on-the-fly, requires that the penetration is partially drained, and the pore pressure distribution has reached a dynamic steady state. Notably, this analysis is not applicable for suspected dilatant silts that return negative pore pressures during penetration. The extensive suite of independently measured permeability profiles enabled validating of permeability evaluated from the on-the-fly method. These analyses show that the relation   exhibits promise as a practical means of prediction of fine-scale permeability structure within feasible ranges where the penetration response is both partially-drained and steady.\nIn addition, related solutions have been applied to the problem of defining the pore fluid pressure field that develops around a penetrometer that self-embeds from freefall into the seabed (Appendix A). \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1637], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Dae Sung ", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dae Sung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Abraham S Grader", "Peter B Flemings", "Chris J Marone"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth, Committee Chair", "Abraham S Grader, Committee Member", "Peter B Flemings, Committee Member", "Chris J Marone, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydraulic conductivity", "soil permeability", "cone penetration test"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ION CONDUCTION MECHANISMS IN POLYMER ELECTROLYTES FOR LITHIUM BATTERIES AND FUEL CELLS, AND CRYSTAL ENGINEERING OF CYCLOPHOSPHAZENES\n", "id": "11018", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1454", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The work described in this thesis is divided into two parts. The first part focuses on the synthesis and characterization of polyphosphazenes for polymer electrolytes in lithium batteries and fuel cells. The overall goal is to gain an understanding of the ion conduction mechanisms in these materials to aid future designs of ion conducting polymers. The second part of this thesis describes the design and synthesis of cyclophosphazenes with asymmetric spirocyclic side groups. The reaction mechanism for the selective formation of the cis-isomer is proposed and the inclusion behavior of crystals formed by these molecules was studied. The theme that ties the two parts of this thesis is the chemistry of phosphazenes.\n\nChapter 1 outlines the fundamental concepts for polymer electrolytes used in lithium batteries and fuel cells. The properties of the polymers that are used as electrolytes and the current understanding of the ion conducting mechanism in these materials are described. Furthermore, the chemistry and applications of phosphazenes is also outlined. \n\nChapter 2 is a study on the ion conduction mechanism in a polyphosphazene electrolyte. Lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate (LiTf), lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imidate (LiTFSI), magnesium trifluoromethanesulfonate (MgTf2) and magnesium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imidate (MgTFSI2) were dissolved in poly[bis(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)phosphazene] (MEEP) to compare the effect on solvent-free polymer ionic conductivity of monovalent versus divalent cations, and two anions with different degrees of dissociation. The polymer electrolytes with the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imidate anion had higher ionic conductivities even though the glass transition temperatures, which reflected polymer molecular motion, were higher than those of their counterparts with the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion. Furthermore, polymer electrolytes with magnesium salts achieved their maximum conductivity at lower salt concentrations than the counterparts with lithium salts. The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity of the solid solutions was fitted to the Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher (VTF) equation. The pseudo-activation energy term, B, of the VTF equation showed a strong dependence on the anion present. The result suggests that the dominant mobile species is the anion, while the cation remains relatively bound to the polymer. The manuscript has been submitted to the journal Solid State Ionics.\n\nChapter 3 describes a synthetic method to produce a proton conductive polymer membrane with a polynorbornane backbone and inorganic-organic cyclic phosphazene pendent groups that bear sulfonic acid units. This hybrid polymer combines the inherent hydrophobicity and flexibility of the organic polymer with the tuning advantages of the cyclic phosphazene to produce a membrane with high proton conductivity and low methanol crossover at room temperature. The ion exchange capacity (IEC), the water swelling behavior of the polymer, and the effect of gamma radiation crosslinking were studied, together with the proton conductivity and methanol permeability of these materials. A typical membrane had an IEC of 0.329 mmol g-1 and had water swelling of 50 wt%.  The maximum proton conductivity of 1.13 x 10-4 S cm-1 at room temperature is less than values reported for some commercially available materials such as Nafion.  However the average methanol permeability was around 10-9 cm s-1, which is one hundred times smaller than the value for Nafion. Thus, the new polymers are candidates for low-temperature direct methanol fuel cell membranes. The author was responsible for the synthesis of the materials used in this study and this work was done in collaboration with Shih-To Fei, Richard M. Wood, David A. Stone and Hwei-Liang Chang. The manuscript is published in the J. Membrane Science (year 2008, volume 320, pages 206-214).\n\nChapter 4 deals with the characterization of water absorbed in proton conducting membranes. The proton conducing membranes were hydrated with 2H2O and 2H T1 NMR relaxation was used to probe the molecular dynamics of the water. The state of water in the proton conducting membrane was correlated to the chemical and morphological properties of the polymer. An understanding of the state of water in proton conducting membranes is as important as the morphological characterization of the proton conducting membrane because water is the medium for proton transport. Furthermore, this vital information will aid in the design of future proton conducting membranes, especially ones that can operate at low humidity and at temperatures above 100 &#730;C. This work was done in collaboration with Professor Alan Benesi and Professor Michael Hickner. The intended target for submission is Journal of Physical Chemistry B.\nChapter 5 describes layer-by-layer (LbL) films of poly[bis(methoxyethoxyethoxy)phosphazene] (MEEP) and poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) that are  assembled by utilizing the hydrogen bonding between these two polymers. These films show controlled thickness growth, high ionic conductivity, and excellent hydrolytic stability. The ionic conductivity of these films is studied by changing the assembly pH of initial polymer solutions and thereby controlling the hydrogen bonding characteristics. Despite similar film composition, MEEP/PAA LbL films assembled at higher pH values have enhanced water uptake and transport properties, which play a key role in increasing ion transport within the films. At fully humidified conditions, the ionic conductivity of MEEP/PAA is 7 x 10-4 S cm-1, over one order of magnitude higher than previously studied hydrogen bonded LbL systems. Finally, free standing films are isolated from low-energy surface substrates, which allows for bulk characterization of these thin films. This work was done in collaboration with Avni A. Argun, J. Nathan Ashcraft, Marie K. Herring, and Professor Paula T. Hammond from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The manuscript has been accepted in Chemistry of Materials. (year 2010, volume 22, pages 226\u2013232)       \n\nChapter 6 describes the synthesis and characterization of two novel cyclic phosphazenes with asymmetric spiro rings. The phosphazene molecules were synthesized via reactions of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene with chiral amino alcohol residues. The reactions showed preferential formation of the cis isomer possibly due to the delocalization of the lone pair electrons of the spirocylic nitrogen, which reduces its ability to solvate protons. Crystals of these phosphazenes were analyzed by x-ray crystallography which confirmed the formation of cis isomers and showed their ability to include guest molecules within the crystal lattices.  The selective inclusion of epoxides by one of the phosphazenes was an effective method for the separation of thermally sensitive guest molecules. This work was carried out in collaboration with Anne Jackson and Toshiki Fushimi, and has been published in Dalton Transactions. (DOI: 10.1039/b925734a)\n\nAppendix A describes the exploratory synthesis of a novel sulfonated polyphosphazene. The sulfonic acid group of this new polyphosphazene is tethered to the polyphosphazene backbone by a flexible side chain. The synthetic strategy of the polymer is compared to sulfonated polyphosphazenes synthesized previously. The logic behind this work is to examine the effect of distancing the sulfonic acid group from the polymer to the proton conductivity of the polymer.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1439, 1440], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, David Kim Yong", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "Kim Yong", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock", "Harry R Allcock", "Alan James Benesi", "John V Badding", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock, Dissertation Advisor", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Chair", "Alan James Benesi, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer electrolytes", "fuel cells", "lithium batteries", "phosphazenes", "ion conduction mechanism", "crystal engineering"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Characterizing Melanoma Adhesion Dynamics: Thrombin Mediated Interactions and Polymorphic Neutrophil Deformability", "id": "29308", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12634", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In order for cancer metastasis to occur, tumor cells must separate from the primary tumor and enter the circulatory system, and then extravasate through the vascular endothelial cells in order to form a secondary tumor at a distant site. This work focuses on the adhesion of melanoma cells to the endothelium in response to various conditions.\nSoluble fibrin serves as a cross-linker between endothelial cells and melanoma cells. We used an aptamer, a small oligonucleic acid sequence with a distinct tertiary structure, to inhibit thrombin activity, and therefore formation of soluble fibrin. The apparatus used, a parallel-plate flow chamber, allows for the perfusion of cells over a confluent monolayer, therefore modeling physiological flow conditions over the endothelium in vitro. The results indicated that the aptamer was able to effectively inhibit thrombin activity and subsequent melanoma adhesions decreased after addition of the aptamer. \nMelanoma interactions involving the effects of activation and sequestration of polymorphic neutrophils (PMNs) were also investigated. PMN activation and sequestration has been associated with inflammation of the pulmonary microcirculation. It was found that activation, which triggers changes in PMN deformability, has a significant effect on the aggregation of melanoma cells on the endothelium whereas environments with high concentrations of PMNs did not yield significant changes. The results suggested that activation plays a key role in aiding metastatic melanoma cells in adhering to the endothelium due to a decrease in neutrophil deformability. This effect was reversed by the addition of cytochalasin B, a mycotoxin that disrupts actin filaments and increases deformability of PMNs, and a decrease in melanoma aggregations on the endothelium was observed. Thus, these results suggest that deformability plays a larger role than accumulation of PMNs in aiding melanoma cells to adhere to the endothelium.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11900], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Deborah Snyder", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "Snyder", "first_name_ssi": "Deborah", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheng Dong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheng Dong, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cancer", "melanoma", "thrombin", "fibrinogen", "fibrin", "polymorphic neutrophils", "cellular adhesions", "flow assays"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Parascience and Revolution: The Paranormal Mind in Twentieth-Century Literature and Science", "id": "15101dpl151", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15101", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parascience and Revolution examines the concept of the paranormal mind in post-1945 literature and science. The notion of a mind capable of telepathy, clairvoyance, and other psychic abilities has fascinated writers and philosophers alike ever since the rise of the psychological sciences during the nineteenth century. While such theories are normally dismissed as pseudoscience, the unusual durability and constant reinvention of the paranormal mind across the long twentieth century points to an overlooked site of intellectual production at the borders of science, art, and epistemology. This project investigates the paranormal mind not as a relic of premodern thought but rather as a collective byproduct of the modern scientific process and the literary imagination. By introducing a new term\u2014parascience\u2014I identify the epistemic space where anomalous scientific concepts are retrieved, recycled, and eventually returned to mainstream culture. In addition, I make the case for literature as a primary catalyst in the ongoing renewal of paranormality. This study considers works of speculative and ethnic fiction that explicitly theorize paranormal cognition through traditional disciplines like physics and biology as well untraditional ones like parapsychology and ethnoscience. More specifically, it analyzes the transformation of the paranormal mind in the fictions of Philip K. Dick, Alan Moore, Greg Bear, Ruth Ozeki, and Sesshu Foster while also recognizing its intellectual gestation in the dissident science of thinkers like Frederic Myers, Hugh Everett, and Lynn Margulis. Residing at the intersection of occultism, philosophy of science, and literary criticism, this project argues for the centrality of pseudoscience to contemporary science studies and extends occult phenomenology from high modernism to twenty-first century speculative and ethnic fiction.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16388], "author_name_tesi": "Lee, Derek Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Lee", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Derek", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Squier ", "Susan Squier ", "Mark Morrisson", "Tina Chen", "Jonathan Eburne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Squier , Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Squier , Committee Chair", "Mark Morrisson, Committee Member", "Tina Chen, Committee Member", "Jonathan Eburne, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["occult", "paranormal", "science studies", "speculative fiction", "ethnic fiction", "pseudoscience", "modernism"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Examining Narrative Persuasive Messages for Hybrid Vehicles", "id": "26248", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11533", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Because of their environmentally beneficial features, hybrid vehicles have gained popularity in the U.S. automotive market.
