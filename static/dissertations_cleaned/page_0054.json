The structure of kinesin-1 consists of two heads attached through flexible neck-linkers to a coiled-coil stalk that ends in a cargo-binding domain. Kinesin-1 derives energy from ATP hydrolysis and walks in a hand-over-hand manner with each head taking 16-nm steps along the microtubules. In published work from the Hancock lab, single molecule experiments were performed to understand the mechanochemical transitions that underlie kinesin stepping by attaching 30 nm gold nanoparticle to one of the two heads of kinesin-1 heads through a 14 amino acid Avi-tag. Using Interferometric Scattering or Dark Field Total Internal Reflection Microscopy, millisecond temporal resolution and 1 nm spatial precision were achieved in this work. Similar experiments that showed somewhat different behavior were performed by the Tomishige lab, using a PEG-tag, which is shorter and less elastic tether than an Avi-tag, and was attached at a different location on the head. \nInterpreting these measurements taken at millisecond timescales requires a more detailed understanding of the microsecond-scale diffusion of the kinesin head and coupled nanoparticle. Specifically, it is important to understand how the attached nanoparticle affects the dynamics of the head and whether the nanoparticle faithfully tracks the head position. To address these questions, the present study used Brownian Dynamics modelling to simulate the three-dimensional dynamics of a 30-nm nanoparticle tethered to a kinesin-1 head via either an Avi-tag or PEG-tag. In the two-head-bound state, a nanoparticle tethered by an Avi-tag tracked the head more accurately along the axis of the microtubule than a particle tethered through a PEG-tag, but tracking accuracy perpendicular to the microtubule were identical for the two tethers. In the one-head-bound state, both heads tracked nanoparticles with similar accuracy, but the PEG-tag created a larger force in the neck-linker domains than did the Avi-tag. According to these data, an Avi-tag is a better tag for tracking the head, as it more accurately tracks head position and creates less perturbation in the natural system than a PEG-tag. \nTo better study the effects of different experimental parameters on nanoparticle tracking accuracy, a simpler model consisting of a nanoparticle tethered to a glass surface was used.  In the absence of added experimental noise, particle size and contour length of the tether were found to have major effects on tracking accuracy, defined as the Root-Mean-Squared (RMS) error between imaged and true particle position, but the persistence length had only a minor influence. With simulated experimental noise added, the Avi-tag and PEG-tags gave similar RMS error of tracking, demonstrating that noise inherent in the imaging process had a larger effect on the measured particle position than did the mechanical properties of the tether. Kinesins are implicated in neurodegenerative diseases and are targets for anti-cancer therapeutics, and by better understanding the inner workings of the motors, it is hope that this work will contribute to these efforts.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14484], "author_name_tesi": "Jethva, Janak Prakashchandra", "last_name_ssi": "Jethva", "middle_name_ssi": "Prakashchandra", "first_name_ssi": "Janak", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. William O.

These industries encounter segregation due to the difference in physical and mechanical properties of particulates. The general goal of this research was to study percolation segregation in multi-size and multi-component particulate mixtures, especially measurement, sampling, and modeling.\nA second generation primary segregation shear cell (PSSC-II), an industrial vibrator, a true cubical triaxial tester, and two samplers (triers) were used as primary test apparatuses for quantifying segregation and flowability; furthermore, to understand and propose strategies to mitigate segregation in particulates. Toward this end, percolation segregation in binary, ternary, and quaternary size mixtures for two particulate types: urea (spherical) and potash (angular) were studied. Three coarse size ranges 3,350-4,000 \u00b5m (mean size = 3,675 \u00b5m), 2,800-3,350 \u00b5m (3,075 \u00b5m), and 2,360-2,800 \u00b5m (2,580 \u00b5m) and three fines size ranges 2,000-2,360 \u00b5m (2,180 \u00b5m), 1,700-2,000 \u00b5m (1,850 \u00b5m), and 1,400-1,700 \u00b5m (1,550 \u00b5m) for angular-shaped and spherical-shaped were selected for tests. Since the fines size 1,550 \u00b5m of urea was not available in sufficient quantity; therefore, it was not included in tests. Percolation segregation in fertilizer bags was tested also at two vibration frequencies of 5 Hz and 7Hz. The segregation and flowability of binary mixtures of urea under three equilibrium relative humidities (40%, 50%, and 60%) were also tested. Furthermore, solid fertilizer sampling was performed to compare samples obtained from triers of opening widths 12.7 mm and 19.1 mm and to determine size segregation in blend fertilizers.\nBased on experimental results, the normalized segregation rate (NSR) of binary mixtures was dependent on size ratio, mixing ratio, material, strain rate, and strain. Segregated fines mass of potash and urea particles was significantly different for the same size ratio (p<0.05). The (NSR) and segregation rate of fines for binary mixtures were higher for larger size ratios, as expected (2.4:1.0>2.0:1.0>1.7:1.0). Segregation rate was the highest and lowest for mixing ratios 33:67 and 67:33, respectively, when coarse mean size was 3,675 \u00b5m. The NSR decreased when the strain rate was decreased from 1.0 Hz>0.5 Hz>0.25 Hz for the binary size ratios 1.7:1.0, 2.0:1.0, and 2.4:1.0 (p<0.05). The NSR was dependent on multi-size mixtures (binary>ternary>quaternary). At strain rate of 0.5 Hz for the size ratio 2.0:1.7:1.0 in ternary mixture, the NSR for potash (0.83 kg/kg-h) was higher than the NSR for urea (0.21 kg/kg-h) (p<0.05). The NSR increased with the increase in strain from 2% to 10%. At strain of 6% and strain rate of 0.5 Hz, for the size ratio 2.0:1.7:1.0 in ternary mixture, the NSR for potash (0.83 kg/kg-h) was higher than the NSR for urea (0.21 kg/kg-h) in ternary mixtures (p<0.05).\nFor size ratios 2.0:1.0 and 1.7:1.0, only 2.8% and 7.0% of decrease in NSRs were recorded for increase in relative humidity by 10 points (from 40% to 50%), respectively, whereas 36.0% and 45.0% decrease in NSRs were recorded for increase in relative humidity by 20 points (from 40% to 60%), respectively (p<0.5).  Additionally, flowability was quantified using a Cubical Triaxial Tester (CTT) for size ratios 2.0:1.0 and 1.7:1.0, angle of internal friction increased from 31.3\u00b0 to 35.9\u00b0 to 39.0\u00b0 and 27.4\u00b0 to 32.0\u00b0 to 36.0\u00b0 when relative humidity increased from 40% to 50% to 60%, respectively (p<0.05), whereas cohesion remained close to zero (p>0.05).  \nAn innovative time-sequence procedure for sampling of bags was devised and implemented. The size guide numbers (SGNs) of 10-10-10 blend samples using 19.1 mm width trier were larger than those obtained using the 12.7 mm width trier, there were no substantial differences between the SGNs and uniformity index (UIs) of the two different width triers, i.e., except for 10-10-10 (sample from second quarter) from blend plant 1, all SGNs and UIs were within 7 and 2, respectively. Eleven out of the twelve samples from bagged fertilizers using 12.7 mm vs. 19.1 mm had the same outcomes, i.e., only one sample from blend plant 3, of                  10-10-10 (sample from third quarter) using 12.7 mm vs. 19.1 mm had a conflicting outcome \u2013 the sample obtained using 19.1 mm width trier (SGN=259, UI=47) passed, whereas, the sample with 12.7 mm trier (SGN=256, UI=47) failed the AOAC chemical analysis test.\nTwo triers of opening widths 12.7 mm and 19.1 mm were used to determine percolation segregation under vibration conditions. The percent mass retained on sieve number 8 (opening width = 2.36 mm) was the highest (28%). Sieve numbers 7 (2.80 mm) and 10 (2.00 mm) retained 21% and 17% and followed the sieve number 8 (2.36 mm). The particle size distributions were not significantly affected at the frequency of 5 Hz (p>0.05). The SGN and UI increased with time at the frequency of 7 Hz. The SGN and UI of samples collected by 12.7 mm and 19.1 mm triers were not significantly different (p>0.05).\nResults of binary size ratios of potash at three strains of 2%, 6%, and 10% each at strain rates of 0.25 and 0.5 Hz and for urea at strains of 2%, 6%, and 10% each at strain rates of 0.25 and 1.0 Hz were used to develop and validate a convective and diffusive model. Based on validation results the segregated fines mass values for size ratio 2.0:1.0 were: (1) within the 95% CI for potash at 6% strain and 0.5 Hz strain rate, (2) similar but not within the 95% CI for potash at 10% strain and 0.5 Hz strain rate, and (3) close but not within the 95% CI for urea at 6% strain and 0.5 Hz strain rate. \n\tA dimensional analysis model included the binary, ternary, quaternary mixtures of urea and potash at strains of 2%, 6%, and 10% and strain rates of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 Hz. Strain rate of 1.0 Hz was included at strain of 6% for binary mixtures only. Developed dimensional analysis model was validated for binary and ternary size ratios of urea and potash at strain rate of 0.5 Hz. Based on the experimental data, it seems binary mixtures of potash results were sufficient to represent the percolation segregation in binary, ternary, and quaternary mixtures of urea and potash with reasonable accuracy (CoV of \u00b115%). The validation results showed that the CoV of the modeled values to the experimental values were 18%, 15%, and 11% for binary mixtures of urea and potash at strains of 2%, 6%, and 10% and strain rate of 0.25 Hz. \n\tIn conclusion, the binary, ternary, and quaternary mixtures provided the needed framework to predict the segregation behavior in continuous mixtures under different motion conditions. Based on initial results, only a limited number of tests need to be performed using multi-size and multi-component mixtures to determine the extent of segregation in continuous mixtures, the number of sizes and components should be determined based on operating conditions. Percolation segregation in blended fertilizer could be minimized by changing physical, mechanical and environmental parameters of particulate materials. The percolation segregation was modeled for time-dependent and time-independent conditions to minimize the number of tests to improve materials and process efficiency.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [188], "author_name_tesi": "Jha, Anjani Kumar", "last_name_ssi": "Jha", "middle_name_ssi": "Kumar", "first_name_ssi": "Anjani", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Virendra Puri", "Eileen Wheeler", "Douglas Brian Beegle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Virendra Puri, Committee Chair", "Eileen Wheeler, Committee Member", "Douglas Brian Beegle, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Modeling", "Sampling", "Coarse and Fines Sizes", "Primary Segregation Shear Cell", "Segregation", "Continuous Mixtures", "Particulate Materials"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Learning and Decision Optimization in Data-Driven Autonomous Systems", "id": "13369dkj5042", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13369", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Modern human-engineered systems like self-driving cars, smart buildings, power grids etc., are becoming increasingly complex so that they present unparalleled challenges for their design, verification and control. Furthermore, these systems generate data at an unprecedented rate. Even though the data is supposed to be of great help in understanding these systems, it has already presented unique challenges for storage, leave alone their analysis and interpretation (for example, Google is supposed to analyze around 20 Petabytes of data everyday and it is expected that the data generated by systems industry will very soon surpass that). Machine learning provides very powerful statistical techniques for analysis and interpretation of large amounts of data and recently has seen great improvements pushed by large-scale applications in software industries. While there has been huge advancements in the individual fields of machine learning and control theory, unfortunately the modern decision systems for complex systems do not take into account the recent advances of machine intelligence for intelligent control. The role of machine learning in systems engineering is still unexplored; however, it holds tremendous potential for achieving human-like (or better) performance in modern autonomous systems, which is the ultimate goal of Artificial Intelligence. Establishing a synergistic relationship between state-of-the-art control and machine learning techniques holds the key to the synthesis of complex systems with high degrees of autonomy.\n\nThis thesis explores various concepts and makes contributions to multiple areas for understanding of complex data-driven systems for their decision and control. Among several challenges of complex data-driven systems, one of the central challenge is understanding and representation of data using tools from mathematics and statistics. In this regard, this thesis presents several results for modeling of sequential data using Markov models and Deep Learning. The proposed ideas are tested on various electro-mechanical systems like combustion in lean pre-mixed systems, fatigue in polycrystalline alloys, event detection in sensor networks and lead-acid battery systems. This thesis brings together a completely interdisciplinary approach using techniques from mathematical analysis, theoretical computer science, machine learning, game theory and control theory to present a framework to solve various challenges posed by modern autonomous systems with fundamental contributions to robotic motion planning and temporal data analysis. In order to bring together control theory and machine learning for a class of modern autonomous systems (e.g., automatic driving in urban scenarios with traffic rules), the thesis presents research for the conditions under which we can bring together these fields in an optimal fashion while keeping desired properties like safety, stability, etc..\n\nThis thesis makes fundamental contributions to analysis and representation of time-series data using symbolic dynamics and information theory. In particular, algorithms for order estimation and compact representation of Markov models of time-series data are proposed which have computational advantages. Furthermore for analysis of high-dimensional temporal data, an algorithm using Deep learning and Gaussian processes is proposed. The thesis also makes fundamental contributions to motion planning of robotic systems where a class of sampling-based feedback motion planning algorithms are proposed. The algorithm is extended for motion planning of multiple robots using game theory. Furthermore, data-driven algorithms are proposed to bring together learning and planning in complex robotic systems.

Transitive-closure spanners are a common abstraction for applications in access control, property testing and data structures.\nWe show a connection between 2-TC-spanners and local monotonicity reconstructors. A local monotonicity reconstructor, introduced by Saks and Seshadhri (SIAM Journal on Computing, 2010), is a randomized algorithm that, given access to an oracle for an almost monotone function f : [m]^d -> R, can quickly evaluate a related function g : [m]^d -> R which is guaranteed to be monotone.

Intuitively, a function is Lipschitz if it is not too sensitive to small changes in its inputs. In various applications, it is important (often crucial) that the input function satisfies the Lipschitz property. Given query access to a function, can we test that it is Lipschitz? Better still, can we restore or reconstruct the Lipschitz property in a (possibly non-Lipschitz) function by modifying it suitably? In this thesis, we initiate the study of testing and reconstruction of the Lipschitz property of functions. Our primary motivation for studying the Lipschitz property stems from its applications to data privacy. \n\nFormally, a function f : D \u2192 R is Lipschitz if d_R(f(x),f(y)) \u2264 d_D(x,y) for all x, y in D, where d_R and d_D denote the distance metrics on the range and domain of f, respectively. We investigate the Lipschitz property of functions under the well- studied model of property testing (Rubinfeld and Sudan; Goldreich, Goldwasser and Ron) and local property reconstruction (Ailon, Chazelle, Comandur and Liu; Saks and Seshadhri). A property tester has to distinguish functions with the property (in this case, Lipschitz) from functions that differ from every function with the property on many values. A local reconstructor restores a desired property (in this case, Lipschitz) in the following sense: given an arbitrary function f and a query x, it returns g(x), where the resulting function g satisfies the property, changing f only when necessary. If f has the property, g must be equal (or at least \u201cclose\u201d) to f .

With its growing use, and social and political awareness, efforts are being made to harness it in the most efficient manner. However, a number of challenges preclude efficient and optimum operation of wind farms. Wind resource forecasting over a long operation window of a wind farm, development of wind farms over a complex terrain on-shore, and air/wave interaction off-shore all pose difficulties in materializing the goal of the efficient harnessing of wind energy. These difficulties are further amplified when wind turbine wakes interact directly with turbines located downstream and in adjacent rows in a turbulent atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). In the present study, an ABL solver is used to simulate different atmospheric stability states over a diurnal cycle. The effect of the turbines is modeled by using actuator methods, in particular the state-of-the-art actuator line method (ALM) and an improved ALM are used for the simulation of the turbine arrays. The two ALM approaches are used either with uniform inflow or are coupled with the ABL solver. In the latter case, a precursor simulation is first obtained and data saved at the inflow planes for the duration the turbines are anticipated to be simulated. The coupled ABL-ALM solver is then used to simulate the turbine arrays operating in atmospheric turbulence.\nA detailed accuracy assessment of the state-of-the-art ALM is performed by applying it to different rotors. A discrepancy regarding over-prediction of tip loads and an artificial tip correction is identified. A new proposed ALM* is developed and validated for the NREL Phase VI rotor. This is also applied to the NREL 5-MW turbine, and guidelines to obtain consistent results with ALM* are developed.\nBoth the ALM approaches are then applied to study a turbine-turbine interaction problem consisting of two NREL 5-MW turbines. The simulations are performed for two ABL stability states. The effect of ABL stability as well the ALM approaches on the blade loads, turbulence statistics, unsteadiness, wake profile etc., is quantified. It is found that ALM and ALM* yield a noticeable difference in most of the parameters quantified. The ALM* also senses small-scale blade motions better. However, the ABL state dominates the wake recovery pattern. The ALM* is then applied to a mini wind farm comprising five NREL 5-MW turbines in two rows and in a staggered configuration. A detailed wake recovery study is performed using a unique wake-plane analysis technique. \nAn actuator curve embedding (ACE) method is developed to model a general-shaped lifting surface.

Many serious security issues have their origin in non-legitimate use of code. For example, code exploiting a vulnerability can be used in computer worms and viruses; code used without acquiring proper permission could conduct intellectual property theft; or code inserted with a malicious intention may be abused as spyware, botnet, or backdoors to cause many additional security problems.\n\nIn this study, we consider two types of security issues that can be caused by a non-legitimate use of program code. First, we investigate self-propagating code, computer worms. To defend against worm spread, we propose PWC, a proactive worm containment solution for enterprises. PWC can stop - instead of just slow down an infected host from releasing worm scans after merely 4 scans. Motivated by the observation that a worm uses a sustained outgoing packet rate, PWC gains infection awareness seconds before a signature or filter can be generated. To overcome denial-of-service possibly caused by such characteristic indicators of infection, PWC develops two new white-host detection (uninfected host detection) techniques: (a) the vulnerability time window lemma, and (b) the relaxation analysis. PWC does not rely on content-based signatures and thus it can quickly contain polymorphic worms. PWC is also resilient to containment evasion. PWC is not sensitive to worm scan rate, and is not protocol specific. Due to white-host detection, PWC causes minimal denial-of-service. Evaluation based on real traces and worm simulations demonstrates that PWC significantly outperforms Virus Throttle [1] in terms of number of released worm scans, number of hosts infected by local scans, and denial-of-service effects.\n\nSecond, we study detection of illegally reused code. Reusing code can be done with malicious motives. Code theft is accomplished by cracking, reverse engineering, breaking into an enterprise network, spying, bribing, etc. In a sense, absence of effective methods to detect fraudulent use of program code has a negative influence to security. For a practical and effective method to detect software plagiarism,\nwe propose value based plagiarism detection system (VaPD). Based on an observation that some critical runtime values are hard to be replaced or eliminated by semantics-preserving transformation techniques, we introduce a novel approach to dynamic characterization of executable programs. Leveraging such invariant values, our technique is resilient to various control and data obfuscation techniques. We show how the values can be extracted and refined to expose the critical values and how we can apply this runtime property to help solve problems in software plagiarism detection. We have implemented a prototype with a dynamic taint analyzer atop a generic processor emulator, QEMU 0.9.1. Our experimental results show that our value-based plagiarism detection method successfully discriminates 34 plagiarisms obfuscated by SandMark, plagiarisms heavily obfuscated by KlassMaster, C programs obfuscated by Thicket, and executable files obfuscated by Loco/Diablo.\n\nIn summary, this study presents two security measures against non-legitimate use of program code.

Phased array antennas are well suited to satisfy the growing demand with its ability to increase channel capacity and steer multiple beams.  Of the various types of antennas, microstrip antennas would be a good common element in constructing the array antenna due to their low cost, low weight, conformability, and easy integration into arrays or use with microwave integrated circuits.\nIn this research work, a four element phased array antenna aimed for 15GHz has been monolithically implemented on silicon substrates using monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) technology.  The array fabricated herein consists mainly of microstrip radiating patches and feed networks including coplanar waveguide (CPW) \u2013to- Microstrip (MS) line transitions, phase shifters, Wilkinson power dividers, and DC blocking filters for CPW and MS lines.  Each component of the fabricated array antenna was carefully designed for operational efficiency, and validated using a custom simulation tool.  All circuits were realized on a high resistivity silicon (HRS) substrate surface-stabilized by polysilicon.  This configuration achieved a significant reduction in RF losses by immobilizing the surface charges populated in the interface of SiO2/Si.  The monolithic integration of the array antenna into silicon not only makes the whole circuitry compact, but also reduces the cost utilizing mature CMOS technology.\nA single microstrip patch showing a resonance frequency of 14.8GHz with a return loss (S11) of 21dB is connected to the feed networks based on CPW lines through a CPW-to-MS transition.  This transition, as well as DC blocking filters for both CPW and MS lines exhibited the possibility for wideband applications by showing wide 3dB bandwidths of 168%, 123%, and 130%, respectively.  Two types of phase shifter designs were constructed to compare performance: a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) phase shifter, and a ferroelectric phase shifter.  Despite a high operating voltage of up to 300V, the ferroelectric phase shifter utilizing permittivity tunability of (Ba,Sr)TiO3 (BST) films was adopted as the phase shifting device in the array due to its high phase shift capability (~30o/dB), low leakage current level (~300nA at a bias voltage of 100V) and notably high operational reliability.  The four element phased array antenna completely integrated on silicon showed a total scan capability of 10o measured at its resonance frequency, 14.85GHz with a return loss of 32dB.  \nThe phased array antenna presented herein will provide a basic view and understanding of the process of monolithic integration into silicon using MMIC technology.  Improvements of antenna performance in terms of steering capability, side lobe level (SLL), half power beam width (HPBW) and bandwidth could be accomplished by further research on design modification as well as on process optimization for array antennas.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6289], "author_name_tesi": "Ji, Taeksoo ", "last_name_ssi": "Ji", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Taeksoo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jian Xu", "Osama O Awadelkarim", "Jose A Kollakompil", "Vijay Krishna Varadan", "Jerzy Ruzyllo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jian Xu, Committee Member", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member", "Jose A Kollakompil, Committee Member", "Vijay Krishna Varadan, Committee Chair", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phased array antenna", "MMIC", "phase shifter", "beam steering"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "LOCALIZATION ALGORITHMS FOR WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK SYSTEMS\n", "id": "6319", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6644", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Advances in the micro-electro-mechanical system and\nwireless communication technology have enabled researchers to\ndevelop large-scale wireless sensor networks with a large number\nof inexpensive and small sensors. Many applications are developed\nbased on wireless sensor networks, such as habitat monitoring,\nnavigation, and objects detection and tracking. By its nature,\nlocation awareness is indispensable for the implementation of\nthese applications.\n\nIn this dissertation, we study two issues related to sensor and\nobject localization in wireless sensor networks. We first examine\nthe sensor localization algorithms, which are used to determine\nsensors' positions in ad-hoc sensor networks. Most existing sensor\nlocalization methods suffer from various location estimation\nerrors that result from ranging errors, complex network topologies\nand anisotropic terrain, etc. We explore the characteristics of\ndimensionality reduction techniques and propose three sensor\nlocalization algorithms based on the multidimensional scaling\ntechniques. They include a centralized sensor localization\nalgorithm, a distributed sensor localization algorithm, and a\nrobust sensor location algorithm based on multidimensional\nscaling. The results of our experiment demonstrate that these\nalgorithms are effective in positioning sensors\n\nPositioning all sensors in a sensor network usually consumes a\nlarge amount of time and energy. In many applications based on\nsensor networks, there is no need to estimate the location of all\nsensors in a sensor network. Sometimes, only sensors within a\ngiven direction or region need to be located. We propose the\nconcept of differentiated sensor localization. Three\ndifferentiated sensor localization methods are also proposed,\nwhich can selectively locate only one or a specific set of\nsensors.\n\nGiven the sensor location information known, many surveillance\ntasks may then be carried out with sensor networks. One of the\nmajor applications of sensor networks is locating objects and\ntracking their movement. We investigate the problem of using\nlarge-scale sensor network to locate large continuous objects and\ntrack their boundary movement.

Detecting and tracking the large continuous objects\nposes many challenging research issues which have not been\nadequately addressed in previous research. Capturing their spread\nand boundary information is usually an efficient approach for\nmonitoring them. A distributed algorithm is proposed in this\nresearch to locate the boundary of continuous objects.

Semiconductors, such as silicon and germanium, have wide transmission windows extending into the mid- and even the far-infrared. They possess higher refractive indices and lower intrinsic absorption than silica within this wavelength range, making such materials ideal waveguiding media for infrared light when forming fiber waveguides with a silica glass cladding. Semiconductors can be precisely doped so they give superior optoelectronic responses, adding new functions to optical fibers. However, the performance of the fibers fabricated by existing methods is limited by the high optical losses due to the existence of grain boundaries inside the cores. These boundary defects scatter photons, resulting in increased optical losses, and trap carriers, degrading the optoelectronic responses. \n        In this dissertation work, a scanning laser crystallization method for fibers is developed and utilized to overcome the drawbacks mentioned above. The pure silicon and germanium fibers are first deposited inside silica capillaries as amorphous states using high pressure chemical vapor deposition. Then a 488 nm continuous wave argon ion laser is employed as the heating source for crystallizing the semiconductor cores. Different from conventional thermal annealing, in which nucleation randomly initiates along the fiber, the focused laser heats up and melts the semiconductors locally, and the molten zone is moved directionally along the fiber by precisely moving the fiber. The fibers produced this way possess a single crystalline nature over a length on the scale of centimeters (~10,000 x improvement compared to thermal annealing). With small core diameters (< 6 \u03bcm), the length to diameter aspect ratio is increased to ~1600, making these the largest of any single crystal fibers produced by established methods. Because of the short laser irradiation time (1ms-10ms), which can be controlled by the fiber moving speed, the core-cladding interface remains both structurally and chemically smooth, and there is no significant oxygen diffusion from the glass cladding into the core. Because of these attributes, the fibers perform as low-loss waveguides. The removal of the grain boundaries also contributes to a higher photo-responsivity (the ability of generating currents under external electric field in response to light absorption). In order to understand the laser heating process and find a way to control the crystal growth, we perform finite element modeling to investigate how the fiber moving speed and the laser irradiation power affects the temperature profile induced inside the fiber cores. A processing diagram in the \u201claser power \u2013 scanning speed\u201d space is proposed, and by comparing with the experimental results, we find that there exists an optimum range for the laser power and scanning speed, within which single crystal growth is preferred.\n        After the laser processing, there is observable residual thermal stress in the semiconductor core. This thermal stress can be relaxed by etching away the surrounding glass cladding, which indicates that the thermal stress originated from the core-cladding interface. By using X-ray Laue diffraction, the full strain/stress tensor of the single crystal silicon microwire embedded in the glass capillary is determined. An unusual triaxial tensile strain is revealed, which has not been reported in silicon. We performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations using the experimental strain components as the input and predicted the electronic band structure change of the silicon microwire under such strain conditions. Strain can be utilized as a tool to tune material properties such as the optical band gap, carrier mobility and light emission efficiency. The fibers could also be used in infrared imaging as a way to spectroscopically distinguish different tissue components. \n        Lastly, the fabrication of hydrogenated amorphous silicon and germanium based, conformally coated fabrics using the high pressure chemical vapor deposition is summarized, and preliminary Schottky junction solar cell behavior is demonstrated. These fabrics could be utilized as the platform for potential flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as wearable solar collection textiles.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16232], "author_name_tesi": "Ji, Xiaoyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Ji", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaoyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkatraman Gopalan", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Suzanne E.

The present work delineates Li-ion cell behaviors at low temperatures by a combined experimental and modeling approach. An electrochemical-thermal coupled model, incorporating concentration- and temperature-dependent transport and kinetic properties, is applied and validated against 2.2Ah 18650 cylindrical cells over a wide range of temperatures (-20\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C) and discharge rates.\n\nDetailed resistance analysis indicates that performance limits at -20\u00b0C depend on not only discharge rates but also thermal conditions. The principal performance limitations are found to be Li+ diffusion in the electrolyte and solid-state Li diffusion in graphite particles. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the dramatic effects of cell self-heating upon electrochemical performance. A nonisothermal Ragone plot accounting for these important thermal effects is proposed for the first time for Li-ion cells and more generally for thermally coupled batteries.\n\nTo extend the driving range of EVs at low temperatures, preheating Li-ion batteries to room temperature is proposed as a practical method based on Li ion cell's strong self-heating effect. The present model is used to simulate the process of heating Li-ion batteries from subzero temperatures. Three heating strategies using battery power as heating source, namely self internal heating, convective heating and mutual pulse heating, are proposed and compared. Their advantages and disadvantages are discussed in terms of capacity loss, heating time, system durability, and cost. Model predictions reveal that Li-ion batteries can be heated from -20\u00b0C to 20\u00b0C at the expense of only 5% battery capacity loss within 2 minutes using mutual pulse heating with high-efficiency dc-dc converter, implying considerable potential for improved driving range of EVs in cold weather conditions.  Whenever external power is available, high frequency AC signal with large amplitude is a preferred choice, offering benefits to both heating power and battery life.\n\nTo reduce the charging time of EVs at low temperature, a new charging protocol CCCS, (constant current followed by constant lithium stoich) has been proposed. It consumes less time than the traditional CCCV method, and also avoids capacity loss due to lithium plating. Based on this new protocol, further attempts have been made to reduce the charging time by (1) heating batteries, (2) cell design and material property optimization. Model predictions demonstrate that the pre-heating-charging method is able to reduce the charging time from 3 hours to 18 minutes. Solid phase diffusion and electrode transport are identified to be the rate-limiting mechanisms for charging by both theoretical analysis and model prediction. This study also illustrates how these limitations are related to cell design parameters and material transport properties quantitatively. By alleviating these limitations, charging can be reduced to within 5 minutes, comparable to the time of refilling a fuel tank in gasoline vehicles.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9347], "author_name_tesi": "Ji, Yan ", "last_name_ssi": "Ji", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Chao Yang Wang", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Michael John Janik", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lithium", "battery", "electrochemistry", "modeling", "low temperature", "electric vehicles"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Big Data or Small Stories?

In order to make this data more accessible to readers, journalists tend to present statistical content about social issues and problems by accompanying them with exemplars or case studies that illustrate the data pattern. But, these exemplars do not always fully capture the complexity of the data patterns, yet they end up playing an important role in shaping user perceptions of the issue because they are more vivid than baserate information. How can we counter this biasing effect of isolated, non-representative exemplars and make readers pay more attention to baserates? Journalists have tended to employ visualization techniques to attract greater reader attention to baserates, but with limited success. This dissertation proposes that interactive visualization of big data is the answer. Interactive visualization can increase information processing of the baserates through two potential mediators: Vividness and Engagement. Interactive information visualization can make the pallid baserate information more vivid and therefore easier to process. Alternatively, by requiring users to act on the visualization, it can draw their attention to the baserate information and therefore serve to engage them with the data-rich content. \nThe study design involved a 2 (baserate-exemplar consistency) \u00d7 3 (interactivity of information visualization) \u00d7 2 (issue topic) mixed-design experiment.

By empirically examining the interactivity effects in individuals\u2019 issue perception formation and related outcomes, this study revealed distinctive mechanisms through which interactive visualization affects users\u2019 information processing and emotional responses. The findings show that interactive visualization is positively associated with user psychology, and further leads to perceived vividness and user engagement with the content. Compared to static visualization, interactive visualization is effective in motivating systematic processing of the baserate information, which positively influences accuracy of issue perception as well as personal attitude. Results help uncover the psychological processes through which individual perceptions are influenced by journalistic evidence, baserates in particular, in a highly visual and interactive media environment. The study also generates useful findings to inform ethical journalistic practices and effective interface designs for communicating big-data information.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10319], "author_name_tesi": "Jia, Haiyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Jia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Haiyan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["S.

Chapter 2 uses stochastic orders to derive conditions under which greater environmental variability of bidders' information enhances a winning bidder's expected profit and a bid-taker's expected revenue. The study provides insights on the bid-takers' information-disclosure decisions in auction design, as well as bidders' information-improving decisions. \nChapter 3 further investigates the role of auctioneers (eBay, e.g.) in online auctions and auctioneers' optimal fee policies. In practice, auctioneers assist sellers in conducting auctions and usually collect two kinds of fees: a reserve fee depending on the reserve price, and a final value fee that is a function of the closing value. The study formulates the problem as a Bayesian game with an auctioneer and a private-type seller, and derives the equilibria. The study finds that multiple optimal fee policies exist, and recommends two sets of policies for implementation. The first is the set of linear policies, with the focus being the percentage final value fee, constant reserve fee policy. This policy is optimal if and only if the seller's value follows a power distribution. The second is the set of optimal policies, with three representative cases: a final value fee only policy, a reserve fee only policy, and a small (large) percentage final value fee with a decreasing (increasing) reserve fee. An auctioneer can achieve optimality with any of these three policies. \nMotivated by remanufacturing practices in industry, Chapter 4 investigates a remanufacturing inventory system with key characteristics: lost sales, heterogeneous qualities of used product returns, short product lifetimes, and rapidly eroding resale and salvage values of remanufactured products. The study establishes a general remanufacturing framework, and studies two inventory systems under the framework, remanufacture-to-stock (RTS) and remanufacture-to-order (RTO). RTS remanufactures selected returned products with one period leadtime, and stocks remanufactured items to satisfy future demand; whereas, RTO stocks selected returned products, and remanufactures them via an expedited process after observing the demand. The study derives optimal and myopic policies under the general framework, RTS and RTO, and finds that: (1) In RTS, the optimal policy is a multi-dimensional base-stock policy; in RTO, the optimal policy is intractable but the myopic policy delivers satisfiable solution. (2) RTS and RTO perform well only for some parameter settings. (3) A hybrid system that switches between RTS and RTO in the product lifecycle performs significantly better than RTS and RTO, and performs close to the general framework. The study recommends the hybrid system for implementation.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6971], "author_name_tesi": "Jia, Zheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Jia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Xu", "Susan H Xu", "Vijay Krishna", "Terry Paul Harrison", "Elena Katok", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Xu, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan H Xu, Committee Chair", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Member", "Terry Paul Harrison, Committee Member", "Elena Katok, Committee Member", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["inventory management", "auctions", "auctioneers", "remanufacturing"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Infant Temperament, Maternal Emotional Availability at bedtime, and Infant Sleep From 1 to 6 Months", "id": "25001", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11303", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Infant sleep develops dramatically during the first half year of life, in a dynamic, bidirectional exchange between intrinsic infant characteristics and the caregiving environment.

To study the age-hardening process in heat-treatable aluminum alloys, the Gibbs energies of the strengthening metastable phases, e.g. theta' and theta\", are critical. However, those data are not included in the existing thermodynamic databases for aluminum alloys due to the semi-empirical nature of the CALPHAD approach. In the present study, the thermodynamics of the Al-Cu system, the pivotal age-hardening system, is remodeled using a combined CALPHAD and first-principles approach. The formation enthalpies and vibrational formation entropies of the stable and metastable phases in the Al-Cu system are provided by first-principles calculations. Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS's) are applied to model the substitutionally random fcc and bcc alloys. SQS's for binary bcc alloys are developed and tested in the present study. Finally, a self-consistent thermodynamic description of the Al-Cu system including the two metastable theta\" and theta' phases is obtained. During welding of heat-treatable aluminum alloys, a detrimental phenomenon called constitutional liquation, i.e. the local eutectic melting of second-phase particles in a matrix at temperatures above the eutectic temperature but below the solidus of the alloy, may occur in the heat-affected zone (HAZ). In the present study, diffusion code DICTRA coupled with realistic thermodynamic and kinetic databases is used to simulate the constitutional liquation in the model Al-Cu system. The simulated results are in quantitative agreement with experiments. The critical heating rate to avoid constitutional liquation is also determined through computer simulations. Besides the heat-treatable aluminum alloys, intermetallic compounds based on transition metal aluminides, e.g. NiAl and FeAl, are also promising candidates for the next-generation of high-temperature structural materials for aerospace applications due to their high melting temperature and good oxidation resistance. Many important properties of B2 aluminides are governed by the existences of point defects. In the present study, Special Quasirandom Structures (SQS's) are developed to model non-stoichiometric B2 compounds containing large concentrations of constitutional point defects. The SQS's are then applied to study B2 NiAl. The first-principles SQS results provide formation enthalpies, equilibrium lattice parameters and elastic constants of B2 NiAl which agree satisfactorily with the existing experimental data in the literature. It is unambiguously shown that, at T=0K and zero pressure, Ni vacancies and antisite Ni atoms are the energetically favorable point defects in Al-rich and Ni-rich B2 NiAl, respectively.

It is hard to find an algorithm which reduces computing time without sacrificing accuracy. Due to wide application area, research on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has attracted huge interest. On L1-regularized least squares regression problem, specifically on an application to hyperspectral imaging, we empirically show that ADMM has outstanding performance in both computing speed and accuracy. In particular, we test the effect of increasing penalties on the performance of ADMM on both synthetic and real-life problems; and in our numerical experiments, we compare a variable penalty ADMM (VP-ADMM) algorithm with split Bregman method (SBM).\n    A hyperspectral image is a three dimensional data-cube in which the first two dimensions describe pixels in the 2D image and the third dimension records the electromagnetic reflectance of the corresponding pixel under varying wavelengths. Due to finite resolution, each pixel is composed of different materials which can be identified by exploiting their electromagnetic reflectance under varying wavelengths. Since most of the materials have tiny proportion in the combination, they can be safely omitted. We call the other ones which are dominant as endmembers. Therefore, for a fixed pixel, the data along the third dimension can be considered as a linear combination of the spectra of the endmembers of that pixel. Since only a few materials are dominant, the data-cube is quite sparse in the number of mixing endmembers with positive weight. The inverse problem of weight resolution can be modeled as an L1 regularized least squares problem. Numerical results show that the time spent for VP-ADMM to obtain similar resolutions is just 20% of that for SBM.\n    In conclusion, we demonstrate that VP-ADMM is superior on solving both random and real-life large scale problems.

This chronic neural developmental disorder persists throughout patients\u2019 life and causes enormous emotional distress and economic burden for family members. Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder. Despite decades of research, the etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia is still unclear, and the treatment of this disorder is largely depending on the anti-psychosis drugs partially relieving the symptoms but with many side effects. It is important to have a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of schizophrenia in order to find new treatment for the disease. However, so far there are very limited animal models that can be used to study the mechanisms of schizophrenia and related disorders.  \nGABAergic neural transmission deficits have long been proposed to be an important pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Recent genetic and genomic studies have identified mutations in GABA-related genes in a substantial amount of schizophrenia patients. We have recently reported several mutations in nlgn2, a gene encoding cell adhesion molecule neuroligin 2 (NL-2), in a group of SCZD patients.  NL-2 is critical for GABAergic synapse formation and function. Our previous in vitro experiments showed that one of the NL-2 mutations, R215H, is a loss-of-function mutation that failed to support GABAergic synapse formation and function. Here, we introduced the single point mutation R215H into mouse genome and generated the NL-2 R215H knock-in (KI) mouse line. We found that NL-2 R215H KI mice display anxiety like behaviors, impaired pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), working memory deficit, and hypersensitive stress response, partially recapitulating schizophrenia-like symptoms. Functionally, we discovered that NL-2 R215H KI mice have reduced GABAergic synapse development, decreased GABAergic neural transmission, and impaired hippocampal activation toward acute stress. Transcriptomic analyses through RNA-seq revealed a number of genes in the NL-2 R215H KI mice that are susceptible genes in patients with psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia patients. Our studies suggest that these newly generated NL-2 R215H KI mice may be a unique mouse model for the study of SCZD and related psychiatric disorders, in particular those disorders caused by GABAergic deficits. Future studies on this mouse model may provide new insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of psychiatric disorders and lead to potential new drug treatment.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13633], "author_name_tesi": "Jiang, Dongyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Jiang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dongyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gong Chen", "Gong Chen", "Bernhard Luscher", "Yingwei Mao", "Nanyin Zhang", "Aimin Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gong Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Gong Chen, Committee Chair", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "Yingwei Mao, Committee Member", "Nanyin Zhang, Outside Member", "Aimin Liu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neuroligin 2", "R215H mutation", "schizophrenia", "psychiatric disorders", "GABAergic deficits"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Social Identity, Social Ties and Social Capital\nA Study in Gaming Context", "id": "16251", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2398", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work will focus on how different social relationships, namely shared identity and personal tie, will impact cooperative behavior, a form of social capital.

Social relations are considered a major source of social capital. However, social relationships of different kinds have different underpinning mechanisms that govern behaviors, so I am wondering if these differences can lead to different consequences.

The continually shrinking gate-oxide thickness, necessitated by the requirement of higher gate capacitances for high drive current, results in direct tunneling and excessive leakage currents in metal-oxide-Si field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). To obtain high gate capacitance and inhibit tunneling, relatively thick insulators of high dielectric constants (high-k) are needed in place of gate oxides in MOSFETs. The research in this thesis will cover a series of issues related to the scaling of submicron devices.\n\tIn the first part of this thesis we examined the plasma-process induced damages in thin-gate oxide MOSFETs and its identification and characterization through electrical measurements. We found that, with the aggressive shrinking of oxide thickness around and below 50\u00c5, conventional transistor parameter measurements such as threshold voltage (Vth), transconductance (Gm) and subthreshold swing (S) failed to resolve differences in devices with variable degree of plasma-process induced damage. We demonstrated that in these thin-oxide MOSFETs the gate leakage current (Ig) is the only transistor parameter which can detect plasma-processing induced changes in oxide charge and interface states. These results are interpreted in terms of the strong dependence of Ig on trap-assisted tunneling which dominates conduction in oxides within the studied thickness regime.\n\tIn subsequent studies, thin-gate oxide MOS capacitors and MOSFETs were subjected to Fowler-Nordheim (FN) stress and Hot-Carrier (HC) stress, respectively, and tested with deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) to monitor trap generation during plasma process as well as during device operation. Charge states in SiO2 and Si/ SiO2 interface states were observed under different FN stress temperatures and their causes were attributed to carrier injection during the stress. For the first time bulk Si defects are reported to be generated by FN stressing on thin gate oxides which raises a serious concern of carrier mobility in channel region of corresponding MOSFETs. During HC stress, we found that HC stress in thin-oxide transistors promotes interface damage while oxide charge trapping becomes less significant. The observed degradation is no longer localized near the drain side.\n\tIn the second part of the thesis, we focus our studies on the electrical properties of high-k gate stack systems. Different high-k dielectrics, SrTa2O6, ZrSiO4, ZrO2 and HfO2 prepared by liquid source misted chemical deposition, and TiO2 prepared by chemical vapor deposition were used as the insulators in metal-insulator-Si (MIS) capacitors which were examined using CV/IV and DLTS. It is revealed, for the first time, that the accumulation capacitance of the MIS with the high-k dielectric is strongly dependent on the measuring temperature and frequency. The capacitance dependence on temperature in the MIS with the high-k dielectric is seen to proceed in an opposite direction to that of MOS capacitors while the capacitance dependence on frequency in the MIS is significantly larger than that of MOS capacitors. An equivalent circuit model is proposed and the discrepancy is explained by the impedance contributions from a thin and low quality interfacial layer, between the high-k dielectric and the Si substrate, often inadvertently incorporated during the high-k dielectric growth. These observations call for efforts to be put towards the careful evaluation and possible elimination of this low-quality interfacial layer from gate dielectric stacks.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3159], "author_name_tesi": "Jiang, Jiayu ", "last_name_ssi": "Jiang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiayu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Osama O Awadelkarim", "S Ashok", "Mark William Horn", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Christopher Roman Wronski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Chair", "S Ashok, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Christopher Roman Wronski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thin oxide", "high k", "gate dielectrics", "characterization"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "DESIGN AND MODELING OF A MOTION AMPLIFIER USING AN AXIALLY-DRIVEN\nBUCKLING BEAM", "id": "6294", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3174", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    For active materials such as piezoelectric stacks, which produce large forces and small displacements, motion amplification mechanisms are often necessary -- not simply to trade force for displacement, but to increase the output work transferred through a compliant structure. Here, a motion amplifier for obtaining large rotations from small linear displacements produced by a piezoelectric stack is built and tested. The concept for this motion amplifier uses elastic (buckling) and dynamic instabilities of an axially driven buckling beam. The optimal design of the buckling beam end conditions was determined from a static analysis of the system using Euler\u2019s elastica theory. This analysis was verified experimentally. A stack-driven, buckling beam prototype actuator consisting of a pre-compressed PZT stack (140 mm long, 10 mm diameter) and a thin steel beam (60 mm x 12 mm x 0.508 mm) was constructed. The buckling beam served as the motion amplifier, while the PZT stack provided the input actuation. The experimental setup, measuring instrumentation and method, the beam preloading condition, and the excitation are fully described. The frequency response of the system for three preloading levels and three stack driving amplitudes was obtained. A maximum 16\u00b0 peak-to-peak rotation was measured when the stack was driven at amplitude of 325 V and frequency of 39 Hz. The experiments on the details of period-n motions and the effects of beam preload were also conducted.\n\n    Since the amplifier is driving a large mass at the pinned end, for simplicity, the mass of the buckling beam is neglected and the system is modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom, non-linear system. The beam simply behaves a non-linear rotational spring having a prescribed displacement on the input end and a moment produced by the inertial mass acting on the output end. The moment applied to the mass is then a function of the beam end displacement and the mass rotation. The system is then modeled simply as a base-excited spring-mass oscillator.\n\n    Results of the response for an ideal beam using the SDOF model agree with the experimental data to a high degree. Loading and geometric imperfections are also studied to determine the sensitivity of the actuator. The behavior with slight imperfection is similar to the response for the ideal beam and the experimental results; the response is not particularly sensitive to imperfection.\n\n    Parameter studies for the ideal buckling beam amplifier were conducted using the validated spring-beam model; these can be used as guidance for improving the design of the motion amplifier and finding the optimal operational conditions for different applications.

As the evolution of Building Information-modeling (BIM) shows great potential to motivate integrated design and delivery, the current manual review process, which is time-consuming and error-prone, is facing a transformation with the adoption of advanced technology in a more collaborative environment.

Among all the vibration-based damage identification methods, the frequency-shift-based method is more preferred due to its simplicity and reliability. However, the current practice of frequency-shift-based damage identification encounters two severe limitations, namely, deficiency of frequency measurement data and low sensitivity of frequency shift to damage effects.  Therefore, this thesis aims to advance the state-of-the-art of the frequency-shift-based damage identification by addressing the aforementioned two limitations of this method.\n\nFirst, a novel approach utilizing tunable piezoelectric circuitry is proposed to address the issue of deficiency of frequency measurement data.  The key idea of this approach is to use the tunable piezoelectric circuitries coupled to the mechanical structure to favorably alter the dynamics of the electro-mechanical integrated system.  On one hand, the integration of piezoelectric circuitries can introduce additional resonant frequencies and vibration modes into the frequency response function.  On the other hand, tuning the circuitry elements (i.e., the inductors) may alter the dynamic characteristics of the electro-mechanical integrated system, and hence results in a family of frequency response function measurements.  Thus, by integrating tunable piezoelectric circuitries to the structure and appropriately tuning the circuitry elements, one can obtain a much enlarged dataset of natural frequency measurements for damage identification.  Guidelines on favorable inductance tuning that can yield the optimal damage identification performance are also developed.  Analyses show that when the inductances are tuned to accomplish eigenvalue curve veerings between system eigenvalue pairs, the enriched frequency measurement data can most effectively capture the damage information, and hence results in the most accurate damage identification.  An iterative second-order perturbation based algorithm is developed to identify the damage features (i.e., location and severity) from the measured frequency changes before and after damage occurrence.  Numerical analyses and case studies on benchmark beam and plate structures are carried out to demonstrate and verify the proposed new method.  Numerical results show that the damage identification performance can be significantly improved by using the proposed new approach with favorable inductance tuning.\n\nTo address the second issue, low sensitivity of frequency shifts to damage effects, another new approach based on the concept of sensitivity-enhancing feedback control is proposed.  The key idea of this approach is to use active feedback control to appropriately assign the closed-loop eigenstructure (both eigenvalues and eigenvectors) to enhance the frequency sensitivity to mass/stiffness damage.  To achieve the best performance of frequency sensitivity enhancement, a constrained optimization problem is formulated to find the optimal eigenstructure assignment for the closed-loop system, which leads to the optimal sensitivity-enhancing control.  In addition, multiple closed-loop systems can be obtained from different sensitivity-enhancing controls, and these closed-loop systems provide a much enlarged dataset of natural frequency measurements for damage identification.  Therefore, by designing a series of sensitivity-enhancing controls and utilizing the natural frequencies of the resulting closed-loop systems for damage identification, both of the two major limitations of the frequency-shift-based damage identification are overcome.  Numerical analyses and case studies on a benchmark beam structure are carried out to demonstrate and verify the proposed new method.  Results show that the frequency sensitivity to stiffness reduction in the beam can be significantly enhanced by applying sensitivity-enhancing control to the beam structure.  It is also demonstrated that the proposed method is effective in damage identification and is robust against uncertainties in frequency measurements.\n\nTo fulfill the requirement of an accurate finite element model for the sensitivity-enhancing control approach of damage identification, a frequency-based iterative model updating method is developed using the same concept of sensitivity-enhancing control.  With this, the sensitivity-enhancing control approach can be used for dual functions of modeling updating and damage identification.  The effectiveness of this model updating method is verified through numerical analyses on an example beam structure.\n\nA laboratory experiment is designed and conducted to verify the sensitivity-enhancing control approach for frequency-shift-based damage detection.  In the experiment, a system identification technique is utilized to identify a mathematical model for controller design and system analysis, and hence frees the requirement of having an analytical model as in the original approach.  The eigenstructure assignment-based constrained optimization scheme is used to design sensitivity-enhancing controls to enhance the frequency sensitivity to mass variations in the beam structure.  Experimental results show that the frequency sensitivity to mass variations can be significantly enhanced by applying the designed controller to the beam structure.\n\nFinally, future research work towards the improvement and implementation of the proposed damage identification approaches is recommended.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3868], "author_name_tesi": "Jiang, Lijun ", "last_name_ssi": "Jiang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lijun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kon Well Wang", "Christopher Rahn", "Edward C Smith", "Heath F Hofmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kon Well Wang, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Edward C Smith, Committee Member", "Heath F Hofmann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Structural Health Monitoring", "Structural Damage Detection", "Vibration", "Smart Structures", "Piezoelectric Circuitry", "Active Control"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "quantum phase transition in strongly correlated systems\n", "id": "8502", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3894", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we investigated the strongly correlated phenomena in bilayer quantum Hall effect, inhomogeneous superconductivity and Boson Hubbard model. Bilayer quantum Hall system is studied in chapter 2. By using the Composite Boson (CB) theory developed by J. Ye, we derive the ground state, quasihole and a quasihole-pair wave functions from the CB theory and its dual action. We find that the ground state wave function is the product of two parts, one in the charge sector which is the well known Halperin's (111) wave function and the other in the spin sector which is non-trivial at any finite d due to the gapless mode. So the total  groundstate wave function  differs from the well known (111) wave function at any finite d . In addition to commonly known multiplicative factors, the quasihole and quasihole-pair wave functions also contain non-trivial normalization factors multiplying the correct ground state wave function.\n  \nThen we continue to  study the quantum phase transition from the excitonic superfluid (ESF) to\na possible pseudo-spin density wave (PSDW) at some intermediate distances driven by the magneto-roton minimum collapsing at a finite wavevector. We analyze the properties of the PSDW\n   and explicitly show that a square lattice is the favored lattice. We suggest that correlated\n   hopping of vacancies in the active and passive layers in the PSDW state leads\n   to very large and temperature-dependent drag, consistent with the experimental data.\n   Comparisons with previous microscopic numerical calculations are\n   made. Further experimental implications are given.\n   \n   In chapter 3, we investigate inhomogeneous superconductivity.  Starting from the Ginzburg-Landau free energy describing\n the normal state to Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state\n transition, we evaluate the free energy of seven most common lattice structures: stripe, square, triangular,  Simple Cubic (SC), Face centered Cubic (FCC),  Body centered Cubic (BCC) and Quasicrystal (QC). We find that  the stripe phase,\n  which is the original LO state, is the most stable phase. This result may be relevant to the detection of the FFLO state in some heavy fermion compounds and\n  the pairing lattice structure of fermions with unequal populations on the BCS side of the Feshbach resonance in\n  ultra-cold atoms.\n  \n  In chapter 4, the Boson Hubbard model is studied by duality transformation.  Interacting bosons at filling factor $ f=p/q $ hopping on a lattice\n    can be mapped to interacting vortices hopping on the dual lattice subject to a fluctuating\n    {em dual} `` magnetic field\" whose average strength through a dual plaquette is equal to the boson density $ f=p/q $.\n    So the kinetic term of the vortices is the same as the Hofstadter problem\n    of electrons moving in a lattice in the presence of  $f=p/q $ flux per plaquette. Motivated by this mapping, we study the Hofstadter\n    bands of vortices hopping in the presence of magnetic flux\n    $ f=p/q $ per plaquette on the 5 most common bipartite and frustrated lattices namely square, honeycomb, triangular,\n    dice and kagome lattices. We count the total number of bands and determine the number of minima in the lowest band and their locations. We also numerically calculate\n    the bandwidths of the lowest Hofstadter bands in these\n    lattices, which directly measure the mobility of the dual\n    vortices. The less mobile the dual vortices are, the more likely the bosons are in a superfluid state.\n    We find that, except for the kagome lattice at odd $ q $,  they  all satisfy the exponential decay\n    law $ W = A e^{-cq} $ even at the smallest $ q $. At given $ q $, the bandwidth $ W $ decreases in the order:\n    triangle, square and honeycomb lattice. This indicates that the domain of\n    the superfluid state of the original bosons increases in the order of the corresponding direct\n    lattices: honeycome, square and triangular.\n    When $ q=2 $, we find that the lowest Hofstadter band\n    is completely flat for both kagome and dice lattices. There is a gap on the kagome lattice, but no gap on dice\n    lattice. This indicates that the  boson ground state at half filling with nearest neighbor hopping on kagome lattice\n    is always a superfluid state. The superfluid state remains\n    stable slightly away from half filling. Our results show\n    that the behaviors of bosons  at or near half filling  on kagome lattice are\n    quite distinct from those on square, honeycomb and triangular lattices\n    studied previously.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3867], "author_name_tesi": "Jiang, Longhua ", "last_name_ssi": "Jiang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Longhua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain", "Gerald Dennis Mahan", "Milton Walter Cole", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain, Committee Chair", "Gerald Dennis Mahan, Committee Member", "Milton Walter Cole, Committee Member", "Andrew Leonard Belmonte, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FFLO", "Bilayer quantum Hall system", "boson Hubbard model"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "&#65279;LinkIT: Exploring the use of a serious educational game for risk communication\n\n", "id": "11466", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4493", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In today&#8223;s hectic environment, people are facing with risks in a plethora of ways.

In astrocytes, endocytosis is particularly important for the uptake of nutrients. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying astroglial endocytosis are poorly understood. Using live fluorescence imaging with FM dye, we identify a rapid and constitutive endocytosis mechanism in cultured astrocytes. The endocytic uptake of FM dye is much faster than that of transferrin and the internalized FM dye is not colocalized with clathrin, indicating a clathrin-independent endocytic pathway. Moreover, this rapid endocytosis is caveolae-independent as indicated by intact FM dye uptake after blocking caveolae formation and lack of colocalization of FM puncta and caveolin.  \nIn addition, rapid endocytosis is independent of dynamin but potently regulated by the early endosomal protein Rab5. After being internalized, FM dye is quickly sorted through early endosomes and transported to lysosomes. Interestingly, this rapid form of endocytosis is substantially regulated by intracellular Ca2+. The neural and gliotransmitters ATP and glutamate induce an increase of intracellular Ca2+ in astrocytes, which greatly enhances rapid endocytosis. Furthermore, ATP is internalized through the same endocytic pathway as FM dye. This suggests a potential feedback control of the ATP signaling pathway in astrocytes. Moreover, amyloid beta peptide also significantly increases the rapid endocytosis through increasing intracellular Ca2+ in astrocytes. These results suggest that astroglial cells posess a unique endocytic pathway that is independent of clathrin and dynamin but tightly regulated by intracellular Ca2+ in response to physiological and pathological stimuli. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4386], "author_name_tesi": "Jiang, Min ", "last_name_ssi": "Jiang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gong Chen", "Bernhard Luscher", "Richard W Ordway", "Andrew Ewing", "Matthew Whim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gong Chen, Committee Member", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Chair", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Andrew Ewing, Committee Member", "Matthew Whim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["astrocytes", "endocytosis", "clathrin"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Customized Real Time Restaurant Recommendation System", "id": "27099", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8268", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "According to a Search Engine Land survey conducted in 2014, 88% of consumers have read online reviews to determine the quality of a local business and 72% consumers say that positive reviews make them trust a local business more. What is a local business? It can be a medical practice, a restaurant, or a gym. The result of this survey shows the important role of reviews in deciding to choose a local business.  Among various types of business, restaurant is the most searched category by users in Yelp. However, oftentimes people just search a restaurant by using word \u201crestaurant\u201d, while the word \u201crestaurant\u201d means differently to different individuals.

These acoustic transducers consist of transmitters and receivers. Transmitters send out acoustic waves through the borehole. Waves then get received by an array of receivers. Through the phase delay of the arriving signals, one can calculate the mechanical and acoustic properties of the borehole rock formation and this information can be used further to indicate lithology, determine porosity, detect over-pressured zones, check well-to-well correlation, etc. This dissertation covers exhaustively on original research work on LWD acoustic transmitters and receivers, including design and optimization, fabrication, and testing.\n\nSome necessary theoretical background was given in the Theories chapter. The fundamentals of elasticity, wave motion and wave equations were introduced. Wave theories on acoustic impedance matching (reflection and refraction), and attenuation were also covered briefly. Piezoelectricity constitutive equations and piezoelectrically stiffened wave equations were outlined. And theories on different piezoelectric vibration modes were presented in details, as well as the three-port network, equivalent circuit, and electrical impedance matching analysis of piezoelectric transducers. The compositing effect on piezocomposite transducers was explained and verified experimentally also in this chapter. These theories are central for understanding and optimizing LWD transducers.\n\nOne of the research objectives is to design LWD transmitters that meet acoustic requirements such as transmitting power, transmitting voltage response (TVR), directivity, etc. In the Optimization chapter, focus was given to a detailed methodology for applying COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae to achieve this goal. Material properties, meshing techniques, and physics coupling were presented in details. Displacement frequency responses of two piezocomposite transducer designs were compared and general design strategies were come up with. Targeted studies confirmed these design strategies. Two important strategies is disintegrating the height direction to reduce the height mode resonance around 8-10 kHz, and slanting the piezoelectric ceramic pieces to broaden response. A comparison of acoustic performance parameters including acoustic field spatial distribution, absolute acoustic pressure, TVR and directivity was made between the two designs. An extensive comparison between d33 and d31 configurations revealed the advantage and disadvantage of each.\n\nUsually LWD transducers work under extreme environment such as high temperature, high pressure, corrosive chemicals, and strong vibrations. This requires rigorous packaging for the piezocomposite transducers. In the Fabrication chapter, first some fabrication topics were discussed, including epoxy selection, solder selection, thermal expansion coefficient consideration, and in-vacuum bonding setup and method. These discussions are a summary of trial and error along the project progress. It might seem concise but it is equivalent to an immense amount of work. In-vacuum epoxy bonding and uniform thickness spacer are proven to achieve ultrahigh bonding strength in combination. Once the techniques were discussed, the fabrication of a successful high-performance piezocomposite transducer prototype was presented step-by-step. Typical steps were piezoelectric ceramic cutting, packaging material machining, epoxy bonding, and impedance analysis. Their performances matched the computation simulations. The preliminary prototypes leading to the final successful prototype were explained in the Appendix I. The first high-performance piezocomposite transducer featured slant-cut ceramics, resulting in broadband response at the expense of reduced resonance peaks. The second high-performance piezocomposite transducer featured non-slant-cut ceramics, bringing about strong resonance peaks but less broad response. One of the contributions of this dissertation work is to have successfully developed fabrication processes to use high-temperature polymer polyether ether ketone (PEEK) which is also corrosion resistant. The application of this polymer simplified the transducer design and fabrication significantly. Challenges conquered include ultrahigh bonding strength for large PEEK pieces, especially with in-vacuum bonding which leaves no trapped air bubbles suitable for high pressure applications.\n\nExtensive testing is needed before the transducers can be used in the field. In the Testing chapter, protocols for multiple tests were established. These tests are anticorrosion testing, to make sure transducers can withstand corrosive drilling fluids; thermal cycle testing, to make sure transducers can withstand high working temperature repeatedly without deteriorating in quality; high voltage testing, to make sure transducers can withstand high driving voltage without dielectric breakdown; high hydrostatic pressure testing, to make sure transducers can withstand high working pressure in the oil well; vibration testing, to make sure transducers can withstand strong vibration in the drilling practice; and acoustic testing, to make sure transmitters can transmit enough power at designated driving frequency for the logging application, and have desired TVR and directivity. The prototypes we fabricated passed all the tests.\n\nReceivers were discussed separately and presented in the Receiver Considerations chapter. Some receiver design strategies were looked into first. Structure-stress interaction studies by COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae compared different piezoelectric ceramic configurations to find the receiver with the highest receiving sensitivity (RS) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Different packaging materials were studied also aiming to improve receiver performance. In terms of fabrication and testing, there were more similarities between transmitters and receivers than differences. Therefore, this chapter focused on the deviations rather than repeating the same processes. Using the same fabrication techniques, receiver prototypes were manufactured and their impedance analysis was presented. They featured a flat response between 11 kHz and 15 kHz, which is a desired performance for LWD receivers so that the receiver is equally sensitive to all frequencies and less prone to excitation variations.\n\nFuture work can be in four directions. The first one is to fabricate d33 mode transmitters, which will improve transmitting power and reduce material cost. The second one is to expand design and fabrication from the current monopole to dipole and quadrupole. Multipole transmitters will obtain certain data not available for monopole transmitters, especially shear data in slow rock formation. The third one is on 3D time-transient COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae simulations of sonic well logging. It will enable transmitter and receiver design optimization in a virtual logging environment. Last but not least, guided wave simulations can be done on drill collar periodic groove design to create broader stopbands, which will then facilitate transmitter designs.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13756], "author_name_tesi": "Jiang, Runkun ", "last_name_ssi": "Jiang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Runkun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Sumeet Kumar Gupta", "Zhiwen Liu", "Bernhard R.

This remarkable reaction proceeds via a free-radical mechanism. A conventional class I RNR activates O2 at a carboxylate-bridged Fe2II/II cluster to generate a stable tyrosyl radical (Y\u2022) in its R2 subunit. The Y\u2022 is believed to oxidize a cysteine to cysteinyl radical (C\u2022) in the R1 subunit transiently by a long-distance (~35 \u00c5), inter-subunit, proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) step, which is mediated by several redox-active amino acid residues. The C\u2022 then initiates the reduction of the substrate by abstracting the hydrogen atom from C3\u2019. \nRNR from Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), a common human pathogen, is the prototype of a new subclass (class Ic RNR), in which the essential radical-harboring tyrosine residue is replaced by a phenylalanine. By a combination of activity assay, kinetic analysis and various spectroscopic methods, my research has demonstrated that Ct RNR employs a high-valent, heterobinuclear MnIV/FeIII cluster for activity. During turnover, the MnIV/FeIII cluster is transiently reduced to the MnIII/FeIII state to generate the C\u2022 in the R1 subunit. So the MnIV/FeIII cluster, specifically, the MnIV site, functionally replaces the Y\u2022 of a conventional class I RNR. \nThe MnIV/FeIII cofactor is generated by reaction of O2 with the reduced MnII/FeII cluster. A MnIV/FeIV intermediate accumulates and undegoes one-electron reduction of the FeIV site. The electron to reduce the FeIV site is shuttled by the near-surface residue, Y222, which has no funcitonal cognate in the best-studied conventional class I RNRs. The MnIV/FeIII cofactor can also be produced from the MnIII/FeIII cluster by H2O2, an important physiological reactive oxygen species (ROS), suggesting that the class Ic RNR may confer to the pathogen greater fitness toward ROS produced as part of the host's immune response.\nThe active form of Ct R2 (MnIV/FeIII) is EPR-silent whereas the reduced form (MnIII/FeIII) is EPR-active. This is the first case that the reduced form of class I RNR can be monitored by EPR and other advanced paramagnetic resonance methods. Studies of reduction of MnIV/FeIII cofactor by hydroxyurea and dithionite suggest that the outcome of the reduction is highly perturbed upon binding of substrate to the active site in the R1 subunit, although the binding site is presumably ~35\u00c5 away from the cofactor. Thus, Ct RNR provides new opportunities for dissection of the conformationally gated PCET step in a class I RNR and raises intriguing questions concerning the evolution of the elegant, intersubunit-PCET, radical initiation strategy.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6549], "author_name_tesi": "Jiang, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Jiang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["J Martin Bollinger, Jr And Carsten Krebs", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Carsten Krebs", "Squire J Booker", "Ming Tien", "Michael Thomas Green", "Scott A Showalter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["J Martin Bollinger, Jr And Carsten Krebs, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Chair", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Chair", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Michael Thomas Green, Committee Member", "Scott A Showalter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ribonucleotide reductase", "Chlamydia trachomatis", "manganese/iron cluster", "proton-coupled electron transfer", "electron paramagnetic resonance", "Mossbauer spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF MARGINAL LANDS FOR ENERGY CROPS", "id": "14260wxj126", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14260", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As countries seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector and lessen dependence on petroleum-based fuels, biofuels attract attention as one possible solution. Cellulosic ethanol currently draws attentions due to its potentials to provide significant lifecycle GHG reductions compared to petroleum-based gasoline and may yield a greater energy return on investment compared to grain-based sources. However, large-scale ethanol production based on cellulosic feedstocks, especially based on the dedicated energy crops, does not currently exist on a commercial basis. One of the issues with large-scale perennial energy crop production is increasing land use competition between \u201cfood and feed\u201d and \u201cfuel.\u201d A commonly suggested solution is to limit energy crop plantation to marginal lands. However, the concept and the method used to identify marginal lands remain vague and inconsistent across bioenergy-related studies. The subject matter of this dissertation deals with economic analysis for marginal land identification and use.\nThe first essay in this dissertation initiates an overview of marginal lands in the context of energy crop plantation. In it, we proposed a sustainable framework to review and classify studies that discuss marginal lands for perennial energy crops to address the issue of the varied definitions and methods used for marginal land assessment. We found that current studies lack the integration of biophysical and socioeconomic considerations on marginal land analysis. Also, current studies mainly adopt quantitative methods, but lack qualitative methods to assess marginal land. Future work should emphasize the integration of biophysical, socioeconomic, quantitative, and qualitative analyses for marginal land identification and use.\nThe second essay in this dissertation aims to identify marginal lands for energy crop production. We expand the marginal land concept by including economic factors. To define a given area as economically marginal lands, we followed four steps: (1) determine an area geographically suitable for planting energy crops and quantify biophysically marginal land by applying filters on soil and land cover; (2) run a simulation model for both food and energy crops (switchgrass, miscanthus and shrub willow) based on soil, land cover, and climate information obtained from publicly available databases; (3) use the yield records from the model and construct production cost scenarios based on agronomic assumptions; and (4) calculate and compare break-even prices of energy crops and food crops to identify economically marginal lands. We determined that all the selected soils are economically suitable for energy crop plantation because their break-even prices are lower compared to corn.  Switchgrass is the best crop choice in the study area, given its lowest break-even price.\nThe third essay in this dissertation aims to assess landowners\u2019 willingness to supply energy crops on marginal lands. We conducted a survey in three states in the northeastern U.S. We found that landowners who own marginal lands are more likely to supply these energy crops and require a lower willingness to accept (WTA) price. However, the overall WTA price is still higher than the price that biofuel producers are likely to offer. This finding reveals the price gap currently existing in the cellulosic biofuel supply chain. Policymakers and private businesses aiming to build up a commercial cellulosic biofuel supply chain should first minimize the gap by either supporting research or technology on these feedstocks to reduce production cost or continuing policies to subsidize the feedstock production directly. We also found that switchgrass is the crop that landowners are most familiar with and likely to adopt, while miscanthus and shrub willow are relatively novel to them. Gaining knowledge about the latter two crops can increase landowners\u2019 likelihood to supply. These findings may be useful for extension specialists to elevate education for miscanthus and willow.

In the past decades, most prior works focused on Cu-based and supported Pd-based catalysts to hydrogenate CO2 to CH3OH. Cu and Pd were proposed to have different affinities towards the adsorption of CO2 and H2, respectively. However, little attention has been paid to the effect of Pd-Cu bimetallic catalysts on the methanol synthesis from CO2 hydrogenation. Thus, this work aims at studying the effect of combining Pd and Cu on the activity and selectivity of methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation and developing a fundamental understanding on composition-structure-activity relationship. The Pd-Cu bimetallic catalysts with various compositions were prepared and examined in CO2 hydrogenation at relatively mild reaction conditions (523 K and 4.1 MPa).\nA strong synergistic effect was observed over Pd\u2013Cu bimetallic catalysts supported on silica at specific compositions as evidenced from the superior methanol formation rate and selectivity in comparison to monometallic catalysts, and the optimal Pd/(Pd+Cu) atomic ratios lied in the range of 0.25-0.34. The methanol formation rate over Pd(8.7)-Cu(10)/SiO2 was almost three times higher than the simple sum of those over monometallic Cu and Pd catalysts. To investigate the composition-structure-activity relationship, the Pd-Cu bimetallic catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM/EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and temperature-programmed desorption (H2-, CO2-, & CO-TPD). Detailed characterization results demonstrated the importance of two well-dispersed Pd\u2013Cu alloy particles (PdCu3 and PdCu) for the observed methanol promotion over Pd\u2013Cu bimetallic catalysts. DRIFTS spectra revealed that the incorporation of Pd and Cu greatly improved the formation of formate and CO species during the CO2 hydrogenation. CO-TPD profiles confirmed the existence of three forms of chemisorbed CO species, and the bonding strength increased in the following order: COL (linear) < COB (di-coordinated bridging) < COH (triple-coordinated bridging). Among them, chemisorbed COB was suggested as a potential intermediate for methanol synthesis because of its moderate bonding strength and desorption temperature range (proximity to reaction temperature). Quantitative analyses showed that the Pd-Cu could promote the chemisorbed COB at specific composition and thus gave rise to the possibility of methanol formation via the following hydrogenation.\nThe selectivity-conversion profile of the Pd\u2013Cu/SiO2 catalyst suggested that CO2 was a primary carbon source for methanol synthesis at lower CO2 conversion, and chemisorbed CO species contributed at higher CO2 conversion within the conversion range examined.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11416], "author_name_tesi": "Jiang, Xiao ", "last_name_ssi": "Jiang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Chunshan Song", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Randy Lee Vander Wal", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Dissertation Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Committee Chair", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CO2 hydrogenation", "Methanol", "Pd-Cu bimetallic catalysts", "Pd-Cu alloy."]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Evaluating the effect of intelligent tutoring of structure strategy on students' reading ability using a cognitive diagnostic modeling approach", "id": "12139xzj103", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12139", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reading comprehension ability is generally acknowledged to be crucial for learners of all ages.

Some research\nhas been conducted on countering jamming attacks for wireless networks. Few works consider jamming attacks launched by insiders, where an attacker first compromises some legitimate sensor nodes to acquire the common cryptographic information of the sensor network and then jams the network through those compromised nodes. In this paper, we first retrospect research works for wireless networks from its feasibility to countermeasures. Then, we address the insider jamming problem in wireless sensor networks. In our proposed solutions, the physical communication channel of a sensor network is determined by the group key shared by all the sensor nodes. When insider jamming happens, the network will generate a new group key to be shared only by the non-compromised nodes. After that, the insider jammers are revoked and will not be able to predict the future communication channels used by the non-compromised nodes. Specifically, we propose two compromise-resilient anti-jamming schemes: the split-pairing scheme which deals with a single insider jammer, and the key-tree-based scheme which copes with multiple colluding insider jammers. We implement and evaluate the proposed solutions using Mica2 Motes. Experimental results show that our solutions have low recovery latency and low communication overhead, and hence they are suitable for resource constrained sensor networks. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6642], "author_name_tesi": "Jiang, Xuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Jiang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xuan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Guohong Cao", "Sencun Zhu", "Jose Antonio Ventura", "Raj Acharya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Thesis Advisor", "Guohong Cao, Thesis Advisor", "Sencun Zhu, Thesis Advisor", "Jose Antonio Ventura, Thesis Advisor", "Raj Acharya, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Jamming", "Compromise-Resilient", "Sensor Networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Evaluation on the Accuracy of Multiple Machines using Composite Position Tolerances", "id": "9c67wm80s", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12124", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis evaluates the producibility of the three (3) composite position tolerance variants and the accuracy of a set of production engineering equipment including subtractive and additive manufacturing processes.

On the other hand, it increasingly brings\ndifferent types of redundancy into software products. The\ncommunity uses the term \"bloatware\" to describe software that\ncontains much bloat. Bloatware causes many negative consequences\nincluding larger disk footprint, higher memory consumption, longer\nloading and downloading time, higher software complexity and maintenance\ncost, and many security problems.\n\nIn this thesis, we review, investigate, and develop techniques to\nmitigate the problem of bloatware from a holistic point of view\nfrom software engineering, software security, and programming language\nperspectives. Specifically, we customize the bloatware to remove the\nsoftware bloat from the following three aspects.\n\nFirst, in current software engineering practice, even if only one method \nof a class is possibly used in a software, the complete class, the whole \nlibrary package, and the entire runtime environment are still included as a \nwhole in the software product delivery. The unused code in \napplications, libraries and the running environment has become one \nof the important sources of software bloat. Our study targets on \nthese three different parts and takes advantage of the iterative hybrid\nstatic and dynamic analysis to identify and remove the unused code from\nthe them. \n\nSecond, smartphones, as a platform that has more limited resources than\nother computation bases, are more subjected to the bloatware problem. We \ninvestigate software bloat that would lead to the rapid size increase\nof Android applications. We categorize the sources of Android application\nsoftware bloat into two types, compile-time redundancy and install-time\nredundancy. In addition, we propose a fully automated approach to\ntrimming off both types of software bloat. Our approach is mainly based\non static analysis and program transformation.\n\nLast but not least, due to various reasons for marketing, developers\nare keeping adding features into their software products in an ad-hoc\nand unsystematic way. According to some surveys, many of these features\nare useless to many end users. Such a phenomenon is also known as\n\"feature creep\" which is a special type of software bloat. To reverse\nthis unstoppable feature creep process, we propose a novel bloatware\nmitigation approach called feature-based software customization. We apply\nstatic dataflow analysis and an enhanced program slicing technique to\ncustomize software features from tangled code.\n\nOur research makes substantial contributions in all of these three aspects.\nOur experimental results show that Java application sizes can be reduced by\n44.5% on average and the JRE code can be reduced by more than 82.5%\non average. By trimming redundant code, 48.6% of the known security \nvulnerabilities in a specific version of JRE has been removed. In the Android \ndomain, by removing different types of redundancy together, we can reduce\nthe size of an Android application by 40.4% on average.

The tandem architecture not only absorbs the virtue of tandem solar cell by means of efficient photon-to-current conversion, but also functions as the effective barrier that can block the leakage current. More than three orders of magnitude reduction in dark current has been observed, along with an elevated photocurrent. The low temperature current-voltage characteristics revealed that the tandem architecture posed a high energy barrier which effectively blocks the dark current. Our results suggest that tandem architecture can be employed to developing high-performance solution-processed photodetector. \n      The application of tandem photodetectors was further extended to sensors on flexible substrates where little study has been reported to date. Our results on flexible tandem photodetectors validate the high efficiency and detectivity of the tandem architecture. Two different bending states have been studied which revealed the small critical bend radii of ~8mm and ~3mm for tensile and compressive bending, respectively. The photodetector performance remains stable under mechanical stress which offers great potential of CQDs-based tandem photodetectors for flexible device applications. \n      Furthermore, we have demonstrated the chip level integration of flip-chip light emitting diode (LED) with current rectifying GaN Schottky barrier diodes constituting the Wheatstone bridge circuitry for alternating current (AC) driving. The flip-chip LED scheme offers better p-contact, high light extraction efficiency and fast heat dissipation. The reflectance and turn-on voltage were investigated under various p-contact annealing conditions. The flip-chip alternating current LEDs (ACLEDs) demonstrated more than ~23% improvement in terms of energy conversion efficiency over top-emissive ACLEDs and offer the potential of using such device for high brightness, high power, high efficiency and high reliability solid state lighting applications. \n     Finally, built on our studies of LEDs and photodetectors, and of chip level integration of LEDs and GaN Schottky barrier diodes. we, for the first time, proposed the integration of visible LEDs and UV GaN photodetectors for bi-directional optical wireless communication (OWC) applications. The LEDs function as transmitters to emit visible light signal whereas the photodetectors as receivers to collect UV signals. The crosstalk can be neglected due to the superior visible-blind property of GaN UV photodetector.

This dissertation presents the research on novel anisotropic metamaterials for tailoring microwave radiation and infrared scattering of nanostructured thin films. First, a new inversion algorithm is proposed for retrieving the anisotropic effective medium parameters of a slab of metamaterial. Secondly, low-loss anisotropic metamaterial lenses and coatings are introduced for improving the gain and/or bandwidth for a variety of antennas. In particular, a quad-beam high-gain lens for a quarter-wave monopole, a low-profile grounded leaky metamaterial coating for slot antenna, and an ultra-thin anisotropic metamaterial bandwidth-enhancing coating for a quarter-wave monopole are experimentally demonstrated. In the infrared regime, novel nanostructured metamaterial free-standing thin-films, which are inherently anisotropic, are introduced for achieving exotic index properties and further for practical photonic devices. In particular, a low-loss near-infrared fishnet zero-index metamaterial, a dispersion-engineered optically-thin, low-loss broadband metamaterial filter with a suppressed group delay fluctuation in the mid-infrared, and a conformal dual-band near-perfectly absorbing coating in the mid-infrared are experimentally demonstrated.

The relationships between the characteristics of 4186 ellipsoids and their projections at different orientations are studied by analysis of simulations of one (e.g. cloud imaging probes), two (e.g. two-dimensional video disdrometer) and three (e.g. multi-angle snowflake camera) simultaneous projections from different viewing directions.

The maximum-dimension biases for oriented particles are larger than for randomly oriented particles, but their aspect-ratio biases are smaller. For oblate spheroids with aspect ratio 0.6, an oft-assumed shape for aggregates, the average retrieval aspect ratio is 0.75. A retrieved aspect ratio of 0.6 is obtained for an oblate spheroid with an actual aspect ratio of 0.33. Distributions of aspect ratios retrieval from two-dimensional projections are best matched from the complete set of ellipsoids, with each ellipsoid randomly oriented. Assuming an underlying oblate spheroid shape with the average observed aspect ratio produces approximately 100% bias in estimating volume by using the volume of the oblate spheroid for the measuring systems with one, two, or three projections. The standard deviation of the projection orientation angle (the angle between the major axis of the particle and the horizontal) distribution mainly depends on the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution used to represent particle orientations, if the particles are assumed to be either oblate or prolate spheroids. For these spheroidal particles, the particle orientation can be accurately retrieved with\niv\nthe orientation angles from multiple cameras.

Low concentrations of plasma testosterone have been associated with insulin resistance, which is an important upstream driver for metabolic abnormalities such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia, and increased cardiovascular risk. The purpose of this thesis is to test the hypothesis that lack of testosterone also impairs the anabolic response to amino acids, specifically leucine (Leu), which stimulates protein synthesis through mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. 6- week old castrated rats were measured body composition in a 9-week period, during which a glucose tolerance test was performed to confirm that low testosterone leads to insulin resistance. Compared to control rats, a decrease in both body weight and lean body mass was observed in castrated animals. After that, Leu or saline (Sal) was administered to castrated and time-matched control rats. The gastrocnemius and liver were removed 20 min later for assessment of protein synthesis and signaling components important in peptide-chain initiation. No change in the ability of leucine to induce phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) was observed. Both protein synthesis and degradation rate did not change significantly in castrated rats. The decrease in lean body mass cannot be attributed to changes in protein degradation rate, and it is possible that low mTOR activity and protein synthesis rate induced by castration is responsible for the erosion of muscle mass. Castration does not change the effect of leucine to induce 4E-BP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation, hence, castration may influence anabolic physiological processes by influencing upstream signals of mTOR, which are independent of the insulin signaling pathway. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5033], "author_name_tesi": "Jiao, Qianning ", "last_name_ssi": "Jiao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qianning", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles H Lang", "Charles H Lang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles H Lang, Thesis Advisor", "Charles H Lang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["insulin resistance", "castration", "testosterone", "leucine resistance"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Mobile Agent-Based Energy-Efficient and Secure Global Information Systems\n", "id": "6626", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6842", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we proposed and prototyped a novel, energy-efficient, and secure global information infrastructure called MAMDAS, which stands for Mobile Agent-based Mobile Data Access System framework.  MAMDAS combines the merits of the summary-schemas multidatabase organization model and mobile agents in building distributed large-scale information access systems.  It addresses four major challenges in global information system design: (i) data source heterogeneity and autonomy, (ii) user and data source mobility, (iii) energy-efficient wireless information retrieval, and (iv) information security.\nFirst, the summary-schemas model was chosen to respond to the problem of data source heterogeneity and autonomy.  Second, the use of mobile agents alleviates the dependency on network connectivity and thus, provides support for both user and data source mobility.  It also improves system performance by reducing the communication overhead.  Moreover, the use of mobile agents can significantly reduce the maintenance cost of large and complex systems because of the improved software modularity and reusability.  Third, in order to address the energy-efficiency issues in mobile computing, we developed an application-driven adaptive dynamic power management protocol that can minimize the energy consumption of the wireless network interface card while maintaining high throughput.  This protocol serves not only as the energy conservation strategy for MAMDAS, but also as a general solution to wireless information retrieval applications.  Finally, we devised security architecture for MAMDAS, which follows the rule of mechanism-policy separation.  It constitutes two main components: the security extension of IBM Java Aglets Workbench and application level security policy.  Our design allows all applications built on top of the IBM Aglets Workbench share the security services provided by the agent platform.  In addition, each application has the flexibility to define security policies that best suit its needs.  It is envisioned that this energy-efficient and secure data access framework be widely used in applications such as global information search engines, E-commerce, E-government, etc.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6839], "author_name_tesi": "Jiao, Yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Jiao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali R Hurson", "Guohong Cao", "John Joseph Hannan", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Kultegin Aydin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali R Hurson, Committee Chair", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "John Joseph Hannan, Committee Member", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Kultegin Aydin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["power management", "information retrieval", "mobile agents", "mobile computing", "security"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Phylogenomic analysis of ancient genome duplications in the history of plants\n\n", "id": "12393", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6841", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Whole-genome duplication (WGD), or polyploidy, followed by gene loss and diploidization, has generally been viewed as a primary source of material for the origin of evolutionary novelties. Most flowering plants have been shown to be ancient polyploids that have undergone one or more rounds of WGDs early in their evolution, and many lineages have since undergone additional, independent and more recent genome duplications. It was suggested that the paleopolyploidy events were crucial to the radiation and success of angiosperms, but evidence for proposed ancient genome duplications remains equivocal. Plant genomes are highly dynamic and usually go through intense structural rearrangements and gene loss following duplication. Old(er) WGDs can not be detected using within-genome colinearity method. Although the occurrence of WGD event(s) is well accepted, the actual number, phylogenetic timing, and age of the event(s) remain equivocal. Here we mainly employed phylogenomic approach to address following questions: 1) To more precisely time and evaluate the fates of genes following genome duplications in eudicots, we built a phylogenomic pipeline to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of 4433 gene families from the complete gene sets of Arabidopsis, Populus, Vitis, and Oryza. For each family, we determined the gene duplications relative to the evolutionary tree of the organisms, and also matched gene pairs of specific WGD events for later synonymous substitution (Ks) analysis. Concentrations of duplication events at shared branch points in the gene family phylogenies confirmed some of the results of earlier studies, and also indicated new interesting signals for polyploidy events. 2) To track more ancient WGDs pre-dating the divergence of monocots and eudicots, we used comprehensive phylogenomic analyses of nine sequenced plant genomes and more than 12.6 million new expressed-sequence-tag (EST) sequences from phylogenetically pivotal lineages. Two additional, previously unnoticed ancient WGDs have been elucidated in the common ancestor of extant seed plants dated at ~ 319 million years ago (mya) and extant angiosperms dated at ~ 192 mya, respectively. Significantly, these ancestral WGDs resulted in the diversification of regulatory genes important to seed and flower development, suggesting that they were involved in major innovations that ultimately contributed to the rise and eventual dominance of seed plants and angiosperms. 3) To precisely time the &#947; event, which was proposed before the separation of all rosids, we mapped the duplication events onto phylogenetic trees that include the paralogs created by the &#947; event and orthologous genes from other species. The overwhelming majority of well-resolved Vitis duplications were placed before the separation of rosids and asterids and after the split of monocots and eudicots, providing evidence for the WGD (&#947;) early in eudicot evolution. A large proportion of the Vitis duplications were placed after the divergence of basal eudicots, supporting the &#947; triplication was likely restricted to core-eudicots. Global gene family phylogenies are a valuable complement to genome-scale structural analysis, incorporating extensive genome-wide evidence even without a sequenced genome, and facilitate a better understanding of WGD events in plants.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6838], "author_name_tesi": "Jiao, Yuannian ", "last_name_ssi": "Jiao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuannian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Claude Walker Depamphilis", "Claude Walker Depamphilis", "Hong Ma", "John Edward Carlson", "Webb Colby Miller", "Naomi S Altman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Claude Walker Depamphilis, Dissertation Advisor", "Claude Walker Depamphilis, Committee Chair", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "John Edward Carlson, Committee Member", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Whole genome duplication", "Phylogenomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Rice Hull Silica, A Silicon Carbide Precursor For Collagen, Lignin And Silicon Metal Powder Bindered Anthracite Briquettes", "id": "19077", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8415", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Foundry coke is currently the primary energy source of U.S. iron foundries employing cupolas to produce iron.

Others have shown that anthracite fines bindered with collagen (which provides strength from ambient temperatures to 400oC), lignin (which provides strength between 400oC and 1200oC) and silicon metal (which provides strength at temperatures in excess of 1200oC) can serve as a partial foundry coke substitute.\nSilicon metal provides strength at high temperature by reacting with carbon present in the briquette to form interlocking networks of silicon carbide nanowires that originate on the surface of anthracite grains.

His colleagues as well as the public named him the national poet. His poetry was recited by lovers of the Puerto Rican Creole, and the literary critics constantly repeated, without giving details, that his literary corpus, specially his poetry, constituted a national answer to the neo-colonialism. \n\n\nWith time, the literary presence of Llorens began to lose its appealing. Although occasionally writers briefly mentioned him on their primary texts, little by little the critics paid him less attention or only remembered him as a modernist poet. Before that tendency, this thesis appears not with the intention of rescuing the figure of Llorens but rather as a comprehensive re-reading of his work that deepens in his nationalism and explains it in details. The conclusions corroborate that the work of Llorens constitutes the first and the most urgent and ubiquitous literary anti-neocolonial response. He articulated strategies of cultural resistance defined in terms of race and gender to establish a dialogue with the colonizer to state similarities, differences and the supremacy of the colonized. Although in his attempt Llorens became a negative model of what the pos-colonial theory critics censor, indirectly, his influence persists.  One example is found in the literary works of Edgardo Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1. As Llores did, when Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1 tries to decolonize the writer affected by the modernity brought back by the neo-colonizer, that had as one of its consequences the diminished the role and the prestige of the writer in the society, he ends up colonizing and marginalizing other social groups.\n\n\n\n<title>Sumario</title>\n\nDurante las primeras cuatro d\u00e9cadas del siglo XX, Luis Llorens Torres fue una de las voces literarias m\u00e1s potentes y prol\u00edficas en Puerto Rico.  El p\u00fablico y sus colegas literatos lo eligieron como poeta nacional.  Su poes\u00eda era recitada por todos los amantes de lo criollo puertorrique\u00f1o y los cr\u00edticos literarios no cesaban de repetir, sin dar detalles, que su obra, especialmente su poes\u00eda, constitu\u00eda una respuesta nacional al neo-colonialismo. \n\n\nCon el tiempo la presencia literaria de Llorens comenz\u00f3 a perderse de vista.  Aunque era mencionado someramente por escritores en sus textos primarios, poco a poco la cr\u00edtica le fue prestando menos atenci\u00f3n o record\u00e1ndolo mayormente como poeta modernista.  Ante esa tendencia, esta tesis se presenta no como un rescate de la figura de Llorens sino m\u00e1s bien como una re-lectura comprensiva de su obra que profundiza en su nacionalismo y explica en qu\u00e9 consiste.   Las conclusiones a las que se llegan demuestran que la obra de Llorens constituye la primera respuesta literaria anti-neocolonial m\u00e1s imperiosa y cabal.  En esa obra se articulan estrategias de resistencia cultural, definidas desde el punto de vista del g\u00e9nero y la raza, con el prop\u00f3sito de establecer un di\u00e1logo con el colonizador y poner de relieve las semejanzas, las diferencias  o, en fin, la supremac\u00eda del colonizado, desde el punto de vista racial y de la masculinidad. Aunque en su intento Llorens se convirti\u00f3 en un modelo negativo de lo que los cr\u00edticos que utilizan la teor\u00eda pos-colonial censuran, su vigencia en la literatura puertorrique\u00f1a es continua.  Indirectamente, algunos de los temas tratados por \u00e9l se repiten en la obra de escritores, que como Edgardo Rodr\u00edguez Juli\u00e1, al intentar descolonizar al escritor afectado por la modernidad mediatizada por el neo-colonizador que menoscaba el papel y el prestigio del escritor en la sociedad, termina colonizando y marginando otros grupos sociales.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1000], "author_name_tesi": "Jimenez, Carmen Julia", "last_name_ssi": "Jimenez", "middle_name_ssi": "Julia", "first_name_ssi": "Carmen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr An\u00edbal Gonz\u00e1lez P\u00e9rez", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Laurence E Prescott", "Dr A\u00edda Beaupied"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr An\u00edbal Gonz\u00e1lez P\u00e9rez, Committee Member", "Julia Cuervo Hewitt, Committee Chair", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member", "Laurence E Prescott, Committee Member", "Dr A\u00edda Beaupied, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gender", "Caribbean Literature", "Race", "Puerto Rican Literature", "Luis Llorens Torres"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "CONTROLS ON SANDSTONE DITRIBUTIONS AND CONNECTIVITY IN THE SHALLOW-MARINE FOX HILLS SANDSTONE AND LANCE FORMATION (UPPER CRETACEOUS, GREAT DIVIDE BASIN, WYOMING, USA", "id": "15122mmj160", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15122", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The shallow-marine Fox Hills Sandstone and Lower Lance Formation in the Great Divide Basin, south-central Wyoming serves as an opportunity to identify the fundamental controls of sand-body distribution in a shallow-marine depositional setting.

It is designed as a risk management tool to insure against declines in the accumulated rainfall index within a geographic grid. Although conceptually RI is an easy to understand risk management tool, it also represents a complex set of choices of coverage levels and index intervals that can be confusing for producers who have seldom used crop insurance before. Overall, the producer\u2019s decision process will consist of the following: 1) should I insure? 2) If I insure, which index intervals should I insure? and 3) If I insure, what level of coverage should I choose? Because the RI insurance policy is not available nationwide, success with this pilot program is critical to its expansion. The expected benefit to forage and livestock producers from this study is to simplify the process of evaluating the multitude of decisions under RI. \nTo generate the probability density functions required for the Monte Carlo simulation, a mean-reverting time series process was the approach used to modeling the rainfall indices. A VBA macro program was written to calculate the premium costs and conduct a Monte Carlo simulation of the potential indemnity payments due when the rainfall index falls below a given trigger grid index. The model was evaluated using the historical rainfall index data from a representative grid in ten counties in the state of Pennsylvania as case studies: Beaver, Clearfield, Erie, Greene, Lancaster, Tioga, Venango, Wayne, Westmoreland, and Wyoming. \nFor seven of the 10 counties, the choice with the highest mean net indemnity per acre, regardless of the coverage levels, was to insure for the entire year (January-December). The results also indicate that the mean net indemnities increase as the number of index intervals insured also increase. Moreover, the period from March to May should be insured regardless of the total number of index intervals to insure. Conversely, choices with the lowest net indemnities were frequently observed for interval combinations occurring in the fall and winter (September through January). \nAdditionally, the findings suggest that at higher coverage levels, the producer can expect higher mean net indemnities, but also higher standard deviations. Choosing a coverage level involves weighing a tradeoff between a higher coverage levels and a higher total premium. These results indicate that less risk-averse producer may be more comfortable with a higher level of coverage, while more risk-averse producer may prefer to purchase lower level of coverage. Crop insurance loss ratios and producer benefit-cost ratios demonstrated that lower coverage levels generate higher mean net indemnities for every dollar that producers paid in premium cost. A risk analysis was conducted to at least partially assess tradeoffs between coverage level and index interval choices under risk. The optimal or expected indemnity maximizing choice from the frontier is dependent on the risk aversion of the producer. \nFinally, current subsidies make RI insurance protection more affordable by reducing the premium costs charged to the producers. As result, it is expected that subsidies will increase higher participation rates. Moreover, subsidies may influence the decision to insure more months and increase coverage levels, providing more flexibility for the producer to manage risk. However, participation in the RI insurance program would be much less attractive if the premium costs are not subsidized\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [160], "author_name_tesi": "Jimenez Maldonado, Alwin J", "last_name_ssi": "Jimenez Maldonado", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Alwin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jayson Kennedy Harper", "Jayson Kennedy Harper", "James William Dunn", "Jeffrey Hyde", "Jose Antonio Ventura", "Jeffrey R Stokes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jayson Kennedy Harper, Dissertation Advisor", "Jayson Kennedy Harper, Committee Chair", "James William Dunn, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Hyde, Committee Member", "Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Member", "Jeffrey R Stokes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Monte Carlo simulations", "rainfall index crop insurance", "mean-reversion process", "time series analysis", "VBA programming"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY FOR SAFER FOOD PRESERVATIVES IN MOON CAKE: EVIDENCE FROM A CONSUMER SURVEY IN BEIJING\n\n", "id": "10021", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "857", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the global economy, food safety is gaining increasing attention as a purchase criterion in food consumption decisions.

Following a brief introduction in chapter 1, chapter 2 explains the general experimental techniques and data analysis used.  Chapters 3 to 5 focus on the properties and dynamics of ionic liquids.  Chapter 6 examines the fundamental details of the non-radiative deactivation of malononitriles.\nChapter 3 reports physical properties of 4 room-temperature ionic liquids consisting of the 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium cation with various perfluorinated anions and the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Tf2N-) anion with 12 pyrrolidinium, ammonium, and hydroxyl-containing cations.  Electronic structure methods are used to calculate properties related to the size, shape, and dipole moment of individual ions.  Experimental measurements of phase transition temperatures, densities, refractive indices, surface tensions, solvatochromic polarities based on absorption of Nile Red, 19F chemical shifts of the Tf2N- anion, temperature dependent viscosities, conductivities, and cation diffusion coefficients are reported.  Correlations among the measured quantities as well as the use of surface tension and molar volume for estimating Hildebrand solubility parameters of ionic liquids are also discussed.\nIn chapter 4, steady-state emission spectroscopy and time-resolved emission spectroscopy with 25 ps resolution are used to measure equilibrium and dynamic aspects of the solvation of coumarin 153 (C153) in a diverse collection of 21 room temperature ionic liquids.  Steady-state absorption and emission spectra are used to extract solvation free energies and reorganization energies associated with the S0&#61611;S1 transition of C153.  These quantities, especially the solvation free energy, vary relatively little in ionic liquids compared to conventional solvents.  Some correlation is found between these quantities and the mean separation between ions (or molar volume).  Time-resolved anisotropies are used to observe solute rotation.  Rotation times measured in ionic liquids correlate with solvent viscosity in similar way that they do in conventional polar solvents.  No special frictional coupling between the C153 and ionic liquid solvents is indicated by these times.  But, in contrast to what is observed in most low-viscosity conventional solvents, rotational correlation functions in ionic liquids are non-exponential.  Time-resolved Stokes shift measurements are used to characterize solvation dynamics.  The solvation response functions in ionic liquids are also non-exponential and can be reasonably represented by stretched exponential functions of time.  The solvation times observed are correlated to the solvent viscosity, and the much slower solvation in ionic liquids compared to dipolar solvents can be attributed to their much larger viscosities.  Solvation times of the majority of ionic liquids studied appear to follow a single correlation with solvent viscosity.  Only liquids incorporating the largest phosphonium cation appear to follow a distinctly different correlation.\nIn chapter 5, the excitation wavelength dependence of emission kinetics of several solutes is measured by steady-state and time-resolved emission spectroscopy and used to demonstrate the presence of dynamic heterogeneity in several room temperature ionic liquids.  The solute kinetics examined here include rotational and solvation dynamics of Coumarin 153, isomerization of two malononitriles, trans-2-[4-(dimethylamino)styryl]benzothiazole isomerization, and intramolecular electron transfer in crystal violet lactone.  The rates of most of these processes vary significantly with excitation wavelength, especially when excited on the red edges of the solute absorption bands, indicating that energetically selected subpopulations relax at distinct rates.  The results presented here suggest more generally that dynamic process taking place on the sub-nanosecond time scale in typical ionic liquids near room temperature are likely to be heterogeneous in character.  Similar heterogeneous dynamics are also observed in low temperature 1-propanol, which indicates dynamic heterogeneity is not unique to ionic liquids.\n4-N,N-dimethylamino-benzylidenemalononitrile (DMN) and joulolidine-malononitrile (JDMN) have long been examined for their non-linear optical properties and as microviscosity probes in conventional solvents, polymers, biological systems and recently ionic liquids.  In Chapter 6, we focus on the details of non-radiative deactivation in these two malononitriles.  Malononitriles are studied in a collection of conventional room-temperature solvents with different viscosities and polarities by both steady-state and time-resolved emission spectroscopy.  Both the absorption and emission spectra of DMN and JDMN show large shifts with solvent polarity and these shifts are reasonably correlated to dielectric properties.  The quantum yields of malononitriles are sensitive to solvent viscosity but the relationship is not simple.  The quantum yields of malononitriles do not seem to be sensitive to solvent polarity.  Our quantum yields do not agree with previous reported values, but the decay times deduced from them are consistent with time-resolved measurements from TCSPC and the Kerr-gated emission technique.  Temperature dependent data on malononitriles in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and 1-propanol over a wide temperature range are also presented.  The temperature dependence of the emission of malononitriles in MTHF and PrOH provides further information about non-radiative deactivation.  We observe an unusual behavior of spectral shifts with temperature, which result from different temperature dependence of the solvation time and lifetime.  Non-radiative deactivation times correlate with &#12310;((&#951;)&#8260;(T))&#12311;^p with p values of 1.0, 0.60 and 0.44 for MTHF, PrOH and [Nip311+][Tf2N-] respectively.  The smaller values of p, thus the weaker correlation between reactive motion and viscosity, appear to be related to the complexity of the solvation dynamics over the temperature range observed.  The detailed spectral dynamics of DMN at low temperature are complex due to the interplay between solvation and reaction dynamics.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2318], "author_name_tesi": "Jin, Hui ", "last_name_ssi": "Jin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Maroncelli", "Mark Maroncelli", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "John V Badding", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Maroncelli, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Chair", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ultrafast solution dynamics", "ionic liquids", "non-radiative deactivation", "malononitriles"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "AN ANALYSIS OF THE MU OPIOID RECEPTOR AND GPR177 INTERACTION: IMPLICATIONS FOR OPIOID ADDICTION\n", "id": "10954", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2734", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Opioid drugs are powerful analgesic agents that lead to the development of tolerance, physical dependence and addiction with prolonged use or abuse.  Chronic exposure also appears to cause alterations in the neuronal morphology of key brain regions implicated in the development of opioid dependence and addiction.  Many of these changes reflect inhibitory effects of morphine and other opioid receptor agonists on neuron size, neurite outgrowth, dendritic arborization, and neurogenesis that occur in brain regions important for reward processing, learning, and memory.  The analgesic and addictive properties of opioid drugs are mediated primarily via the \u00b5-opioid receptor (MOR).  However, the precise role of MORs in the development of these neuronal alterations remains elusive.  A growing body of evidence indicates that G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling is modulated by proteins that bind to the GPCR and form multiprotein signaling complexes or signalplexes.  A number of proteins that interact directly with the MOR have recently been identified and shown to affect MOR biogenesis, trafficking, and signaling.  We hypothesize that identifying and characterizing novel MOR interacting proteins (MORIPs) may help to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved in the development of opioid addiction.\nUsing a modified split-ubiquitin yeast two-hybrid screening method, we identified GPR177 as a candidate MORIP.  Several recent studies have shown that GPR177 is the mammalian ortholog of Drosophila Wntless/Evenness Interrupted/Sprinter, an evolutionarily conserved protein that plays an important role in the secretion of Wnt proteins from Wnt-producing cells.  Wnt signaling mechanisms are of particular interest due to their effects on neuronal development, which include promoting neuron growth, increasing dendritic arborization and regulating neurogenesis.\nThe interaction between the MOR and GPR177 was validated using GST-pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments.  These two proteins were also found to co-localize within a subset of striatal neurons.  Western blot analysis of various rodent brain regions and organ tissues showed that GPR177 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body.  In developing zebrafish, morpholino-induced knockdown of GPR177 expression led to disorganization of brain tissue, loss of semicircular canal formation in the ear, and abnormal curvature of the tail.  In MOR-expressing Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells, morphine treatment promoted formation of MOR/GPR177 complexes, and resulted in the inhibition of Wnt protein secretion in a cell-based assay.  This effect on Wnt secretion was blocked by pre-treatment with MOR antagonists, which suggests that the inhibition of Wnt protein secretion is mediated via the MOR and its interaction with GPR177.  We thus propose a novel mechanism whereby the inhibition of Wnt secretion and signaling mediated by the MOR/GPR177 interaction may be involved in the development of opioid addiction.  Our studies suggest that the MOR/GPR177 interaction could serve as a target for a new therapeutic agent aimed at counteracting the addictive properties of opioid analgesics.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2729], "author_name_tesi": "Jin, Jay ", "last_name_ssi": "Jin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson", "Robert G Levenson", "Victor Alan Canfield", "Patricia Grigson", "Victor J Ruiz Velasco"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Chair", "Victor Alan Canfield, Committee Member", "Patricia Grigson, Committee Member", "Victor J Ruiz Velasco, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wnt secretion", "Wntless", "GPR177", "mu-opioid receptor", "protein-protein interaction"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Thermal Conductivity and Multiferroics Of Electroactive polymers and Polymer Composites", "id": "14034", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7061", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-01-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Electronically conducting polymers and electromechanical polymers are the two important branches of the cutting-edge electroactive polymers. They have shown significant impact on many modern technologies such as flat panel display, energy transport, energy conversion, sensors and actuators. To utilize conducting polymers in microelectronics, optoelectronics and thermoelectrics, it is necessary to have a comprehensive study of their thermal conductivity since thermal conductivity is a fundamental materials property that is particularly important and sometimes a determining factor of the device performance. For electromechanical polymers, larger piezoelectric effect will contribute to the magnetoelectric (ME) coupling efficiency in their multiferroic composites. The first objective of this dissertation is to characterize electronic conducting polymers for their electrical and thermal conductivity. The analytical model and experimental technique are presented to measure the in-plane thermal conductivity of polyaniline thin films doped by camphorsulfonic acid. Measurements of 20 nm - 1 \u03bcm thick films reveal a strong thickness dependence of thermal conductivity below 130 nm. The size effect rapidly diminishes for films thicker than 800 nm. The size effect on thermal conductivity is attributed to the restrictions of the phonon mean free path length and heat capacity. The same technique is extended to measure the electrical and thermal conductivity of 55 nm thick polyaniline thin films doped with different levels of camphorsulfonic acid. Results indicate that the effect of the doping level (camphorsulfonic acid/polyaniline ratio) is more pronounced on electrical conductivity than on thermal conductivity. It is suggested that polarons are the charge carriers responsible for the electrical conduction, while phonons play a dominant role in the heat conduction in doped polyaniline thin films. The scientific outcome of this study provides a fundamental understanding of heat conduction mechanism in nanoscale polyaniline thin films. The second objective of this dissertation is to develop new classes of electromechanical polymers and strain-mediated electromechanical polymer-based multiferroic ME composites.  One of them is based on chain-end cross-linked ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE). With a low dc bias magnetic field, the ME coefficient of this composite is 17.7 V/cm Oe at non-resonance and 383 V/cm Oe at resonance. This remarkable result arises from the introduction of chain-end cross-linking and polysilsesquioxane structures into the ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) films, which leads to the formation of larger \u03b2 phase crystallite size and concurrent improvement in the polarization ordering and consequently, better piezoelectricity in comparison to those of the pristine P(VDF-TrFE) copolymers. ME composite based on poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) P(VDF-HFP) are also developed. Crystalline \u03b2 phase structure in P(VDF-HFP) is produced by uniaxially stretching of pre-melted and quenched films. It is found that there is a linear relationship between the ME voltage coefficient of the composite and the poling field applied to the polymer films. Moreover, an electric field-induced phase transition is observed in P(VDF-HFP), manifested by the evolution of a double hysteresis D-E loop at intermediate poling field to a single loop at high poling field. The double hysteresis loop is due to the antiferroelectric phase that will transform into the ferroelectric phase when poled at high electric field. To enhance the piezoelectric effect of P(VDF-HFP) copolymer, chemical modifications and various processing methods are utilized to alter the crystalline structure. For uniaxially stretched, hydrated and post-annealed P(VDF-HFP), the non-resonance ME voltage coefficient is measured to be 22.0 V/cm Oe and the resonance ME voltage coefficient is 310 V/cm Oe, which place them among the best multiferroic ME composites reported to date and also imply the commercial device potential. It is found that the intermolecular interaction between P(VDF-HFP) and hydrate salt provides an efficient way to lead P(VDF-HFP) to crystallize into the \u03b2 phase. The hydrate salt functions as the nucleation site and the hydrogen bonding between C-F bond from P(VDF-HFP) and O-H bond from the hydrate salt tend to produce ferroelectric \u03b2 phase. It is suggested that the hydrogen bonds can also stabilize the chain orientation created by uniaxial stretching. Therefore, both enhancement of the crystallization in the \u03b2 phase, and chain and crystal orientation contribute to the improvement of piezoelectric performance of P(VDF-HFP) and therefore the ME voltage coefficient in the multiferroic composite.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7054], "author_name_tesi": "Jin, Jiezhu ", "last_name_ssi": "Jin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiezhu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque", "Qing Wang", "Ralph H Colby", "Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque, Dissertation Advisor", "Qing Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermal conductivity", "conducting polymer", "multiferroic", "piezoelectric", "PVDF-based polymer"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Zooarchaeological and taphonomic analysis of the faunal assemblage from Tangzigou, southwestern China\n", "id": "10488", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3067", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation research is a zooarchaeological and taphonomic analysis of the faunal assemblage from Tangzigou, an Early Holocene open-air site in Yunnan Province, southwest China.  The goal of this study was to reconstruct the foraging behavior of Tangzigou people in order to investigate whether there were archaeological signs of resource stress and/or intensification in post-Pleistocene southwestern China.  This research contributes to our current understanding of the timing and process of the subsistence shift from foraging to agriculture during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition. \n\nNo evidence of resource intensification was found in the Tangzigou assemblage.  Data used to evaluate the resource stress hypothesis were derived from the analysis of the skeletal element representations, mortality profiles, bone breakage patterns, and bone surface modifications of ~9000 mammalian bone fragments.  Large-scale comparative datasets were produced from observations of modern antlers and experimental studies on modern cervid/bovid phalanges to accurately document the various types of modifications.  This was done in order to confirm or dispute the existence of antler tools at Tangzigou, and to explain the meaning of intensively broken phalanges in the Tangzigou assemblage.  \n\nThe interpretation here is still a hypothesis based on just one site from a single time period that requires further testing.  A larger sample is essential for inter-site and diachronic comparisons to understand the timing and process of subsistence shift.  Only then, can an accurate portrait of the human subsistence strategies from Tangzigou emerge.  This research is a step toward fulfilling that goal. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3056], "author_name_tesi": "Jin, Joohyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Jin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Joohyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nina G Jablonski", "Nina G Jablonski", "Pat Shipman", "George Robert Milner", "Brian Hesse", "Russell W Graham"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nina G Jablonski, Dissertation Advisor", "Nina G Jablonski, Committee Chair", "Pat Shipman, Committee Member", "George Robert Milner, Committee Member", "Brian Hesse, Committee Member", "Russell W Graham, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["intensification", "China", "Yunnan", "taphonomy", "zooarchaeology", "Pleistocene-Holocene transition"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Technology integration in the context of collaboration in early childhood settings", "id": "22678", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10266", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As the concern about technology in education shifts from teachers\u2019 technological skills to how technology can be used in appropriate ways for children\u2019s learning and development, the challenge of technology use lies in determining how to integrate technologies into teaching practice.

In addition, the teachers\u2019 knowledge of technology and pedagogy was closely related to the ways in which and the extent to which they integrated technology into their teaching practice. \nAccording to the findings of study, the teachers also engaged in various modes of collaboration in technology integration by drawing on mutual support, shared responsibility, and joint work, and as well as working in isolation. In the process of collaborating on technology integration, the teachers in the present study drew on their differing knowledge bases, skills, and experience in an effort to support each other.

The major pests of maize include caterpillars, beetles, aphids, and thrips. The aim of the dissertation was to study maize defense responses to caterpillars at the molecular, phenotypic and ecological scales. More specifically, maize defense responses to fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda) and black cutworm (BCW, Agrotis ipsilon) in the Order of Lepidoptera were investigated in various experimental settings. Chapter 2 assessed maize defense responses to FAW in the nested association mapping (NAM) founder lines, and illustrated possible resistance mechanisms. Insect bioassays indicated that the constitutive defense of the 25 founder lines fall into a continuum. High levels of rip2 and mpi transcript expression and RIP2 protein accumulation in resistant genotypes correlated with their high constitutive defenses to FAW. There was a correlation between rip2 expression levels and RIP2 accumulation upon FAW herbivory in the diverse maize inbred lines. Chapter 3 focused on the soil-mediated cover crop effect on corn defense response to BCW, and linked the molecular aspects of corn defense responses to agroecosystem and farming management practices. BCW grew better when corn plants obtained adequate amount of N from soil provided by cover crops, so cover crops benefited both corn plants and BCW at the phenotypic level. Secondly, cover crops increased the expression of several corn defense genes to deter BCW herbivory at the molecular level. Therefore, the relationship of cover crops and corn defense responses to BCW is not a simple linear relationship. The Appendix Chapter investigated an important herbivore defense gene maize insect resistance 1 (mir1) expression in 23 NAM founder lines, and it was found that maize natural sequence polymorphism affects the expression of mir1. 23 maize NAM founder lines including B73 did not express mir1 in their whorls before or after FAW infestation and the presence of the 4789 bp region including a CACTA transposable element in mir1 promoter of these lines is likely one of the regulatory sequences controlling mir1 expression in diverse maize lines whorls. The second regulatory sequence controlling mir1 expression is an inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) in Mp708 mir1 intron three.

Despite women\u2019s significant advancement, occupational segregation by gender is still persistent. This segregation tends to concentrate women in certain occupations and men in others. Even within the same occupation, division of work by gender remains a distinct phenomenon. The issues regarding workplace segregation by gender has gained significant attention in research and practice. \nAt the same time, theories of career development, derived from various perspectives of careers, have explored unique patterns and characteristics of women\u2019s careers. In addition to differences in career patterns, women appear to perceive the meaning of their careers differently than men. Led by this notion of women\u2019s difference in career experiences, this study aims to describe women\u2019s experiences in non-traditional occupations that have been dominated by men.  The study also explores the meanings women derive from careers. For this purpose, in-depth interviews with 12 participants from five occupations in a university setting were conducted and interviews were analyzed by qualitative methods. Research questions specified five different interests regarding women\u2019s career development in non-traditional occupations: 1) career entrance, 2) issues as a woman in a non-traditional occupation, 3) coping strategies for issues experienced by women, 4) perceptions of the university as a work environment, and 5) meanings of careers as defined by women. \nThe paths participants took to arrive at their occupations revealed complexity in women\u2019s career choices and the themes identified are: 1) undecided but making the best choice, 2) getting ready for male-dominated occupations, 3) parents\u2019 influences in formative ways, and 4) benefits of prior work experience. The issues that participants experienced as women in non-traditional occupations include stereotyping, harassment, exclusion from male-bonded culture, and recognition of differences between men and women at work. In order to cope with issues and difficulties as women in male-dominated environments, women adopted various strategies: 1) proving their ability, 2) showing confidence, 3) knowing male culture, 4) building special bonds with colleagues, and 5) avoiding emotional reactions and communicating. \nThe university was perceived as a positive work environment for women and participants reported they enjoyed their work in terms of serving students and working with students. Their perceptions of the university environment also included negative issues such as divisions of different work groups and perceptions as a minority compared to the same occupations in industry outside the university. Regarding their meanings for career, themes emerged which contributed to their career successes: happiness, accomplishment and commitment, independence, and balance between family and work.\nRecommendations for future research and practice are suggested for women\u2019s career development and advancement.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6060], "author_name_tesi": "Jin, Sungmi ", "last_name_ssi": "Jin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sungmi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith Ann Kolb", "Kenneth Gray", "William J Rothwell", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith Ann Kolb, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Gray, Committee Member", "William J Rothwell, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nontraditional occupations", "Career choice", "Career development", "Women", "University staff"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Network modeling and prediction of retrograde gas behavior in natural gas pipeline systems", "id": "19787", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9360", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As retrograde gases are transported through pipeline systems, retrograde condensation may occur.

The innate immune responses are largely mediated by phagocytic cells, including macrophages and neutrophils, whereas the adaptive immune responses rely on antigen-specific lymphocytes, the T and B cells.  Defective immune cell function can cause diverse immunodeficiencies, while deregulated immune cell activation leads to chronic inflammation, autoimmunity and cancer. Therefore, activation of immune cells is subject to tight regulation by both positive and negative mechanisms. One increasingly recognized mechanism of immunoregulation is protein ubiquitination, a reversible process that is counter regulated by ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and deubiquitinating enzymes (DUB).  \nThis thesis project concerns a recently identified deubiquitinating enzyme, CYLD.  CYLD was originally identified as a tumor suppressor mutated in patients with cylindroma, benign tumors of skin appendages. In vitro studies suggest that CYLD deubiquitinates the signaling molecules TRAF2 and IKK&#947;, thereby negatively regulates activation of the transcription factor NF-&#954;B by innate immune stimuli, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs).  However, our recent studies using CYLD knockout mice fail to reveal an important role for CYLD in the regulation of TLR and TNFR signaling in innate immune cells.  Instead, these genetic analyses reveal a critical role for CYLD in regulating adaptive immune function, particularly the development of T cells in the thymus.  Studies to be presented in this thesis have further elucidated pleotropic functions of CYLD in the regulation of peripheral activation of T and B lymphocytes and the prevention of chronic inflammation.  Additionally, CYLD also regulate a specific aspect of macrophage function, osteoclastogenesis. The major findings are summarized in the following: \n\n1.\tCYLD negatively regulates ubiquitin-dependent kinase Tak1 and prevents abnormal T cell responses. Although CYLD deficiency causes impaired thymocyte development therefore reduced peripheral T cell number, T cells isolated from spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes of CYLD knockout mice are hyper-responsive upon TCR and CD28 stimulation. In vivo, CYLD-deficient T cells infiltrate into colon and mediate intestinal inflammation, which resembles human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). At the molecular level, CYLD targets a ubiquitin-dependent kinase, Tak1, by inhibiting its ubiquitination and auto-activation. In the absence of CYLD, Tak1 is constantly ubiquitinated and activated, leading to activation of downstream kinases, IKK and JNK. These findings emphasize a critical role for CYLD in preventing the spontaneous activation of Tak1 axis of T cell signaling, thereby maintaining normal T cell function.\n\n2.\tCYLD regulates the peripheral development and na\u00efve phenotype maintenance of B cells. CYLD knockout mice develop B cell hyperplasia in secondary lymphoid organs especially in mesenteric lymph nodes, which is dramatically enlarged at 12 week of age. B cells deficient with CYLD spontaneously display surface activation markers and are hyper-responsive to IgM and LPS stimulation both in vitro and in vivo, indicating their abnormal activation status. EMSA results obtained from freshly isolated spleen and mesenteric lymph node B cells reveal hyper activation of NF-&#954;B due to loss of CYLD. The constitutive NF-&#954;B activation in CYLD knockout B cells is due to constant phosphorylation and degradation of NF-&#954;B inhibitory protein I&#954;B&#945; by its kinase IKK&#946;. This finding suggests that CYLD is a crucial negative regulator of IKK activation in B cells. However, unlike in T cells, loss of CYLD results in hyper activation of Erk but not JNK and p38 MAPKs, which indicates different upstream molecular target(s) of CYLD in B cells.\n\n3.\tCYLD regulates osteoclast function and osteoporosis. Macrophage, one of the major players in innate immunity, is also the precursor of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Macrophage can differentiate into osteoclast in the presence of both M-CSF and RANKL. In contrast to our previous finding that macrophage activation by innate immune stimuli (LPS and TNF-&#945;) is normal in the absence of CYLD, the function of macrophage as osteoclast precursor is regulated by CYLD. CYLD-deficient bone marrow derived macrophages differentiate into osteoclasts in vitro considerably more efficiently than wildtype cells.  Moreover, the CYLD knockout mice display an osteoporotic phenotype, characterized by loss of trabecular bone mass. Mechanistically, CYLD physically interacts with and deubiquitinates TRAF6, the key signaling component of RANK signaling, therefore controlling downstream NF-&#954;B and AP-1 activation. These findings establish a negative-regulatory role of CYLD in RANK pathway and osteoclast differentiation.  In agreement with these functional data, the expression of CYLD protein is potently induced by RANKL but not by LPS or TNF-&#945;, thus emphasizing the importance of CYLD protein level in its function in macrophages. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6616], "author_name_tesi": "Jin, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Jin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shao Cong Sun", "David Joseph Spector", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "Gavin Peter Robertson", "Teresa Wood"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shao Cong Sun, Committee Chair", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Chair", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Member", "Gavin Peter Robertson, Committee Member", "Teresa Wood, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lymphocyte activation", "deubiquitinating enzyme", "osteoclastogenesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Situation Awareness and Adaptive Decision-Making in Autonomous Systems via Symbolic Learning", "id": "15703", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7987", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Autonomous systems are becoming prevalent in the human society as they play a very important role in the applications that need to function in uncertain environments. Such systems usually require integration of several functions including perception and decision-making for operation under incomplete or incorrect a priori information. In this context, situation awareness is the perception of the environment for extraction of pertinent information, and adaptive decision-making is the adaptation to the uncertain environment. This dissertation addresses two main issues: situation awareness and adaptive decision-making in autonomous systems by symbolic learning.\n\nSituation awareness involves the recently developed framework of Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF) and is discussed in the context of supervised learning. In the SDF framework, sensor observations are discretized temporally and spatially to generate blocks of symbols and patterns are generated from these symbol blocks for pattern classification. Research issues such as feature extraction from two-dimensional domain of wavelet-transformed sensor time series, optimization of the symbol generation process, and fusion of heterogeneous sensor information are addressed in this dissertation. The proposed technology is validated by various (experimental and simulated) case studies that include behavior recognition in mobile robots, anomaly detection in nuclear power plants, and personnel detection using multi-modal sensors.\n\nAdaptive decision-making is crucial to ensure effective and efficient operation of autonomous systems in uncertain environments, and is discussed in the context of path planning and autonomous navigation. The search space of the autonomous system is constructed as a symbolic grid map, where the two-dimensional space is partitioned into grids and an alphabet of symbols is assigned to each grid cell to represent the environmental information. Formulation of the search space is then extended in the multi-resolution sense to enable adaptive decision-making based on the available spatio-temporal information. A navigation algorithm based on the multi-resolution formulation is then proposed for autonomous navigation in uncertain environments. The proposed algorithm is validated on various case studies such as complete coverage of complex and static environments, and simulation of oil spill cleaning in dynamic and uncertain environments.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7934], "author_name_tesi": "Jin, Xin ", "last_name_ssi": "Jin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Asok Ray", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Shashi Phoha", "Alok Sinha", "Thomas Wettergren"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Asok Ray, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member", "Shashi Phoha, Committee Member", "Alok Sinha, Committee Member", "Thomas Wettergren, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["situation awareness", "decision making", "autonomous system", "machine learning", "autonomous navigation", "sensor fusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "BROADBAND DIELECTRIC STUDY OF THE RELAXATION DYNAMICS OF AMORPHOUS AND SEMI-CRYSTALLINE POLYMER BLENDS", "id": "6284", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6673", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nIn order to elucidate the complex relaxation dynamics in polymer blends containing a crystallizable component and having a large Tg difference between the components, a series of systems were investigated principally via dielectric relaxation spectroscopy, with the aid of differential scanning calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray diffraction experiments.\nFor neat semi-crystalline poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), a dielectric relaxation (labeled as g\u00810\u201e4)  faster than the cooperative segmental relaxation is observed for the first time, and it is assigned to a segmental relaxation with reduced cooperatvity in the order - disorder interphase regions.\n Poly(styrene-co-p-hydroxystyrene) (SHS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were selected to investigate the dynamics of blends of crystallizable PEO with relatively high Tg components, with and without strong intercomponent interactions. For amorphous SHS/PEO blends (\u00810\u20266 60wt% SHS), hydrogen bonding is capable of suppressing concentration fluctuations and leads to a single cooperative segmental process involving both components. In addition, a fast PEO segmental process is observed in the dielectric spectra of blends with \u00810\u2026680 wt% SHS, due to reduced intermolecular hydrogen bonding and repulsion between SHS styrene units and PEO segments.\nFor amorphous PMMA/PEO blends, after room-temperature aging, a dielectric relaxation becomes apparent at approximately the same frequency-temperature location as that of the PEO g\u00810\u201e4 process. It is assigned to nanoscale PEO regions possessing a degree of partial order comparable to that of an order \u00a8C disorder interphase.\nThermorheological simplicity is observed for amorphous mixtures of dihydroxyl naphthalene (DHN) and poly(vinyl ethyl ether) (PVEE), where DHN is a model small molecule with two functional groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds with PVEE, a non-crystallizable analog of PEO.  The absence of chain connectivity in DHN and the presence of a suitable degree of intercomponent interactions is proposed to enable DHN molecules to closely contact PVEE segments and distribute uniformly in the PVEE matrix, thereby having the same effect on all PVEE local environments.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6670], "author_name_tesi": "Jin, Xing ", "last_name_ssi": "Jin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt", "Ian Roland Harrison", "Ralph H Colby", "Qiming Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt, Committee Chair", "Ian Roland Harrison, Committee Member", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dielectric", "Relaxation", "Dynamics", "Semi-crystalline", "Polymer Blends."]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Multiple Criteria Supply Chain Inventory Models\nwith Stochastic Demands\n", "id": "18474", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8513", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis considers the use of multiple criteria optimization methods applied to the supply chain inventory problem with stochastic demand. The supply chain system is modeled with a single wholesaler and multiple retailers. The demand of the customer is met by the retailers and the retailers are independent from each other and see independent customer demands. The wholesaler meets the demand of all the retailers.\n\nTwo types of supply chains are examined in this thesis, the de-centralized supply chain system and the centralized supply chain system. In the de-centralized case, we assume that each decision maker is responsible for setting the inventory policies for each company in the supply chain system. In the centralized case, we assume that the decision maker is responsible for setting the inventory policies for the entire supply chain system.\n\nWe study this supply chain problem with three objectives under stochastic and stationary demand. The demands of the customer follow normal distributions. The criteria considered are (1) capital invested in inventory; (2) annual number of orders; (3) customer service level. We first develop the formulas for all the three objectives and then provide general models for the supply chain system for both de-centralized and centralized cases.\n\nTwo methods are used to solve this multiple criteria mathematical programming problem. The first method uses the weighted objective method. Interval programming is used to for generating the weights. The second method uses the compromise programming method. Several efficient points are generated by these two methods and presented to the decision maker. In the de-centralized case, the retailer problems are solved first using both methods. We then solve the wholesaler problem using both methods based on the results of the retailer problems. In the centralized case, two scenarios are considered: common replenishment epochs and different replenishment epochs. Both scenarios are also solved using the weighted objective method and the compromise programming method. Numerical examples are provided for each case to illustrate the methods.\n\nFinally, we compare the results of the common replenishment epochs with those of the different replenishment epochs. We also compare the results of the de-centralized supply chain system with those of the centralized supply chain system. We then draw conclusions based on the comparisons of the results.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8407], "author_name_tesi": "Jin, Yang ", "last_name_ssi": "Jin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yang", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["multiple criteria optimization", "inventory models", "periodic review policy", "interval programming", "compromise programming"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "REACTIVE SPUTTER DEPOSITION OF VANADIUM, NICKEL, AND MOLYBDENUM OXIDE THIN FILMS FOR USE IN UNCOOLED INFRARED IMAGING", "id": "23561", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10741", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A vanadium oxide (VO x) thin film is the most common imaging layer used in commercial uncooled focal plane arrays for infrared cameras. These VOx thin films have an x value ranging from 1.3 to 2 and have low resistivity (0.1 to 10 \u03a9\u2022cm), high temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) (\u22122 to \u22123 %/K), and low 1/f noise. Reactive ion beam sputtering is typically used to deposit these VOx thin films for commercial thermal imaging cameras. However, the reactive ion beam deposition system for the VOx is reported to have less than desirable throughput and a narrow process window. \nIn this work, the potential for reactive pulsed-dc magnetron sputtering of nanocomposite VOx thin films for microbolometer applications was investigated. VOx thin films with resistivity from 10-4 to 105 \u03a9\u2022cm with a TCR from 0 to -4.3 %/K were deposited by reactive sputtering from a metallic vanadium target in argon/oxygen mixtures with substrate bias.  Magnetron sputtered VOx shows bolometric properties comparable to those of commercial-grade IBD prepared VOx. Important limitations for manufacturing implementation of reactive magnetron sputtering such as hysteresis oxidation and non-uniform oxidation of the vanadium target surface were evaluated. The VOx film deposition rate, resistivity, and temperature coefficient of resistance were correlated to oxygen to argon ratio, processing pressure, target-to-substrate distance, and oxygen inlet positions. To deposit VOx in the resistivity range of 0.1\u201310 \u03a9\u2022cm with good uniformity and process control, it was found that a lower processing pressure, larger target-to-substrate distance, and an oxygen inlet near the substrate are useful. Other processing methods employing magnetron sputtering were investigated such as co-sputtering of V and V2O5 target, sputtering from a VC target, a V2O5 target, and a V2Ox target but initial investigation of these methods did not yield a superior process to the simple sputtering of a pure metallic vanadium target. \nAnother technique, biased target ion beam deposition (BTIBD), was investigated for deposition VOx thin films with potential alloy additions. In this BTIBD system, ions with energy lower than 25 eV were generated remotely and vanadium targets are negatively biased independently for sputtering. High TCR (<-4.5%/K) VOx thin films have been reproducibly prepared in the resistivity range of 103-104 \u03a9\u2022cm by controlling the oxygen partial pressure using real-time control with a residual gas analyzer. These high resistivity films may be useful in next generation uncooled focal plane arrays for through-film rather than lateral thermal resistors. This architecture could improve the sensitivity through the higher TCR without increasing noise normally accompanied by higher resistance. Processing parameters necessary to produce high TCR VOx films and details on how this novel deposition tool operates are discussed. Addition of molybdenum and its effects on the VOx thin films\u2019 electrical properties were also studied. \nUsing the BTIBD system, VOx films in the resistivity range of 0.1-10 \u03a9\u2022cm desired for current microbolometer application were difficult to produce. Pure molybdenum oxide (MoOx) and nickel oxide (NiOx) thin films were deposited by reactive biased target ion beam deposition and evaluated in a search for materials with a larger process latitude. MoOx thin films were deposited with resistivity from 3 to 2000 \u03a9\u2022cm and with TCR from -1.7 to -3.2 %/K. NiOx thin film were deposited with resistivity from 1 to 300 \u03a9\u2022cm and with TCR from -2.2 to -3.3 %/K. The thermal stability of these films was also investigated.  It was found that biased target ion beam deposited high TCR MoOx and NiOx thin films are polycrystalline semiconductors and have good stability in air. Compared to commonly used VOx thin films, MoOx or NiOx thin films may offer improved process control for resistive temperature sensors and a superior deposition rate.  However, preliminary experiments indicate that these films might have relatively higher 1/f noise.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10367], "author_name_tesi": "Jin, Yao ", "last_name_ssi": "Jin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark William Horn", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "S Ashok", "Michael T Lanagan", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark William Horn, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member", "S Ashok, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["uncooled infrared imaging", "microbolometer", "vanadium oxide", "nickel oxide", "molybdenum oxide", "reactive sputtering deposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONALIZATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF TUNGSTEN DISULFIDE WITH 2-AMINOETHANETHIOL", "id": "14962amj233", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14962", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two-dimensional (2D) layered transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are an \nemerging, fascinating class of nanomaterial with a wide range of potential applications \nincluding catalysis, electronics, photonics, energy storage, and sensing.

The luxury tax benefited nearly all Americans a small amount,\nbut hurt the small fraction of consumers who love automobiles the most.\nThe second chapter, a joint work with my adviser and others, seeks to understand the way\nColombian and American firms interact in U.S. Customs data. After documenting patterns\nin the data, we develop an estimable empirical model in which heterogeneous sellers engage\nin costly search for buyers. Through meeting buyers, a firm gradually learns about the appeal\nof its product in the market, which affects its incentive to search for more buyers. Fit using\nindirect inference, the model both replicates key patterns in the customs data and allows us to\nquantify several types of trade costs, including the search costs of identifying potential clients\nand the costs of maintaining business relationships with existing clients. We also estimate the\neffect of previous exporting activity on the costs of meeting new clients, and to characterize\nthe cumulative effects of learning on a firm\u2019s search intensity. Finally, we use our fitted model\nto explore the effects of these trade costs and learning effects on aggregate export dynamics.\nThe third chapter measures the effect of mobility between workplaces on the speed at\nwhich new ideas diffuse. Using a new panel data set linking academics to departments and\ncitations, I develop and estimate a dynamic model of location choice in which an idea is more\nlikely to be encountered when colleagues already know about it. Several exercises indicate that\ncoworker knowledge significantly affects the probability of learning about a new idea. Coun-\nterfactual exercises show that labor mobility increases the speed at which new ideas spread\nbetween locations, makes locations more uniform in the fraction of people who know about\na new idea, and raises the percentage of people who know about a new idea at a given time. A\ncalibration using results from my baseline estimation indicates that international movement\nof workers can have a large effect on diffusion of knowledge into a developing country.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9791], "author_name_tesi": "Jinkins, David Carson", "last_name_ssi": "Jinkins", "middle_name_ssi": "Carson", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James R.

MXenes, a recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) material, attract great interest as one of the leading candidates for high energy storage applications such as super capacitors, lithium ion batteries, and fuel cells because of their exceptional electronic conductivities [1-6]. Due to the hydrophilic nature on the surface and the weakness of hydrogen bond and van der Waals force between the MXene layers, MXenes can easily trap water molecules between the 2D material layers. Those water molecules significantly affect the electrical potential of MXenes [7]. In order to provide insight into proton conduction in MXene-trapped water layers, we simulated proton diffusion in this water layer to investigate how protons hop around in terms of time and, temperature and compare this simulation with the electrical potential found in bulk water diffusion.

Analysis of synergies has been performed within the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis, in which variance is decomposed into two components depending on whether it affects task performance or not. Then, the two components are reduced to a single index reflecting the relative amount of two variance components; this index is typically used as a synergy index. The method has proven to be able to quantify synergies in a variety of elemental spaces for a variety of tasks. In this dissertation, a series of studies exploring synergies stabilizing the hand action in various subpopulations are presented. Subpopulations include patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, cortical stroke, and healthy controls. The application of the concept of synergy to patient groups has allowed quantifying aspects of impairments related to movement stability and agility and also provided insights into neural mechanisms of synergic control. The evidence presented in the dissertation has led to the following main conclusions. First, impaired control of movement stability is commonly seen in persons with impairments in subcortical brain structures. The impairments are seen as low synergy indices during steady states of performance and delayed/reduced drop in the synergy indices before quick action (low anticipatory synergy adjustments). Second, these two components of the impairments in the control of stability may have distinct neurophysiological mechanisms and they could be selectively involved in different disorders. The results consistently suggest subcortical loops as being crucial for high stability of task performance. Third, the changes in synergy indices could be seen at the early stages of the PD and even in subclinical stages of disorder involving the basal ganglia, when traditional clinical examination fails to show any impairment. Lastly, changes in motor synergies are sensitive to treatment in PD patients. These features potentially make synergy indices a powerful tool to objectively quantify the impairments of motor symptoms and also a useful biomarker for early detection of motor changes.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12232], "author_name_tesi": "Jo, Hang Jin ", "last_name_ssi": "Jo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hang Jin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Latash", "Mark Latash", "Xuemei Huang", "Robert L Sainburg", "Kristina A Neely"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Latash, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Latash, Committee Chair", "Xuemei Huang, Outside Member", "Robert L Sainburg, Committee Member", "Kristina A Neely, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Synergy", "Hand", "Prehension", "Uncontrolled Manifold Hypothesis", "Parkinson's disease"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Deploying root traits for African bean breeding", "id": "18039", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1100", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Common bean is the most important grain legume for direct human consumption in the world. It provides dietary protein and minerals for millions of people in developing countries. Low Phosphorus (P) availability and drought are major constraints to bean production in many productions region in Africa and Latin America. Genotypic adaptation to drought and low soil P availability is associated with phenotypic variation in root architecture. Plants evolved a wide range of adaptations to enhance P and water acquisition from the soil. In this dissertation, we describe the importance of root traits for resource acquisition and the used of root phenotyping and selection as an alternative for improving crop adaption to drought and low P stresses. Chapter 1 presents the general introduction of common bean as a legume crop with emphasis on the importance of root architecture for water and nutrient uptake from the soil, and the genetic basis of some root traits. In Chapter 2 we developed a rapid, simple and inexpensive method for field phenotyping of root phenes of common bean. With this method twelve architectural root phenes from one root crown can be evaluated in two minutes. The field phenotyping method we developed, Shovelomics, should have utility for bean breeding for low P and drought tolerance in developing countries of Africa and Latin America. In chapter 3, we describe a large and diverse genetic variation in root phenes of common bean from Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools. Large variation among genotypes within gene pools, genotypes within race, and genotypes within country of origin were detected. Genotypes with root traits associated with adaptation to low P availability were found in both gene pools, while traits associated with adaptation to drought stress were mostly found in the Mesoamerican gene pool. Our findings indicate that useful root traits for breeding for edaphic stresses were identified in both Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools. In Chapter 4, we worked with root hair traits, and longer and denser root hairs are associated with P efficiency in crops. We found large genetic variation in root hair length from basal roots within bean populations derived from parents contrasting in root hair traits. In addition, we estimated the heritability of root hair length from basal roots using parent-offspring regression analysis, and we found moderately high heritability of root hair length in two populations. This result has implications for strategies used for selection for longer and denser root hairs. The relatively high heritability suggests that considerable progress may be expected from selection for longer root hairs in segregating bean populations. Breeding for longer and denser root hairs could enhance acquisition of P in low P soils in Africa and Latin America.

In spite of the highly parallel structure of GPUs and their ability to execute multiple threads concurrently, they are far from achieving their theoretically achievable peak performance. This is attributed to several reasons such as contention for limited shared resources (e.g., caches and memory), high control-flow divergence, and limited off-chip memory bandwidth. Another reason for the low utilization and subpar performance is that the current GPUs are not well-equipped to efficiently and fairly execute multiple applications concurrently, potentially originating from different users. This dissertation is focused on managing contention in GPUs for shared cache and memory resources caused by concurrently executing threads. This contention causes severe loss in performance, fairness, locality, and parallelism. To manage this contention, this dissertation proposes techniques that are employed at two different places:core and memory. First, this dissertation shows that by intelligently \nscheduling the threads at the core, the generated memory request \npatterns can be more amenable for existing resource management \ntechniques such as cache replacement and memory scheduling\nas well as performance enhancement techniques such as data \nprefetching.

In such situations, models that assume a constant effect can fail to detect QTL in a whole genome scan. To investigate this possibility, we utilize an extension of the Cox model (EC-model) within an interval-mapping framework. In its simplest form, this model assumes that the QTL effect changes at some time point t0, and follows a linear function before and after this change point.  The approximate time point at which this change occurs is estimated. Using simulated and real data, we explore the mapping performance of the EC-model to the Cox Proportional Hazards model (CPH-model), which explicitly assumes a constant effect.  The results show that the EC- model detects time-dependent QTL, which the CPH model fails to detect. At the same time, the EC-model recovers all of the QTL the CPH-model detects.

Pressurized counterflow studies conducted using pressed ammonium perchlorate pellets and gaseous ethylene show three pressure dependent combustion regimes.  At pressures below 1 MPa, ammonium perchlorate decomposition is controlled by heat transfer from the resulting fuel/oxidizer diffusion flame, exhibiting a weak dependence on flame strain rate and burning rates between 0.01 to 0.05 cm/s.  As pressure increases, the monopropellant flame moves closer to the oxidizer surface until the pressure reaches the self-decomposition limit near 3 MPa, indicating that the monopropellant flame dominates the diffusion flame.  Further increasing the pressure yields burning rates between 0.4 to 0.7 cm/s, which are consistent with the literature, and exhibit little strain rate dependence for the range of flow conditions tested.  Similar studies conducted with methane suggest independence of fuel type.  The pressurized counterflow apparatus was also utilized to examine the regression rate of hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene with gaseous oxygen at varied pressures.  The diffusion-controlled burning rates exhibited no pressure dependence, as expected, and agreed well with published regression rate data.

For long-distance migrants, the Green Wave Hypothesis has served as a broadly applicable framework for understanding the role of spatially propagating resource phenology in spring migration departure from wintering grounds, migratory rate, and timing of arrival at summer breeding grounds.  While avian migrants and subarctic ungulates have been the focus of previous research on this topic, little focus has been placed to date on the impacts of climate change on ungulate migration phenology in the Arctic.

However, the details of joint trajectories and force production reveal considerable variability from one trial to the next. In this thesis we intend to understand the different factors that affect goal-level variability, a common measure of performance, in repeated trials of skilled tasks. Body-level variability has a significant effect on goal-level variability but it turns out that the body-level variability is just one of the factors; there are other passive and active factors that affect performance. \n\nWe develop a novel theoretical framework to model the trial-to-trial dynamics arising in repeated trials. This approach, at its core, depends on the idea of a goal function: a mathematical definition of a task in terms of the subject's morphology, the physics of the environment, and the requirements of the task. This goal function, by definition must evaluate to zero for perfect performance. The set of possible body-states that satisfy this relation often has the structure of a goal equivalent manifold (GEM) on which the movement system attempts to converge while trying to achieve the goal. Our models help us analyze the ensuing dynamics and also demonstrates how the various factors like stability, noise and passive sensitivity interact with each other to produce performance.\n\nUsing our approach we are able to develop data-analysis techniques that assess the stability of the inter-trial control process involved. Also, we are able to reconstruct the time-series of the controller action required to converge on the solution manifold and this sheds light on the structure of performance variability. To test some of the predictions of our model we develop a virtual-reality shuffleboard game. Based on our theory we predict the scaling of goal-level performance with respect to the passive sensitivity properties along the GEM. Using the understanding gained from our model, we also hypothesize that inter-trial dynamics is significantly more stable in a direction normal to the GEM while in the tangential direction it is weakly stable and that fluctuations in these directions are more uncorrelated (less persistent) and more persistent respectively. These hypotheses are tested and established to be true using the data-analysis methods we developed applied to the shuffleboard experiment. \n\nThe theoretical framework developed in this work can be readily adapted to quantitatively characterize performance in a variety of skilled human tasks.

Hip hop poetry, with its roots in African American rhetorical traditions, is a complex and extensive art form that stems from spoken word poetry. Spoken word poetry is an umbrella term for five different genres of poetry: performance poetry, hip hop poetry, slam poetry, Taos poetry, and Nuyorican poetry. It is defined as poetry that is written on the page but performed for an audience. Hip hop poetry, more specifically, \u201ctends to forefront rhythm, improvisation, free association, rhymes, and the use of hybrid language, from rich poetic phrasing to the gritty imagery of vernacular\u201d (Weiss & Herndon, 2001, p. 70). Hip hop poetry also serves specific functions. Hip hop poets act as conduits for literacy education, identity development, political awareness, and activism within their communities. In this sense, art becomes a space for social action, a space where groups can mobilize and generate a sense of power and voice.\nUsing rhetorical ethnography as method, the author embarks on a seven month journey through the Los Angeles spoken word scene to observe how spoken word communities perform collective identity. The author also explores spoken word as a counterpublic collective that engages in oppositional discourse. Through ethnographic observation, interviews, focus groups, and rhetorical analysis, the author analyzes the performance of collective identity, membership, and counterpublicity, and describes the ways in which the spoken word counterpublic collective attempts to confront oppression.  \nThis study exposes the interdependence among the study of identity, counterpublicity, and performance. The author concludes that identity directly affects the motives behind a counterpublic collective coming together and performing counter-hegemonic discourse. Ethnographic exploration of counter-hegemonic discursive performance uncovers the ways in which spoken word artists attempt to transgress dominant ideologies and carve space for new meanings to emerge that validate their lived experiences. Rhetorical analysis of the performance illuminates the ways in which spoken word artists are also supporting and reinforcing dominant ideologies. The researcher offers rhetorical ethnography as method and makes suggestions for future studies concerning the multifaceted aspects of counterpublic collective identity and performance.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [224], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Amber Lauren", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "Lauren", "first_name_ssi": "Amber", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ronald L Jackson Ii", "Rosa A Eberly", "Ian E Baptiste", "Raymond Keith Gilyard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ronald L Jackson Ii, Committee Chair", "Rosa A Eberly, Committee Member", "Ian E Baptiste, Committee Member", "Raymond Keith Gilyard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rhetoric", "poetry", "performance", "counterpublic", "collective identity", "ethnography", "spoken word"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "connected learning: exploring children\u2019s motivations for new\nmedia use, technology identity and academic outcomes\n", "id": "21565", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10031", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The rapid development of new media technologies has realized widespread adoption, especially among young users.

Identifying subtypes of BPD promises useful diagnostic and treatment implications.  Although a series of subtyping studies exist, only two have examined BPD subtypes while taking into account BPD severity.  We utilize factor mixture modeling (FMM) to identify discrete BPD subtypes, simultaneously considering symptom severity, in a large nonclinical young adult sample.  We also consider how identified subtypes may be reflected in individuals reliably diagnosed with BPD.\n \nMethod: Undergraduate students (N = 20,010; 63.86% female; mean age=18.75, SD = 1.73) and BPD-diagnosed participants (N = 66; 97% female; mean age = 29.74, SD = 10.94) completed a dimensional version of the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD).  This was condensed to measure the nine DSM BPD criteria on a True/False scale.  We conducted FMM to determine classes of individuals characterized by different responses to the MSI-BPD as well as the composition of underlying BPD severity dimensions. \n\nResults: The nonclinical sample was comprised of three subtypes\u2014Asymptomatic (70%), Impulsive/Externalizing (19%), and Identity Disturbed/Internalizing (11%)\u2014falling along a single continuum of increasing BPD severity.  In the BPD sample, a single severity dimension best captured BPD symptomatology and no subtypes were identifiable. \n\nConclusions: Our results suggest the importance of both dimensional and categorical conceptualizations of BPD, depending on the sample and level of severity in focus.  Impulsive/Externalizing and Identity Disturbed/Internalizing classes suggest different treatment targets for subthreshold BPD and potential etiologically relevant profiles for BPD development.  The findings are discussed in terms of their clinical implications regarding diagnosis, treatment, and theoretical conceptualization of BPD.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14199], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Benjamin Norman", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "Norman", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth N.

When agricultural crops are parasitized, the economic losses are devastating.  Yet despite the ecological and economic significance of parasitic plants, we know relatively little about how ecological factors influence their growth prior to host acquisition.  In this work we explore the effects of two important environmental cues\u2014temperature and light spectral quality\u2014on host acquisition by obligate parasites in the genus Cuscuta (dodders).  The majority of dodder research has focused on their ecology as a mature parasite, but much less is known about their ecology as a seedling in search of a host.  We conducted a series of experiments to better understand how temperature and light spectral quality influence the host acquisition process of dodder seedlings.  First we explored how changes in temperature impact dodder parasitism.  Temperature significantly affected seedling circumnutation: seedlings rotated fastest in warm temperatures; however, it did not affect dodder foraging success, as the majority of seedlings located their hosts in conditions from 28\u00b0C to 45\u00b0C.  The ability of dodder seedlings to successfully parasitize tomato hosts was also affected by temperature:  parasitism was significantly reduced above 37\u00b0C.  Next we examined how temperature and light spectral quality (the ratio of red to far-red light, R:FR) impact the constitutive release of tomato volatiles.  Temperature did not influence the overall total emission of volatiles but it did affect the release of several individual compounds.  The ratio of R:FR light had a slight effect on total volatile emissions and a significant effect on the release of several individual compounds, with reduced emissions occurring in high R:FR environments.  Last we investigated the effect of R:FR on host acquisition using two light manipulation approaches.  We found dodders had significantly reduced foraging and parasitism success in high R:FR environments.  The effect of brief exposure to high R:FR on the short- and long-term growth of host plants was negligible.  We conclude dodder host acquisition is significantly impacted by environmental factors such as temperature and light spectral quality.  Moving forward, we recommend expanding this work to develop novel forms of control against this economically destructive pest.

With the inability of traditional brain imaging techniques to properly assess the severity of brain damage induced by mTBI, there is hope that more advanced neuroimaging applications will be more sensitive, as well as specific, in accurately assessing mTBI. In this study, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate the default mode network (DMN) in the subacute phase of mTBI. Fourteen concussed student- athletes who were asymptomatic based upon clinical symptoms resolution and clearance for aerobic exercise by medical professionals were scanned using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Nine additional asymptomatic, yet not medically cleared athletes were recruited to investigate the effect of a single episode of mTBI versus multiple mTBIs on the resting state DMN. In concussed individuals the resting state DMN showed a reduced number of connections and strength of connections in the posterior cingulate and lateral parietal cortices. However an increased number of connections and strength of connections was seen in the medial prefrontal cortex of the mTBI group. Connections between the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex and left lateral parietal cortex showed a significant reduction in magnitude as the number of concussions increased. Regression analysis also indicated an overall loss of connectivity as the number of mTBI episodes increased.

The effects of repetitive subconcussive head trauma, occurring in full contact sports, on brain structural, functional and metabolic integrity has not been sufficiently investigated. It is yet to be determined whether these multiple subconcussive blows induce transient alterations in the brain or long-term deficits. Our central hypothesis is that previous concussive episodes lead to chronic cognitive and functional deficits in the brain. Additionally, a history of prior concussion may increase an athletes' vulnerability to repetitive subconcussive blows leading to a compromise in metabolic, structural, and/or functional brain integrity. Thus, specific alteration of brain functional/structural integrity in the acute phase of injury may identify athletes at high risk for recurrent concussion. In order to assess the effect of subconcussive blows advanced neuroimaging techniques (functional magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and neuropsychological testing) was completed during two (pregame and postgame) identical testing sessions that occurred within 24 hrs prior to a scheduled full contact game and within 24 hrs of the end of that game. All subjects under study displayed no signs or symptoms of a concussion at either testing session and were also observed during and after the game by a medical professional. Virtual reality assessment of balance, reaction time, and working spatial memory revealed poorer performance in the group with a history of previous concussion compared to those with no prior concussion. Furthermore, there were significant reductions in neurometbolite ratios in the group with a history of concussion as assessed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed reduced connectivity in the group with previous concussion, yet no changes in functional connectivity pre-game to post-game. However, the group with no history of concussion showed a\niv\nsignificant decrease in connectivity in the right lateral parietal and medial pre-frontal cortex following a full contact game. Pre-game to post-game changes did not reveal any significant changes in metabolite ratios or performance on virtual reality modules, although an interesting trend was observed. Consistent across all modalities the group with a previous concussion tended to improve in their post-game evaluations compared to their pre-game assessment. Conversely the group without a history of prior concussion exhibited the opposite trend and consistently performed worse in the post-game evaluation.

Here we use 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to evaluate the brain metabolites N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), and creatine (Cr) in the corpus callosum in mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). Specifically we looked at the NAA/Cho, NAA/Cr, and Cho/Cr ratios in the genu and splenium.

Additionally, We recruited 20 NV and 28 student athletes recovering from sub-acute phase of MTBI.

Results of logistic regression analysis indicated significant main effects for the roles of marriage or engagement, parenthood, both marriage or engagement plus parenthood, fulltime employment, and both marriage plus fulltime employment on prevalence of drinking and/or binge drinking over 30 days when controlling for age.  Of those women in dual roles, those who were married or engaged plus parenting were about half as likely to drink over 30 days (OR=.46) and those who were married or engaged plus employed were approximately twice as likely to drink (OR=2.04) as those who were  married or engaged but without a dual role.  A trend toward less drinking, especially binge drinking, was noted as the women in this sample increased the number of roles they assumed from one to three.  The study demonstrated the importance of young adult role assumptions in lowering the prevalence of drinking.

It aims to reveal the unique effect that these measures of self-concept have on consumer preferences such as product evaluation, purchase intention, attitude toward the ad, and attitude toward the model.\nThe role of self-concept in ad processing has been given little attention in past advertising research, with researchers opting to focus more on concepts such as message appeals and message content. However, research involving the self not only investigates a significant factor in consumer response but also is easily obtainable via self-reports, and should thus be given more attention in the field of advertising. Individuals vary immensely in their self-image; it is through research where we can determine how the differences in these aspects of self affect how consumers respond to advertised images.\nAs predicted, Black participants who were exposed to an ad with a Black model demonstrated a more positive attitude toward the ad, higher self-image congruity, higher purchase intention and more positive attitude toward the model than those who were exposed to the White model. However, tests of responses of White participants did not yield similar results; Whites maintained a more positive attitude toward the ad featuring the Black model, and did not show preference for either the Black or the White model with regard to self-image congruity, purchase intention, and attitude toward the model.\nFurthermore, the interaction of masculinity and the race of the model yielded a significant interaction for Whites such that those high in masculinity showed a higher purchase intention when exposed to the White model, whereas those lower in masculinity exhibited a strong purchase intention for the product when presented with a Black model. No other effects of masculinity on the dependent variables were significant. However, the interaction of masculinity with the race of the model suggests that further research may uncover a deeper relationship between the effects of race and masculinity on reactions to advertisements.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [998], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Curtis J.T.", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "J.T.", "first_name_ssi": "Curtis", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Media Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Francis Erin Dardis", "Francis Erin Dardis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Francis Erin Dardis, Thesis Advisor", "Francis Erin Dardis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["attitude toward the model", "atttitude toward the ad", "racial identification", "racial identity", "masculinity", "advertising", "perceived masculinity", "self-identification", "self-image congruity", "purchase intention"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "General Education 2000 - A National Survey: How General Education Changed Between 1989 and 2000", "id": "5993", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1453", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThis national study describes changes in general education practice between 1989 and 2000.  General education has been a formal part of the typical American baccalaureate since the early 1900s (Cohen, 1998).  Periodic reviews of general education are conducted. Since the late 1960s,  these reviews have occurred in approximately ten year intervals.  Dressel (1967), Blackburn et al. (1976), Toombs, et al. (1989), and Gaff (1991) examined general education across American higher education institutions.  These studies trace the development of general education through the 1990s. The current study adds to this chronicling of general education. \n\nUndergraduate education in the United States was critically examined through a series of national reports between 1985 and 1995.  Through these reports were directed at undergraduate education, they had implications for general education (Stark and Lattuca, 1997).  The reports lamented increasing fragmentation in the undergraduate curriculum and the loss of a common understanding of the role for general education in the American baccalaureate.  During the same period access to higher education increased resulting in an increasingly diverse student population served by increasingly diverse institutions of higher education.  These changes suggest that general education may have changed and support the need for the present study.\n\nThe study is exploratory and attempts to discover how general education changed and what influenced change in general education curricula.  A national survey of Chief Academic Officers and a national survey of General Education Administrators solicited responses from those campus leaders most familiar with general education on their campuses.  The study collected perceptual and behavioral information to determine the status of general education and to compare its findings to studies by Toombs, et al.(1989) and Gaff (1991).  The findings of the study suggest that general education practice changed in the period and that it is continuing to change.  The primary aims of the reforms were making general education programs more coherent, meeting changing student needs, and updating programs to reflect changing contexts. The study also found that the historical pattern of general education reform occurring in waves, reported by Gaff (1991), changed.  The new pattern is one of continuous change.  The findings suggest general education programs are more dynamic than in the past.  As a result, this study found that general education practice might need to be guided by models that account for interactions between content, faculty, students, and other stake holders and that consider both the curriculum that faculty plan and the curriculum that students receive.  \n\nThe study suggests that two models be used to guide general education scholarship and practice \u2013 an academic planning model (Stark and Lattuca, 1997) and a model of curricula as communication (Ratcliff, 2000, 2001).  Together, these models consider both the curriculum faculty plan and the curriculum students receive.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1438], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Damon Kent", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "Kent", "first_name_ssi": "Damon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Fredericks Volkwein", "Dorothy H Evensen", "Jeremy Cohen", "James L Ratcliff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Fredericks Volkwein, Committee Chair", "Dorothy H Evensen, Committee Member", "Jeremy Cohen, Committee Member", "James L Ratcliff, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["general education", "curriculum", "higher education"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Language, Truth, and Reason: Gadamer with Nishida", "id": "18254", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "8324", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the hallmarks of contemporary life is a widespread feeling of resignation about the ability of human reason to reach truth in ethical and political matters.

This contention poses two tasks for this project. The first task is to give an account of the event through which the truth-disclosing function of language grounds our normative claims. Here truth is uncovered in the linguistic space opened up and constituted by the participants in a dialogue. In this process, the individual actions and intentions of the participants are taken up into a movement that has its own dynamic, such that the truth is something that acts on our understanding in an event of self-presentation. I shed light on the ontological foundations of this difficult and radical concept of truth by comparing it to Nishida Kitar\u014d\u2019s distinctive philosophical account of the structure of experience, which is founded on an attempt to display the perspectives of subject and object as moments within a more basic and encompassing reality. Finally, the claim that truth \u2018happens\u2019 when things come to presentation in language relies on an understanding of language as essentially disclosive rather than referential.

There is also evidence supporting the hypothesized positive relationship between mobilization and the incidence of environmental laws, though this relationship is considerably weaker and more tenuous.  The effect of environmental movement mobilization remains unchanged even once we control for public opinion, which has no independent effect on either environmental agenda setting or the passage of laws.

Density functional theory calculations reveal that these clusters all possess the same active site consisting of a radical oxygen (Zr-O\u2022) with an elongated zirconium-oxygen bond (elongation &#8776; 0.24 \u00b1 0.02 \u00c5) and a spin-unpaired electron located on the terminal oxygen atom. Calculated energy pro&#64257;les demonstrate that each oxidation reaction is favorable energetically and involves easily surmountable barriers. Furthermore, it is found that the active series of stoichiometric clusters (ZrO2)x+ (x = 1-4) may be regenerated by reacting a series of oxygen-de&#64257;cient clusters (ZrxO2x-1)+ (x = 1-4) with a strong oxidizer. This indicates that the series of clusters may promote multiple cycles of oxidation reactions and, therefore, exhibit true catalytic behavior. The series of cationic stoichiometric clusters, having structures that resemble speci&#64257;c sites in bulk zirconia, are promising candidates for potential incorporation into a cluster assembled catalyst material. \nGuided-ion-beam mass spectrometry experiments and density functional theory calculations have also been conducted to determine the influence of ionic charge state on the catalytic activity of gas-phase zirconium oxide clusters containing radical oxygen centers. Experiment and theory indicate that by adding one oxygen atom with a full octet of valence electrons (O2-) to a series of stoichiometric cationic zirconium oxide clusters (ZrO2)x+ (x = 1-4), a series of anionic clusters (ZrxO2x+1)- (x = 1-4) are formed which contain radical oxygen with elongated (elongation &#8776; 0.24 \u00b1 0.02 \u00c5) metal-oxygen bonds and a spin unpaired electron located on the terminal oxygen atom. The series of anionic clusters oxidize carbon monoxide, strongly associate acetylene, and weakly associate ethylene, in contrast to the series of cationic clusters that was found to be highly active toward the oxidation of all three molecules. Theoretical investigations indicate that a critical hydrogen transfer step necessary for the oxidation of ethylene and acetylene at metal oxide clusters containing radical oxygen centers is energetically favorable for cationic clusters but unfavorable for the corresponding anionic species. The calculated electrostatic potential of the cluster reveals that in the case of cations, a favorable interaction with nucleophilic molecules takes place over the whole surface of the (ZrO2)x+ (x = 1-4) series of clusters, compared to a restricted interaction of ethylene and acetylene with the less coordinated zirconium atom in the case of the anionic (ZrxO2x+1)- (x = 1-4) series. Therefore, in spite of the common presence of radical oxygen in specific anionic and cationic stoichiometries, the extent to which various classes of reactions are promoted is directly determined by ionic charge state. Moreover, the (ZrxO2x+1)- (x = 1-4) series of anionic clusters may be regenerated by reacting a series of oxygen deficient anionic clusters (ZrO2)x- (x = 1-4) with a strong oxidizer. This indicates that not only cationic species, but also anionic clusters may promote multiple cycles of carbon monoxide oxidation.\nThe guided-ion-beam technique also has been applied to investigate the reactivity of gas-phase cationic tungsten oxide clusters with carbon monoxide and propylene. A series of cationic clusters having the same stoichiometry as bulk tungsten oxide (WO3) exhibit enhanced activity and selectivity for the transfer of a single oxygen atom to propylene, suggesting the formation of propylene oxide, an important monomer used, for example, in the industrial production of plastics. Furthermore, the series of cationic stoichiometric clusters have been demonstrated to be active for the oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, a reaction of significance to environmental pollution abatement. The findings suggest that the enhanced oxidation reactivity of the stoichiometric cationic clusters also may be due to the presence of radical oxygen (W-O\u2022) with elongated metal-oxygen bonds. \nIn other studies, small cationic and anionic aluminum oxide clusters have been investigated to determine their reactivity toward carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide employing guided-ion-beam mass spectrometry. Clusters with the same stoichiometry as bulk alumina, Al2O3, exhibited atomic oxygen transfer products when reacted with carbon monoxide, suggesting the formation of carbon dioxide. Anionic clusters were less reactive than cationic species but showed higher selectivity towards the transfer of only a single oxygen atom. Cationic clusters, in contrast, exhibited additional products corresponding to the sequential transfer of two oxygen atoms and the loss of an aluminum atom. To determine if these stoichiometric clusters may be generated from oxygen-deficient species, clusters having a stoichiometry with one less oxygen atom than bulk alumina, Al2O2, were reacted with nitrous oxide. Cationic clusters were found to be selectively oxidized to Al2O3+, while anionic clusters added both one and two oxygen atoms forming Al2O3- and Al2O4-. The oxygen-rich Al2O4- cluster exhibited comparable reactivity to Al2O3- when reacted with carbon monoxide.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2017], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Grant Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Grant", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Nicholas Winograd", "Ayusman Sen", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Chair", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cluster", "radical", "oxygen", "zirconium", "tungsten", "aluminum"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "MAKING SENSE OF RATE OF CHANGE: SECONDARY STUDENTS\u2019 REASONING ABOUT CHANGING QUANTITIES\n", "id": "10952", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2215", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rate of change is an important concept for students to study, and little is known about the ways in which secondary students make sense of rate of change. In this qualitative study I examined how four high school students who have not taken calculus reasoned about changing quantities when interacting with mathematical tasks involving multiple representations of constant and varying rates of change. Employing a cognitive perspective on mathematical reasoning, I conducted a series of five individual, task-based interviews with each student. Although mathematical reasoning is not directly observable, I made inferences regarding students\u2019 reasoning based on their explanations, their written work, and their gestures, counting as data those episodes during which students provided evidence of attending to changing quantities. Using the method of constant comparison, I traced students\u2019 reasoning from their explanations, written work and gestures to develop characterizations of their reasoning. In addition, I examined how students combined covariational (Carlson et al., 2002), transformational (Simon, 1996), and proportional (Lamon, 2007) reasoning when reasoning quantitatively about specific and nonspecific amounts of change. During the series of task-based interviews, students encountered the same set of tasks, but each of the students reasoned in different ways. The students utilized different combinations of covariational, transformational, and proportional reasoning when reasoning quantitatively about specific and nonspecific amounts of change.

The purpose of this work is to determine: 1) when this alteration occurred (>3.5 Ga, ~3.43 Ga, or <3.4 Ga); and 2) whether it was produced by submarine/subaerial hydrothermal activity or subaerial weathering (e.g., paleosol, modern soil).  To answer these questions a combination of field and laboratory techniques were utilized including mapping, bulk chemical analysis, powder XRD, thin section analysis, and geochronology. \nThe study has revealed that the alteration is divisible into 4 distinct zones by changes in chemistry and mineralogy: IV) the least altered parent (submarine andesite to basaltic andesite) at the base of the profile (>40-80m below the unconformity) which is characterized by chlorite and muscovite replacement of the original mineralogy, as well as probable losses in Ca and Na; III) a lower Fe-poor zone (17 - <40-80m) which contains poorly crystalline silica and muscovite with minor pyrophyllite and shows increased concentrations of Si, K, Na and depletions of other major elements and REEs; II)  a horizon of Fe-enriched (up to 81 wt% Fe2O3) pillowed volcanics (0-17 m below the unconformity and 1 \u2013 6 m thick) that contain pyrophyllite, muscovite, minor quartz, and enrichments of LREEs; and I) an upper Fe-poor zone (0 \u2013 17m) which is enriched in pyrophyllite, poorly crystalline silica and muscovite but depleted in all major elements except Si and K.  Other notable features of the alteration zone include: a loss of original volcanic mineral texture with increasing proximity to the unconformity; a significant loss of volume (40 \u2013 60%) in Zones I and II; the confinement of the pyrophyllite-rich zone to below the unconformity; a lack hydrothermal features (i.e. veins); possible soil textures; and the presence of possible rip-up clasts of the alteration in conglomerates overlying the unconformity surface.  Such features are consistent with other Archean paleosols.  Sm-Nd and Rb-Sr dating has revealed that the alteration zone underwent a loss of all major elements at 3.47\u00b10.46 Ga, contemporaneously with the development of the erosional unconformity surface, as well as an addition of Si, K, and Na by groundwater at 2.76\u00b10.15 Ga.  The geological, geochemical, geochronological, and mineralogical features of the alteration zone strongly suggest that it represents a paleosol that developed at ~3.4 Ga. \nPaleosols are physical records of the condition of the surface environments, composition of the atmosphere, and the nature of the biosphere present during their formation.  The Warrawoona paleosol at Trendall Ridge is at least 250 Myr older than any other previously studied paleosol, and would provide insight into a poorly understood period of Earth\u2019s early history when life was emerging. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2426], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Ian Matthew", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "Matthew", "first_name_ssi": "Ian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hiroshi Ohmoto", "Hiroshi Ohmoto"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hiroshi Ohmoto, Thesis Advisor", "Hiroshi Ohmoto, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Paleosol", "Archean", "Pilbara", "Iron and Aluminum Mobility"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Power Efficiency and Scaling of the Cell Broadband Engine\n\n", "id": "9587", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2589", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<p>Since the 1980s, frequency scaling, brought on by Moore's Law, has given us increased uniprocessor performance at a steady rate and with no cost to application programmers.

Chapter 3 analyzes lobotomy\u2019s articulation with anticommunist fictions (novels and films, the \u201cbrainwashing\u201d panic, and ultraconservative conspiracy theory) in order to argue for a broader contextualization of lobotomy\u2019s displacement by psychopharmacology in the mid-1950s.

Ultimately, Echoes of the Soul shows how biomedicine interacts rhetorically with other forms of culture and argues that this interaction shapes biomedical development, the construction of a useable medical past, and the ethical commitments that guide our vision for medicine\u2019s future. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2858], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Jenell M.", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Jenell", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Merrill Squier", "Michael Francis Berube", "Rosa A Eberly", "Stephen Howard Browne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Merrill Squier, Committee Chair", "Michael Francis Berube, Committee Member", "Rosa A Eberly, Committee Member", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rhetoric of Science", "lobotomy"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Illocutionary Force of Hurt and Support in Young Adult Romantic Relationships: Message Feature Ratings, Message Perceptions, and Physiological stress", "id": "9434", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3020", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is founded on the assumption that interpersonal communication experiences, especially as they relate to a person\u2019s identity, are instrumental in physiological stress reactivity and recovery. Accordingly, the goal of the dissertation is to examine how features of interpersonal messages can vary in ways that impact stress. \n\tAs a starting point, Chapter 1 reviews literature on the components of identity and explores how communication shapes identity. Given the central role of communication in the formation and maintenance of identity, the remainder of the chapter describes how communication can threaten and support identity.\nAs a foundation for understanding the role of communication in the stress response, Chapter 2 describes the environmental, psychological, and physiological aspects of stress. Then, the chapter examines how identity disconfirming messages can initiate the stress response through the perception of threat and how identity confirming messages can reduce physiological stress by changing perceptions of a stressful situation.\nIn Chapter 3, illocutionary force, or the strength of a message, is identified as a theoretical mechanism for understanding how messages can impact physiological stress. The chapter begins by explicating illocutionary force. Then, the ways that message features and message perceptions can vary in force and impact the magnitude of the stress response are examined. Consistent with this logic, hypotheses specify the associations between perceived explicitness, argument strength, involvement, hurt, support, dominance, and affiliation and stress responses to interactions with a dating partner. \nChapter 4 describes the methods of a study designed to assess the impact of hurtful messages on stress reactivity. The chapter begins by discussing the procedures and results of a pilot study that evaluated the extent to which hurtful messages from a dating partner initiated a stress response. Then, the chapter describes the demographic characteristics of the participants who completed Study 1. Finally, Chapter 4 summarizes the self-report and observational measures used to test some of the hypotheses forwarded in Chapter 3.\nChapter 5 presents the results of Study 1 and discusses the implications for the study of hurtful messages. A series of regression analyses were conducted to test the relationships between the rated message features and stress reactivity to hurtful messages. Stress reactivity was operationalized in two ways: area under the curve with respect to increase and area under the curve with respect to ground. The results of the analyses provided partial support for the hypotheses. The perceived message features did not directly predict increases in physiological stress; however, there were significant interactions between the rated message feature, self-reported perceptions of hurt, and partner involvement for each rated message feature. The perceived message features also did not predict the stability of cortisol change after a hurtful interaction. \nChapter 6 presents methods and results of two pilot studies and the procedures used in Study 2 to assess the impact of supportive messages on stress recovery. First, the chapter describes a pilot study in which participants recalled recent stressful events to initiate the stress response. Second, the chapter describes the procedures used in the second pilot study and Study 2, in which participants completed a series of stressful tasks to induce stress reactivity and then engaged in a conversation with a dating partner. Finally, the chapter explains the self-report and observational measured used in Study 2 to test some of the hypotheses forwarded in Chapter 3. \nIn Chapter 7, the results of Study 2 are presented. Rated explicitness, argument strength, and involvement all had a direct effect on recovery from the stressful tasks, providing support for the hypotheses. Observer ratings of supportiveness, dominance, and affiliation did not directly impact cortisol change.\nFinally, Chapter 8 discusses the implications of both studies for understanding the impact of illocutionary force on physiological stress and the relationship between communication and stress. The chapter also explores the practical applications of the findings. Finally, the chapter concludes by examining the strengths and weaknesses of the dissertation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3011], "author_name_tesi": "Johnson, Jennifer Susan", "last_name_ssi": "Johnson", "middle_name_ssi": "Susan", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Denise Haunani Solomon", "Roxanne Louise Parrott", "Jon F Nussbaum", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli", "Denise Haunani Solomon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Denise Haunani Solomon, Dissertation Advisor", "Roxanne Louise Parrott, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli, Committee Member", "Denise Haunani Solomon, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Support", "Hurt", "Message Features", "Physiological Stress"]}]
