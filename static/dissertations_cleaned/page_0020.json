Although CR technology is not a new concept, it has not been understood as well as Hot Mixture Asphalt (HMA) and Warm Mixture Asphalt (WMA). Currently, a nationwide standard for CR mixture design does not exist. Furthermore, sufficient data is not available to indicate if there is a difference between the performance of cold mixtures stabilized with conventional emulsions versus those stabilized with polymer modified emulsions.\n\nIn this thesis, the performance of lab produced CR specimens with conventional asphalt emulsion and polymer modified asphalt emulsion is investigated through conducting a series of tests. CR specimens were prepared in precise procedures to ensure reliable and consistent specimen production for testing. Through basic volumetric measurements and performance related tests including strength, durability, moisture damage resistance, and rutting resistance, a general CR mixture design procedure was established. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine the difference between performance of CR mixtures modified with conventional and polymer modified emulsion. Although no significant\ndifference in performance was observed for most of the performance measures, polymer modified emulsion was shown to improve the rutting resistance of CR mixtures compared with conventional emulsion.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10684], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Xuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xuan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mansour Solaimanian", "Shelley Marie Stoffels"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mansour Solaimanian, Thesis Advisor", "Shelley Marie Stoffels, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cold Recycling", "Recycled Asphalt Pavement", "Asphalt Emulsion", "Mixture Design", "Polymer Modified Asphalt Mixture."]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Investigating the cellular functions of kinesin, microtubules and +TIPs using in vitro reconstitution, microscale engineering and novel statistical techniques", "id": "23617", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10691", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microtubules are cytoskeletal filaments that self-assemble from \u03b1\u03b2 tubulin dimers and are essential for cellular mechanics, cell division and intracellular cargo transport.  Carrying out these functions requires numerous accessory proteins that bind to and interact with microtubules. The study of microtubules and microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) is relevant for understanding aging, developing cancer therapies, and providing approaches to treating neurodegenerative diseases. This thesis is devoted to using bioengineering tools and biophysical reconstitution methods to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which MAPs carry out their functional roles in mitosis, in organizing the neural cytoskeleton, and other processes.\nThe mitotic motor kinesin-5 is best known as a homotetramer, however, motor properties independent of its homotetrameric configuration are not well understood. From in vitro assays, an engineered kinesin-5 dimer was found to stabilize microtubules by slowing GMPCPP microtubule depolymerization and promote dynamic microtubule growth by inhibiting catastrophe. Single-molecule experiments showed that kinesin-5 remains associated with microtubule plus-ends for a duration of 7 seconds. These results demonstrate that in addition to its role in sliding apart antiparallel microtubules, kinesin-5 is a microtubule stabilizer, polymerase and end-tracker.\nTo maintain microtubule uniformity in dendrites of Drosophila neurons, microtubules growing into branches need to be guided towards the cell body. To investigate the mechanism of microtubule guidance, purified EB1 and kinesin-2 were dimerized to form an EB1-kinesin complex, and this complex was shown to be sufficient to steer the growth of one microtubule towards plus-end of another microtubule, providing a mechanism for maintaining uniform microtubule orientation, not only in neurons but also in other cells. Also, this work demonstrates that the dynamic EB1-microtubule interaction is sufficiently strong to carry out mechanical functions in cells. \nIn vitro reconstitution can be used to investigate microtubules and MAPs in well-defined environments, but it is usually limited to single microtubules. To eliminate this constraint, micro-patterned electrodes were fabricated on elevated pedestals and high frequency AC fields were used to align microtubules on the opposite electrodes, thus forming a bipolar artificial mitosis spindle in 3D with microtubule plus-ends oriented towards the overlap zone. These aligned microtubules provide a platform for investigating MAPs in a spindle-like geometry. \nCellulose synthase complex (CSC) is a membrane bound multi-subunit complex that synthesizes cellulose microfibrils and has great meaning in plant cell morphologies and commercial applications. To estimate the copy number and stoichiometry of CSC in a nondestructive way, GFP-CESA3 in Arabidopsis was photobleached under total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy. A step detection algorithm was developed and the smooth bleaching traces were analyzed by to identify discrete bleaching steps. The resulting broad distribution of step sizes was analyzed by Gaussian Mixture Model to determine the unitary step size, thus allowing estimation of the copy number. These analyses can be applied both to other photobleaching studies and to molecular motor stepping. \u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10320, 10321, 10322], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Yalei ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yalei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William O Hancock", "William O Hancock", "Melissa Rolls", "Christopher Martin Yengo", "Richard Cyr", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William O Hancock, Dissertation Advisor", "William O Hancock, Committee Chair", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "Christopher Martin Yengo, Committee Member", "Richard Cyr, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microtubule", "kinesin", "cellulose synthase", "spindle", "micro-fabrication", "in vitro reconstitution", "statistics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Building Control Knowledge Information Modeling & Control Self-Configuration", "id": "26472", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10998", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Building control systems play an important role in building energy conservation and indoor environment control.  A large number of research studies have been focusing on the development of advanced control algorithms.  These new algorithms have showed energy savings and other improvements in the studied cases.  There are a few interrelated infrastructural needs among building control related research studies, applications and industrial practices, which may further facilitate the new technology deployment and standardization.  First, there is a need for standard procedures to modularize control structure.  Second, there is a need for standard representation formats and management tools for building control knowledge (BCK).  Third, there is a need for an open-access HVAC dynamic simulation platform to develop and test advanced control algorithms.  Further, there is a need for an automated control configuration mechanism to support reconfiguration of the control system, and to eliminate manual programming errors. \nThis study aims to bridge these gaps through an integrated study with an overall goal to develop a BCK representation and management framework, and utilize this framework to self-configure building control.  More specifically, this study accomplishes a number of objectives, 1) developed a universal/standard data schema for the BCK based on analysis of existing representation formats; 2) created a database prototype to manage the BCK; 3) developed a self-configuration framework to configure control for specific building system based on interacting with BCK database; and 4) developed a dynamic HVAC simulation platform to serve as the testing bed for the control configuration.  \nResults from this study show that building control self-configuration can be achieved through interacting with a BCK database that enables the exchange of specific system information to initiate the self-configuration process.  This study contributes to information modeling for building control system (especially focus on the representation of BCK), the dynamic HVAC system modeling for control analysis, and the control self-configuration to support system reconfiguration and adaptation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10578], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Yan ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen James Treado", "Stephen James Treado", "Jelena Srebric", "John Messner", "John Yen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen James Treado, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen James Treado, Committee Chair", "Jelena Srebric, Committee Member", "John Messner, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Building", "energy", "self-configuration", "modeling", "HVAC", "Building control knowledge", "data schema", "database", "information modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Algebraic Multilevel Methods for Graph Laplacians ", "id": "15362", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7592", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation presents estimates of the convergence rate and computational complexity of an algebraic multilevel preconditioner of graph Laplacian problems.

Various molecular subtyping strategies have been developed to recognize an outbreak, match case isolates with food and environmental isolates and discriminate between outbreak isolates and isolates that are not epidemiologically associated with the outbreak.  A recently developed multi-virulence-locus sequence typing strategy (MVLST) was applied to study two recent U.S. multistate outbreaks, the 1998 hot dog outbreak and the 2002 turkey deli outbreak.  MVLST clarified the epidemiology of these two outbreaks when combined with Epidemic Clone II (ECII) PCR.  MVLST was then used to further analyze a set of representative isolates from fourteen listeriosis outbreaks and isolates not associated with any of the outbreaks.  The evolutionary clusters identified by MVLST agreed with known lineages and serotypes of L. monocytogenes.  MVLST accurately identified four known epidemic clones of L. monocytogenes: epidemic clone I (ECI), Epidemic Clone II (ECII), epidemic clone III (ECIII) and epidemic clone IV (ECIV).  MVLST revealed a population structure of L. monocytogenes similar to those suggested in previous studies.  Virulence gene sequences appear to be excellent molecular markers for identifying epidemic clones and clarifying the epidemiology of L. monocytogenes.  \n\nSequence analysis of MVLST data identified a minimum of twenty eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) capable of differentiating all isolates, including all four epidemic clones.  Sequence analysis of Genbank data identified three SNPs that can separate outbreak clones within ECI and ECIII.  A combination of pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and ligation-mediated (LM) PCR identified a SNP in bacteriophage A118 in L. monocytogenes that can separate outbreak clones within ECII.  SNPs in prophage regions that could separate outbreak clones within ECIII and ECIV were subsequently identified.  \n\nTo simplify molecular typing of L. monocytogenes, a multiplex PCR scheme was developed for simultaneous identification of Listeria spp., L. monocytogenes, serotype 4b and 1/2a, and ECI, ECII and ECIII.  Molecular markers specific for epidemic clones I (17B), II (LMOh7858_0487-0498) and III (LMOf6854_2467-2472); for serotypes 4b (ORF2110) and 1/2a (lmo0737); and for L. monocytogenes (lmo2234) and Listeria spp. (iap) were targeted in this Multiplex PCR scheme.

However, the molecular mechanism governing the centrosome-nucleus association is incompletely understood, and the question whether additional components are involved in this process has not been answered yet. \n\nTo address this question, I performed two genetic screens to identify additional genes that may play roles in the centrosome-nucleus association. I found additional zyg-12-like genes in the suppressor screen on a centrosome-duplication gene zyg-1. I also identified suppressors that may genetically interact with zyg-12 through another suppressor screen on gene zyg-12. The preliminary characterizations of zyg-1 suppressors suggest that gene zyg-1 may have an unrevealed function in promoting the centrosome-nucleus association. My zyg-12 suppressor screen also provided strong evidence for the existence of the additional components involving in this process.\n\nIn addition, to better understand the function of zyg-12 in the association, I investigated the mechanism of the centrosomal localization of ZYG-12. Using the microtubule binding assay, I tested the hypothesis that ZYG-12 interacts with microtubules to localize to the centrosome. However, ZYG-12 did not bind to microtubules in the assay, which suggested that it may localize to the centrosome through some other mechanism.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6905], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["zyg-12", "zyg-1", "centrosome attachment", "suppressor screen"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "ROBUSTNESS PROPERTIES OF GENERALIZED CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS, WITH APPLICATIONS TO CROSS-OVER DESIGNS", "id": "7334", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6745", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To date, correlation coefficients have been the most utilized statistical measures in many fields for investigating the presence of a relationship between two variables or among several variables.

On the other hand, we also broaden the work of Chinchilli et al. (2005), allowing for the generalized correlation coefficient being applicable to more complex cross-over designs which are uniform within sequences. We develop the corresponding asymptotic theory and influence function in this direction.

The sweeping popularity of these information and communication environments also affects children and adolescents (later referred as \u201cchildren\u201d). There is a dearth of systematic scholarly work examining those threats for children\u2019s protection. In addressing this void, the goal of our research is to explore and understand the risks and threats of such information and communication environments on children. In particular, our primary research interests lie in the three main threats to children\u2019s online safety (Palfrey et al., 2008): online harassment and cyberbullying, exposure to problematic contents, sexual solicitation and Internet-initiated offline encounters. \nOnline harassment and cyberbullying mostly occur in social media, and always involve offensive language. Since the textual contents on online social media are highly unstructured, informal, and often misspelled, existing research on message-level offensive language detection cannot accurately detect offensive content. Meanwhile, user-level offensiveness detection is an under researched area. We propose the Lexical Syntactic Feature (LSF) architecture to detect offensive contents and identify cyber bullies. Results from experiments showed that the LSF framework achieves accuracy of 96.6%, 77.8% in sentence and user offensiveness detection respectively. Besides, the processing speed of LSF is 10 ms per sentence, suggesting its potential for effective deployment in social media.\nProblematic contents and solicitation mostly appear on mobile platforms. Since people are heavily relying on the search results and rankings on app stores to explore new apps, on the market side, we must help parents easily choose appropriate apps for their kids with minimal online threats. Since we concern about problematic contents and cyber solicitation, and posting personal information and interacting with online strangers are the two major types of behaviors expose children to cyber solicitation (Ybarra et al., 2007), we monitor two types of risks on mobile devices: content risks and privacy risks. \nFor content risks, we develop automatic mechanisms to detect problematic contents and verify the content ratings of mobile apps and in-app ads. The results show that 27.8% of Android apps have unreliable content ratings. In addition, a large percent of the in-app advertisements carry inappropriate contents for children, and 35.9% of Android in-app ads and 38.9% of iOS in-app ads are found exceeding the host apps\u2019 content ratings. For privacy risks, we adopt the contextual integrity theory (Nissenbaum, 2009) to develop quantitative measures of privacy risks on mobile apps. We also propose an automatic system with user interface to assist parents being aware of apps\u2019 privacy risks, therefore, to make informed decisions when choosing apps for their children. We believe that the findings have important implications for the legal and educational departments, social medias, platform providers (e.g., Google or Apple), as well as for regulatory bodies and application developers. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9877], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu", "Heng Xu", "Wang Chien Lee", "Alan Maceachren"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sencun Zhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Heng Xu, Dissertation Advisor", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member", "Alan Maceachren, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Children", "Mobile Apps", "Mobile Ads", "Android", "iOS", "Social Media", "Cyberbullying", "Problematic Content", "Solicitation", "Text Mining", "Privacy"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "PARTICIPATION IN JOB TRAINING OVER WORKING LIFE AND EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES AMONG MID-CAREER WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n", "id": "6680", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6824", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between job training participation and wage effects among women at mid-career in the United States. This study used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women (NLSW) to explore whether mid-career women\u00a1\u00a6s participation in job training is related to their demographic characteristics, education, and work experiences. The employment outcomes in terms of hourly wage rates associated with job training participation among women at late career were also investigated. \nFirst, significant relationships were found between participation in job training and race, education, occupation, and typical length of work duration each year among women at mid-career. Whites were more likely than non-Whites to participate in both on-the-job (OJT) training and other training courses or educational programs (Other training). Women with education beyond high school were more likely to receive OJT and other training than those who were high school graduates or less. Women who were employed in professional, managerial, or technical occupations were more likely to receive both OJT and other training than those who worked in other occupations. In addition, women who typically worked for longer durations each year had greater odds of receiving job training than those who worked a shorter duration each year.\nSecond, a significantly positive relationship was found between mid-career women\u00a1\u00a6s participation in OJT over their working life and their hourly wage rates. However, participation in other training showed no significant relationship with wage rates. Findings from this study also revealed that women who were White, had a higher education degree, worked in the manufacturing industry, worked in a professional, managerial, or technical occupation, and typically worked a longer duration each year, tended to receive a higher hourly rate of pay.\nBased on these findings, several recommendations may be offered.\n1. There is a need to close the gap in post-school training acquisition for women who tend to receive less training. \n2. These findings support the need to continually promote continuing education programs and training services for mid-career women.\n3.

The Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) and Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) are the two most common water-cooled nuclear reactors.  Corrosion is the principal threat to the failure of the fuel in these reactors, resulting in the release of fission products to the coolant and hence to the establishment of radiation fields in out-of-core regions of the coolant circuit (e.g., steam generators in PWRs and turbines in BWRs).  As is well known, corrosion is an electrochemical phenomenon; however, electrochemical effects are often neglected in corrosion studies on zirconium and its alloys, because of the difficulty in performing well-defined experiments under the appropriate conditions (high temperatures and pressures).  \n\nIn-situ studies have been carried out to examine the electrochemistry of passive zirconium under simulated BWR and PWR coolant conditions by using a controlled hydrodynamic, high temperature/high pressure test cell.  The oxidation/hydriding mechanisms are elucidated by measuring the current, impedance, and capacitance of passive zirconium as a function of formation potential.  The data are interpreted in terms of a modified point defect model (PDM) that recognize the existence of a passive film comprising a thick oxide outer layer over a thin barrier layer.  From the composition of the zirconium passive film and thermodynamic analysis, it is postulated that a hydride barrier layer forms under PWR coolant conditions whereas an oxide barrier layer forms under BWR primary coolant conditions.  \n\nTransients in current density and the thickness of the passive film formed on zirconium, when stepping the potential in either the positive or negative directions, have confirmed that the rate law afforded by the PDM adequately describes the growth and thinning of the passive film at high temperatures.  The experimental results demonstrate that the kinetics of either oxygen or hydrogen vacancy generation at the metal/film interface control the rate of film growth when the potential is displaced in the positive direction, whereas the kinetics of dissolution of the barrier layer at the barrier layer/solution interface control the rate of passive film thinning when the potential is stepped in the negative direction.  Both the growth rate and dissolution rate of the passive films formed in the hydrogenated solution are lower than that formed in the dehydrogenated solution. \n\nIn addition, the effects of second phase particles (SPPs) on the electrochemistry of passive zirconium in the hydrogenated, high temperature aqueous solutions are examined by using different heat-treated Zircaloy-4 samples; i.e., as-received, belta-quenched, and alfa-annealed.  Optical microscopy with polarized light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the microstructure and determine the size and density of the SPPs.  The average size of the second phase particles in the Zircaloy-4 samples was in the sequence of belta-quenched < alfa-annealed < as-received, with the reverse sequence being observed in the areal density.  The size of the SPPs is found to be comparable to the passive film thickness.  Electrochemical studies show that the size and density of the second phase particles are the determining factors of the electrochemical properties of the passive films.  Thus, the belta-quenched sample has the highest corrosion resistance, while the alfa-annealed sample has the lowest.  It is also evident that the second phase particles play an important role in determining the electronic character of a passive film, as demonstrated by Mott-Schottky analysis. The second phase particles may cause short circuits in the electrical path across the passive film, which would explain the effect of the size and the density of the SPPs, and hence heat treatment, on the corrosion properties of passive Zircaloy-4.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6901], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Yingzi ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yingzi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald", "Long Qing Chen", "Earle Richard Ryba", "W Murray Small"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald, Committee Chair", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Earle Richard Ryba, Committee Member", "W Murray Small, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["oxidation/hydriding mechanism", "Zircaloy-4", "zirconium", "passive film", "point defect model"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Data Visualization In Models \nfor  Healthcare Workflow Improvement\n", "id": "18776", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8644", "abstract_tesi": "Workflow optimization in the healthcare system has been analyzed and discussed by many researchers in recent years. The increasing difficulties in dealing with complex data and the increasing expectations from physicians and patients for more reliable information have necessitated improvements in the health care decision making process. Data visualization (DV) is useful approach for dealing with multifaceted data and presenting information in a user friendly way. Much research has been done to develop useful DV tools that have made information more accessible to patients as well as physicians. However, very little research has been done to implement the DV techniques effectively into the different stages of a healthcare delivery workflow. \nIn this thesis, we study the question domains that patients and physicians must address in the treatment encounter, followed by a possible solution set for each domain with the DV techniques that may be involved. The workflow is investigated and developed from the input stage to the treatment cycle stage, focusing on steps in the decision making process and their sequences in the workflow. The DV techniques are then analyzed in detail based on their characteristics, functions and advantages. For each stage, the DV display is shown with a focus on how it may help patients and the physicians better communicate. \nAn optimization model is formulated based on the workflow to identify the DV technique for each stage so that the overall objectives of quality, efficiency, and cost are addressed. Goal programming is used to combine different criteria into one single overall criterion. In order to evaluate the workflow with DV interventions, a workflow model is built in Simio to simulate the current and proposed workflow. Analysis of the simulation results provides insight on comparisons of the performance of the workflow with DV intervention and without DV intervention. A case study is presented for tuberculosis (TB) to show how DV techniques can help TB patients and the physicians better communicate, understand and use the information to make informed decisions.

It consists of multiple parallel queues, each of which serves single type of requests and is called an application. For each queue, there are possibly multiple servers, with some scheduling discipline and waiting area having infinite capacity. Each request brings a random amount of work and will be assigned by application scheduler to a server and processed at a particular speed. Web hosting center is an example of such a system. Therein operates thousands of servers consuming huge amount of energy and serves hundreds of applications that require the system to deliver Quality of Service (QoS). The complexity of managing such huge systems in cost effective manners is not a trivial endeavor, especially under stringent QoS requirements from self-similar like traffic.\n\nThis thesis proposes a three-tiered solution methodology at system, application, and server level as a tunable resource allocation strategy for power and performance management (for such\naforementioned systems). At system level, a centralized G/G/m-based solving algorithm, applicable at different time-granularities, is developed to provision servers at required\noperating frequencies. A packing/scheduling mechanism is built for dispatching incoming workload into a given set of servers to balance\nenergy-savings and performance needs in the second tier. Further, in the third tier, a decentralized frequency control strategy for an individual server is devised by adopting fluid modeling and Markov Decision Process(MDP).\n\n\nIn terms of contributions, this thesis provides an energy aware resource management framework for web hosting centers. The proposed three-tired solution methodology can achieve significantly high\namount of energy-savings and maintain the system performances as well, compared to those done by prior studies. Secondly, it is one of the first few studies, which provides a rigorous optimization formulation under self-similar-like workloads with respect to availability of controllable resources. Solutions derived from those optimization can be easily computed and implemented in an online fashion for computer systems.

Once breast cancer cells enter the bone microenvironment, they alter the homeostasis of the bone remodeling system in favor of osteoclasts, which results in osteolysis. Clinically, bisphophonates are used to induce osteoclast apoptosis to prevent further damage but the existing lesions do not heal completely, which suggests that the function of osteoblasts, the bone building cells, is impaired by breast cancer cells. In our laboratory, we discovered that metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) inhibit osteoblast (MC3T3-E1) differentiation and induce apoptosis. Furthermore, breast cancer cells induce an inflammatory response by the osteoblasts, resulting in the production of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and COX-2, which are known to promote osteoclastogenesis. Therefore, down-regulation of the inflammatory response of the osteoblasts brought about by breast cancer cells may reduce the activation of osteoclasts and decrease osteolysis. \n\nIn this study, I took advantage of the fact that the induction of IL-6, MCP-1, COX-2 and iNOs are regulated by a common transcription factor, NF-kappaB. I hypothesized that inhibition of NF-kappaB would prevent the response to the BCCM. NF-kappaB, a crucial transcription factor, is sensitive to intracellular redox status; its activation can be inhibited by cellular antioxidant enzymes. Interestingly, two major antioxidant enzymes, glutathione peroxidase (GPxs) and thioredoxin reductase (TR), are selenoenzymes. Their dependence on selenium (Se) may offer a way to increase their expression and activity, block NF-kappaB activation and thus inhibit the expression of its target genes.\nI discovered that supplementation of osteoblasts with the organic Se compound, methylseleninic acid (MSA), down-regulated the inflammatory response by suppressing the activation of NF-kappaB while the supplementation of inorganic Se compound, sodium selenite, failed to reduce the inflammatory response.  MSA significantly increased the activity and expression of selenoproteins in the osteoblasts. However, the suppressive effect of MSA was observed at a concentration higher than the maximum concentration for selenoprotein synthesis, which may suggest the involvement of selenium metabolites. I also found that in order to inhibit inflammatory responses, osteoblasts needed to be supplemented with MSA at the same time when they were stimulated with BCCM. This finding indicated the rapid generation and instability of the molecule responsible for the inhibition of the osteoblast inflammatory response. \n\nTo test the effect of dietary selenium in breast cancer progression, three selenium supplementation diets (sodium selenite, SeM, and MSA) as well as selenium-deficient and selenium-adequate diets were fed to immunocompetent Balb/C mice before inoculation of a metastatic breast cancer cell line, 4T1.2. There was no significant difference in the development or growth of the primary breast tumor and the metastatic patterns between mice receiving the selenium-deficient or selenium-adequate diets. On the other hand, selenium supplementation diets were shown to affect breast cancer growth and progression differently. Mice with sodium selenite supplementation developed the most metastasis (15/15) and showed higher incidence of breast cancer kidney and bone metastasis. The SeM supplementation diet (3ppm) reduced breast cancer primary tumor growth and decreased overall tumor burden in major organs, such as lung, liver, kidney and femur. Taken together, this study showed that SeM supplementation diet provided the most protective effect on breast cancer progression.  \n\nIn summary, MSA, but not sodium selenite, was processed rapidly in osteoblasts to generate bioactive molecules which suppressed the activation of NF-\u0192\u00dbB and the down-stream inflammatory stress response stimulated by metastatic breast cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, mice with Se-deficient and selenium-adequate diets did not show significant differences in primary tumor growth and metastasis. Among the three dietary selenium supplementation groups, mice with sodium selenite supplementation developed the most severe metastasis and resulted in the most metastatic tumor burden in major organs. On the other hand, mice with SeM supplementation showed significantly smaller primary tumors and the least metastatic tumor burden. Taken together, organic Se supplementation showed more protective effect on breast cancer metastasis progression in both in vitro and in vivo systems. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6906], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Yu-Chi ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yu-Chi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrea Marie Mastro", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Lorraine C Santy", "Yanming Wang", "Robert Paulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrea Marie Mastro, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Chair", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Lorraine C Santy, Committee Member", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NF-kappa B", "selenium", "inflammatoru response", "osteoblast", "brreast cancer bone metastasis", "MDA-MB-231", "4T1.2"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Improving Digital Library Ranking with Expert Information", "id": "26380", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11622", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this research is to investigate whether expert information can improve the ranking function of academic search engines.

Due to the advantages of high biocompatibility, non-contact manipulation, compact size, and low power consumption, the acoustofluidic technologies are invaluable in many biochemical/biomedical applications.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11620], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Yuchao ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuchao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Huang", "Jun Huang", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Bruce Gluckman", "Siyang Zheng", "Corina Stefania Drapaca"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jun Huang, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Bruce Gluckman, Committee Member", "Siyang Zheng, Committee Member", "Corina Stefania Drapaca, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Acoustic wave", "Microfluidics", "Biomedical applications", "Cell separation"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "CONVERSION OF REACTIVE GLIA INTO FUNCTIONAL NEURONS AS A NOVEL THERAPY FOR STROKE", "id": "15025yzc137", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15025", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Stroke is a severe neurological disorder and a leading cause of disability and death, which affects millions of people worldwide. Recovery of stroke-injured brain is very limited, largely due to incapability of adult brain to regenerate enough new neuronal cells. We have recently developed an innovative in situ cell conversion technology to directly convert endogenous glial cells into functional neurons, but whether it could help functional recovery is not well studied. In this dissertation, we demonstrate that NeuroD1-mediated glia-to-neuron conversion can functionally rescue the motor deficits induced by the cerebral stroke in mice. Specifically, using a combination of hGFAP::Cre and FLEX-NeuroD1 AAV system, we were able to regenerate ~40% of cortical neurons (400 NeuN+ new neurons/mm2), compared to previously reported an average of <1% of cortical neurons (2-8 NeuN+ neurons/mm2) in an ischemic-injured adult mammalian cortex. Importantly, following injection of viral vectors carrying NeuroD1 into the stroke areas, not only were reactive glial cells converted into functional new neurons, but also the injured pre-existing neurons were better protected, leading to a repair of cortical tissue and neural circuits. In the NeuroD1-treated stroke areas, both neuroinhibitory and inflammatory factors significantly reduced, while blood vessels significantly increased, accompanied with a restoration of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). These beneficial effects at cellular and circuits level led to a rescue of motor behavior deficits. Our studies suggest that in situ cell conversion from reactive glial cells into functional neurons may have the potential to treat stroke and related neurological disorders.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16908], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Yuchen ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "first_name_ssi": "Yuchen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gong Chen", "Yingwei Mao", "Timothy J Jegla", "Bernhard Luscher", "Ian Alexander Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gong Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Yingwei Mao, Committee Chair", "Timothy J Jegla, Committee Member", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NeuroD1", "ischemic injury", "brain repair", "astrocyte-to-neuron conversion", "motor function"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Multi-criteria Approaches to Supplier Selection and Order Allocation with Quqntity Discounts", "id": "27543", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12152", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, a multi-criteria multi-period supplier selection and order allocation problem is studied.

Rice blast disease, caused by fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, is an important plant disease and the model pathosystem for studying the monocot plant-fungus interactions. However, little is known regarding how M. oryzae effectors interact with rice proteins for host defense suppression and fungal infection. This study aims to shed light on molecular and biochemical mechanisms of the rice-M. oryzae interaction by functionally characterizing some M. oryzae effectors and their host target proteins.\nIn this study, Yeast two-Hybrid (Y2H) screenings were performed using four fungal effectors as baits to identify their interacting rice proteins. These pathogen effector-host protein interactions were further confirmed using in vitro GST pull-down assay and in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. An M. oryzae effector-rice protein interaction map was then established by integrating the data from this study and previously published information. These putative host targets include several interesting rice proteins such as chromatin remodeler OsHIRA, ubiquitin-like protein OsNPI, and transcription factor OsVOZ1. Functional prediction and categorization of host target proteins reveal that M. oryzae effectors appear to favorably target host Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) and nuclear processes. \nTwo M. oryzae Zinc Finger Effectors (MoZFEs) were individually expressed in transgenic rice lines (MoZFEs-OX) to investigate their function in plant cells.  Interestingly, MoZFEs-OX lines exhibited growth and developmental defects and increased susceptibility to M. oryzae infection. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis with RNA-seq reveals a amount of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in MoZFE1-OX lines vs. wildtype plants. Many of these DEGs are enriched in primary metabolism and defense pathways that correlated with developmental and susceptible phenotypes shown in transgenic rice lines. \nTo elucidate the mode of action of MoZFEs in rice cells, BiFC was used to demonstrate that MoZFEs interact directly with OsHIRA in the nucleus and cytoplasm. HIRA forms gene silencing complex with AS1 and AS2 transcription factors which bind to the promoters of Class I Knotted1-like homeobox (KNOX) genes and regulate plant growth and development in an epigenetic fashion. Bioinformatics analysis of rice gene promoters reveals proximal nucleotide binding motifs that are potentially bound by MoZFE1 and OsHIRA/AS1/AS2. As shown by gene expression analysis with quantitative RT-PCR, the silencing status of KNOX genes maintained by the OsHIRA complex in wild-type leaves was disrupted in MoZFE-OX lines. These bioinformatics predictions and experimental evidence suggest that MoZFEs likely interact with HIRA to interfere with AS1/AS2 binding, and negatively modulate rice growth and defense responses.\nTo further characterize the biological function of the HIRA/AS1/AS2 complex in rice development as well as innate immunity, oshira, osas1, and osas2 mutants were generated by targeted mutagenesis using the CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing. Strikingly, these mutants all exhibited developmental defects during the vegetative and reproductive stages, with some of these phenotypes resembling that of MoZFEs-OX lines. Moreover, oshira mutant also shows enhanced disease resistance to M. oryzae infection, suggesting its role in negative regulation of rice immunity. In summary, thesis studies reveal some novel interactions between M. oryzae effectors and rice protein targets, demonstrates the functions of MoZFEs and OsHIRA/AS1/AS2 silencing complex in rice development and immunity, and improves our understanding of the molecular and biochemical, molecular mechanisms involved in the rice-M. oryzae interaction. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13145], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Yueying ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yueying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yinong Yang", "Yinong Yang", "Timothy W Mcnellis", "Seogchan Kang", "Surinder Chopra", "Yanming Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yinong Yang, Dissertation Advisor", "Yinong Yang, Committee Chair", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member", "Seogchan Kang, Committee Member", "Surinder Chopra, Outside Member", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rice Blast disease", "Effectors", "plant immunity", "rice", "plant development", "Disease regulator"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on Demand Analysis with Food Spoilage", "id": "14981yzc141", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14981", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In Essay One, \"Demand for Perishable Foods: A Cost of Consumption Framework with Policy Implications\", we challenge the convention of treating consumption and purchased quantities as identical even for food products that undergo substantial deterioration while in storage. We first prove a theorem that shows how decay processes can be incorporated into any existing demand system in a theoretically consistent way. Our method involves augmenting the prices in an existing neoclassical demand model with a function of shopping frequency and decay parameters. The augmented prices have the intuitively appealing interpretation of being 'consumption prices' which reflect the cost of consuming a unit of food. We apply this method to the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System to estimate household-level demand for foods that vary by their degree of perishability. Included composite goods include 'fresh fruit', 'fresh vegetables', 'non-fresh vegetables', 'meat', and miscellaneous food 'other'. We are able to directly estimate the quality-adjusted decay rates that rationalize observed household demands. We ask, does our framework perform better at estimating perishable food demand than 'naive' models that ignore perishability? Because our framework nests the 'naive' model, we are able to conclude that our framework performs better. We argue that our framework is well-suited for studies that inform public health policies which attempt to improve diets through improving access.\t\n\nEssay Two, \"Measuring Consumer-Level Quality-Adjusted Food Loss: A Demand System Approach\", extends the model developed in essay one by accounting for 1. the endogeneity of six variables including five shopping frequencies and total expenditure, and 2. household heterogeneity. Household heterogeneity is introduced using demographic translating to account for theoretical consistency. Necessary parameter constraints for economic regularity, namely, adding-up, zero-degree demand homogeneity in prices and income, and Slutsky symmetry, are imposed on the system of translated demand equations. Because of the highly non-linear form of the demand system, control functions (cf. instrumental variables) are used. We use our model results to infer the quality-adjusted food waste that rationalizes observed household market behavior to be around 55%.\n\nEssay three, \"Store-Format Choice: A Competing Risk Approach\", introduces a novel model of food retail store choice. The time since the last shopping trip is central to our competing risk framework. When a household shops, their clock starts, ticking down the time until they shop again. At each tick, they choose to shop at 'competing' store formats or may choose not to shop at all. The hazard functions of these choices, which fully characterize shopping probability distributions, are jointly estimated. This approach has many advantages over the multinomial logit models which dominate the store-format choice literature. First, we use the information of when the household does not shop. Second, by construction, shopping timing is accounted for in a way that avoids any possibility of endogeneity. Third, our non-parametrically estimated household-specific baseline hazard functions can take virtually any functional form. Indeed, we find that household hazard functions are bimodal, with households feeling increasing pressure to shop at all store formats until a peak around 7-10 days, feeling decreasing pressure until a nadir around 15-20 days, and increasing pressure thereafter. The peak at 7-10 days suggests that weekly schedules and perishable food shelf-lives strongly impel households to shop. The richness of our framework allows us to draw many other conclusions.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16429], "author_name_tesi": "Chen, Yunsi ", "last_name_ssi": "Chen", "first_name_ssi": "Yunsi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott J Colby", "Scott J Colby", "Edward C Jaenicke", "Yizao Liu", "M.

One of the ways that companies are dealing\nwith this challenge is to offer products that can be assembled from a\ncollection of independent components. One of the central difficulties facing the\nmakers of such `configured-to-order' products is the following: The precise\nquantity and collection of resources required to satisfy an order is not known\nuntil a customer has actually placed an order. The supply chain tools currently\navailable to practitioners are not prepared to deal with such uncertainty and\nexisting academic models do not adequately address the problem in a practical\nmanner. This thesis responds to this challenge by addressing a series of\noptimization problems and framing them within the context of a popular business\nprocess called sales and operations planning.\n\n\nWithin this context, three related optimization models are formulated and solved\nusing stochastic programming techniques. These models are referred to as the\nexplosion, implosion and component rationing problems, respectively.  The\nexplosion and implosion problems both seek to maximize profit, but where the\nexplosion model determines component requirements given product demand, the\nimplosion model determines the appropriate product sales targets given certain\nrestrictions on component supply. The component rationing problem seeks to\nmaximize revenue for a given component supply and product demand by\nappropriately setting the component threshold levels that will reserve certain\ncomponents for certain product orders. In all three problems, uncertainty is\npresent because the quantity of components required to satisfy an order is\nunknown at the time that the decisions are made.\n\n\nComputational studies performed using problem sets derived from data provided by\nIBM show that, with respect to the explosion and implosion problems, there is\nsignificant benefit to accounting for the uncertainty associated with how\nproducts are configured. For the explosion problem, accounting for this\nuncertainty results in improved profit, revenue and serviceability.

It was approved that by controlling the size of the transducer, power and frequency of the ultrasound wave the transducer emits, acoustic wave can be precisely targeted on each individual single cell, therefore to facilitate the cell intake of small particles without noticeable impact on other neighbor cells.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [395], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, An ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "An", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jian Xu", "Jian Xu", "Michael T Lanagan", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jian Xu, Dissertation Advisor", "Jian Xu, Committee Chair", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transducer", "single cell", "bio-chip", "quantum dots"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Picky Consumer", "id": "13932auc245", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13932", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We live in an age of a \u201cpicky pandemic.\u201d Consumers are now more demanding of products, services, and brands than ever before. Reports indicate that while global consumers have more disposable income and are generally more willing to spend money than ever before, many consumers feel as if there are not enough choices that fit their exact preferences (Hendriksz 2016). The state of consumer pickiness is becoming a relevant topic to marketers and consumer researchers; hundreds of consumer-generated online discussions are documenting feelings of pickiness and the challenges for agents making decisions for picky people (e.g., Freeman 2014). Yet despite the construct\u2019s relevance and ubiquity, no research in the marketing literature has rigorously defined what it means for a consumer to be \u201cpicky\u201d or explored the implications of consumer pickiness for decision making. While pickiness is related to high preference and choice selectivity, existing constructs such as a maximizer or perfectionist don\u2019t fully encompass what people mean when they identify a picky consumer.

This research is the acoustic part of a joint helicopter rotor icing physics, modeling, and detection project at The Pennsylvania State University Vertical Lift Research Center of Excellence (VLRCOE). The current research aims to provide acoustic insight and understanding of the rotor icing physics and investigate the feasibility of detecting rotor icing through noise measurements, especially at the early stage of ice accretion. All helicopter main rotor noise source mechanisms and their change during ice accretion are discussed. Changes of the thickness noise, steady loading noise, and especially the turbulent boundary layer \u2013 trailing edge (TBL-TE) noise due to ice accretion are identified and studied.\nThe change of the discrete frequency noise (thickness noise and steady loading noise) due to ice accretion is calculated by using PSU-WOPWOP, an advanced rotorcraft acoustic prediction code. The change is noticeable, but too small to be used in icing detection. The small thickness noise change is due to the small volume of the accreted ice compared to that of the entire blade, although a large iced airfoil shape is used. For the loading noise calculation, two simplified methods are used to generate the loading on the rotor blades, which is the input for the loading noise calculation: 1) compact loading from blade element momentum theory, icing effects are considered by increasing the drag coefficient; and 2) pressure loading from the 2-D CFD simulation, icing effects are considered by using the iced airfoil shape.\nComprehensive rotor broadband noise measurements are carried out on rotor blades with different roughness sizes and rotation speeds in two facilities: the Adverse Environment Rotor Test Stand (AERTS) facility at The Pennsylvania State University, and The University of Maryland Acoustic Chamber (UMAC). In both facilities the measured high-frequency broadband noise increases significantly with increasing surface roughness heights, which indicates that it is feasible to quantify helicopter rotor ice-induced surface roughness through acoustic measurements. Comprehensive broadband noise measurements based on different accreted ice roughness at AERTS are then used to form the data base from which a correlation between the ice-induced surface roughness and the broadband noise level is developed. Two parameters, the arithmetic average roughness height, R_a, and the averaged roughness height, based on the integrated ice thickness at the blade tip, are introduced to describe the ice-induced surface roughness at the early stage of the ice accretion. The ice roughness measurements are correlated to the measured broadband noise level. Strong correlations (absolute mean deviations of 9.3% and 11.2% for correlation using R_a and the averaged roughness height respectively) between the ice roughness and the broadband noise level are obtained, which can be used as a tool to determine the accreted ice roughness in the AERTS facility through acoustic measurement.  It might be possible to use a similar approach to develop an early ice accretion detection tool for helicopters, as well as to quantify the ice-induced roughness at the early stage of rotor ice accretion.   \nRotor broadband noise source identification is conducted and the broadband noise related to ice accretion is argued to be turbulent boundary layer \u2013 trailing edge (TBL-TE) noise. Theory suggests TBL-TE noise scales with Mach number to the fifth power, which is also observed in the experimental data. The trailing edge noise theories developed by Ffowcs Williams and Hall, and Howe both identify two important parameters: boundary layer thickness and turbulence intensity. Numerical studies of 2-D airfoils with different ice-induced surface roughness heights are conducted to investigate the extent that surface roughness impacts the boundary layer thickness and turbulence intensity (and ultimately the TBL-TE noise). The results show that boundary layer thickness and turbulence intensity at the trailing edge increase with the increased roughness height. Using Howe\u2019s trailing edge noise model, the increased sound pressure level (SPL) of the trailing edge noise due to the increased displacement thickness and normalized integrated turbulence intensity are 6.2 dB and 1.6 dB for large and small accreted ice roughness heights, respectively. The estimated increased SPL values agree well with the experimental results, which are 5.8 dB and 2.6 dB for large and small roughness height, respectively.\nFinally a detailed broadband noise spectral scaling for all measured broadband noise in both AERTS and UMAC facilities is conducted. The magnitude and the frequency spectrum of the measured broadband noise are scaled on characteristic velocity and length. The peak of the laminar boundary layer \u2013 vortex shedding (LBL-VS) noise coalesces well on the Strouhal scaling in those cases. For the measured broadband noise from a rotor with relatively large roughness heights, no contribution of the LBL-VS noise is observed. The velocity scaling shows that the TBL-TE noise, which is the dominant source mechanism, scales with Mach number to the fifth power based on the absolute frequency. The length scaling shows that the TBL-TE noise scales well on the absolute roughness height based on Howe\u2019s TE noise theory.    \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13303], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Baofeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Baofeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth S.

Though the volunteers are unpaid, the cost of training and operating the program is still a considerable investment for national parks. To avoid the huge expenses, it is important for the national parks to know how to improve volunteer involvement and retain active volunteers. Therefore, semi-structured interviews were conducted at Kenting National Park in Taiwan to investigate the potential factors associated with variables related to volunteer involvement. The transcripts of interviews were coded and analyzed with the NVivo software program. The results of interviews are discussed and two new methodological instruments are introduced in this study.   \n\nThe results show that the initial motivations to be volunteers usually differ from the current motivations to continue volunteering. Though volunteering can be serious leisure, some constraints to volunteering are unique compared to leisure constraints because of the specific circumstances of providing services. Moreover, some negotiation strategies to overcome volunteering constraints also differ from those for leisure activities. The strategies themselves can be alternative forms of involvement rather than treated as different variables. The volunteers tend to perceive environmental changes through the awareness of unusual phenomena that are typically connected to indigenous knowledge and long-term experience in the local area. The services of volunteering can be categorized into direct and indirect contributions and both of them should be counted to avoid underestimating volunteer involvement.   \n\nTo provide an improved approach in designing quantitative scales for measuring volunteer involvement, the concepts of Likert-type scales, ipsative approaches, and level of measurement are reviewed and a new algorithm, the S-score, is proposed. Rather than absolute scores, the S-score carries the relative strength, which is better to deliver accurate messages and reduce response biases of each item responded to by individuals. Hypothetical data are used to show how S-scores could better explain the results of raw scores in measurement scales. Even if the scales in different studies are not the same, the S-score approach can transform the raw scores into standardized unitless scores to make the results comparable across destinations, cultures, or eras. The features of S-scores and suggestions for questionnaire design for future research are also discussed.   \n\nSince the results of interviews revealed that volunteer motivations change over time, the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix in management science were adapted to develop the Volunteer Motivation-Change Evaluation matrix to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the volunteer program through analyzing the dynamic motivation shifts. The results show that the strengths of the volunteer program of Kenting National Park involve keeping volunteers through social interaction and environmental education motivations. The program attracted volunteers with motivations of gaining knowledge, which declined in importance over time, while motivations related to escape increased. Volunteers with self-esteem motivations might be lost as results indicated the weaknesses of gaining self-esteem in the program.

The emergence of radio frequency identification (RFID), web services, and mobile applications technology has led to innovations in business processes, but their impact on usability and process structural change is uncertain. New technology implementation may, for example, improve usability and information exchange, while increasing process complexity, or reduce complexity at the expense of usability or information exchange. This research identifies three independent metrics, structural complexity, technology usability and interaction complexity, to characterize the business process complexity. The study has two objectives: (1) to design business process metrics that may be used in evaluating process structure, the ease of technology use in business processes and the complexity of resource interactions; and (2) to find tradeoffs among three metrics with regard to improving business processes. \n\nEvaluation of complex structural processes involves determining whether they generally have a clear structure and are easy to analyze, understand, and explain. Structural complexity is studied with respect to different business process structures. The hypothesis for this research is that more distinct process structures will lead to complex processes. A developed structural complexity metric enables analysis of basic process structures and measures them using an information theoretical metric. Information theory characterizes the randomness, disorder or uncertainty of the occurrence of process structures. Furthermore, compared with other process measurement metrics, the structural complexity metric shows more robust result in sample processes from literatures. This structural complexity model is particularly useful for evaluating business processes\u2019 static features.\n\nA usability complexity metric that combines human-computer interaction and cognitive science is utilized to evaluate the cognitive loading of a business process. The resulting model, Business Process Analysis in Goal, Operations Methodology, and Selections (BPA-GOMS), is composed of two attributes\u2014the internal complexity of an activity and the interaction complexity. The internal complexity models user-level behaviors and how to perform the business process using cognitive theory. Interaction complexity is identified through a business process analysis that examines interactions with other resources, including employees, customers and computer programs. Usability and interaction complexity provide insights into node level and information exchange in business process analysis.\n\nA process with different routing probabilities could result in different complexity measurements due to variability in the occurrence of the business process flow. The operational behavior of the business process is studied here to determine the stable probability of process tasks. This stable probability reflects the long-term likelihood that a random flow will visit the routing. If the routing has a complex structure and difficult usability, the process receives a higher operational complexity score. Operational complexity measurements can be determined using the transition matrix to represent the probable occurrence of each process activity. The rank of activities also shows the importance components and provides an insight for Business Process Reengineering (BPR). \n\nFindings from this study offer several major contributions: (1)Information theoretic metrics measuring the business process structural, interaction, and usability complexity.(2) Develop a BPA-GOMS model,  extended GOMS in business process analysis (3)Find the long-term probability of activities in analyzing business processes (4) Diversity of Case Studies, including Industrial procurement, university/industry collaboration, RFID in healthcare, Data collection in education systems four case studies of complexity evaluation in system implementation, patient identification, the cutting tool supply chain problem, and educational systems that illustrate the results of the proposed metrics.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1149], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Chen-Yang ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chen-Yang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu", "Richard Allen Wysk", "Ling Rothrock", "Meg Leavy Small"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu, Committee Chair", "Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Member", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Meg Leavy Small, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["complexity analysis", "business process analysis", "usability study"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DYNAMIC RELATION BETWEEN A CEO'S MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE MEASURE COMPENSATION CONTRACT AND THE HORIZON PROBLEM", "id": "11280", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1903", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two streams of agency theory research have focused on different aspects of the contracting relationship between shareholders and CEOs.  The first stream of agency theory research examines the role of multiple performance measures in a CEO\u2019s compensation contract in maximizing firm value in a single-period setting.  The second stream of agency theory research focuses on the horizon problem and examines how a CEO\u2019s career concerns, his desire to remain employed or cease employment in the near future, affect his utility and his compensation contract.  Both streams of research provide useful evidence on the shareholder-CEO contracting relationship but are incomplete because they do not simultaneously consider multiple performance measure, multi-period compensation contracting. \nThe second chapter of this dissertation examines multiple performance measures in the presence of the horizon problem to determine whether a CEO\u2019s compensation structure, the ratio of earnings-based compensation to total compensation, is affected by the CEO\u2019s career concerns.  In examining whether the CEO\u2019s compensation contract is affected by his career concerns, I recognize that a CEO who is nearing retirement can leave the firm for a variety of reasons.  As such, I use a competing risks regression, a hazard model that allows for the comparison between observation groups by how the CEO left the firm, to incorporate the reason a CEO left into the analysis of the relation between a CEO\u2019s compensation structure and his tenure.  The three groups of interest in the competing-risks regression are whether the CEO retired, resigned following poor performance, or left following a merger or acquisition.  I find no evidence that a CEO\u2019s tenure for each of these groups is associated with his compensation structure.  I also do not find evidence of significant differences between the compensation structures of CEOs who retired, resigned following poor performance, or left following a merger or acquisition.  The lack of associations and differences between compensation structures does not offer insight into whether compensation committees adjust compensation contracts to offset a CEO\u2019s career concerns as he gets ready to leave the firm but do suggest that, if the compensation structure is being adjusted, it is done in a manner that assumes all CEOs will leave for the same reason.  I do find evidence that a CEO\u2019s tenure is associated with firm performance for both the retirement and poor-performance groups.  This suggests that the board of directors actively monitors the CEO\u2019s performance.  \n\tI use the estimates of CEO tenure generated by the competing risks regression in a maximum-likelihood regression of the determinants of a CEO\u2019s compensation structure.  I find that CEOs with more earnings-based compensation have longer tenures.  This is consistent with the notion that CEOs who are approaching retirement are likely to become more conservative and unwind their equity positions.  I also find that the relative noise ratio, the ratio of the noise in earnings to the noise in stock price, is positively associated with a CEO\u2019s compensation structure.  This finding is contrary to prior theoretical and empirical research that examines the determinants of a CEO\u2019s compensation structure in a single-period setting, which predicts and finds evidence of a negative relation between a CEO\u2019s compensation structure and the relative noise ratio.  In my research, I examine a multi-period setting.  Certain features of a CEO\u2019s compensation structure, such as stock options, have been shown to encourage CEOs to increase volatility.  Thus, in a multi-period setting, the relative noise ratio would have a positive relationwith a CEO\u2019s compensation structure.\nWhile a CEO\u2019s compensation structure is not related to his tenure, changes in his compensation structure are related to his tenure for both the poor performance and the merger and acquisition groups.  For the poor performance group, stock-based compensation increased with tenure.  In addition, the changes in compensation structure for both the poor performance and retirement groups are similar.  Finally, changes in performance are negatively associated with tenure for CEOs in the poor performance group.  The combination of these results suggest that compensation committees increase stock-based compensation as CEOs approach retirement but not in a manner that suggests the compensation committee distinguishes between how a CEO will leave the firm.  Instead, it appears that compensation committees allow firm performance to determine how a CEO, who is of retirement age, leaves the firm.    \nFor the mergers and acquisition groups, increases in stock-based compensation are associated with shorter tenures.  This is consistent with the notion that significant increases in stock-based compensation can motivate CEOs to find ways to unwind their equity positions as their career concerns change.  Becoming a target of a merger or acquisition may afford the CEO such an opportunity.  The changes in compensation structure for the mergers and acquisition group are significantly different than the changes in compensation structure of both the retirement and poor performance groups.  While the changes in compensation structure for the mergers and acquisition group are significantly different from the retirement and poor performance groups, univariate statistics indicate that the changes in compensation structure for the mergers and acquisition group result in compensation structures that are similar to the retirement group\u2019s for the period immediately preceding when the CEO left the firm.  Thus, the changes in compensation structure for the mergers and acquisition group also appears to support the notion that, while compensation committees appear to adjust a CEO\u2019s compensation structure as he approaches retirement, they do not do so in a manner that is indicative that they anticipate how a CEO will leave the firm.\nA different method of examining the shareholder-CEO contracting relationship is to examine the sensitivity of a CEO\u2019s compensation to changes in shareholder\u2019s wealth.  In the third chapter of this dissertation, I examine the shareholder-CEO contracting relationship in regard to the incentive ratio, which is the ratio of a measure of the sensitivity of changes in the CEO\u2019s earnings-based compensation contract to changes in shareholder wealth to a measure of the sensitivity of the CEO\u2019s stock-based compensation to changes in shareholder wealth.  While the proxy for a CEO\u2019s incentive ratio is positively correlated with my proxy of the CEO\u2019s compensation structure, the correlation is not statistically significant, suggesting that these two measures capture different features of the shareholder-CEO contracting relationship.  \nWhile the empirical evidence in Chapter 2 does not indicate any association between a CEO\u2019s compensation structure and his tenure, the empirical evidence in Chapter 3 suggests a significant association between the CEO\u2019s incentive ratio and his tenure.  For both the retirement and merger and acquisition groups, larger stock-based incentives are associated with shorter tenures.  This is consistent with the notion that, as a CEO approaches retirement, he may become more conservative and wish to unwind his risky equity positions by leaving the firm.  Interestingly, larger earnings-based incentives are associated with shorter tenures for the poor performance group.  This is consistent with the notion that a compensation committee will force a resignation sooner for CEOs who have significant earnings-based incentives but are not realizing the expected performance targets.  When the estimates of tenure from the competing risk regression are included in a maximum-likelihood regression that examines the determinants of the CEO\u2019s incentive ratio, I find a negative association between the CEO\u2019s tenure and his incentive ratio.  This is consistent with the notion that stock-based incentives encourage the CEO to leave so that he can unwind his risky equity positions. \nFor the analysis of whether there is an association between changes in a CEO\u2019s incentive ratio and his tenure, I find that increases in stock-based incentives are associated with longer tenures for CEOs who leave following a merger or acquisition.  This is inconsistent with the notion that increases in a CEO\u2019s stock-based incentives will motivate the CEO to shorten his tenure by engaging in a merger or acquisition.  However, these results are consistent with the notion that increases in a CEO\u2019s stock-based incentives will motivate the CEO to engage in a merger or acquisition when it is favorable for the CEO to do so.  \nOverall, the results from both Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 suggest that compensation committees adjust compensation as a CEO moves through his tenure with a firm but not in a manner that suggests that the compensation committee anticipates how a CEO will leave the firm.  However, the evidence also suggests that these adjustments, when coupled with firm performance, do affect how a CEO leaves the firm.  These results may be of interest to shareholders, regulators, and researchers and aid our understanding of how a CEO\u2019s personal characteristics may affect the contracting relationship as he moves through his tenure with a firm. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1885], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Christine ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Christine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven J Huddart", "Steven J Huddart", "N Edward Coulson", "John Edward Ketz", "Henock Louis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven J Huddart, Dissertation Advisor", "Steven J Huddart, Committee Chair", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member", "John Edward Ketz, Committee Member", "Henock Louis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CEO compensation", "horizon problem", "competing-risks model", "multiple-performance measure compensation contract"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "OGF-OGFR AXIS AND ITS INHIBITORY ACTIONS ON CELL CYCLE PROGRESSION\n\n\n", "id": "7289", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1989", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Opioid growth factor (OGF) is an endogenous opioid peptide ([Met5]-enkephalin) that interacts with the OGF receptor (OGFr), and serves as a tonically active negative growth factor in neoplasia. Previous studies showed that OGF inhibits the growth of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells and pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and is targeted to cell proliferation. However, the mechanism by which OGF inhibits cell replication was not clear. \nThe studies described within this thesis were directed towards defining the molecular mechanisms of OGF inhibitory action. A number of unique findings are presented here.\nIn SCC1 HNSCC cell cultures synchronized with nocodazole, flow cytometry revealed that OGF treatment (10-6 M) resulted in fewer cells exiting the G1 phase of the cell cycle in comparison to controls (p<0.05). Subsequent studies showed that OGF decreased the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (p<0.05) without changing the total Rb expression. Reduced phosphorylated Rb was correlated with reduced cdk4 kinase activity while the total cdk4 expression did not change. Moreover, OGF treatment increased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) p16 protein expression 2-fold in comparison to controls (p<0.05), but had no significant effect on p15, p18, p19, p21 or p27 protein expression. Western blot analysis did not detect p57 protein in the SCC1 cell line. Blockade of OGF-OGFr interactions with the short-acting opioid antagonist, naloxone (NAL), demonstrated that increased expression of p16 protein by OGF was completely abolished by concomitant administration of OGF and NAL. NAL alone had no effect on p16 expression suggesting that this regulation of p16 was an opioid receptor mediated event. Moreover, OGF treatment increased p16 protein expression in comparison to controls (p<0.05) in CAL27 and SCC4 HNSCC cell lines, demonstrating the ubiquitous nature of this observation. Inhibition of p16 (INK4a) activation by p16 specific siRNA blocked OGF inhibitory action on proliferation of SCC1, CAL-27 and SCC4 HNSCC cells. Cultures treated with negative control siRNA, which had no effect on p16 expression, did not block OGF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth inhibitory action. Collectively, these results indicate that the receptor-mediated, growth inhibitory effects of the OGF-OGFr axis in HNSCC cells are associated with induction of p16/cdk4 resulting in decreased Rb phosphorylation. These data revealed that the target of cell proliferative inhibitory action of OGF in human HNSCC cells is by the way of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitory pathways, specifically, the p16 pathway.  Because many human HNSCC tumors retain p16, OGF may be a valuable therapeutic agent in this setting.\nAlternatively, pancreatic cancer cells have frequently lost p16 gene expression, and thus other CKI pathways were examined for their role with OGF inhibition of pancreatic cancer growth. BxPC-3 human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell cultures were synchronized with nocodazole, and flow cytometry revealed that OGF treatment (10-6 M) resulted in fewer cells (p<0.05) exiting the G1 phase of the cell cycle in comparison to controls. The present studies focused on the role of OGF on regulatory pathways for the G1 to S phase transition. Studies using the BxPC-3 pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line suggest that OGF decreased the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) (p<0.05). This change was correlated with reduced cdk2 kinase activity. There was no change in total cdk2 expression. Moreover, OGF treatment for 9 hours increased p21 protein expression 2-fold in comparison to control (p<0.05), but had no effect on p27 protein expression. Blockade of the OGF-OGFr axis with the short-acting opioid antagonist naloxone revealed that the increased expression of p21 protein following OGF treatment was completely abolished by concomitant administration of OGF and NAL. NAL alone had no effect on p21 protein expression suggesting that the OGF effects were OGF receptor mediated. Moreover, OGF treatment increased CKI p21 protein expression in comparison to control (p<0.05) in Panc1 and Capan2 pancreatic cancer cell lines. Inhibition of p21 activation by p21 specific siRNA blocked the OGF inhibitory action on BxPC3, Panc1 and Capan2 cell proliferation. Scrambled siRNAs (negative controls) had no effect on p21 expression and did not block OGF\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth inhibitory action. Collectively, these results indicate that the receptor-mediated, growth inhibitory effects of the OGF-OGFr axis in human pancreatic cancers are associated with induction of p21 expression and repression of the Rb phosphorylation. \nIn summary, these studies demonstrate for the first time that the target of cell proliferative inhibitory action of OGF is cyclin dependent kinase inhibitory pathways. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1972], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Fan ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Mclaughlin", "Ian Stuart Zagon", "Michael Verderame", "Xuwen Peng"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Mclaughlin, Committee Chair", "Ian Stuart Zagon, Committee Member", "Michael Verderame, Committee Member", "Xuwen Peng, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cell cycle", "OGF"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Health indicators that influence the risk of all-cause mortality and functional decline in older persons", "id": "cr56n096b", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12720", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The percentage of persons aged 65 years or older in the United States is growing rapidly, from 13.7% in 2012 to a projected 20.9% in 2050. The prevalence of overweight or obesity is increasing across all age groups, including older adults. Nearly 71% of United States adults aged 60 years or older are either overweight or obese (body mass index (BMI) 25 kg/m2 or above); approximately 31% of them are obese (BMI 30 kg/m2 or above). Although elevated BMI is a strong risk factor for adverse health outcomes among younger and middle-aged adults, studies have suggested that overweight or mild obesity may confer no additional or even lower all-cause mortality risk among older individuals. However, the explanation for this \u201cobesity paradox\u201d is still unclear and this phenomenon has sparked great controversy in the medical and nutrition communities over the years. \nThe objective for our first study was to investigate the association between baseline BMI and all-cause mortality in a well characterized cohort of older persons, controlling for age, sex, smoking, alcohol, laboratory values, medications, and comorbidity status. To address crucial methodological issues, such as reverse causation and residual confounding, we restricted our secondary analyses to never-smokers with no major chronic diseases, excluded early deaths, and used a propensity score approach. This was a prospective cohort study of 4,565 Geisinger Rural Aging Study (GRAS) participants with a baseline age of 74\u00b14.7 (mean\u00b1SD) and a BMI of 29.5\u00b15.3 over a mean of 10.9\u00b13.8 years of follow-up. There was a U-shaped association between BMI and all-cause mortality when we treated BMI as a continuous variable using a restricted cubic spline approach (P-non-linearity<0.001). A similar pattern also was noted when we categorized participants according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) BMI guidelines (18.5 to 24.9 desirable, 25.0 to 29.9 overweight, 30.0 to 34.9 class I obesity, and \u2265 35.0 kg/m2 classes II/III obesity). After accounting for age, sex, smoking, alcohol, laboratory values, medications, and comorbidity status, underweight (BMI <18.5 kg/m2) individuals had significantly greater adjusted risk of all-cause mortality than participants with a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2 (reference range). Participants with overweight (BMI 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2) or class I obesity (BMI 30.0 to 34.9 kg/m2) had significantly lower adjusted risk of all-cause mortality. Interestingly, this adjusted mortality risk was not significantly higher among those with class II or III obesity (BMI \u226535.0 kg/m2). Findings remained consistent when using propensity score weights or including only never-smokers with 2-and 5-year lag analysis or with no identified chronic diseases.\nThe objective for the second study was to examine the joint effects of BMI class and metabolic health in relation to all-cause mortality in a well-characterized cohort of older persons. To reduce the impact of reverse causation and residual confounding on the potential relation between obesity/metabolic health and mortality, we conducted multiple sensitivity analyses using propensity score weights and also by excluding smokers with no identified chronic disease burden or those who had early deaths. This prospective study was based on the same cohort as the first study, except we further eliminated those with a BMI <18.5 kg/m2 (n=14) (i.e., 4,551 participants remained for the final analysis). Study participants, with a baseline age of 74\u00b14.7 (mean\u00b1SD), were categorized according to the NIH BMI guidelines and the presence or absence of a metabolically healthy phenotype (i.e., 0 or 1 risk factors based on a modified Adult Treatment Panel III). A metabolically unhealthy phenotype was defined as having 2 or more risk factors. There were 2,294 deaths over a mean 10.9\u00b13.8 years of follow-up. Relative to metabolically healthy desirable weight, metabolically healthy overweight or class I obesity was not associated with a greater mortality risk (HR: 0.90; 95 CI%: 0.73, 1.13 and HR: 0.58; 95 CI%: 0.42, 0.80, respectively) (P-interaction<0.001). Results persisted even when using a propensity score approach or when including only never-smokers with no identified chronic disease burden or with 5-year lag analysis. \nThe objective for the third study was to use conditional inference tree analysis to construct a risk stratification algorithm for risk of developing functional decline, based on BMI and other potential risk factors (e.g., age, sex, lifestyle factors, and disease burden) among GRAS participants who reported no functional limitations at baseline. This prospective study was based on the same cohort as the first study, except we further excluded 2,614 individuals who either 1) did not complete baseline (i.e., between 1999 and 2003; n=982) or follow-up (i.e., between 2009 and 2011; n=1,371) functional status questionnaire due to death or other reasons or 2) had baseline functional limitation (i.e., indicated having any of the activities of daily living (ADL) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL); n=261). This resulted in 1,951 individuals for the final analysis (i.e., 4,565-2,614=1,951). For comparison, we also analyzed the data using multivariate stepwise logistic regression. A total of 221 individuals developed functional limitation (i.e., reported having difficulty with any ADLs or IADLs) over a mean 9.2\u00b11.7 years of follow-up. Both analytic approaches identified higher BMI, age, and comorbidity as significant risk factors for functional decline. Conditional inference tree analysis further stratified individuals into four risk groups based on these three risk factors. Compared to the low risk group, all other risk groups had significantly greater risk of developing functional limitation. The odds ratio comparing the two extreme categories was 9.09 (95% CI: 4.68, 17.6).\nThe objective for the fourth study was to perform a meta-analysis of observational cohort studies to examine current literature on the association between weight change (weight loss, weight gain, and weight fluctuation) and all-cause mortality among older adults aged 60 years or older. We used three databases \u2013 PubMed (MEDLINE), Web of Science, and Cochrane Library \u2013 to identify prospective studies published in English from inception to November 2014. This meta-analysis included 17 prospective studies that met the inclusion criteria. Overall, we observed a higher all-cause mortality risk with weight change: weight loss (pooled relative risk (RR): 1.67; 95% CI: 1.51, 1.85; P<0.001 for heterogeneity), weight gain (pooled RR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.33; P=0.03 for heterogeneity), and weight fluctuation (pooled RR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.36, 1.72; P=0.43 for heterogeneity). Results from sensitivity analyses with stricter criteria showed similar patterns. None of the study characteristics had statistically significant effects on the pooled RR, except for study quality on weight loss. \nIn conclusion, our results support the obesity paradox among older persons. We observed a U-shaped association between BMI and all-cause mortality with lower risk in individuals with overweight or mild obesity (class I obesity), compared to those with a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2. Our findings did not support the suggestion that residual confounding by smoking or reverse causation due to early deaths, disease burden, and smoking could explain this phenomenon. Our results do however suggest that the obesity paradox may be partially explained by the inclusion of metabolically healthy overweight and obese older persons, who do not have elevated mortality risk, in population studies of BMI and mortality. However, it is important to highlight that higher BMI was consistently identified as a significant risk factor for functional decline using both traditional regression and data mining approaches in our study. Therefore, it is imperative to consider the impact of overweight or obesity on other health and functional outcomes when considering any possible mortality benefits. Lastly, while our meta-analysis showed that weight change is associated with higher mortality risk among community-dwelling adults aged 60 years or older, more studies are warranted to provide the specificity needed to develop meaningful public health and clinical guidelines.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11973], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Feon W", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Feon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Xiang Gao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Xiang Gao, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Obesity", "Longevity", "Elderly", "Prospective cohort study", "Metabolic Health", "Functional decline", "Epidemiology", "Data mining"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "EXPLOITING AND ACCOMMODATING ASYMMETRIES IN MEMORY TO ENABLE EFFICIENT MULTI-CORE SYSTEMS", "id": "0c483j36g", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13017", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "      The memory hierarchy, including on-chip caches and off-chip main memory, is becoming the performance and energy bottleneck in multi-core systems, and architectural techniques are needed to tackle the challenge. With the increasing number of cores in multi-core systems, abundant data accesses from variant applications contend for the limited memory resources, such as cache capacity and memory bandwidth, provided by traditional memory systems. Moreover, the power consumption of memory systems has become an important design constraint in performance scaling at the coming dark silicon era. As a result, computer architects are facing significant challenges in designing high performance and energy-efficient memory systems. Emerging memory technologies, such as nonvolatile memories (NVMs), introduce new opportunities to tackle the challenge by exploiting their high density, low leakage, and non-volatile features. Nevertheless, architectural approaches are required to alleviate the disadvantage of high write latency and energy in NVMs.\n      To address the performance and energy challenges in multi-core memory systems, this dissertation designs efficient memory management policies through exploiting and accommodating asymmetries in memory. Variant types of asymmetries in memory are explored, including asymmetric read-write access semantics, asymmetric access pattern, and asymmetric memory technologies. By exploiting and accommodating different types of asymmetries in memory, three solutions are proposed to improve the performance and energy efficiency of multi-core systems with the memory hierarchy built by conventional SRAM/DRAM, emerging NVMs, or hybrid technologies.\n      First, this dissertation studies asymmetric read-write access semantics and proposes a write-aware memory request scheduling policy to improve performance through mitigating write-induced interference. Although reads are usually prioritized over writes in the memory controller, writes eventually need to be serviced when the write queue is full. Servicing a higher number of writes in a burst can reduce the bus turnaround penalty and increase the row-buffer hit rate by exposing more writes together. However, the queuing latency of reads also increases. This dissertation analyzes the pros and cons of servicing a long burst of writes, and proposes a run-time mechanism to schedule reads and writes according to the workload behavior. By considering the impact of row-buffer locality and queuing delay, the proposed scheduling policy provides significant performance improvement in multi-core systems with DRAM-based and NVM-based main memory.\n      Second, this dissertation exploits the asymmetric access pattern among different portions of last-level caches (LLCs) and presents a low-overhead mechanism to reduce the power consumption of SRAM-based LLCs. Power management for LLCs is important in multi-core systems, as the leakage power of LLCs accounts for a significant fraction of the limited on-chip power budget. Since not all workloads running on multi-core systems need the entire cache, portions of a large, shared LLC can be disabled to save energy. This dissertation explores different design choices, from circuit-level cache organization to architectural management policies, to propose a low-overhead mechanism for energy reduction. Based on the extensive experimental analysis, this dissertation finds that simultaneously exploiting three key types of access pattern, i.e, utilization, hotness, and the distribution of dirty cache lines, is necessary to design the power management policies for an energy-efficient LLC.\n      Finally, a novel selective inclusion policy for NVM-based LLCs with asymmetric read-write energy is introduced to improve the energy efficiency. In NVM-based LLCs, dynamic energy from write operations can be responsible for a larger fraction of total cache energy than leakage. This property leads to the fact that no single traditional inclusion policy being dominant in terms of LLC energy consumption for LLCs with asymmetric read-write energy. Based on this observation, a novel inclusion policy is proposed to incorporate advantages from both non-inclusive and exclusive designs. In order to reduce redundant writes and energy consumption, the proposed policy selectively caches the frequently reused clean data in particular levels of the cache hierarchy. Furthermore, a variant of the selective inclusion policy is developed to illustrate that the detection of frequently reused clean data can help to achieve more energy-efficient data placement in hybrid SRAM/NVM LLCs.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12457], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Hsiang-Yun ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hsiang-Yun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Jane Irwin", "Mary Jane Irwin", "John Morgan Sampson", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Jane Irwin, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Chair", "John Morgan Sampson, Committee Member", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Kenneth Jenkins, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Memory systems", "Asymmetric access", "Energy efficiency", "Cache", "Memory request scheduling", "Power management", "Non-volatile memory"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Finding The Museum: The Spatial Discontinuities\nof The Mattress Factory Art Museum\n", "id": "21086", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9658", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In my case study of the Mattress Factory Art Museum (MF), I describe and conceptualize how the museum staff and its resident artists use its exhibition spaces (\u201cspatial practices\u201d), and their implications for museum education. The study takes into account the historical uses of the MF\u2019s buildings and the museum\u2019s placement in and relationship to its historic residential neighborhood on the North Side of Pittsburgh. I also consider its deviations from \u201ctraditional\u201d museum practices, its heterogeneous community of curators, artists, and visitors who reveal the cultural diversity of this site, and how the MF works with artists from around the world to install their artworks in its galleries. \n\nInstallation art, by definition, is a type of art in which the visitor to an exhibition becomes part of it by physically entering the space, and, further, by interacting with the installation, which is usually three-dimensional. Installation art is interactive, and during my 16 visits to the MF to explore and research it as the topic of my study, I interacted with numerous installations, some of which are in the museum\u2019s permanent collection. Except for the permanent works, the installations change from time to time as artists live in residence for a period of time and create their artworks in collaboration with the museum staff. I also explored the museum\u2019s use of space, applying the theories of philosophers Michel de Certeau (\u201cspaces\u201d versus \u201cplaces\u201d), Henri Lefebvre (\u201carchi-textures\u201d), and Michel Foucault (\u201cheterotopias\u201d) to guide my data collection and theorize the constitution of the spatial practices of the MF as a form of museum pedagogy. \n\nUsing a case study, I examined how the MF\u2019s places (physical locations) become spaces (people\u2019s movements and responses to a place). As I discovered, the MF\u2019s spatial practices in which the artists often use room-size installations with unusual forms, sounds, and lighting effects in their works immerse visitors in a multi-sensorial, interactive, often exploratory, experience that evokes their sensory responses and engages their participation. (I primarily use my own sensory responses to the artworks and the museum buildings themselves to convey how the MF uses its spaces and involves its visitors in the artworks.) \n\nFinally, I concluded that the relationship of the installations of the MF to the building\u2019s interior and exterior features as a former mattress warehouse and macaroni-producing factory that is more than a century old, and to its neighborhood surroundings, comprises its archi-textures as defined by Lefebvre. Because of the MF\u2019s interrelated architectural features, history, and immediate surroundings, its contents can be considered one large art installation itself in my view. In terms of the structure of the MF, it functions in contrast to other conventional contemporary art museums, creating what French theorist Foucault calls a heterotopia (an ensemble of relations placed in a single site). As a heterotopia, the MF houses unusual ways of creating spatial relations with installations and relations of co-operative enterprise not only because invited curators and artists have been reconfiguring the MF\u2019s exterior and interior spaces with multiple materials and mediums, but also because the museum itself serves as an adjustable installation artwork in which its gallery spaces can periodically be dismantled and reinstalled with new content.\nThe uniqueness of the MF and the value it offers museum education is its staff\u2019s ability to accommodate multiple spatial practices for a range of installation artists to execute their ideas and for visitors to interact with the diverse explorative spaces they create. The multiple spatial practices of the MF imply that an art museum is not just a container for artworks but may be comprised of several functional spaces such as a research site and a studio where artists investigate ideas and utilize spaces to create multiple kinds of environments for visitors to encounter art. The building that houses an art museum with its architectural design, historical context, and surroundings can be viewed as a part of the artwork that creates unique experiences for visitors, who then transform the museum from a place to distinct spaces. Such was my experience of the Mattress Factory Art Museum. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9418], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Ju-chun ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ju-chun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Richard Garoian", "Mary Ann Stankiewicz", "Christine M Thompson", "Marcus Steven Shaffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Richard Garoian, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Ann Stankiewicz, Committee Chair", "Christine M Thompson, Committee Member", "Marcus Steven Shaffer, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Space", "Spatial Practices", "Installation Art", "Heterotopias", "Archi-Textures", "Museum Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Developing molecular depth profiling and dynamic imaging with TOF-SIMS and cluster ion beams", "id": "7102", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3262", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis work is aimed toward developing molecular depth profiling with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and the emerging cluster ion sources, mainly C60+.  This unique tool for molecular surface characterization exhibits surface sensitivity and chemical imaging capability, both highly desirable features in materials characterization.  However, the approach has not yet found full application to the study of organic and biological samples since the traditional atomic ion sources induce crucial fragmentation of molecules during desorption, and the sensitivity and formation of molecular ions generally drops significantly.  This situation has been dramatically changed recently with the development of cluster ion sources.  New physics is believed to be involved with the cluster ion bombardment that is quite different from atomic bombardment, and a number of exciting new properties have been observed.  The most interesting property is the potential of molecular depth profiling.\nA fundamental knowledge of these properties is highly desirable to speed future application development.  Hence, the basic concepts of the issues discussed in this thesis are introduced in Chapter 1.  Next, a defined, reproducible platform for examining the details of cluster/solid interactions has been constructed as presented in Chapter 2.  Successful molecular depth profiling, as well as sputtering parameters were obtained from this platform.  With these parameters, an erosion dynamics analytical model is also developed in Chapter 3.  Two parameters have been found to be critical for successful molecular depth profiling, a high sputtering yield and a minimized damage factor of the bombardment.  Although this model is semi-quantitative, it facilitates the elucidation of the essential physics of cluster/solid interactions.  This physical understanding is key to fully applying new properties of cluster ion bombardment.  Multiple examples based on this platform are studied in Chapters 3 and 5 to confirm this model and to examine the basic sputtering properties of C60+ on more complex materials.  This approach has also proven valuable in comparing different ion sources quantitatively.  Results in Chapters 3 and 4 have demonstrated that the C60+ ion source exhibits superior sputtering properties when compared to Aun+ (n=1-3).  The results from this study are opening new research avenues for cluster ion sources.  An important goal is to be able to perform three-dimensional molecular dynamic SIMS imaging.  Preliminary studies aimed toward identifying the critical issues for 3-D imaging will be presented in Chapter 6 with future directions summarized in Chapter 7.

It has also been used in the paper manufacturing industry to enhance paper strength, the electronics industry in acoustic diaphragms for audio speakers, the pharmaceutical industry as filtration membranes, and in the medical field as wound dressing and artificial skin material. Pullulan, a water soluble EPS synthesized by a yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans, is often described as an \u0192\u00d1-1, 6 linked maltotriose polymer. With this unique linkage pattern, pullulan demonstrates distinctive physical properties, such as adhesive ability, the capacity to form fibers, and the ability to be formed into thin and biodegradable films which are transparent and impermeable to oxygen. As a result, pullulan has been used for a wide range of applications in food, pharmaceutical, chemical, and environmental remediation applications.\nThe purpose of this research is to improve the rate of cellulose and pullulan production and their material properties by exploring new culture methods including a new biofilm reactor design and the addition of different additives. The physical and chemical properties of these novel polysaccharide composites were evaluated using several characterization approaches. \nFirst, a novel biofilm bioreactor configuration was implemented, including a solid substrate (plastic composite support, PCS) to promote effective nutrient delivery for biofilm development. PCS degrades slowly with time offering a distinct advantage: disruption of biofilm formation preventing thick film formation, which results in an oxygen and substrate diffusion barrier. Second, several additives were used to make EPS composite and the mechanical properties of this new EPS composite were evaluated. \nThe broader impacts of this work will benefit industries which need cellulose fiber and/or pullulan such as the forest products industry and other industries utilizing the medical value of this material. Also, the molecular weight distribution of pullulan plays an important role relative to its bioactive potential. For example, pullulan, which is suitable for intravenous injection should have a narrow molecule weight distribution (MWD) with Mw/Mn = 1.2 and MW about 60 kDa. This work focused on the development of new processes which have potential to be environmentally benign and sustainable. \nEnhancement of bacterial cellulose (BC) production by Acetobacter xylinum was explored through the addition of different additives into the fermentation medium in agitated culture including agar, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium alginate. Among the evaluated additives, CMC yielded highest BC production (8.2 g/L) compared to the control (1.3 g/L). The results also indicated that CMC-altered BC production increased with CMC addition and reached saturation around 1%. The variation between replicates for all analysis was less than 5%. From XRD analysis, however, the crystallinity and crystal size decreased as CMC addition increased. FESEM results showed CMC-altered BC produced from agitated culture retained its interweaving property. TGA results demonstrated that CMC-altered BC had about 98% water retention ability, which is higher than BC pellicle produced with static culture. CMC-altered BC also exhibited higher Tmax compared to control. Finally, DMA results showed that BC from agitated culture loses its tensile strength in both stress at break and Young\u00a1\u00a6s modulus when compared to BC pellicle since the former were in pellet form.\nAs for BC production in biofilm reactors, the type SFYR+ PCS was selected as solid support for BC production by A. xylinum in a batch biofilm reactor due to its high nitrogen content, moderate nitrogen leaching rate, and sufficient biomass attached on PCS. The PCS biofilm reactor yielded BC production (7.05 g/L) that was 2.5-fold greater than the control (2.82 g/L). The XRD results indicated that the PCS-grown BC exhibited higher crystallinity (93%) and similar crystal size (5.2 nm) to the control. FESEM results showed the attachment of A. xylinum on PCS, producing an interweaving BC product. TGA results demonstrated that PCS-grown BC had about 95% water retention ability, which was lower than BC produced within suspended-cell reactor. PCS-grown BC also exhibited higher Tmax compared to the control. Finally, DMA results showed that BC from the PCS biofilm reactor increased its mechanical property values, i.e., stress at break and Young\u00a1\u00a6s modulus when compared to the control BC.\nFor pullulan production, the optimal cultivation medium was first evaluated for Aureobasidium pullulans. The optimal growth condition for pullulan production by A. pullulans was found as 75 g/l of sucrose as carbon source, 3 g/l of yeast extract, and cultivation temperature at 30oC. Under these conditions with an initial pH at 5, the 20.7 g/l of final pullulan concentration and 0.22 g/l/h maximum production rate were observed. The optimal kinetic parameter was as follows: initial pH at 2.0, switched to pH 5.0 after 72 h and kept constant; agitation speed at 200 rpm; aeration at 1.5 vvm. \nUsing the optimal medium, a biofilm reactor with plastic composite support (PCS) was then evaluated for pullulan production using A. pullulans. In test tube fermentations, PCS with soybean hulls, defatted soybean flour, yeast extract, dried bovine red blood cells, and mineral salts was selected for biofilm reactor fermentation (due to its high nitrogen content, moderate nitrogen leaching rate, and high biomass attachment). Three pH profiles were later applied to evaluate their effects on pullulan production in a PCS biofilm reactor. The results demonstrated that when a constant pH at 5.0 was applied, the time course of pullulan production was advanced and the concentration of pullulan reached 32.9 g/L after 7-day cultivation, which is 1.8-fold higher than its respective suspension culture. \nResponse surface methodology using Box-Behnken design was then employed to study the effects of sucrose and nitrogen concentrations on pullulan production. After 7-day fermentation with optimum condition, the pullulan production reached 60.7 g/L, which was 1.8 times higher than the result from initial medium, and was the highest yield reported to date. The quality analysis demonstrated that the purity of produced pullulan was 95.2% and its viscosity was 2.5 centipoise (cP). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) also suggested that the produced exopolysaccharide was pullulan.\nPullulan fermentations by A. pullulans with various initial ammonium ion concentrations were evaluated in a 2-L bioreactor. The results demonstrated that A. pullulans produced highest pullulan (23.1 g/L) when the initial ammonium sulfate was at 5 g/L. The purity of produced pullulan was 94.6%. Seven g/L of ammonium sulfate produced more biomass due to the higher level of nitrogen source, but the pullulan-degrading enzyme activity was detected after the depletion of sucrose, which reduced pullulan concentration. From the results of fed-batch fermentation, addition of 10 g/L of sucrose suppressed A. pullulans from producing pullulan-degrading enzyme.\nUsing the results from suspended-cell, batch fermentation, the modified Gompertz model can serve as a universal equation to fit biomass production, pullulan production, and sucrose consumption. Furthermore, validation of this modified Gompertz model indicated that biomass production (slope = 1.00, R2 = 0.991), pullulan production (slope = 1.10, R2 = 0.991), and sucrose consumption (slope = 0.96, R2 = 0.991) were all predicted accurately. Additionally, the modified Gompertz equation demonstrated its generality to fit all pullulan production, biomass production, and sucrose consumption curves at three ammonium sulfate levels. After incorporating the degrading factor, a re-modified Gompertz equation was obtained that can adequately describe the decrease of pullulan; which resulted from the presence of pullulan-degrading enzyme, at the late fermentation stage. In summary, excess ammonium ions with the depletion of carbon source resulted in the presence of pullulan-degrading enzyme that subsequently reduced pullulan concentration. A re-modified Gompertz equation can serve as a generalized equation to describe pullulan fermentation.\nIn conclusion, these studies clearly demonstrated that the biofilm reactor can be employed to enhance microbial extracellular polysaccharide production. BC production and its material property are highly affected by additives during fermentation. BC produced from PCS biofilm reactor exhibited tensile strength comparable to that produced in pellicle form. For pullulan production, optimal cultivation parameters and solid support for biofilm formation were determined. The produced pullulan maintained its high purity around 95%. The mathematical models proposed in this study can pave the way for further studies, for example, an online recovery of BC and/or pullulan from existing biofilm reactor.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3554], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Kuan-Chen ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kuan-Chen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali Demirci", "Ali Demirci", "Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Virendra Puri", "Nicole Robitaille Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali Demirci, Dissertation Advisor", "Ali Demirci, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Chair", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Nicole Robitaille Brown, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pullulan", "bacterial cellulose", "fermentation", "biofilm reactor", "bioreactor design", "polysaccharide"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Guided Exploration for Coordinated Autonomous Soaring Flight", "id": "19071", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8626", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An exploration strategy to effectively guide coordinated mapping of vertical wind speed in autonomous soaring flight is proposed. A map is discretized into a grid, and a scalar Kalman filter estimates vertical wind speed in each cell. Exploration is driven by uncertainty in the vertical wind speed estimate and by the relative likelihood of thermal triggering. This relative likelihood is computed based on solar incidence, which is in turn computed from digital elevation data (obtained from US Geological Survey) and the position of the sun. An exploration priority function is developed to drive mapping of vertical wind. This exploration strategy leads to a well-explored map in regions where the predicted maximum solar heating occurs. Regions having a low likelihood of thermal formation are avoided. Exploration resources are saved and utilized on regions where thermals are more likely to form.\n\nPerformance of the exploration strategy is verified using Monte Carlo simulations for various flock sizes at different geographic locations as well as different levels of altitude floors (which trigger energy exploitation). Results show that endurance is greatly improved when the prediction of thermal triggering is accurate. Performance gains decrease with rising altitude floor which reduces the exploration time. When thermal prediction provides minimal guidance, performance loss occurs for a small flock size. Larger flock size and lower altitude floor are necessary to provide excess exploration resources. This result suggests a heavier weight on the uncertainty in the wind estimate when exploration resources are restricted.\n\nThe feasibility of the exploration strategy is demonstrated in a high-fidelity soaring flight simulator, which contains more realistic thermal dynamics. This simulation setup is a stepping stone to the hardware implementation of the guided exploration algorithm. Finally, hardware implementation of the exploration strategy with a commercially available autopilot system and an SB-XC sailplane is provided.

The tmRNA pathway is important for both bacterial physiology and bacterial pathogenesis. To understand the physiological role of tmRNA in bacteria, and to exploit tmRNA as a target for antibiotics, we investigated the activity of tmRNA in the model species Caulobacter crescentus. In C. crescentus lacking tmRNA activity, initiation of DNA replication is delayed. To understand the molecular basis of the tmRNA phenotype, the impacts of tmRNA activity on the expression of replication initiator protein DnaA, and the transcription from a strong promoter (Ps) within the origin were investigated. We demonstrated that transcription of dnaA and Ps are both delayed in cells lacking tmRNA activity. We identified a TCAA motif from the dnaA promoter that is important for the timing of dnaA transcription. A possible model is that tmRNA can regulate an unknown transcriptional regulator, and the unknown transcriptional regulator could bind to the TCAA motif in both the PdnaA and Ps, thereby regulating the timing of transcription from both and ensuring the correct timing of DNA replication initiation. We also showed that the 5?UTR of dnaA strongly represses dnaA expression. Although this repression is not tmRNA-dependent, it could be a conserved mechanism on dnaA regulation in other bacteria. \nBecause tmRNA is essential for viability or virulence in many species, inhibitors of the tmRNA pathway could have bactericidal activity. We developed genetic methods to screen libraries of cyclic peptides for inhibitors of individual steps in the tmRNA pathway, and had isolated cyclic peptides that inhibit the proteolysis of tmRNA-tagged proteins in E. coli.  Inhibitors shared little sequence similarity and interfered with various steps in the ClpXP mechanism in vitro. Several of these inhibitors were bactericidal when added exogenously to cultures of C. crescentus, which  that requires ClpXP activity for viability. This result suggests that the tmRNA pathway may be a useful target for antibiotic development. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3896], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Lin ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Lee Babitzke", "Kenneth Charles Keiler", "Stephen James Benkovic", "Douglas Cavener", "Eric Thomas Harvill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Lee Babitzke, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Charles Keiler, Committee Member", "Stephen James Benkovic, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["antibacterial cyclic peptide", "DnaA", "ClpXP", "DNA replication", "tmRNA", "cell cycle regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "TAIWANESE YOUNG CHILDREN'S PLAY IN ECE SETTINGS: A STUDY OF TEACHER AND CHILD BEHAVIORS AFFECTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-REGULATION\n\n\n", "id": "11722", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4407", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Play has been recognized for its importance to children\u2019s development. In addition, self-regulation has been found to be associated with school readiness and future success. Research has supported that play is a vital context for the development of self-regulation. This study adopted a socio-cultural perspective to examine the relationship between play and self-regulation in Taiwanese young children. The research questions are as follows:\n1.\tWhat is the developmental status of cognitive self-regulation, i.e., executive function and theory of mind, for Taiwanese 4- to 5-year-old children?\n2.\tWhat is the developmental status of behavioral self-regulation, measured by observations in group time and teacher evaluations, for Taiwanese 4- to 5-year-old children?\n3.\tWhat are the play types of Taiwanese 4- to 5-year-old children?\n4.\tHow are teachers involved in play and how do children react to teachers\u2019 involvement?\n5.\tIs there any relationship between specific types of play and executive function in Taiwanese 4- to 5-year-old children?\n6.\tIs there any relationship between specific types of play and theory of mind in Taiwanese 4- to 5-year-old children? \n7.\tIs there any relationship between specific types of play and behavioral self-regulation in Taiwanese 4- to 5-year-old children?\nA correlational design was used in this study, in which fifty 4- to 5-year-old typically developing Taiwanese young children participated. However, due to different social ecologies in the classroom age-grouping, data for only 34 children were analyzed in the study. The data collection began in May 2009 and ended in January 2010. Two phases were involved\u2014the preparation phase and the data collection phase. In the latter phase, five procedures were involved: (1) observing children\u2019s play behaviors in free play, (2) observing teacher involvement in children\u2019s play and children\u2019s responses in free play, (3) conducting two executive function tasks, two theory of mind tasks, and assessing children\u2019s verbal ability, (4) observing children\u2019s self-regulation behaviors in group time, and (5) teacher ratings of behavioral self-regulation for each participating child. The measures employed in this study included the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Taiwanese version Form A, the Modified Social/Cognitive Scale of Play Behaviors, the Executive Function Battery, the Theory of Mind Battery, the Self-Regulation Coding System, and the Self-Control Rating Scale. Descriptive and correlation statistics were used to analyze the data in the study.      \nThis study revealed seven results: \n1. Taiwanese children aged 4 to 5 demonstrated an advanced development in the executive function tasks, but were slower in their theory-of-mind understanding compared to their American counterparts.\n2. Taiwanese children aged 4 to 5 were attentive in group time in general and were assessed as controlling their impulsivity well by their classroom teacher after one semester of observation. \n3. Taiwanese children aged 4 to 5 tended to perform sophisticated social levels of play like group play, and higher cognitive levels of play like constructive and dramatic play.\n4. Teachers were not involved in children\u2019s play most of the time. This might relate to the fact that there was no free-play time in the arrangement of the daily schedule, and that teachers had to deal with administrative responsibilities or talk to parents during the time of observation.\n5. A lack of relationship between executive function and any type of play was due to a ceiling effect on children\u2019s executive function tasks.\n6. A positive relationship between two dramatic play types and theory-of-mind understanding might reflect some shared meta-representations existing, and also that they can reinforce each other.\n7. Unexpectedly, a negative association between group play and teacher evaluation was found. This might reflect an early stage of group play and the Chinese cultural pursuit of \u201ca silent child.\u201d  \nAlthough this was an exploratory study, it contributes to the following areas: to provide culturally persuasive evidence to support a play pedagogy in Taiwan; to provide timely results to inform ECE research; to give an example to study from a socio-cultural perspective; to provide a research by using multi-measures and multi-sources; and to inspire further thinking about the influence of Chinese cultural values. Several modifications regarding the limitations in this study were suggested for future studies. Recommendations for educators and parents were proposed as well: paying more attention to children\u2019s socio-emotional development, and adopting a dramatic-play pedagogy to provide a great path for intrinsically-motivated self-regulation in a joyful environment.   \n \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4377], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Mei-Fang ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mei-Fang", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson", "James Ewald Johnson", "Robert Lee Burgess", "Vivian Yenika Agbaw", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Rama B Radhakrishna"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "James Ewald Johnson, Committee Chair", "Robert Lee Burgess, Committee Member", "Vivian Yenika Agbaw, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Rama B Radhakrishna, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["socio-cultural perspective", "children's play", "self-regulation", "executive function", "theory of mind", "early childhood education"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "LONG-RANGE WIND TURBINE NOISE ROPAGATION BY THE PARABOLIC EQUATION METHOD\n\n\n", "id": "7456", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5438", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A project has been undertaken to develop a numerical toolkit to simulate long-range propagation of wind turbine noise problems with the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and CAA (Computational Aeroacoustics) methods. This thesis, which is focused on developing a parabolic equation (PE) method for long-range noise propagation prediction in a complicated environment, is part of that project. The basic idea is marching an initial acoustic solution from the near field to the far field. This research has been performed in two steps: first, as a learning process a traditional two dimensional parabolic equation code is developed; second, a novel three dimensional parabolic equation model is developed, coded, and validated for sound propagation in an inhomogeneous arbitrary moving atmosphere.\n\nThe 2D PE method is based on an axisymmetry assumption, where the homogeneous Helmholtz equation is split into an incoming wave and an outgoing wave. The outgoing wave satisfies a parabolic equation. In the process of the splitting, a square root operator is generated. Based on the order of the approximation scheme to the square root operator, the PE method is categorized as a narrow angle PE, a wide angle PE, or a higher-order PE. Because it is unconditionally stable in this application, the Crank-Nicholson finite difference method is used to solve the wide angle PE with second order accuracy. The discretization of the parabolic equation results in a linear system of equations, which is solved by an LU algorithm with appropriate initial field and boundary conditions. The numerical results of several example cases are compared to the analytical results, which validate the 2D CNPE method for sound propagation in an inhomogeneous atmosphere without wind. \n\nIn order to handle sound propagating in an arbitrary moving inhomogeneous medium, a new formulation of the Helmholtz equation is derived in three dimensional cylindrical coordinates. Based on this new formulation, a new parabolic equation is constructed, which extends the homogeneous Parabolic Equation (PE) method to arbitrary moving media. The new PE is discretized by the Crank-Nicholson finite difference method and solved by the Generalized Minimum RESidual (GMRES) method. Numerical results for zero-wind and uniform wind cases above a rigid flat ground surface are presented and compared with benchmark analytical solutions to validate the methodology. Results of sound propagation problems in more realistic wind environments are compared to the 2D PE simulation with an effective speed of sound approximation. It is concluded that if the vertical distance between the acoustic source and observer is small, the effective sound speed approximation to the wind velocity component along the sound propagation direction is acceptable. However, as the vertical distance between them increases, the effective sound speed model will introduce as much as 20 dB errors at some long-range locations. Furthermore, the 2D PE cannot simulate the lateral refraction, thus cannot obtain correct phase information of the acoustic pressure. Therefore, in order to obtain accurate acoustic field in a complicated environment with arbitrary wind, it is necessary to use this 3D PE method.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5430], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Rui ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Philip John Morris", "Lyle Norman Long", "Victor Ward Sparrow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Chair", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sound Propagation", "Parabolic Equation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A search for ultra-high energy neutron point sources with the Auger surface detector\n", "id": "18686", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8832", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A thorough blind search for point sources of the entire exposed sky, and a stacked\ntargeted search across ten Galactic stellar object target sets, are conducted with\nthe Pierre Auger surface detector data.

Evidence for construct validity can be gathered by examining the factor structure of a test (Messick, 1995).

The current study examined the dimensionality of the EARLI numeracy measures, which target key skills such as number identification, counting, and basic arithmetic. \nConsidering the small sample size of the study, three programs, NOHARM, DIMTEST and DETECT were selected to provide a comprehensive picture of the underlying structure of the EARLI numeracy measures.  Initial evidence of unidimensionality was obtained for some of the measures (Counting Aloud, Counting Object, and Measurement), which contributed to the support of their use in preschools. However, the dimensionality for two measures (Number Naming and Pattern Recognition), remained inconclusive due to discrepancy in results between programs. Further evidence concerning dimensionality is needed before any substantive conclusion can be made.  \nOur literature review revealed the lack of empirical studies on dimensionality evaluation with small sample sizes.

Amidst all these studies, a relatively under-explored area is the sexual experiences of overweight adolescents. In addition to overweight teens, this study also investigated the development of underweight youth. This study aimed to understand the sexuality development of youth by weight status from adolescence to young adulthood. The current study utilized the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) data.\nThis study first asked whether adolescents of different weight statuses have different timing of sex debut. The results showed that underweight and overweight youth experience significantly later first sexual intercourse than normal weight teens. Social relationships play an important role in explaining why weight status delays the transition to first sex. When developmental stages were taken into account, different processes emerged. The status of underweight only delays sex debut in the younger teen ages, not in the older teen ages. \nThe second research question tapped into the development and predictors of sexual relationship trajectories. Four distinct types of sexual trajectories were identified: a high-risk trajectory, a constant-one-partner trajectory, a progression-to-one-partner trajectory, and a never-had-sex trajectory. Overweight adolescents are less likely to have a developmental trajectory that involves any level of sexual activity than to have the never-had-sex trajectory. These negative associations are once again explained by the social relationship characteristics of adolescents. \nThe last research question investigated the role of weight status and sexual relationship trajectories in affecting intimate partner physical violence, sexual coercion, and psychological adjustment in young adulthood. The findings revealed that weight status in adolescence increases the likelihood of experiencing violence in a recent sexual relationship and for having severe depression during early adulthood. Sexual relationship trajectories were only found to be associated with experiencing physical violence by an intimate partner, but not with forced sex or severe psychological problems. Finally, a close mother-child relationship and a positive family climate are associated with increased odds of experiencing severe depression among underweight and overweight youth.

In this thesis, we use erythoroid cells and GATA1 as our model system to study the connection between transcription factors (e.g. GATA1) and gene regulation. Erythropoeisis is the process by which erythrocytes are produced. GATA1 is an erythroid transcription factors that is essential for this process. \nIn the first study reported in this thesis, we examined the relationship between evolutionary preservation of a transcription factor binding site motif and its activity.  We used chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with a high density tiling array of a 66 megabase (Mb) region of mouse chromosome 7 (ChIP-chip) to identify DNA segments occupied by GATA1 . We then tested each occupied segment for enhancer activity in a transient transfection assay to identify the GATA1-occupied segments with this function. Combining these functional analyses with the constraint information of the consensus GATA1 binding motif (WGATAR) in the occupied segments, we found that GATA1-bound segments with high enhancer activity tend to be the ones with an evolutionarily preserved WGATAR motif. This relationship was confirmed by a loss-of-function assay by mutating each individual WGATAR motif and measuring its contribution to the whole enhancer activity. Thus, GATA1 binding site motifs that regulate gene expression during erythroid maturation are under strong selective constraint, while non-constrained binding may have only a limited or indirect role in regulation. \n\tAfter this analysis of the relationship between motif constraint and activity (in the 66 Mb regions), we then examine the relationship between occupancy and expression response genome-wide. We mapped the GATA1-occupied segments in the whole mouse genome using NimbleGen HD2 whole-genome tiling array. We also obtained the expression profile of mouse genes in response to restoring GATA1, using the Affemtrix Moe430v2 microarray. Our results showed strong correlation between GATA1 occupancy pattern around the transcription start site (TSS) of genes and the expression pattern of the corresponding genes. All responsive genes tend to be closer to GATA1-occupied segments than randomly chosen genes, and this relationship is more pronounced for up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes. Up-regulated genes also tend to have multiple GATA1-occupied segments in their vicinity, with a substantial signal for occupancy close to the TSS and in the first intron. These positional relationships that tend to distinguish up- from down-regulated genes indicate different mechanisms of regulation. Most up-regulated genes have GATA1 and other activating co-factors close to the start site. Some down-regulated genes have GATA1 but not other activating transcription factors such as TAL1. Other down-regulated genes may be repressed by an indirect mechanism, e.g. as a result of the activation of other genes.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6904], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Yong ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Robert Paulson", "Stephan C Schuster", "David Scott Gilmour", "Reka Z Albert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison, Dissertation Advisor", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Chair", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Stephan C Schuster, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["conservation", "ChIP-chip", "GATA1", "function"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Essays on Product Returns in a Closed-loop Supply Chain", "id": "14353yuc190", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14353", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The essays in the dissertation examine product returns in Closed-loop Supply Chains from multiple perspectives by using different methodologies.

Since then numerous studies on the possible novel state have been carried out. While it was shown very recently that the observed drop in the resonant period of the torsional oscillators housing solid helium which was interpreted as a signature of NCRI is more likely a mechanical phenomenon other than a real phase transition, a number of  interesting properties of solid 4He have been observed during the last decade in many laboratories. These newly discovered results include a shear modulus anomaly, dc flow through solid helium and a heat capacity peak. Most of these studies focus on bulk crystalline solid 4He. This dissertation focuses on the study of thermodynamic properties of helium in porous media.\n\nWe have measured the heat capacity of solid 4He grown in aerogel and Vycor. For solid 4He in aerogel, the dependences of heat capacity on pressure and 3He concentration have been systematically studied. We found evidence that 3He atoms tend to reside in the vicinity of silica strands as temperature is decreased forming a 3He rich region.\n\nWe have also carried out measurements of thermal conductivity of solid 4He embedded in Vycor. The thermal conductivity of Vycor is not significantly changed with the infusion of solid helium. Interestingly, the infusion of liquid 4He in Vycor pores results in a three-fold reduction in thermal conductivity below 0.5 K. The introduction of superfluid 4He films and liquid 3He into the Vycor pores also results in the reduction of thermal conductivity. We propose a model suggesting the origin of the reduction is the presence of hydrodynamic slow sound modes in liquid 4He, as well as in superfluid 4He films and liquid 3He. The slow sound modes facilitate the quantum tunneling of two-level systems (TLS) in silica and dramatically increase the TLS-phonon scattering. The more modest reduction in solid helium-Vycor composite is caused by the presence of phonon excitations in solid helium which also facilitate TLS tunneling in silica.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8352], "author_name_tesi": "Cheng, Zhigang ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhigang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Moses Hung Wai Chan", "Jainendra Jain", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr.", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Moses Hung Wai Chan, Dissertation Advisor", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr., Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["helium", "heat capacity", "thermal conductivity", "porous media"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "DESIGN, FABRICATION, MODELING, AND EXPERIMENTAL TESTING OF A PIEZOELECTRIC FLEXTENSIONAL MICROACTUATOR", "id": "6580", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3153", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The necessity for reliable and low-cost microactuators capable of providing high resolution displacements and controlled force has been consistently being brought up because of their applications in RF and optical switches, microfluidic pumps and valves, micromanipulators for nanoscale handling and atomic force microscope drives. In this thesis, a piezoelectric flextensional microactuator is designed, fabricated, modeled, and tested for the amplification of the small piezoelectric strain to achieve large displacements. Bulk PZT material available in the form of 500 \u00a5\u00ecm thick polished substrate is integrated with a precision micromachined silicon beam structure to fabricate the clamped-clamped flextensional microactuator. A high strength, high precision, and low temperature (~200 \u00a1\u00c6C) In/Sn solder bonding process is developed and used to bond the PZT and the beam.  This process can also be used for the heterogeneous integration of various materials for MEMS fabrication as well as for their packaging. The experimentally measured static deflection characteristics of the silicon micromachined beam show a flextensional gain factor of 20 with a large amplitude stroke of ~8 \u00a5\u00ecm when actuated using -100 V to 100 V. The fabrication process produces devices with variable initial imperfection so a nonlinear model is developed to predict static and dynamic performance based on a polynomial curve fit of the initial shape. A static analysis of this model shows that for maximal actuator displacement, gain factor, and blocked force, the microactuator should have a thin beam structure and initial imperfection tuned to the maximum contraction provided by the PZT. For large PZT displacement, a perfect beam provides maximum gain factor but some imperfection is required to guarantee actuator movement in the desired (up or down) direction. For small PZT displacement, more initial imperfection improves performance. The theoretical model, based on the measured initial beam shape, predicts the experimentally measured direction and magnitude of beam displacement for three devices. The dynamic response of the microactuator results from buckling of the clamped beam in response to contraction of the bonded PZT support. Unlike previous research where sinusoidal initial beam shapes are analyzed, in this work the polynomial initial beam shape enables more accurate prediction of beam natural frequencies, frequency response, and time response when compared with experimental results. The inclusion of squeeze film damping between the beam and PZT support enables the model to predict response times. Experiments show that mounting the PZT with soft carbon tape limits PZT vibration.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3140], "author_name_tesi": "Cheong, Jongpil ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jongpil", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Md Amanul Haque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn, Committee Chair", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Chair", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Buckling", "PZT", "beam", "flextensional", "microactuator"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Three Essays in International Trade", "id": "11006", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2462", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "CHAPTER 1: The Great Russian Devaluation and Labor Demand\n\nDoes a greater degree of integration into world markets lead to a more elastic demand for labor? Often referred to as the Rodrik hypothesis, this question, despite being important from both theoretical and applied policy standpoints, is still not satisfactorily answered. Several studies that examine data for different countries, periods and aggregation levels, have failed to draw uniform conclusions. Likely reasons for this fact include poor and aggregated data, a lack of large enough shocks in tariffs, an inability to separate the effect of trade from that of other reforms, and the absence of rich sets of predictions from models. In this paper, I avoid these concerns by using a unique firm-level panel data set for several thousand manufacturing firms in Russia during a period of significant and rapid currency devaluation. This event made imports of final and intermediate goods more expensive while making Russian exports less expensive and acted like a tariff on imports and/or a subsidy on exports. In a simple, but yet revealing model, I specify the implications of a devaluation for the labor demand and derive a set of testable predictions. I then use the data and reduced form regressions to test the essence of these predictions and show that trade barriers affect labor demand elasticities. In particular, I find that a 25-30% drop in the conditional labor demand elasticity can be safely attributed to the devaluation.\n\nCHAPTER 2 (with Svetlana Demidova, Hiau Looi Kee and Kala Krishna): Firm Heterogeneity and Costly Trade: A New Estimation Strategy and Policy Experiments.\n\nThis paper models and estimates the responses of firms (who differ in their productivity and face firm and market specific demand shocks) to trade policies in different product and export destinations. The paper does three things. First, it builds a tractable partial equilibrium model in the spirit of Melitz (2003), which incorporates both of these dimensions of heterogeneity and is well-suited for empirical work. Second, it shows how to use this model to estimate the structural parameters of interest using only cross-sectional data. Third, it uses the model to perform counterfactual experiments regarding the effects of reducing costs, both fixed and marginal, or of trade preferences (with distortionary Rules of Origin) offered by an importing country. We find both have a catalytic effect which greatly increases exports to all markets. Our counterfactuals make a case for \"trade as aid,\" as such polices can create a win-win scenario for all parties concerned and are less subject to the usual worries regarding the efficacy of direct foreign aid.\n\nCHAPTER 3 (with Svetlana Demidova, Kala Krishna and Susumu Imai): The Inside Scoop: Acceptance and Rejection at the Journal of International Economics\u2019\n\nThere is little work on the inner workings of journals.

The public perceptions of racially biased policing are entirely focused on the behavior of police officers.  Thus, it is not surprising that negative perceptions of the police contributed to the push for official traffic stop data collection.  The limitation of this data collection has been to assume that the offending behavior of drivers that comes to the attention of police is equivalent across demographic groups, when little evidence exists to support this assumption.  Research on racially biased policing has less frequently examined whether driver\u2019s offending behavior has an impact on stopping behavior by police.  This neglect in previous work is particularly troublesome considering that most research on police behavior has found legally relevant offending behavior and offense severity to be among the strongest and most consistent predictors of various types of police actions.  \nBuilding on previous research that has documented demographic differences in travel patterns, illegal and risky driving behavior, the current study seeks to explore three research questions: 1) Does driving behavior vary by driver race, age, and gender?  2) Does severity of offending behavior vary based on demographic characteristics?  3) Do contextual level factors influence driving behavior?  The general hypothesis to be tested by the current study is that racial / demographic groups are not equivalent in the nature and extent of their traffic law violating behavior.  \nTo address these research questions, this study uses data collected for the Pennsylvania State Police Project on Police-Citizen Contacts during field observations of roadway usage and law-violating speeding behavior in 27 sampled counties across the state. Hierarchical multivariate models explore the influence on observed driving behavior of driver demographic characteristics, situational and contextual characteristics. Results indicate support for the hypotheses regarding the impact of driver demographic characteristics and contextual factors on driving behavior. These findings provide an alternative explanation for demographic disparities in police outcomes that is not based on officer bias, but rather legitimate offending differences.  The implications of these findings for future traffic stop research are also discussed. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2838], "author_name_tesi": "Cherkauskas, Jennifer Marie-Calnon", "last_name_ssi": "Cherkauskas", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie-Calnon", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Silver", "Eric Silver", "Robin Engel", "Richard B Felson", "Doris Layton Mackenzie", "Eric Plutzer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Silver, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Silver, Committee Chair", "Robin Engel, Committee Chair", "Richard B Felson, Committee Member", "Doris Layton Mackenzie, Committee Member", "Eric Plutzer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["speeding", "racial profiling", "benchmark data"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Role of Technology in Chinese Social Movements:  An Exploration of the Technological Communications Apparatus Used During the Tiananmen Incident of 1976, The 1989 Tiananmen Democracy Movement, and the 2011 Jasmine Revolution ", "id": "16127", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8263", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With recent events like the Arab Spring, London Riots and Occupy Wall Street, research regarding the use of new technologies and their impact on social movements has become increasingly more important to explore.

One of the important aspects of additive manufacturing is process planning, and there are many decisions that must be made in order to convert a CAD representation of a desired component into a finished part.  These include determining the build orientation, generating support structures for necessary areas, slicing the model into layers, and creating the toolpath that the machine will follow for each layer.  The interdependence of these tasks is complex, and traditional methods that only consider individual parameters can yield an inferior end result.  \n\nThis thesis develops a process planning module to select an optimal parameter set for the construction of a part using additive manufacturing.

The current procedures used by companies to determine parameter values are assessed, and a new three-stage approach is developed and validated.  This approach involves the identification of important parameters to the construction of the part, the creation of a test design to examine the relationship between these settings, and the analysis of multiple parameters simultaneously to determine optimal values.

One third of epilepsy patients do not respond to pharmaceutical treatments which leaves surgical removal of the seizure generation focus as the primary treatment option. This is still not viable for some individuals as it is impossible to localize the seizure focus. Furthermore, the removal of neural tissue is an irreversible process and the surgery is a high-risk procedure. \n\nSome form of epileptic seizure control with applied electrical stimulation have been demonstrated over the past decades. Specifically, proportional feedback control of polarizing low-frequency electric field (PLEF) stimulation has been shown to effectively suppress seizures in slice preparations. Research carried out in intact rodents and humans indicates that feedback control may be effective for electric control of seizures. This treatment option would be advantageous to patients whose epilepsy is drug-resistant, as the implantable electrodes are relatively small, can be removed, and the stimulation protocol can be tuned to maximize efficacy. One impediment to implementing feedback control is the existence of the stimulus artifact: a spurious, additive electric potential at the recording sites caused by the stimulus current. \n\nIn this thesis, we propose a prototype set of electronics for concurrent neural recording and stimulation. These consist of a head-mounted preamplifier, a PC-controlled amplifier bank, and an optically-isolated stimulator. The performance of these electronics permit the recording of the underlying neural activity and the complete stimulus artifact. Furthermore, we present the necessary signal processing techniques for the prediction of stimulus artifacts caused by an arbitrary stimulus waveform.

The agricultural sector uses only labor, the industrial sector needs an indivisible investment. Under autarky, productive agriculture provides the funds needed for investment in industry and in equilibrium credit constraints are not binding. If agriculture is not sufficiently productive, the price of the industrial good must be high enough to make the industrial sector sustainable. \nIn an open economy, if the country has the comparative advantage in agriculture, deindustrialization may occur over time. Deindustrialization is welfare reducing when the negative wealth distributional effects swamp the gains from trade.\nCHAPTER 2: Return Policies, Market Outcomes, and Consumer Welfare\nThe effect of return policies on market outcomes is studied in a model where consumers differ in their valuations of time. Product quality is identified with defect rates. Producers first choose quality and then compete in prices. For given defect rates, allowing returns makes products closer substitutes, enhancing competition and reducing prices. Being closer substitutes makes higher qualities less worthwhile, which reduces quality. While the decrease in quality reduces consumer welfare, the decrease in prices raises it. The latter dominates so that aggregate consumer welfare increases with return policy.\nCHAPTER 3: Skill Acquisition, Credit Constraints, and Trade\nThis essay analyzes the role of apprenticeships in overcoming credit constraints that limit the ability of agents to acquire skills. A general equilibrium model is used where the availability of skilled and unskilled labor is endogenously determined. Under the apprenticeship system, trainees can pay for their training by working at below market wages during their apprenticeship. Under the college system, payment must be made up front.\nIn the static model the response of supply to price depends on the number of skilled agents in the economy. If there are relatively many skilled agents, supply can be decreasing in price and multiple equilibria may exist. In steady state such non-monotonicity of supply obtains only in the presence of credit constraints. Finally, opening the economy up to trade could reduce welfare if a country imports the good whose relative price has risen due to trade.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6119], "author_name_tesi": "Chesnokova, Tatyana ", "last_name_ssi": "Chesnokova", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tatyana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kala Krishna", "Nezih Guner", "Tomas Sjostrom", "Abdullah Yavas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kala Krishna, Committee Chair", "Nezih Guner, Committee Member", "Tomas Sjostrom, Committee Member", "Abdullah Yavas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["credit constraints", "skill acquisition", "return policy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Foreign English Teachers in South Korea: Negotiating Bodies, Dress, Teacher Selves and Professionalism", "id": "p5547r367", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12907", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines the identities of individuals from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland who travel to South Korea and teach English as a foreign language.

Communication research focused on this relationship is in its infancy, and as such, there is much about the effects of communication patterns in the father-daughter relationship that remain unknown. This dissertation examines the antecedent and consequential correlates of convergence communication in the father-daughter relationship. Convergence communication is the central construct in the Necessary Convergence Communication theory, which is a theoretical framework designed to describe and explain how engaging in a specific, submissive interaction routine (i.e., convergence communication) can increase an individual\u2019s risk for experiencing suboptimal psychosocial development and functioning. In this dissertation, the antecedent correlates are hypothesized to be financial strain, authoritarian parenting, psychological control, and differentiation. The main psychosocial consequential correlate of interest is the self-concept, operationalized as global self-worth, job competence, social acceptance, romantic relationships, and satisfaction with appearance.\n\nThree hundred and eighteen emergent adult females participated in this dissertation study by completing an online survey that contained measures of all the constructs listed above. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data via a two-step procedure in which a measurement model is first constructed and evaluated before moving on to the structural model. The results of this analysis revealed the following: a) the factor structure of convergence communication did not hold, suggesting that the manner in which it is measured needs to be refined ; b) psychological control, differentiation, and two aspects of convergence communication (motivation to converge and disequilibrium) were highly correlated indicating they lacked discriminant validity and needed to be combined into a single latent variable (labeled controlling parenting strategies); c) global self-worth, job competence, and social acceptance were highly correlated indicating they lacked discriminant validity and needed to be combined into a single latent variable (labeled general self-worth); d) financial strain and authoritarian parenting were both positively related to controlling parenting strategies, which was positively related to interpersonal deference; e) convergence communication (operationalized as interpersonal deference) was not related to perceptions of general self-worth, competence in romantic relationships, or satisfaction with appearance; e) controlling parenting strategies was negatively related to general self-worth, competence in romantic relationships, and satisfaction with appearance. These results are discussed with respect to their implications for Necessary Convergence Communication theory, the father-daughter relationship, general aspects of measurement, and the field of family communication.

Progress in analytical methods enabling detection, characterization, and visualization of biological dynamics at the molecular level will advance our exploration of complex biological systems. In this dissertation, analytical platforms were fabricated to capture membrane-associated receptors, which are essential proteins in cell signaling pathways. The neurotransmitter serotonin and its biological precursor were immobilized on gold substrates coated with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of oligo(ethylene glycol)alkanethiols and their reactive derivatives. The SAM-coated substrates present the biologically selective affinity of immobilized molecules to target native membrane-associated receptors. These substrates were also tested for biospecificity using antibodies.\nIn addition, small-molecule-functionalized platforms, expressing neurotransmitter pharmacophores, were employed to examine kinetic interactions between G-protein-coupled receptors and their associated neurotransmitters. The binding interactions were monitored using a quartz crystal microbalance equipped with liquid-flow injection. The interaction kinetics of G-protein-coupled serotonin 1A receptor and 5 hydroxytyptophan functionalized surfaces were studied in a real-time, label-free environment. Key binding parameters, such as equilibrium dissociation constants, binding rate constants, and dissociative half-life, were extracted. These parameters are critical for understanding and comparing biomolecular interactions in modern biomedical research.\nBy integrating self-assembly, surface functionalization, and nanofabrication, small-molecule microarrays were created for high-throughput screening. A hybrid soft-lithography, called microcontact insertion printing, was used to pattern small molecules at the dilute scales necessary for highly selective biorecognition. By carefully tuning the polar surface energy of polymeric stamps, problems associated with patterning hydrophilic tether molecules inserted into hydrophilic preformed SAMs are surmounted. The patterned substrates presenting neurotransmitter precursors selectively capture membrane-associated receptors. These advances provide new avenues for fabricating small-molecule arrays.\nFurthermore, a novel strategy based on a conventional microcontact printing, called chemical lift-off lithography, was invented to overcome the micrometer-scale resolution limits of molecular ink diffusion in soft lithography. Self-assembled monolayers of hydroxyl terminated alkanethiols, preformed on gold substrates, were selectively removed by oxygen plasma treated polymeric stamps in a subtractive stamping process with high pattern fidelity. The covalent interactions formed at the stamp-substrate interface are believed to be responsible for removing not only alkanethiol molecules but also a monolayer of gold atoms from the substrates. A variety of high-resolution patterned features were fabricated, and stamps were cleaned and reused many times without feature deterioration. The remaining SAMs acted as resists for etching exposed gold features. Monolayer backfilling into lifted-off areas enabled patterned protein capture, and 40-nanometer chemical patterns were achieved.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8332], "author_name_tesi": "Cheunkar, Sarawut ", "last_name_ssi": "Cheunkar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sarawut", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss", "Anne M Andrews", "Christine Dolan Keating", "John B Asbury", "David John Vandenbergh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss, Dissertation Advisor", "Anne M Andrews, Dissertation Advisor", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Chair", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["self-assembled monolayers", "g-protein coupled receptors", "alkanethiols", "lithography", "and microcontact insertion printing"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Using recycled plastic composites to develop earthquake resilient housing for the region of Kutch, India", "id": "xk81jk36q", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12755", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of this thesis is to develop an earthquake resilient housing system, for the seismic region\nof Kutch, located in the state of Gujarat, along the western coast of India.

Drawing upon the hypothesis of induced innovation this research investigates whether spatial variations in climatic resource prompted the development of location-specific technologies that led to an increase rice productivity in Nepal.  Using the country\u2019s district level time-series data (1991/92 and 2002/03), I examine whether districts with comparatively lower initial rice productivity levels have increased their rates of production relatively faster than those with higher initial productivity.  Complementing this analysis with relevant case studies, I also investigate the extent to which Nepal\u2019s research establishments have provided farmers with technological options to alleviate climatic constraints in rice cultivation across the country\u2019s climatically diverse terrain.  \nI find that rice productivity has increased steadily across the districts of Nepal during the 12 year period and is not just skewed towards climatically favorable regions but is also observed in areas that are relatively marginal for rice production.  While the emerging patterns of productivity growth may have been the autonomous response to the increasing demand, it may also have been facilitated by conscious decisions to develop technologies that are location-specific.  I find that the research establishments in Nepal have developed technological innovations as a buffer against the deleterious effect of climatic risks.  The findings from both empirical and qualitative assessments indicate that Nepal\u2019s research establishment is engaged in and committed to the development of location-specific technologies that address the constraints of climate.  The outcome of such commitment has been a series of technological innovations such as development of drought resistant varieties, improved irrigation management and agronomic practices, and change in research and development policies.  Together, this may have been responsible for higher yields among districts with marginal climate, which have subsequently led to convergence of the rice productivity growth rate in the country.  If the current trend in limiting the deleterious effects of climate in agriculture through appropriate technological as well as institutional changes continues then the prospect of adapting to future climate is more plausible in Nepal.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4589], "author_name_tesi": "Chhetri, Netra Bahadur", "last_name_ssi": "Chhetri", "middle_name_ssi": "Bahadur", "first_name_ssi": "Netra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Ewart Easterling Iii", "Brenton Yarnal", "James Mc Carthy", "David Gerard Abler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Ewart Easterling Iii, Committee Chair", "Brenton Yarnal, Committee Member", "James Mc Carthy, Committee Member", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["agriculture", "climate change", "climate-technoligy interaction", "adaptation", "induced innovation", "Nepal"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "INVOLVEMENT IN SCHOOL SPONOSRED EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES: A CLOSER LOOK AT HISPANIC AMERICAN ADOLESCENTS\n", "id": "6939", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1137", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There are group differences in adolescents\u2019 rates of involvement in school sponsored extracurricular activities (SSEAs), with Hispanic American adolescents having the lowest levels of SSEA involvement.

Low and high amplitude tests were performed in series to observe the seismic performance of the bridge starting from yielding to complete failure. In the present study, recorded bridge acceleration during high amplitude tests is utilized and further analyzed to evaluate the degraded performance of the bridge after each high amplitude test. This is done by using extended Kalman filtering (EKF) technique as a tool.  The degraded performance of the bridge after each run is measured in terms of effective stiffness of the bridge at pier ends. In parallel, finite element (FE) model of the same bridge is developed in order to perform time history analysis under a set of earthquake ground motions with various hazard levels. Before applying the ground motions, the FE model is updated with the effective stiffness of the bridge obtained from EKF after each high amplitude test. This is important to numerically simulate the post-damaged condition of the bridge and to quantify the gradual progression of bridge damage when subjected to earthquake ground motions in sequence. After each time history analysis, bridge response is obtained in terms of the rotation at bridge pier ends. Thus obtained response from time history analyses is used for fragility curve development. The change in fragility parameters represents the progressive damage of the bridge when subjected to ground motions with incremental intensity.

In this dissertation, we use MP approaches, mainly relying on mixed-integer programming (MIP) modeling, to solve logistics problems in the following two areas: home healthcare (HHC) and truckload transportation procurement.\n    HHC is health or supportive care provided in the patient\u2019s home by healthcare professionals. Approximately 12 million individuals currently receive HHC services from more than 33,000 providers with over 1 million staff members. However, 65% of home care and hospice agencies are facing nurse staff vacancies and 84% of nurse staff worked overtime during last week at the interview time. To help improve efficiency of the HHC workforce and improve patient outcomes, we develop an operational dispatching (routing) model that assigns care workers to patients and\ndetermines the optimal visiting sequences and start times. An appointment scheduling decision support system is developed to handle the clients\u2019 appointment requests dynamically. The model allows the use of time windows and time-dependent travel speeds. We develop and compare heuristic approaches for solving this problem and conduct numerical experiments on different sized instances. According to the results, a hybrid algorithm based on genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization is further proposed.\n    In freight transportation service procurement, shippers sell service contracts to carriers based on negotiated transportation rates and service level by utilizing a competitive auction process. Recently, several large shippers and third-party-logistics (3PL) providers have turned to combinatorial auction mechanisms to reduce their transportation costs, where the bidding carriers can quote prices on packages in combination of individual lanes. We address the problem of truckload transportation\nprocurement via combinatorial auctions from two perspectives. i) a carrier perspective, where the goal is to develop an optimal bidding strategy based on the operation cost analysis (called bid generation), and ii) a shipper perspective, where the goal is to determine the allocation of lanes to carriers give a set of bids (called the winner determination problem). In the first case, we incorporate the bid generation model\nwith vehicle routing methods and stochastic optimization to determine an optimal bidding strategy for carriers. In the second case, we develop a multi-round combinatorial auction of transportation procurement by MIP. A real application to an agriculture and construction equipment company is also provided.

Among them, crystalline nanocellulose (CNC) is a rigid, highly crystalline, and rod-shaped nanomaterial that is typically extracted by concentrated acid hydrolysis. CNC exhibits unique characteristics (biocompatibility, large specific surface area, high aspect ratio, adaptable surface functionalization, high mechanical strength and light weight) and, therefore, can be a promising candidate for a broad array of applications ranging from reinforcing fillers for nanocomposites to rheology modifiers in personal care products or drilling fluids to barrier packaging films and tissue engineering scaffolds.\n\nSignificant research has been directed toward the production and characterization of CNC, its chemical functionalization and its incorporation into numerous composite materials. An understanding of the relationship between the nature of cellulose feedstocks (chemical composition, crystallinity, microfibril network and microstructure) and the properties (crystal structure, aspect ratio, morphology, surface chemistry, amphiphilicity and thermal stability) of CNCs produced from them remains virtually unexplored. Specifically, the formation and structure of amorphous cellulose within native ordered celluloses is still largely unknown. In this work, we used bacterial cellulose to explore the impact of polysaccharides on the structure of the formed cellulose and the properties of the CNCs produced from these modified cellulose feedstocks. Our results showed that by modulating both cellulose crystallization and bundling, new CNCs with improved properties could be obtained. A model was proposed that explained the relationship between the structure of cellulose and the resulting CNCs produced.\n\nThe emerging applications of CNC involve many aqueous composite systems such as paintings, coatings, pharmaceutical formulations, personal care products, and food delivery systems. It is critical to understand the binding interactions of CNC in the presence of polymers, surfactants, electrolytes and other colloidal particles as it can have a profound influence on the colloidal stability and functionality of CNC in these systems, as well as the bulk properties of these systems. Thus, we comprehensively examined the binding interactions between sulfated CNC and a biologically-derived cationic surfactant lauric arginate (LAE). Our results showed that their binding interactions were influenced by several reaction conditions (mixing ratio, pH and ionic strength). The underlying driving forces for the adsorption of the cationic surfactant to the anionic CNC were identified. More importantly, it was found that the surfactant could aggregate on the surface of CNC in various forms, which notably impacted the properties (surface potential, hydrophobicity, aggregation state and thermal stability) of the ensuing CNC.\n\nThe most cited application of CNC is its use as a nanoreinforcing additive in many polymer nanocomposites, which is critically dependent on its dispersibility and interface compatibility within the polymer matrices. However, the inherent hydrophilic characteristic of CNC has largely impeded its applications in non-polar media or polymers. Many surface modification strategies have been explored, but most employ chemistries that would not be acceptable from a health and safety or an environmental lifecycle standpoint. In the present study, we demonstrated a green, industrially scalable, and ecologically friendly surface functionalization of CNC using a novel biologically-derived cationic surfactant (LAE) and a simple water-based mixing procedure. The complete ionic binding of CNC sulfate groups enabled a surfactant monolayer tethered to CNC, which improved the hydrophobicity of modified CNC to the full potential. The as-obtained modified CNC exhibited notably improved dispersion and interface adhesion when incorporated into a hydrophobic polylactide (PLA) matrix. The crystallization rate (cold crystallization temperature decreased from 129 to 105 oC), crystallinity (increased from 3 to 14.2%), glass transition temperature (increased from 70.6 to 82 oC), storage moduli (increased from 2157 and 3 MPa at 20 and 90 oC, respectively, to 4262 and 266 MPa), and tensile properties (tensile strength and moduli) of resultant nanocomposite films were remarkably improved with appropriate loading level of modified CNC (<5 wt%).\n\nFurthermore, besides the traditional polymers (PLA, polyethylene, polystytene, etc.), natural polysaccharides form another important group of polymers. Oppositely charged natural polysaccharides in aqueous solutions can interact spontaneously to form polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs), which have been investigated biomedical and food packaging applications. However, the incorporation of CNC into such PEC system aiming to improve the mechanical and barrier properties of the resulting composite is scarcely reported. In this work, we demonstrated the first report on fabricating ternary polysaccharide polyelectrolyte complex (PPC) films consist of chitosan (CS), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and CNC. Oppositely charged CS and CMC electrostatically interacted with each other at the charge ratio of 1:1 and provided a dense interpercolating network structure that acted as the matrix for the PPC films. CNC was incorporated within the CS/CMC matrix and functioned as the reinforcing agent to improve the mechanical (tensile strength and modulus were enhanced by 40 and 52%, respectively, when incorporating 10 wt% CNC in the PPC film) and water vapor barrier properties (specific water vapor transmission rate decreased by 72% at 10 wt% CNC content) of the PPC films. PPC-CNC films exhibited homogeneous, compact morphological features and improved mechanical properties, ascribed to the even distribution and good interface compatibility of CNC within the CS/CMC matrix. It is expected that this novel PPC film can be a promising candidate as a barrier coating or film for food and other packaging applications. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15023], "author_name_tesi": "Chi, Kai ", "last_name_ssi": "Chi", "first_name_ssi": "Kai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Jeffrey M Catchmark", "Virendra Puri", "Jude Liu", "Gregory Ray Ziegler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey M Catchmark, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey M Catchmark, Committee Chair", "Virendra Puri, Committee Member", "Jude Liu, Committee Member", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Crystalline nanocellulose", "amorphous cellulose", "cationic surfactant", "biocomposite", "polyelectrolyte complex"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Geometrically constrained nanoscale materials", "id": "14962", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7598", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nano-materials are a main topic in condensed matter research because of unusual properties that originate from quantum mechanical effects at this length scale. In this thesis I consider nano-materials from a geometrical perspective. The atoms/molecules could be restricted topologically; their electronic interactions (reaction through charge transfer), however, are still allowed. The physical and chemical properties of materials under this restriction change dramatically. This dissertation is mainly devoted to the study of those changes in physical and chemical properties, based on first-principles computation techniques (Density Functional Theory). \n\nDFT is an ab-initio quantum mechanical computation method used for materials as well as molecules. It predicts stable molecular/crystal structures and describes a chemical reaction and phase transition. It also provides an understanding and quantitative prediction of materials properties, including mechanical, thermal, electrical, optical, magnetic, and chemical properties. In this thesis I mainly use DFT to examine the energetics and band structures of geometrically constrained nano-materials. A brief overview of Density Functional Theory is given in Ch.1. \n\nGraphene (a single layer membrane of carbon atoms) and hexagonal boron nitride, which as a similar structure to that of graphene are basic building blocks for all the work in this thesis. Ch.2 covers some basic structural and electronic properties of these materials. In Ch. 3, I extend that to graphene nanoribbons, finite-width stripes of graphene. \n\nIn Ch.4, I propose a topological frustrated system based on a graphene membrane. A suspended and impenetrable graphene layer breaks the translational symmetry in vacuum and divides it into two distinct sub-spaces. Imagine alkali atoms released above the layer and halogen from below. The layer prevents direct interaction between alkali and halogen as each species is restricted in its own half-space, so the formation of a regular salt crystal is forbidden. However, they could still interact via charge transfer through the sheet. The charge transfer from alkali breaks halogen molecular bonds and creates a cross-layer alkali/halogen dipole pair. This uncompensated collective dipolar interaction penalizes the halogen states and raises them to the Fermi level. It thus generates an unusual band-structure with nearly flat bands at Fermi level. A slight change in the halogen position causes the dramatic change in electronic structures (a semiconductor-semimetal-metal transition), leading to the breakdown of Born-Oppenheimer approximation and possibly to strong many-body effects (polaron, superconductivity...). The stable open-shell halogen also suggests a potential catalytic behavior by accommodating to a reactant transition state. This system defines a new regime of chemical interaction that is governed by a topological constraint. Viewed as surface physics, the properties of a given side can be tuned by changing the species on the opposite side.\n\nIn Ch.5, I replace the graphene by a hexagonal boron nitride membrane in the topological frustrated system. In contrast to the gapless graphene, the large bandgap of h-BN provides a wide energy window within which the adsorbate levels reside. The collective dipole-dipole interaction produces a giant Stark effect on the halogen and alkali-derived valence and conduction bands, resulting in a remarkable band gap tuning with areal adsorbate density. When the areal density of the adsorbates increases from 1 dipole pair per 5 by 5 BN unit cell to 1 dipole pair per 3 by 3 BN unit cell, the gap of the system can be varied -- in situ and reversibly -- by 2 electron volts. This variation in bandgap is very large when compared to other reversible, tunable bandgap systems. We could then have the flexibility in designing and controlling semiconductor devices, such as, transistor, photodiodes, p-n junctions and lasers. \n\nIn Ch.6, I demonstrate a new method of stabilizing sp2 terminated zig-zag graphene nanoribbons by introducing the concept of steric crowding effect, that is, when two atoms are too close to each other, there is a cost in energy due to the electron cloud overlap. The zig-zag edge of a graphene nanoribbon is predicted to support a spin-polarized edge state. However, this edge state only survives under a pure sp2 termination, and it is difficult to produce thermodynamic conditions that favor a pure sp2 termination of a graphene edge, since the edge carbons generally prefer to bond to two hydrogen atoms, in sp3 hybridization, rather than one hydrogen, as sp2. We describe how to use the steric effects of large, bulky ligands to modify the thermodynamics of edge termination and favor the sp2 edge. Ab-initio calculations demonstrate that alternative terminations such as methyl and tert-butyl can support robust edge states across a broad range of thermodynamic conditions.\n\nIn Ch.7, I propose a new method to tune the bandgap of mixed sp3/sp2 terminated zig-zag graphene nanoribbon. When one or more zig-zag ribbon edge atoms are sp3 terminated, a bandgap opens. DFT calculation shows that if the sp3 termination density along the edge varies, the bandgap also changes. The density of sp3 terminated edge atoms is determined by the chemical potential of terminating ligands. Furthermore, the bandgap also changes with respect to the ribbon width. So by controlling the chemical potential of ligands and the ribbon width, we could have a tunable bandgap system. \n\nIn Ch.8, I propose some possible future works that are related to current research. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7533], "author_name_tesi": "Chia, Cheng Ing", "last_name_ssi": "Chia", "middle_name_ssi": "Ing", "first_name_ssi": "Cheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Jun Zhu", "Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi, Dissertation Advisor", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Jun Zhu, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DFT", "graphene", "topological frustration", "nanoribbon"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "HOW DO COWORKERS MATTER? \nEXAMINING INFLUENCES ON PEERS\u2019 ROLE DEFINITIONS, ATTITUDES, OCBs, AND PERFORMANCE\n\n", "id": "9834", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1564", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I examined how coworker actions, conceptualized based on their content (affective and instrumental) and valence (positive and negative), influence their peers\u2019 role perceptions, attitudes and intentions, and behavioral outcomes.

Several models have been developed to describe the movement of the motors; however, one of the common assumptions has been that motors move in an unbounded solution.  While results exist for colloidal particles undergoing applied-field electrokinetics near a wall, there are no calculated results for auto-electrokinetic motion near a wall.  This led us to examine how a bounding wall affects the speed of colloidal motors.\n  With our modeling approach, localized electroosmotic (LEO) flows are shown to exist when motors approach the wall closely.  Unlike a continuous flow caused by an applied electric field, the LEO flow induced by spherical colloidal motors exists primarily on the charged wall below the motor, ranging within one particle diameter away from the motor.  For motors moving near a wall with the same sign of zeta potential as the motor, LEO manifests itself by slowing down the particle, which is consistent with experimental observations.  In addition, we examine a different driving force for flows due to dissolving minerals, deriving a general expression for diffusioosmotic flows caused by a concentration gradient involving multiple ions of different valences.\n  With flows driven by self-generated fields, we apply them to geometries that would not allow flows by the conventional pressure-driven mechanism \u2013 a dead-end pore.  We show that Transient Diffusioosmotic Flows (TDOFs) can be created in a dead-end capillary with a time-dependent and spatially-nonuniform salt gradient.  TDOFs can drive transport through the dead-end capillary, and by manipulating the surface potentials, we can even cause exchange of materials.  This provides a new path in driving flows in bounded geometries.  Furthermore, while the small size of the tube makes it hard to create pressure-driven flows in a microchannel, flows driven by self-generated fields could be a more efficient way to create flows in narrow channels and tight pores.\n  This dissertation comprises many research fields including: electrokinetics (electrophoresis and diffusiophoresis), diffusion, electromigration, colloidal forces, and catalyst chemistry.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9553], "author_name_tesi": "Chiang, Tso-yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Chiang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tso-yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell Velegol", "Ali Borhan", "Themis Matsoukas", "Ayusman Sen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell Velegol, Dissertation Advisor", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["colloidal motor", "electrophoresis", "diffusiophoresis", "particle-surface interactions"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Taiwan's Ban on Corporal Punishment- Teachers' Perceptions of Impact and Meanings\n", "id": "9808", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6822", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Corporal punishment was long used in Taiwanese schools as an informal disciplinary tool for improving students\u2019 academic performance as well as for disciplinary violations. Based on thirty-five interviews and three school activity observations across a nationwide sample of junior high teachers and schools, this study examines the impact of Taiwan's 2006 legislative ban on corporal punishment in the educational system. Its purpose is to understand educators\u2019 perceptions of discipline and corporal punishment, current disciplinary practices and problems, and why the practice persists, particularly in junior high schools. \nFive main themes emerged in this study. First, corporal punishment is a strong traditional informal norm of teaching in Taiwan. Spanking or corporal punishment had been a \u201cnormalized\u201d classroom tool \u2013a fairly reliable non-complex response to the highly complex problem of pupil motivation and control.\nThe second theme involves opposition to the ban and continued cautious use of corporal punishment. While most teachers adhere to the ban, with respect to harsher forms of corporal punishment, many continue to view its milder form as a practical tool for pupil control and motivation. \nThe third theme involves support for or indifference to the ban. At the time of the interviews, two thirds of the subjects expressed either supportive or neutral opinions. They either believed in its philosophy or had simply adapted to the ban. As for those teachers with feelings of indifference, they continued their former practices, either using or not using corporal punishment. To them, in the words of one interviewee, this ban was imposed \u201csimply to make some people feel relieved.\u201d \nThe fourth theme is uncertainty. Whether they were opposed to or supported the ban, interviewees generally expressed perceptions of uncertainty, insecurity, or inability to discipline students under the new law. They complained that they only received \u201cformal directives\u201d or \u201cunrealistic guidelines,\u201d rather than practical strategies or advice from the school officials or the Ministry of Education. \nThe last theme involves the shift toward more humanistic forms of pupil control. The changes include viewing students as having individual educational and social needs, a decrease in punishing students for poor academic performance, and using more positive disciplinary strategies. Though corporal punishment is still used, it is much less frequent and abusive than before.  \nThe principle that students should not be physically punished by teachers has become a prevailing perspective within a global educational environment. But at the same time, Taiwanese schools must operate and maintain legitimacy within local environments, which serve as a conservative check on global influences. Therefore, using both a functional and institutional framework, this study explores how the conflict between global and local values may complicate school reform efforts.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6819], "author_name_tesi": "Chiang, Yi-Ching ", "last_name_ssi": "Chiang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi-Ching", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger C Shouse", "Roger C Shouse", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger C Shouse, Dissertation Advisor", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Chair", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["corporal punishment", "school discipline"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Identification of Endogenous Modulators for the Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor\n", "id": "8032", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1217", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor capable of being regulated by a structurally diverse array of chemicals ranging from environmental carcinogens to dietary metabolites.  A member of the basic helix-loop-helix/ Per-Arnt-Sim (bHLH-PAS) super-family of DNA binding regulatory proteins, the AhR is an important developmental regulator that can be detected in nearly all mammalian tissues.   Prior to ligand activation, the AhR resides in the cytosol as part of an inactive oligomeric protein complex comprised of the AhR ligand-binding subunit, a dimer of the 90 kDa heat shock protein, and a single molecule each of the immunophilin like X-associated protein 2 (XAP2) and p23 proteins.  Functioning as chemosensor, the AhR responds to both endobiotic and xenobiotic derived chemical ligands by ultimately directing the expression of metabolically important target genes.  Primarily responsible for mediating the toxicological and biological effects of dioxin and other environmentally persistent carcinogens, the AhR was originally characterized for its role in orchestrating the adaptive metabolic response to xenobiotic compounds.  Recently, however, the AhR has been identified as performing a critical role in a number of physiologically important life functions, including proper embryonic and liver development, immune system homeostasis, resolution of fetal vasculature, and maintenance of normal cardiac physiology.  Currently, the most potent AhR agonists to be identified are of synthetic origin, yet an increasing number of natural compounds have been shown to activate the receptor.  Although essential roles for the AhR in normal cellular biology have already been established and continue to evolve, no high affinity physiologically relevant endogenous ligand has been identified.  Therefore, the ultimate goal of this research project was to identify such ligands.  The initial data presented in this thesis confirms the presence of a putative endogenous ligand(s) for the AhR in the CV-1 cell line, while demonstrating the existence of an AhR regulated feedback mechanism functioning to control putative endogenous ligand levels.  Derived from the kidney epithelium of the African green monkey, the CV-1 cell line is an immortalized cell culture line exhibiting minimal AhR expression.  Consequentially, the level of AhR-regulated cytochrome P450 metabolism is also compromised allowing for subsequent accumulation of cellular metabolites, including potential intracellular endogenous ligands for the AhR.  However, the ectopic expression of AhR-regulated cytochrome P450s from the 1A or 1B families effectively reduced the high level of constitutive AhR activity observed in CV-1 cells.  Meanwhile cytochrome P450 2E1, an isoform not regulated by AhR, exhibited no significant effect.  Furthermore, extracts of lung tissue prepared from Ahr-null mice clearly revealed, by the increased AhR activation potential compared to \u201cwild-type\u201d mice, the accumulation of an endogenous ligand for the AhR.  Coupled with the high level of AhR-dependent CYP1A1 constitutive activity normally seen in lung, these observations support the existence, at least in mouse lung tissue, of an auto-regulatory loop between the AhR and CYP1A1 functioning to modulate endogenous ligand levels.  Presented in subsequent chapters are results identifying and characterizing the ability of several eicosanoid molecules to activate AhR signaling.  For instance, 12(R)-hydroxy- 5(Z),8(Z),10(E),14(Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (12(R)-HETE) and 5(S), 12(R)-dihydroxy-6(E),8(E),10(E),14(Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (6-trans-LTB4), two potent pro-inflammatory metabolites of arachidonic acid, were discovered as indirect activators of the AhR, capable of activating AhR signaling, but failing to bind of the receptor.  Surprisingly, other structurally similar isomers, such as 12(S)-HETE and LTB4 respectively, did not activate AhR signaling.  In addition, the 5,6- and 14,15- positional isomers of leukotriene A4 (LTA4) along with various dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (DiHETE) metabolites were also identified as potent activators of the AhR.  Furthermore, conclusive evidence is presented demonstrating that 5,6-DiHETE isomers, cellular metabolites of 5,6-LTA4, can serve as endogenous ligands for the AhR, capable of directly binding and transforming the receptor to its DNA binding form.  Although several of these eicosanoid molecules function as direct ligands for the receptor, others appear to activate the AhR through an indirect mechanism.

A lot of times, there is no reliable way to measure some of the reservoir parameters required to build the model. This leads to gross approximation of these properties over the whole reservoir.  Often these parameters are adjusted and readjusted until a good history match is obtained. Once a good history match is obtained, greater confidence can be placed on predictions made by the model.\nThe most common method of history matching is to make numerous simulation runs with each run using a different set of model parameters. The model parameters are varied in small steps in a trial-and-error fashion between each run until the observed production data matches with simulation model production data. This process is computationally intensive and time consuming. The number of simulation runs required to obtain a good history match also depends on the initial estimates of the parameters.\nIn this study, artificial neural networks are used to build a neuro-simulation tool for predicting properties like porosity, permeability, net pay thickness and two-phase relative permeability curves. Network uses cumulative production and pressure data as input to predict the history match parameters. Predictions made by the tool developed will give a good history match or the least serve as a good starting point to perform history match. The main advantage of using this tool is that the tool will not require an initial guess value for the parameters. This will remove the guess work involved in estimating some of the unknown parameters. The proposed artificial neural network will also reduce the actual number of simulation runs required to obtain a good history match when good estimate of model parameters are not available. The parameters predicted should provide a good history match or the least serve as good estimate for parameters that can be fine tuned to improve history match.\nA commercial reservoir simulator was used to generate synthetic data necessary to train and validate the artificial neural network. The neural network developed can be used to predict reservoir properties of black oil reservoirs. Two separate networks were developed. A prediction network that will predict reservoir properties and the other, a network designer, that will provide design parameters required to build the prediction network.\nThe results of this study show that the prediction network as designed by the network designer is capable of predicting reservoir parameters within acceptable margins of error. It will also considerably reduce the number of simulation runs required to achieve a good history match, thus reducing the computational resources and time required for history matching process.\nThe developed tool was implemented to real field data from Perry reservoir located in Brayton Fields, west of Corpus Christi, Texas. Neuro-simulation tool was able to obtain a good history match with field production data. With just 50 simulation runs made to generate the training data for the network, it was able to predict the properties of the reservoir without any need for an initial estimate of the parameters.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4943], "author_name_tesi": "Chidambaram, Prasanna ", "last_name_ssi": "Chidambaram", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Prasanna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Turgay Ertekin", "Michael Adebola Adewumi", "Robert W Watson", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Chair", "Michael Adebola Adewumi, Committee Member", "Robert W Watson, Committee Member", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Artificial neural network", "History matching"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Pushing the power and performance envelope of Next-generation Handheld platforms", "id": "27442", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12019", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Today\u2019s handhelds have grown in sophistication to run demanding applications. With the number of wearables and IoTs expanding, the tablets and smartphones are proposed to be used as their compute hubs. This places high compute demand and significant energy drain on these handhelds. In such a landscape, the consumers expectations are antithetical \u2013 needing the highest performance delivered all the time along with a long battery runtime all through a modest Li-ion battery on device!\nTo provide higher performance and lower energy consumption, vendors have resorted to the use of hardware accelerators. In current generation handhelds, many applications (especially multimedia apps) rely heavily on multiple accelerators. In spite of these efforts from the vendors, full fledged support for multiple concurrent applications have been futile as they are unable to meet the consumer\u2019s power-performance expectations. The main motivation of this dissertation is to propose techniques to push the performance boundaries by alleviating the bottlenecks and to efficiently make use of the power envelope when multiple accelerators are involved. It consists of four main components.\nThe first part of the dissertation presents GemDroid, a comprehensive simulation infrastructure to study SoC architectures. Currently, this is one of the first publicly available tool to conduct a holistic evaluation of mobile platforms consisting of cores, IPs and system software.\nAs the second part, the dissertation analyzes a spectrum of applications with GemDroid, and observes that the memory subsystem is a vital cog in the mobile platform because, it needs to handle both core and IP traffic, which have very different characteristics. Consequently, a heterogeneous memory controller (HMC) design is presented, where the memory is physically divided into two address regions, where the first region with one memory controller (MC) handles core-specific application data and the second region with another MC handles all IP related data.\n\nIn the third part, the dissertation focuses on improving system throughput by short- circuiting the memory traffic and enabling multiple-applications to run concurrently by virtualizing the data paths. Through measurements on a current generation tablet, it shows that the frequent invocation of the CPU for processing applications frames and the involvement of main memory as a data flow conduit, are serious limitations. Instead, the dissertation proposes a novel IP virtualization framework (VIP), involving three key ideas that allow several IPs to be chained together and made to appear to the software as a single device. Firstly, chaining of IPs avoids data transfer through the memory system, enhancing the throughput of flows through the IPs. Secondly, by using a burst-mode, the CPU can initiate the processing of several frames through the virtual IP chain, without getting involved and interrupted for each frame, thereby allowing better energy saving and utilization opportunities. Third, the dissertation also makes a case for supporting multiple applications through the creation on several virtual paths \u2013 one for each flow, and hardware scheduling is used to enforce QoS guarantees despite any contention for resources along the way.\nAs the final part, the dissertation strives to address the most critical and a daunting task - efficient energy management in handheld platforms. With the growing number of accelerators, memory demands are increasing and high computing capacities are required to support applications with stringent QoS needs. Current DVFS techniques that modulate power states of a single hardware component, or even recent proposals that manage multiple components, can lose out opportunities for attaining high energy efficiencies that may be possible by leveraging application domain knowledge. Thus, this dissertation proposes a coordinated multi-component energy optimization mechanism for handheld devices, where the energy profile of different components such as CPU, memory, GPU and IP cores are considered in unison to trigger the appropriate DVFS state by exploiting the application domain knowledge. Specifically, it shows that for the important class of frame-based applications, the domain knowledge - frame processing rates, component utilization and available slack - can be used to decide effective DVFS states for each component from among the numerous choices.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11451], "author_name_tesi": "Chidambaram Nachiappan, Nachiappan ", "last_name_ssi": "Chidambaram Nachiappan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nachiappan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das", "Dr Mahmut Kandemir", "Anand Sivasubramaniam", "Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das, Committee Chair", "Dr Mahmut Kandemir, Dissertation Advisor", "Anand Sivasubramaniam, Committee Member", "Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["SoC platforms", "mobile", "handheld", "performance", "energy", "power", "architecture", "system design", "virtualization", "IP chaining"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on Demand for Organic Milk in the U.S., Environment and Economic Growth in Japan, and Life Expectancy at Birth and Socio-Economic Factors in Japan\n\n\n", "id": "9020", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4402", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of three separate empirical essays on: 1) Censored demand system estimation and analysis for U.S. organic milk; 2) A multilevel modeling approach to examine the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis using SO2 and NOx concentration data in Japan; and 3) A study on life expectancy at birth in Japan between 1955 and 2005 using a dynamic panel data approach. The abstract of each essay is described below.\n\n[Essay One] Organic dairy sales have been growing rapidly in the past decade. Within the organic dairy category, organic milk has had the largest share of sales. Against the backdrop of such a rapid growth, the first essay empirically examines consumer behavior toward organic milk in 2004 and 2005 by using consumer purchase data collected by ACNielsen. Two empirical problems caused by the data (missing price information for non-purchasing households, and extreme censoring) are overcome in this study. As for missing price data, I systematically match consumers by the stores at which they shop, and transfer price data from a purchasing household to a non-purchasing household. The second empirical problem (censoring) is addressed by using a censored demand system. The zero expenditure shares are accounted for by estimating a translog demand system with a Quasi-Maximum Likelihood method. The compensated own-price elasticities show that organic milk is more sensitive than non-organic milk to own-price changes. Cross-price elasticities indicate that organic milk purchases increase when non-organic milk price rises. Yet, the reverse is not true. With respect to the impacts of demographic factors, household income does not significantly affect organic milk purchases. Actually, lower income households are estimated to have larger expenditure shares on organic milk than higher income households. Households with a female head and non-white households have less expenditure shares on organic milk compared to their counterparts.    \n\n[Essay Two] The hypothesis of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) has been studied and examined theoretically and empirically by many researchers since the 1990s. Fewer studies have looked at an EKC relationship within a country, and to my knowledge, no studies have looked at the impacts of different political units on environmental pressures in one country. Therefore, the purpose of the second essay is to investigate the empirical relationship between environmental pressure and income in Japan by looking at municipal level SO2 and NOx concentration data and income data at both the prefecture and national levels using a multilevel modeling approach. By incorporating municipal and prefecture-specific effects into the model (the random intercept model), I find an inverted U-shaped (EKC) relationship at the prefecture level only for SO2 concentrations. However, after allowing the slope of prefectural income to vary among prefectures (the random coefficient model), I find no evidence for an EKC. Similarly, with respect to NOx, I find an EKC at prefecture level when I adopt the random intercept model for both the whole dataset and non-roadside station data. Yet the random coefficient models do not show an EKC relationship for both datasets. The roadside station data do not show significant associations between prefecture income per capita and NOx concentrations in any models. As for the relationship between national GDP per capita and NOx concentration, the roadside station data show upward sloping curves while the non-roadside station data show downward sloping curves.\n\n[Essay Three] Japanese life expectancy at birth has increased dramatically, particularly since the end of the Second World War, and is now one of the highest levels in the world. Backed by such a rapid growth, the third essay empirically examines the major determinants of Japanese longevity using prefecture-level data at five-year intervals on life expectancy at birth for males and females, and health and socio-economic factors between 1955 and 2005. This study uses a dynamic panel data model, which allows us to take into account the dynamic nature of adjustment and also to control for serial correlation, which can otherwise cause inconsistency in the estimates. More specifically, I use both the Arellano and Bond estimator and the system GMM estimator. As far as I am aware, this paper is the first to employ a dynamic panel data model in this field. The results show that income is positively related to life expectancy at birth for males and females from 1955 to 1980, but the association between these two variables disappears for the period from 1980 to 2005. The percentage of the population living in rural areas adversely affects life expectancy for males in the period between 1955 and 1980, while it positively affects life expectancy for females in the latter period (1980 to 2005). College education is positively related to life expectancy for both males and females only during the higher life expectancy period (1980 to 2005), but has no effect during the lower life expectancy period (1955 to 1980). \n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4372], "author_name_tesi": "Chikasada, Mitsuko ", "last_name_ssi": "Chikasada", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mitsuko", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics and Demography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Jaenicke", "Edward C Jaenicke", "David Gerard Abler", "James Samuel Shortle", "Robert Schoen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Jaenicke, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Chair", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Chair", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Member", "Robert Schoen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Japan", "EKC", "demand", "longevity", "organic milk"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Microbial ecology of mushroom casing soils and preharvest strategies to enhance safety and quality of fresh mushrooms", "id": "6923", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4760", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-01-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Agaricus bisporus mushrooms of good quality immediately after harvest normally develop brown blotches at retail, even while kept at refrigeration temperatures.  The brown blotch discoloration, caused due to high bacterial populations, diminishes the quality and value of the product.  Food safety is another significant issue of concern to the mushrooms industry.  In August 2003, the Georgia Dept. of Agriculture recalled a brand of \u00a1\u00b0ready-to-eat\u00a1\u00b1 mushrooms grown in Pennsylvania for testing positive for Listeria monocytogenes.  Prior to that incident, in 2001, a health alert was issued by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) after Salmonella Kedougou was detected on mushrooms.1,2  These recent incidents and several anecdotal reports within the mushroom industry of the presence of Listeria sp. in mushroom casing soils have been an impetus to develop preharvest Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) programs at the mushroom farm level.  \n\nThe first goal of this research was to evaluate crop irrigation with modified acidic electrolyzed oxidizing water, < 1% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 0.3% calcium chloride (CaCl2), and casing soil pasteurization as preharvest cultural practices to reduce bacterial populations on fresh mushrooms and enhance quality.  The cultural practices were also evaluated for crop yield.  Crops were grown using commercial mushroom growing practices except for the treatments to the irrigation water or casing layer.  Mushrooms were aseptically sampled from the production beds for enumerating microbial populations by standard microbiological plating procedures.  Whiteness (L-value) and color (delta E) following harvest and postharvest storage were measured using a Minolta Chromameter.  Mushrooms were separated by treatment and weighed to determine yield.  \nPreliminary studies indicated that 0.5% H2O2 in irrigation water reduced symptoms of brown blotch in mushrooms during postharvest storage.  Further studies evaluated 0.75% H2O2 and/or 0.3% CaCl2 in irrigation water to reduce bacterial populations.  Mushrooms irrigated with water (control) had ca. 7.3 log CFU of aerobic bacterial populations per gram of fresh mushroom tissue.  Compared to the control, irrigation with 0.75% H2O2 and 0.3% CaCl2 reduced the bacterial populations on fresh mushrooms by 87% to 6.4 log CFU/g.  The irrigation treatment significantly enhanced mushroom whiteness following harvest as well as 6-days of postharvest storage at 12\u00a8\u00acC, and had no significant effect on crop yields.  \nUnpasteurized casing soil prior to irrigation contained 5.9 log CFU/gm of aerobic bacterial populations.  Pasteurization of the casing soil resulted in a 2.9 log reduction in aerobic bacterial population numbers (reducing the total aerobic bacterial population from 5.9 to 3 log CFU/gm of casing soil (wet wt.).  However, the aerobic bacterial population increased by 3.9 log (from 3 log to 6.9 log CFU/gm) following irrigation and holding for 1 week at 17\u00a8\u00acC.  The aerobic bacterial population of unpasteurized casing soil increased by 1.4 log CFU/gm following irrigation and holding for 1 week (from 5.9 log to 7.3 log).  There was no significant difference in bacterial numbers in mushrooms grown using either unpasteurized or pasteurized casing soil.  However, mushrooms grown on pasteurized casing soil had better postharvest quality.  Crop yield decreased by 11.0% when mushrooms were grown using pasteurized casing soil.  While casing soil pasteurization demonstrated potential to enhance mushroom quality, the technology was not optimized for commercial recommendations due to food safety factors discussed below.\n\nThe second goal of this research was to determine the survival and/or growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella sp. in whole and sliced mushrooms during postharvest storage at 12\u00a8\u00acC.  The slicing operation was conducted following inoculation of the foodborne pathogens over the mushroom cap surface.  Inoculated and packaged mushroom were stored at 12\u00a1\u00c6C and 75-85% relative humidity.  Mushroom packages were removed over the shelf-life period to enumerate populations of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella sp.  Whole mushrooms did not significantly support the growth of L. monocytogenes or Salmonella sp.  However, slicing mushrooms significantly promoted the growth of the pathogens.  Populations of L. monocytogenes in unwashed sliced mushrooms rapidly increased from 4 log CFU/gm to 6.8 log CFU/gm during 5 days of postharvest storage at 12\u00a8\u00acC.  Populations of Salmonella sp. in unwashed sliced mushrooms increased from 4.47 log CFU/gm to 6.7 log CFU/gm during 5 days of postharvest storage at 12\u00a8\u00acC.\n\nThe third goal of this research was to understand the microbial ecology of the casing soil, determine the survival of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella sp. in casing soils, and study the influence of indigenous culturable casing soil microflora on the survival of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella sp.  Because mushrooms are in close proximity to the casing soil and, in fact, often adhere to the mushroom surface at retail display, there are new demands from buyers for growers to implement food safety control measures for casing soils.  A recommendation to implement a control measure for casing soils has been reserved since the microbial ecology of the casing soil and its influence on the survival of foodborne pathogens is currently not known.  \nFreshly prepared casing soil samples were used to isolate pure cultures of indigenous microflora.  Batches of casing soil were either untreated or autoclaved at 121\u00a8\u00acC for 90 min to destroy populations of indigenous casing microflora.  The casing soils were inoculated with L. monocytogenes and/or Salmonella sp., maintained under simulated mushroom-growing conditions (80% moisture, 22\u00a1\u00c6C), and periodically sampled for enumerating populations of the foodborne pathogens.  To determine the influence of soil biotic factors on food safety, pure cultures of indigenous microflora were re-introduced into sterile casing soil, allowed to establish, and challenged with the foodborne pathogens.  Indigenous culturable casing soil microflora comprised predominantly of the Pseudomonas and Pantoea bacterial genera, the Streptomyces genera from the actinomycetes, the Penicillium fungal genera, and a high population of native yeast.  Inoculated population levels of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella sp. remained largely unchanged in autoclaved casing soil over a period of even upto 8 weeks.  However, the foodborne pathogens were rapidly destroyed in untreated casing soil.  A 4 log reduction in populations of L. monocytogenes occurred within 10 days of introduction into the casing soil.  The presence of Penicillium sp. and Streptomyces sp. in sterile casing soil inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella sp.  Penicillium chrysogenum, indigenous to casing soil, produced the \u00a5\u00e2-lactam class of antibiotic molecule in a casing soil broth system.  The studies demonstrate that unpasteurized casing soils do not support the survival or growth of L. monocytogenes or Salmonella sp.  The extended survival of the foodborne pathogens in casing soil with no background microflora emphasizes the importance of a viable and robust casing soil microflora.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4725], "author_name_tesi": "Chikthimmah, Naveen ", "last_name_ssi": "Chikthimmah", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Naveen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Bruce Beelman", "Luke F Laborde", "Hassan Gourama", "David Meigs Beyer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Bruce Beelman, Committee Chair", "Luke F Laborde, Committee Chair", "Hassan Gourama, Committee Member", "David Meigs Beyer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["food microbiology", "food safety", "mushrooms", "Agaricus", "Listeria monocytogenes", "peat", "casing layer"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The P2X7-Pannexin Complex is Involved in Plasmodium falciparum Merozoite Egress from Erythrocytes", "id": "23492", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10268", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The malaria parasite is a devastating pathogen, killing nearly a million people annually.

To do so, a guiding framework is developed utilizing conceptual models from theories of social capital, social disorganization, and prevention science.  The sample includes all 28 sites of the PROSPER project in Iowa and Pennsylvania.  \n\nCommunity risk and resource measures were derived from several different archival sources, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies, and interviews of key community members.  Five domains of community risk (economic risk, crime, substance risk, district academic risk, and school problems) and four domains of community resources (collective efficacy, school proactive, the density of youth serving organizations, availability of structured activities) were assessed.  In addition, GIS was utilized to assess the additive value of the individual youth\u2019s proximal experience of various community risks and resources in predicting their individual problem behaviors.\n\nOutcome measures were derived from survey measures given to students in the spring of their eighth grade year.

Use of guided waves for this purpose is a promising option but appropriate selection of guided wave modes for the generation of cumulative higher harmonics is of critical importance due to the multi-mode nature of ultrasonic guided waves. \nThis thesis deals with the problem of generating non-linear guided waves in plates from a theoretical perspective. A theoretical framework to predict the higher harmonic guided wave generation in plates has been developed. Geometric and material non-linearities are incorporated by using the Lagrangian strain (non-linearized strain) and higher order terms in the strain energy function. A new formulation in terms of the displacement gradient has been developed for the present problem. A perturbation technique and normal mode expansion have been used to solve the problem and arrive at the conditions of \u201cinternal resonance\u201d which are sufficient for the generation of cumulative second harmonics. A comprehensive analysis as to which guided wave modes have the capability to generate cumulative second harmonic guided waves has been performed. This is extended to predict the non-linear interaction of guided waves in plates that can be used to predict any higher harmonic generation in plate. \nThe analysis led to the conclusion that Shear Horizontal and Rayleigh Lamb modes can generate only Rayleigh Lamb symmetric modes as second harmonics with single primary mode excitation. Specific modes that satisfy the condition of internal resonance have been identified. The analysis on generalized interaction of guided wave modes led to a more complete understanding of the higher harmonic guided waves in plates. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7120], "author_name_tesi": "Chillara, Vamshi Krishna", "last_name_ssi": "Chillara", "middle_name_ssi": "Krishna", "first_name_ssi": "Vamshi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Higher harmonics", "non-linear elastic", "guided waves"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Towards improved Nde and Shm methodologies incorporating nonlinear structural features", "id": "26354", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11813", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ultrasound is widely employed in Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) applications to detect and characterize damage/defects in materials. In particular, ultrasonic guided waves are considered a foremost candidate for in-situ monitoring applications. Conventional ultrasonic techniques rely on changes/discontinuities in linear elastic material properties, namely the Young's modulus and shear modulus to detect damage. On the other hand, nonlinear ultrasonic techniques that rely on micro-scale nonlinear material/structural behavior are proven to be sensitive to damage induced microstructural changes that precede macro-scale damage and are hence capable of early damage detection. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the capabilities of nonlinear guided waves --- a fusion of nonlinear ultrasonic techniques with the guided wave methodologies for early damage detection. To that end, the thesis focuses on two important aspects of the problem:\n\nWavemechanics - deals with ultrasonic guided wave propagation in nonlinear waveguides;\n\nMicromechanics - deals with correlating ultrasonic response with micro-scale nonlinear material behavior.\n\nFor the development of efficient NDE and SHM methodologies that incorporate nonlinear structural features, a detailed understanding of the above aspects is indispensable. \n\nIn this thesis, the wavemechanics aspect of the problem is dealt with from both theoretical and numerical standpoints. A generalized theoretical framework is developed to study higher harmonic guided waves in plates. This was employed to study second harmonic guided waves in pipes using a large-radius asymptotic approximation. Second harmonic guided waves in plates are studied from a numerical standpoint. Theoretical predictions are validated and some key aspects of higher harmonic generation in waveguides are outlined. Finally, second harmonic guided waves in plates with inhomogeneous and localized nonlinearities are studied and some important aspects of guided wave mode selection are addressed.\n\nThe other part of the work focused on developing a micromechanics based understanding of ultrasonic higher harmonic generation. Three important aspects of micro-scale material behavior, namely tension-compression asymmetry, shear-normal coupling and deformation induced asymmetry are identified and their role in ultrasonic higher harmonic generation is discussed. Tension-compression asymmetry is identified to cause second (even) harmonic generation in materials. Then, shear-normal coupling is identified to cause generation of secondary waves of different polarity than the primary waves. In addition, deformation induced anisotropy due to the presence of residual stress/strain and its contribution to ultrasonic higher harmonic generation is qualitatively discussed. Also, the tension-compression asymmetry in the material is quantified using an energy based measure. The above measure is employed to develop a homogenization based approach amenable to multi-scale analysis to correlate microstructure with ultrasonic higher harmonic generation.\n\nFinally, experimental investigations concerning third harmonic SH wave generation in plates are carried out and the effect of load and temperature changes on nonlinear ultrasonic measurements are discussed in the context of SHM. It was found that while nonlinear ultrasound is sensitive to micro-scale damage, the relative nonlinearity parameter may not always be the best measure to quantify the nonlinearity as it is subject to spurious effects from changes in environmental factors such as loads and temperature.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11270], "author_name_tesi": "Chillara, Vamshi Krishna", "last_name_ssi": "Chillara", "middle_name_ssi": "Krishna", "first_name_ssi": "Vamshi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Francesco Costanzo", "Panagiotis Michaleris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Member", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Member", "Panagiotis Michaleris, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NDE", "SHM", "Nonlinear ultrasonics", "nonlinear guided waves", "micromechanics", "microstructure characterization", "homogenization;"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Root anatomical traits for efficient water acquisition under drought in Maize (zea mays L.)", "id": "23841", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10497", "abstract_tesi": "Drought stress is a primary constraint to crop production.

Understanding the predictors of parental commitment to early intervention is important if one is interested in maximizing parental involvement. The present study examined predictors of parental commitment to early intervention using a sample of 138 low-income African American mothers that participated in a home visiting intervention program aimed at promoting the development of their preterm infants and the parent-infant relationship. The participants were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Both intervention and control mothers received a home visiting program, and thus commitment to home visiting was able to be assessed in both groups. Predictors of commitment included sociodemographic variables, infant medical variables, and parents\u2019 state of mind regarding attachment, which was assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). Commitment was assessed in three ways: marker measures of general involvement, interventionists' ratings of overall parental commitment, and parents\u2019 engagement with the intervention activities. Higher socioeconomic risk was associated with lower commitment regardless of group status. In contrast, higher infant medical risk was associated with lower commitment only for the control group. Autonomous mothers were found to be more committed to intervention compared to non-autonomous mothers; however, this was only seen in the intervention group. Multiple regression analyses revealed that when socioeconomic risk and maternal attachment status were used as predictors, only socioeconomic risk significantly predicted commitment. The results suggest that socioeconomic risk is a major obstacle for parental commitment to intervention. It is likely that autonomous parents were more encouraged to participate in the present intervention because of the content of the program that was congruent with their values and needs.

Specifically, the focus is on engineering and understanding cofactor partitioning for heterologous production of xylitol in Escherichia coli.  By replacing E. coli\u2019s native cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) with a cyclic AMP-independent mutant (CRP*), xylose uptake and xylitol production from mixtures of glucose and xylose was facilitated, with glucose serving as the growth substrate and source of reducing equivalents.  Numerous xylose reductases (XRs) and xylulose dehydrogenases (XDHs) with varying nicotinamide cofactor specificities were screened in a crp*, &#916;xylB double mutant strain (PC09).  It was found that a NADPH-dependent xylose reductase from Candida boidinii (CbXR) consistently produced the highest concentration of xylitol in shake flask cultures (~275 mM in LB cultures, ~180 mM in minimal cultures).  Use of non-growing, metabolically-active resting cells was next examined as a means of improving xylitol yield (YRPG, mols of xylitol produced per mol of glucose consumed).  An increase of YRPG in resting cells compared to batch cultures (~3.4 and ~1.8 respectively) was observed.  By altering various conditions and parameters of resting cells, xylitol YRPG was further increased to ~4.0, while limiting fermentation product secretion (e.g. lactate, acetate, and ethanol).  \nIt was then sought to understand the role of NADPH supply in xylitol yield and the contribution of key central carbon metabolism enzymes toward xylitol production. Studies in which the expression of CbXR or a xylose transporter was increased suggested that enzyme activity and xylose transport are not limiting xylitol production in PC09. A constraints-based stoichiometric metabolic network model was used to understand the roles of central carbon metabolism reactions and xylose transport energetics on the theoretical maximum molar xylitol yield (xylitol produced per glucose consumed). These results were then compared to experimentally determined xylitol yields (YRPG), which were measured from resting cell biotransformations with various PC09 derivative strains. For the case of xylose-proton symport, omitting the Zwf (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), PntAB (membrane-bound transhydrogenase) reactions, or TCA cycle activity from the model reduces the theoretical maximum yield from 9.2 to 8.8, 3.6, and 8.0 mol of xylitol per mol of glucose, respectively. Experimentally, deleting pgi (encoding phosphoglucose isomerase) from strain PC09 improves the yield from 3.4 to 4.0, while deleting either or both E. coli transhydrogenases (sthA and pntA) has no significant effect on the measured yield. Deleting either zwf or sucC (TCA cycle) significantly reduces the yield from 3.4 to 2.0 and 2.3 mol of xylitol per mol of glucose, respectively. Although the metabolic role of transhydrogenases during E. coli biocatalysis has remained largely unspecified, these results demonstrate the importance of direct NADPH supply by NADP+-utilizing enzymes in central metabolism for driving heterologous NADPH-dependent reactions, and suggest that the pool of reduced cofactors available for biotransformation is not readily interchangeable via transhydrogenase.\nFinally, two fundamentally different strategies were studied to improve the coupling between glucose oxidation and xylose reduction based on the result that the pool of reduced cofactors is not readily interchangeable. It was first examined the effects of deleting the phosphofructokinase (pfk) gene(s) on growth-uncoupled xylitol production and found that deleting both pfkA and sthA (encoding the E. coli soluble transhydrogenase) improved the xylitol YRPG from 3.4 to 5.4.  The second strategy focuses on coupling growth with xylose reduction.  Deleting the pgi and sthA genes resulted in a strain that was severely growth inhibited; however the growth was able to be partially restored upon expressing the NADPH-dependent CbXR to the double mutant strain (\u00b5max = 0.12 from 0.06 hr-1) with concomitant xylitol production, which is a potential suitable strain for adaptive evolution.  Intracellular nicotinamide cofactor levels were also quantified, and the magnitude of the change in the NADPH/NADP+ ratio measured from cells consuming glucose in the absence versus presence of xylose showed a strong correlation to the resulting YRPG.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3118], "author_name_tesi": "Chin, Jonathan W", "last_name_ssi": "Chin", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Patrick Cirino", "Patrick Cirino", "Costas D Maranas", "Wayne Roger Curtis", "Ali Demirci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Patrick Cirino, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick Cirino, Committee Chair", "Costas D Maranas, Committee Member", "Wayne Roger Curtis, Committee Member", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["xylitol", "cofactor regneration", "E. coli", "metabolic engineering", "biotransformation"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Commodity Prices and Transaction Coordination through Contracts", "id": "6096", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4476", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation research is composed of three essays to investigate the role of procurement contracting, market structural features, and market participants\u00a1\u00a6 behavior as determinants of the implications of contracting for spot price determination, market segments, and welfare effects.  A key feature of procurement contracting is the partitioning of the market into a contract segment and a residual, open (spot) market segment.  This research presents three alternative considerations of the role of procurement contracting in price determination.  \nFor the first essay, a two-sector general equilibrium model is introduced by analyzing the optimizing behavior of agents, who produce and purchase commodities in the presence of forward contracting, and derived a set of individual supply and demand functions under price uncertainty and risk aversion.  By setting up a formal optimizing model, we are able to understand how activities of production and consumption should be modifies as a consequence of introducing forward contract markets.  Assuming clearing markets, equilibrium spot price distributions are solved in the rational expectations framework.  We examine the effects of contracts on spot market price behavior.  Specifically, both price level and price volatility effects are considered.  Simulation results show that as hedge increases mean of spot price falls, and variance increases.  These results are intuitive though also dependent on parameterization.\nThe second and the third essays of this research use intuitive concepts from game theory that are currently useful to formalize and investigate various forms of market structure.  For the second essay, the contract market itself is assumed subject to adverse selection and moral hazard in that quality is unknown.  We look at how agents effectively signal their quality using a modified framework a la Spence (1973).  The results show that the high quality seller receives quality premium on forward contracts, whereas the low quality seller receives lower forward contract price than the expected spot price due to quality discount.  Also, under the optimal incentive contracts provided by the buyer the high and the low quality sellers supply their total production to the forward contract market.  In other words, the spot market does not exist if all feeders in market are offered optimal contracts.  \nFor the third essay, we set up a bargaining model between buyers and sellers for their contracts in which they bargain over price and/or quantity.  The bargaining protocol is a fairly standard Rubinstein bargaining model of alternating offers (see Rubinstein (1982)).  The results in this essay show that bargaining is not just increasing prices paid to farmers comparing with the situations in monoposy and in competitive market; the total surplus associated with bargaining are positive.  We conclude that the existence of market-wide pooling of revenues mitigates the problem of the processor\u00a1\u00a6s market power that individual producers face.  In absence of the introduction of a cooperative, we find it likely that individual producers receive the lowest price and zero profit.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4446], "author_name_tesi": "Chin, Ming-Chin ", "last_name_ssi": "Chin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ming-Chin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert D Weaver", "James William Dunn", "Edward C Jaenicke", "Kalyan Chatterjee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert D Weaver, Committee Chair", "James William Dunn, Committee Member", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Member", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["forward contracts", "price volatility", "signaling", "collective bargaining"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "political ideologies of upper echelons: \nimplications for top executives\u2019 pay arrangements \n", "id": "22048", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10070", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I examine the influence of the political ideologies of top executives on organizational outcomes. I first test how liberal and conservative CEOs have different influences on top management teams\u2019 (TMT) pay arrangements. Given that politically liberal CEOs believe in the importance of egalitarianism, whereas political conservatives hold to free-market principles, I propose that a firm with a more liberal CEO is likely to have greater TMT pay egalitarianism, which is defined as the degree to which pay is arranged such that executives\u2019 financial rewards are shared collectively. In the following study, I attempt to test whether the efficacy of TMT pay arrangements varies according to non-CEO executives\u2019 political ideologies. Liberals and conservatives assess fairness using different standards. Liberals, who strongly value egalitarianism, tend to base their judgment about fairness on the equality of outcomes; conversely, conservatives, who uphold proportionality, tend to be more accepting of unequal distribution of outcomes. Due to these divergent political ideologies, their perceptions and interpretations of similar situations will differ; consequently, the behaviors they exhibit and the choices they make in response will differ as well. Based on this argument, I test whether the direct influence of TMT pay egalitarianism on two organizational outcomes \u2013 firm performance and executive departure \u2013 is moderated by non-CEO executives\u2019 political ideologies. By testing these relationships, this dissertation will shed light on the importance of understanding the political ideologies of upper echelons.

Anomalies in complex\nsystems may often manifest themselves under appropriate excitation from certain exogenous stimuli.  These anomalies may be benign or\nmalignant as their impact on the system may vary with mission objectives and operating conditions.  Major catastrophic failures in complex engineering systems can often be averted if incipient\nfaults are detected sufficiently in advance by observing small anomalies in the dynamical behavior.\n\nThe dissertation presents a novel approach to anomaly detection in complex systems based on the fundamental principles of Systems Sciences, Language Theory, and Computational Mechanics. The goal of the research is to detect anomalies to mitigate failures in complex dynamical systems as well as to enhance their performance and availability.  However, solely based on the fundamental principles of physics, accurate and computationally tractable modelling of complex system dynamics is often infeasible.  One may\nhave to rely on semi-empirical models whose parameters can be identified using time series data generated from sensors and (possibly) additional sources of information such as operation history of the process. Accordingly, decision and control laws are to be formulated based on such semi-empirical models along with\nreal-time data by monitoring these systems.\n\nThe technical approach presented in the dissertation focuses on quantitative detection of the qualitative features of anomalies in complex systems.  The proposed anomaly detection methodology utilizes the concepts of Symbolic Dynamics which are a part of dynamical systems theory and Computational Mechanics.  Symbolic\nDynamics qualitatively describes dynamical systems behavior in terms of sequences of symbols.  Computational Mechanics provides a tool for pattern recognition in these symbol sequences. This dissertation proposes a new, computationally simpler, alternative approach to Crutchfield's epsilon machine for representing the pattern in a symbolic process. The proposed tool is called the D-Markov machine, which is motivated from the\nperspective of anomaly detection. Anomalies due to small faults, such as deviations of system parameters from their nominal values, are detected by identifying variations of patterns in symbol\nsequences. Time series data, observed under selected stimuli and/or self-excitation, are used to generate the symbol sequences.\n\nThe problem of anomaly detection, addressed in this dissertation, belongs to the class of non-linear non-autonomous dynamical systems in which anomalies occur at a slow time-scale while the inferences are made based on the time-series observation of selected system variable(s) at the fast time-scale.  The proposed procedure of anomaly detection relies on two-time-scale analysis of the stationary response of the dynamical system.  To possibly facilitate small change detection in system parameters, the system\nmay be excited with a priori known stimuli and discovering anomaly patterns, if any, from the resulting responses at the fast time scale.\n\nThe proposed anomaly detection methodology is separated into two parts: (i) Forward problem; and (ii) Inverse problem.  The objective in the forward problem is to learn, in an off-line\nsetting, how the grammar underlying the system dynamics changes as the system parameters change.  In contrast, the inverse problem is that of inferring the system parameters based on the on-line observations of the observed stationary behavior.  The feasible range of damage parameter estimates can be narrowed down from the\nintersection of the information generated from responses under several stimuli chosen in the forward problem.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5523], "author_name_tesi": "Chin, Shin Choong", "last_name_ssi": "Chin", "middle_name_ssi": "Choong", "first_name_ssi": "Shin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shashi Phoha", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Asok Ray", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "John Metzner", "Natarajan Gautam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shashi Phoha, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Chair", "Asok Ray, Committee Member", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Member", "John Metzner, Committee Member", "Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pattern recognition", "signal processing", "anomaly detection"]}]
