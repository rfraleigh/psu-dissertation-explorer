Currently, 17.9% of the GDP of the United States is spent on health care. It is an information intense industry, and, through private and governmental incentives, is increasingly using digital information to manage care. Cloud computing and computer virtualization have complicated the decision process around how to architect solutions for health care. Health care decision makers must seek to minimize their spending while ensuring sufficient computational capacity, regulatory compliance and security. The intensity of the use of digital information in health care is expected to increase rapidly. \nThis dissertation makes several contributions to the fields of health care informatics and computer science. We first established motivation for studying this area by examining the attitudes of health care technology leaders throughout the United States.  This research led us to believe that many health care organizations will continue to make use of private clouds for some time. Given this assumption, we examined how the predictability of health care workloads could be used to improve the use of private cloud computing infrastructures. Using historic resource requirements as a guide, we constructed an algorithm that could be used to by systems architects to make better informed hardware allocation decisions.  Continuing to use the concept of predictability, we created a system that dynamically migrated virtual machines within a private cloud in expectation of increased workload. This preemptive migration based on history-generating foresight reduced the overhead associated with other trigger-based migration schemes of up to 99.6%. \nThe original survey also indicated that health care technology leaders were concerned about security and the changing regulations associated with data leakages. Our research focus shifted to reducing the risk of data leakage in hybrid computing clouds.  We devised a mechanism that prohibited layer three network communications between different network zones to reduce the risk of data leakage while ensuring, to the extent practical, that traditional multilevel security rules could be implemented.  Finally, we proposed mechanisms required to successfully deploy health care data in a dynamic Intercloud such that data could move freely between private and various public cloud providers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10663], "author_name_tesi": "Rauscher, Richard L", "last_name_ssi": "Rauscher", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raj Acharya", "Raj Acharya", "Padma Raghavan", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich", "Wang Chien Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raj Acharya, Dissertation Advisor", "Raj Acharya, Committee Chair", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich, Committee Member", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cloud computing", "health care", "healthcare", "virtual machines", "VMMA", "Bell-LaPadula", "data leakage"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Competitive interactions and associations of the invasive thistles <I>Carduus nutans</I> and <I>Carduus acanthoides</I>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "7169", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1856", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "   As the number of biological invasions continues to increase, the degree to which communities can resist invasions and the interactions between multiple invasive species will become increasingly important. This will have important consequences for existing communities, as the combined impact of multiple invaders may not simply be additive. Using experimental, observational and modeling approaches, we investigated the direct competitive interactions between <I>Carduus nutans</I> and <I>C. acanthoides</I>, two congeneric invasive thistle species. <P>It was hypothesized that their observed spatial segregation was due to interspecific competition. Spatially-explicit simulation models of competitive interactions between these species were developed for both the landscape and the field levels, to explore the range of behaviors predicted. We examined direct interspecific competition using three response surface field experiments. Additionally, the thistle distribution patterns were quantified at two resolutions: the regional level in the area of overlap, and the field level in four fields of natural co-occurrence. Their interactions with the existing vegetation were examined in two ways: by quantifying their vegetative associations in four fields of co-occurrence, and by experimentally examining their germination and establishment response to microsite characteristics. <P>The competition experiments did not demonstrate strong competition or density dependence. The simulation models do generate spatial segregation, but not for parameters corresponding to the results of the competition experiments; a gradual decay of the segregation pattern with eventual coexistence is more likely. The landscape-scale observational studies indicate negative associations between these species, but at the field scale, which is the scale at which competition would occur, <I>C. nutans</I> and <I>C. acanthoides</I> are positively associated, implying that competition between them does not lead to exclusion. While there were significant differences in the plant communities in areas with and without thistles, there were no significant differences in communities associated with <I>C. nutans</I> versus <I>C. acanthoides</I>. Both species were found to be sensitive to microsite characteristics, with generally better establishment in larger gaps, and better survival in gaps with less disturbance. <P>Our results reject the hypothesis that resource competition between these two species strongly influences their distributions; instead, our results suggest that interactions with other community members, combined with the spread history of these species, likely most strongly influence the current distribution. Although strong competitive interactions were not observed between these two congeneric invaders, interactions between invasive species will only continue to increase, and the combined empirical and theoretical approach presented here will be critical to assessing how such interactions influence the success and impact of invasive species. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1840], "author_name_tesi": "Rauschert, Emily Sofia Jalics", "last_name_ssi": "Rauschert", "middle_name_ssi": "Sofia Jalics", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katriona Shea", "Eric S Post", "Ottar N Bjornstad", "David A Mortensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katriona Shea, Committee Chair", "Eric S Post, Committee Member", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Member", "David A Mortensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["invasive species", "microsite", "coexistence", "competition", "competition models", "<I>Carduus</I>"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Human Body Pose Estimation and Segmentation with Hierarchical, Data-driven MCMC", "id": "19870", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9573", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We are tackling the problem of human body detection, segmentation and pose estimation in still images, which has applications in initializing a human articulated body tracker, action recognition and image processing. The goal is to generate pixel-level segmentations of the body and its individual parts, along with estimates of the joint locations of an articulated human body model. Large variation in body shape and clothing across subject, pose and viewpoint, as well as the unpredictable nature of the scene background and the lack of temporal information, makes this a very challenging problem.\n\nWe review the broad field of human pose estimation, discuss relevant work that has studied this problem from various perspectives, and identify several shortcomings in the current state-of-the-art of human pose estimation. The problem of human pose estimation is then formulated within a Bayesian framework, with the use of a generative model approach. The key aspect of this approach lays in the joint estimation of body shape and image segmentation. Together the multi-label image segmentation and the generative body model extract potential body part segments from the image that are simultaneously evaluated against the expected shape and color distribution of a particular, pose specific body model.\n\nThis approach circumvents several shortcomings of previous work, such as a local search over model parameters, needing to be initialized with pose parameters close to the true body pose. Instead, this work uses a global search framework based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, which is an iterative hypothesize and test procedure that explores the vast search space of body poses and foreground/background segmentations to produce a generative explanation of the observed image data. To effectively search the large space of body poses, a data-driven proposal function and a coarse-to-fine search scheme are employed to reduce the high-dimensional search space into a set of low dimensional ones.\nThis work further explores the particular application of estimating the walking direction of pedestrians and their style of clothing. Strong prior knowledge of possible body poses can then be used to more effectively constrain the vast parameter space of the employed body model.\n\nA quantitative evaluation of this work in terms of accuracy of pixel-level segmentations, estimated joint locations and walking direction of pedestrians is performed on several public human pose datasets.

The first member of the MYO3 family was identified in Drosophila photoreceptors and called NINAC (Neither inactivation nor afterpotential C) based on its role in phototransduction. It was observed that NINAC null mutant flies undergo light and age dependent retinal degeneration. The first report describing deleterious recessive mutations in MYO3A associated with inherited human progressive hearing loss (DFNB30) was published in 2002. It is believed that MYO3 dependent transport of Espin (isoforms) from the base to the tips of the stereocilia plays a crucial role in stereocilia elongation. Previous reports have hypothesized that MYO3A and MYO3B may have overlapping functions but MYO3B can only partially compensate for MYO3A. Thus, it is critically important to reveal functional differences between isoforms to determine how the loss of MYO3A leads to deafness. Using a wide-range of cell biological and biochemical approaches, this study investigated novel aspects of class III myosins and its binding partners associated with vertebrate hearing and vision. This study reports discovery of two novel MYO3 binding proteins- MORN4 and EspinL, and provide insights into the functional mechanism of each protein in association with MYO3. It was found that the tail of MYO3 has a conserved Espin1 and EspinL binding site, whereas the MORN4 binding site is distinct and present only in the MYO3A tail region. Based on structural data, a novel mechanism of motor (MYO3) mediated cargo (Espin1) activation is proposed. This work demonstrates that MYO3A is uniquely engineered to regulate formation and elongation of parallel actin bundle based protrusions which does not require rapid actin remodeling. The study also revealed a correlation between MYO3 motor activity and its ability to regulate actin protrusion formation and elongation. Interestingly, the intactness of the MYO3A extended tail region was found to be crucial for stabilizing actin protrusions. Finally, the study reports the characterization of two novel deafness causing MYO3A dominant mutations- G488E and L697W. The G488E mutation leads to an interesting phenotype of a 2-fold decrease in the maximum actin-activated ATPase rate and 2-fold increase in the actin sliding velocity. Whereas, the L697W mutation leads to a ~2-fold decreases in both the maximum actin-activated ATPase rate and actin sliding velocity. These results highlight the importance of MYO3 in vertebrate sensory structures and provides novel insights into its role in length and ultrastructure maintenance of parallel actin based protrusions.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13229], "author_name_tesi": "Raval, Manmeet Harishbhai", "last_name_ssi": "Raval", "middle_name_ssi": "Harishbhai", "first_name_ssi": "Manmeet", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Martin Yengo", "Christopher Martin Yengo", "Lisa M Shantz", "Hui-Ling Chiang", "Colin James Barnstable", "Scot R Kimball"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Martin Yengo, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Martin Yengo, Committee Chair", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "Hui-Ling Chiang, Committee Member", "Colin James Barnstable, Outside Member", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Myosins", "Actin cytoskeleton", "Filopodia", "Stereocilia", "Deafness"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Swelling mica-type clays of variable charge: synthesis, characterization and cation exchange properties\n", "id": "7069", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5351", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\n\nThe main objective of this thesis research was to synthesize, characterize and investigate cation exchange properties of swelling mica-type clays of variable charge. Although micas occur naturally in soils, they have limited ability to remediate contaminated soils owing to their small cation exchange property. Therefore, if swelling micas with high cation exchange capacity and selectivity can be developed, they could be used for remediation of metal comtaminated soils. On the other hand, low charge swelling clays could be used for the preparation of nanocomposites and cosmetics. In this study, sodium fluorphlogopite micas of variable charge were synthesized by two different new methods, (1) sodium chloride melt method, and (2) stoichiometric fluorine content method. \n\tDifferent characterization techniques were used in this study to confirm the phase formation by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), shape and size range by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Si nearest neighbor environment by magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MASNMR) spectroscopy. Cation exchange capacities and cation exchange equilibria were conducted on highly charged swelling micas to determine their ion selectivity properties. As synthesized Na-saturated samples and samples saturated by Mg by two saturation methods were used for ion exchange equilibria studies. Results from the ion exchange and selectivity studies revealed that sodium saturated samples have nearly theoretical CECs and also have exhibited high selectivity for Cu2+ ions. In addition to the as prepared Na-saturated swelling micas, Mg saturated micas were prepared by using two methods: (1) Ion exchange with Mg(NO3)2 and (2) Ion exchange by Mg nitrate melt. Samples saturated with Mg by melt method have low CECs as well as a low selectivity for Sr2+ ions. The melt method appears to have led to some degradation of the synthetic micas. Samples saturated with Mg by the exchange method in general were slightly more selective for Sr than Cu with an exception in the case of Na-2-mica. Saturation of micas with Mg, in general, did not improve selectivity for cations compared to the as prepared samples. Micas with a unit cell charge of one and less than one were also synthesized. Powder XRD patterns revealed the formation of hydrated phases at charge densities as low as 0.125 per unit cell. Solid-state NMR studies revealed two types of Si environments, Si(1Al) and Si(0Al) in such low charge micas. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5346], "author_name_tesi": "Ravella, Ramesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Ravella", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ramesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sridhar Komarneni", "Peter J Heaney", "Carmen E Martinez", "Jerzy Dec", "Rustum Roy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Chair", "Peter J Heaney, Committee Chair", "Carmen E Martinez, Committee Member", "Jerzy Dec, Committee Member", "Rustum Roy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["soils and water", "heavy metals", "remediation", "Swelling mica"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Optimal Strategies Using Financial Options in Airline Booking\n\n", "id": "8627", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1928", "abstract_tesi": "\tMaximizing airline profit is challenging as several costs, such as fuel or manpower, have been increasing. Fierce competition has forced airlines to drastically reconsider their economic policy. Traditionally, revenue management techniques such as overbooking or dynamic pricing have been utilized to improve profit of the airline industry. Recently, the use of financial options theory offers a different approach to airline revenue maximization.\nThe purpose of this thesis is to apply financial option theory in order to maximize the expected revenue of the airline per flight. An option-based model to maximize the airline revenue under uncertainty and a numerical search method are presented. The demand distribution and the random walk of a ticket price cause uncertainty in the booking process. The proposed model assumes that the evaluation periods are discrete and uses the Cross-Ross-Rubinstein model (1979) to price the options. The complexity of the expected revenue expression does not allow for the utilization of calculus to maximize the airline\u2019s profit. Therefore, a numerical search method is used to determine the optimal values for the decisions variables, which are the initial number of call and put options and the respective strike prices, for a given distribution of demand.  A numerical example is presented and sensitivity analysis is performed to test the behavior of the model when changing input parameters (skewness of demand distribution and up and down moves of the ticket price). It is found that changing the skewness of the distribution has a significant effect on the expected revenue. Moreover, we show that the parameters of the random walk (the drift and its variance) directly affect the utilization of options, because these have a direct effect on the probability that the ticket price increases. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of accurate forecasting of demand and the precise estimation of the random walk parameters.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1910], "author_name_tesi": "Ravelojaona, Eve ", "last_name_ssi": "Ravelojaona", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Eve", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["M Jeya Chandra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["M Jeya Chandra, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["airline industry", "revenue management", "airline booking", "options theory", "optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "AN EQUIVARIANT BIVARIANT CHERN CHARACTER", "id": "6464", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2543", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-08-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using notions from homological algebra and sheaf theory Baum and Schneider defined a bivariant equivariant cohomology theory which shares many of the properties of equivariant KK-theory; indeed, these two theories have so much in common that when the group under consideration is profinite they are rationally isomorphic.

In vitro culture techniques, developed almost a century ago, are fundamental enabling tools for the study of life processes and are routinely employed in many applications that impact human health care.  Emergence of the field of tissue engineering, focused on developing tissue surrogates for transplantation, has renewed the emphasis on critically examining the conditions under which we culture cells/tissue outside the body.  It has been well recognized that isolation of cells from the complexity of their native physiological environment results in adaptive responses that often limit cell viability and function in vitro.  Bridging the gap between physiological complexity and in vitro culture environments is critical to the successful implementation of the tissue engineering strategy.  We show herein that a compartmentalized bioreactor based on the principle of continuous-growth\u2013and-dialysis provides stable culture conditions that better simulate the physiological environment.  The bioreactor was used to grow mineralizing, collagenous bone tissue up to 150   thick from an inoculum of isolated murine (mouse calvaria MC3T3-E1, ATCC CRL-2593) or human (hFOB 1.19 ATCC CRL-11372) osteoblasts over uninterrupted culture periods up to a year.  Proliferation and phenotypic progression of an osteogenic-cell monolayer into a tissue comprised of   cell layers of mature osteoblasts in the bioreactor was compared to cell performance in conventional tissue-culture polystyrene (TCPS) controls.  Cells in the bioreactor basically matched results obtained in TCPS over a 15 d culture interval, but loss of insoluble ECM (iECM) and ~2X increase in apoptosis rates in TCPS after 30 d indicated progressive instability of cultures maintained in TCPS with periodic refeeding but without subculture.   By contrast, stable cultures were maintained in the bioreactor for up to a year, suggesting that extended-term tissue maintenance is feasible with little-or-no special technique.  Month\u2019s long culture interval in the bioreactor lead to progression of pre-osteoblasts to osteocyte-like cells embedded in mineralized matrix observed in normal bone and production of visually-apparent (macroscopic) bone.  Challenging bioreactor-derived bone tissue at different stages of development with metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) known to invade the skeleton created a system-in-crisis that captured early stages breast cancer colonization of bone.   In situ confocal microscopy revealed sequential steps of breast cancer cell adhesion, penetration, and degradation of the 3D bone-like osteoblast tissue over co-culture intervals ranging from 3 to 10 days.  Bioreactor enabled direct observation of interactions of breast cancer cells with engineered 3D bone like tissue and simulated an important step in the progression of the disease that may be a target for therapeutic intervention.

Alternative splicing of the Tnnt3 pre-mRNA results in generation of several splice forms that can be classified into two major categories based on whether they include mutually exclusive exon 16 (referred to as Tnnt3\u03b1 splice forms) or 17 (referred to as Tnnt3\u03b2 splice forms). Previous studies have shown that an increase in experienced body weight (i.e. actual body mass plus addition of external load) leads to a proportionate increase in relative abundance of Tnnt3\u03b1 splice forms and a decrease in relative abundance of Tnnt3\u03b2 splice forms. The Tnnt3\u03b1 and Tnnt3\u03b2 splice forms have been associated with increased and decreased calcium sensitivity respectively. The changes in alternative splicing pattern that occur in response to an increase in experienced body weight causes an overall enhancement in calcium sensitivity and force production resulting in improved skeletal muscle function in order to support the increased body weight. Hence, Tnnt3 splice forms have distinctive effects on force production during muscle contraction, thereby regulating muscle function.\nThe work described in this thesis is focused on determining the variation in Tnnt3 alternative splicing patterns in rat gastrocnemius muscles in response to different physiological conditions of impaired muscle function such as aging, skeletal muscle disuse and high fat diet-induced obesity. The studies presented here show that the relative abundance of several Tnnt3 splice forms varied significantly among 2, 9 and 18-month old rats and the pattern of alternative splicing correlated with changes in body weight rather than muscle mass.  Skeletal muscle disuse due to hindlimb immobilization for 7 days resulted in dramatic alterations in relative abundance of Tnnt3 splice forms such that the alternative splicing pattern was similar to that observed in lighter animals, i.e. decreased relative abundance of Tnnt3\u03b1 splice forms and increased relative abundance of Tnnt3\u03b2 splice forms. Remobilization for 7 days after hindlimb immobilization restored the relative abundance of most Tnnt3 splice forms toward that observed in the non-immobilized limb, even though muscle mass had not yet begun to recover. High fat diet consumption for 2 and 8 weeks also resulted in body weight-inappropriate patterns of Tnnt3 alternative splicing. There was an overall decrease in relative abundance of Tnnt3\u03b1 splice forms and an increase in relative abundance of Tnnt3\u03b2 splice forms. \nIn conclusion, these studies demonstrate that alternative splicing of Tnnt3 pre-mRNA is disrupted during early stages of skeletal muscle disuse and high fat diet-induced obesity. The alternative splicing pattern is shifted such that there is an overall decrease in calcium sensitivity and force production. This could be a potential mechanism for disuse and obesity-related decline in skeletal muscle function. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11081], "author_name_tesi": "Ravi, Suhana ", "last_name_ssi": "Ravi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suhana", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scot R Kimball"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scot R Kimball, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["aging", "disuse atrophy", "high fat diet", "Tnnt3", "alternative splicing", "immobilization", "remobilization", "obesity"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Heterogeneous Catalysis at the Single-molecule Level: A Quantitative Understanding of the Catalytic Activity of Individual Gold Nanoparticles and its Associated Dynamics ", "id": "20115", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9589", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We use total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to understand heterogeneous catalysis at the single-molecule level. This study focuses on examining, in detail, the catalytic activity of individual gold (Au) nanoparticles (5.4 \u00b1 0.7, 9.5 \u00b1 0.6, and 19.4 \u00b1 1.1 nm diameter) through single-molecule detection of a model fluorescent reaction: reduction of resazurin (non-fluorescent) to resorufin (fluorescent) in the presence of a suitable reductant (hydroxylamine). We find that for both the product formation and the product generation reaction, all Au nanoparticles follow a Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism. We verify the proposed mechanism for kinetic and thermodynamic consistency through temperature-dependent measurements at both the single-molecule and ensemble levels. We quantitatively study the influence of solvent on the reaction system by replacing H2O with D2O. Single-molecule measurements aid in deconvolution of desorption kinetic parameters, which is impossible at the ensemble-level when the desorption step is not rate-limiting. It also provides a detailed understanding of the dispersive kinetics of individual Au nanoparticles and quantifies the heterogeneity in activity among individual nanoparticles.\nThe next phase of our study focuses on deconvoluting the origins of temporal variations in activity present among individual catalytic turnover events on a single Au nanoparticle. We interpret the contributions of intrinsic restructuring and adsorbate-induced restructuring of gold nanoparticles by Reaction Force-Field (ReaxFF) Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and an autocorrelation analysis of experimental data. By adding small molecule adsorbates of varying affinity to the Au surface, we probed the contributions of the reactivity for different types of active sites on the observed variations in activity. Strong adsorbates such as thiols were found to chromatographically titrate the Au active sites from higher reactivity to lower reactivity. By varying the coverage of thiols, we modulate the temporal variations in the activity of individual Au nanoparticles. Furthermore, at the single-molecule level, we studied the reorientation dynamics of single resorufin molecules generated on the surface of a 5.4 nm Au nanoparticle. By combining single molecule observations with theoretical calculations, we relate the presence of a slow rise in on-times (rise times) from our fluorescence turnover trajectory to the rotational dynamics of product (resorufin) on the Au surface. We perform an extensive autocorrelation analysis on the observed rise times and determined the activation barrier associated with product reorientation through temperature-dependent single-molecule analysis.\nFinally, in a separate study, we probe the thermodynamic adsorption profile at a solvated organic-inorganic interface by following the binding and organization of carboxylic acid-terminated alkanethiols of varying chain lengths (C2, C3, and C6) to the surface of Au nanoparticles using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The thermodynamic parameters support a mechanism of step-wise adsorption of thiols to the surface of Au NPs and secondary ordering of the thiols at the organic-inorganic interface. We observe an apparent compensation effect: the negative \u0394H is compensated by a negative \u0394S as the thiols self-assemble on the Au NP surface. Understanding the thermodynamics of adsorption at nanoparticle surfaces will provide critical insight into the role of ligands in directing size and shape during nanoparticle synthesis since thiols are a common ligand choice (i.e., Brust method). The ITC technique is applicable to a large number of structure-directing ligands and solvent combinations and, therefore, should become an important tool for understanding reaction mechanisms in nanostructure synthesis.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9355], "author_name_tesi": "Ravi, Venkataramanan ", "last_name_ssi": "Ravi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Venkataramanan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Michael John Janik", "Enrique Daniel Gomez", "Peter J Butler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Chair", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heterogeneous Catalysis", "Gold Nanoparticles", "Single Molecule Level Measurements", "Kinetic Analysis", "Thermodynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CONSTRUCTION OF A GENOME-SCALE ATOM MAPPING MODEL OF E.COLI FOR METABOLIC FLUX ANALYSIS\n\n", "id": "11424", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5023", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Metabolic flux analysis (MFA) is a valuable and critical tool in understanding cell physiology.

Flux analysis based on a genome-scale isotope mapping model is expected to provide a more comprehensive understanding of cellular functioning. Therefore, as a first step towards providing atom mapping data for currently available complete metabolic reconstructions, the genome-scale isotope mapping model of E. coli imPR90068 is made available here. Based on the latest metabolic reconstruction of Escherichia coli iAF1260, the isotope mapping model spans 2,077 reactions (previous largest mapping model included 238 reactions), contains atom mappings for all 90,068 non-hydrogen atoms and accounts for 1.37 x 10157 distinct isotope forms. The expanded scope of imPR90068 allows the complete tracking of labeled atoms through pathways such as cofactor and prosthetic group biosynthesis and histidine metabolism. An elementary metabolic unit (EMU) representation of imPR90068 for MFA is constructed. The largely automated procedure employed to generate imPR90068 uses a compound matching algorithm based on the graph theoretical concept of pattern recognition along with relevant reaction information. The details of the procedure including the specific challenges faced in generating genome-scale mappings are provided and the potential application of the developed procedure to generate isotope mapping models of other organisms is recognized.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4999], "author_name_tesi": "Ravikirthi, Prabhasa ", "last_name_ssi": "Ravikirthi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Prabhasa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas", "Costas D Maranas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas, Thesis Advisor", "Costas D Maranas, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["MFA", "metabolic flux analysis", "isotope mapping models"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Role Of TGF\u03b2 Signaling In Ultraviolet Radiation  (UVB)-Induced Cutaneous Inflammation And Carcinogenesis", "id": "19940", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9548", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Inflammation is an integral component of carcinogenesis and chronic dysregulated inflammation is recognized as an important tumor promoter increasing cancer risk. Cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in the tissue microenvironment, play a critical role in regulating the immune response to foreign antigen or altered self-antigen. Ensuing tissue damage and tissue repair from inflammation contribute to tumor promotion in part by subversion of the protective immune response generated against the neoplastic antigens into a predominantly protumorigenic response. Environmental exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVB) is the major cause of skin cancer and exposure at high doses can potently activate the immune system. UVB can act as a complete carcinogen in the skin by inducing mutations in the DNA and establishing a proinflammatory microenvironment. Transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) is a potent negative regulator of epithelial cell proliferation and a key immunoregulatory cytokine in the skin with a pivotal function in maintaining steady-state peripheral tolerance. Previous studies using the 2-stage skin carcinogenesis model with mice that have alterations in the TGF\u03b21 pathway showed that TGF\u03b21 can function as a tumor promoter as well as a tumor suppressor but its role in UVB-induced skin carcinogenesis is not known. \nTo study the role of TGF\u03b2 signaling in UVB-induced cutaneous inflammation and carcinogenesis, we used a pharmacological inhibition model with SB431542 (SB), a small molecule inhibitor of TGF\u03b2 type I receptor kinase and a genetic abrogation model, CD11c-dnTGF\u03b2RII in which mice express a dominant negative human transforming growth factor beta receptor II gene under the control of a CD11c promoter (CD11c-DNR), specific for dendritic cells. UVB-induced skin tumor formation in Skin Hairless-1 mice (SKH1) was suppressed by topical treatment with SB, as were CD4 and CD8 Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and IFN\u03b3+ TIL. However, there was no difference in the tumor size or tumor cell proliferation. To understand the mechanism of TGF\u03b2 modulation of tumoral immune response, we used acute and chronic models of UVB induced inflammation with SB. SB blocked acute and chronic UVB-induced skin inflammation, linked to reduced T cell activation and IFN\u03b3 secretion in the skin and skin draining lymph nodes suggesting that the difference in tumor inflammation could be critical to reduced tumor outgrowth when TGF\u03b21 signaling was blocked.\nDendritic cells are professional antigen presenting cells forming the bridge between the innate and the adaptive immune system and are key mediators of cutaneous inflammation. TGF\u03b2 signaling is important for the development of Langerhans cells (LCs), the epidermal DC subset in the skin. It is also implicated in the steady state epidermal maintenance of LCs. However, the role of TGF\u03b2 signaling for immunostimulatory function of LCs or other dermal DC subsets in response to an inflammatory stimulus such as UV irradiation is not clear. When we studied the effect of SB on DCs in an acute UVB model, we found that SB blocked p-Smad2 induction in dermal DCs, the migration of CD103+ CD207+ and CD207- dermal DC subsets to the skin draining lymph nodes (SDLNs) and in an ex vivo ear explant assay. However, SB did not alter the p-Smad2+ percentage or the basal or UVB-induced migration of LCs implicating CD103+ CD207+ and CD207- dermal DC subsets as key DC populations for UVB-induced skin inflammation. \nTo further determine the requirement of TGF\u03b2 signaling specifically in DCs, we used CD11c-DNR mice to study UVB-induced inflammation. Defective TGF\u03b2 signaling in DCs reduced the steady-state migration of all three DC subsets: LCs, CD103+ CD207+ and CD207- dermal DC subsets. Acute UVB irradiation, however, reduced the migration of only CD103+ CD207+ and CD207- dermal DC subsets to the SDLNs and CD207- subset in a similar ear explant assay in DNR mice compared to WT. This correlated with a reduction in p-Smad2+ and CD86high subset of dermal DCs. There was no difference in UVB-induced migration of LCs between WT and DNR mice. \nFinally, to test the physiological relevance of the UVB-induced migration of dermal DC subsets, we used a T cell driven pathological model of Contact Hypersensitivity. Defective TGF\u03b2 signaling in DCs in DNR mice led to an attenuated ear thickness response in CHS compared to WT. In addition, the synergistic increase in ear thickness, CD4, CD8 T cell activation and cytokine profile in the SDLNs in WTs with UVB plus CHS was significantly suppressed in DNR mice. Together, these results highlight the critical requirement of TGF\u03b2 signaling in DCs for an optimal cutaneous immune response to UV irradiation. In contrast to the well documented immunoinhibitory properties of TGF\u03b2, these results suggest a model in which TGF\u03b2 signaling in DCs is important for UVB induced cutaneous inflammation as well as other cutaneous inflammatory responses mediated by dermal dendritic cells. Together, these studies highlight a novel tumor-promoting mechanism for TGF\u03b2 in UVB skin carcinogenesis.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9320], "author_name_tesi": "Ravindran, Anand ", "last_name_ssi": "Ravindran", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anand", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adam Bleier Glick", "Adam Bleier Glick", "Gary H Perdew", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Sagarika Kanjilal", "Zhi Chun Lai"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adam Bleier Glick, Dissertation Advisor", "Adam Bleier Glick, Committee Chair", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Sagarika Kanjilal, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Skin Cancer", "Ultraviolet Radiation", "Transforming Growth Factor-Beta", "Inflammation", "Dendritic cell", "T lymphocyte Activation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Performance Study Of A Small Scale Wind Turbine", "id": "23686", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10787", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Wind Energy at The Pennsylvania State University is an exciting field of research.

College students are at particular risk of alcohol-related consequences due to their heavy drinking tendencies, with multiple studies indicating over 40% of students engage in the practice of binge drinking. Although there have been some promising findings with respect to programs that serve to reduce alcohol use and limit associated harm, researchers note the pressing need for the continued examination of etiological variables that can improve prevention efforts. Two important predictors of drinking outcomes identified in both the etiological and prevention literature are protective and risk behaviors students engage in while drinking. Although associations between drinking-related protective and risk behaviors and drinking outcomes have been well studied on their own, there is a lack of research examining how both types of behaviors operate collectively. Further, these variables are often assessed globally, such that students are asked to report their typical, or average use of these behaviors. Thus, it is unclear as to what types of protective and risk behaviors are most influential of drinking outcomes, whether these associations are consistent across multiple drinking events, and whether the use of these variables is consistent from one drinking event to the next.\n\nAccordingly, there were three aims of the dissertation: 1) to examine the collective influence of individual drinking-related protective and risk behaviors on alcohol use and related consequences using a global assessment, 2) to examine the stability of drinking-related protective and risk behaviors over time, as well as relationships between these variables, alcohol use, and related consequences using an event-level assessment, and 3) to examine whether gender differences exist in the use of protective and risk behaviors over time.\n\nSeveral findings emerged from the current study. Results of the global analysis revealed pacing protective behaviors, and drinking to get drunk, mixing, and mass consumption risk behaviors accounted for significant, unique variance in drinking outcomes. Results of the event-level analysis revealed that use of individual protective and risk behavior constructs were stable over time, however the associations between individual protective and risk behavior constructs, alcohol use, and consequences varied. Finally, results of the test for gender differences indicated that use of protective and risk behaviors over time was equivalent between males and females, with the exception of social protective behaviors and drinking to get drunk risk behaviors. Findings reinforce the importance of including components in prevention programs that aim to increase the use protective behaviors and decrease the use of risk behaviors, and also highlight the need for additional research that examines context-specific predictors of these constructs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [106], "author_name_tesi": "Ray, Anne Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Ray", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Anne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert James Turrisi", "Robert James Turrisi", "Laura Klein", "William Gerin", "Jolynn Carney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert James Turrisi, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert James Turrisi, Committee Chair", "Laura Klein, Committee Member", "William Gerin, Committee Member", "Jolynn Carney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["alcohol use", "college students", "protective behaviors", "risk behaviors"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "GENOME PACKAGING AND HOST-PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS IN PARAMYXOVIRUS ASSEMBLY AND BUDDING", "id": "0v838057g", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12750", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Paramyxoviruses possess non-segmented, negative-sense RNA genomes that are encapsidated by viral nucleocapsid protein (NP), and are packaged into budding virus particles via NP protein interaction with viral matrix (M) proteins, thereby creating infectious viruses. We had previously identified a DLD sequence near the C- terminal end of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) NP protein that was important for interaction with PIV5 M protein, and for enhancing PIV5 virus-like particle (VLP) production. We have shown here that a DLD-containing 15 amino acid sequence derived from PIV5 NP or Nipah virus N proteins is sufficient to direct a foreign protein, Renilla luciferase, into virus-like particles. This short DLD-containing sequence was also able to replace the requirement for NP protein in PIV5 VLP production. Mumps virus NP protein contains a DWD sequence instead of DLD, and consequently, PIV5 NP protein cannot interact efficiently with mumps virus M protein, in spite of the two viruses being very closely related. Altering PIV5 NP DLD sequence to mumps virus NP DWD sequence creates a new PIV5 NP protein that is now compatible with M proteins from both PIV5 and mumps virus. We hypothesize that DLD-like sequences define compatibilities between paramyxovirus M and NP proteins that can be manipulated to drive production of virus-like particles containing therapeutics for delivery to cells.\nA hallmark of enveloped virus infection is the hijacking of host cellular pathways during viral egress. To define host factors involved in paramyxovirus budding, a yeast two-hybrid screening approach was used previously, which identified angiomotin-like 1 (AmotL1) as a host factor that binds to the matrix (M) proteins of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) and mumps virus. AmotL1 belongs to a family of proteins that also includes angiomotin (Amot) and angiomotin-like 2 (AmotL2). All three angiomotins harbor PPXY motifs and interact with WW-domain containing proteins such as Nedd4 and YAP. We found that the PIV5 and mumps virus M proteins bind to AmotL1, but not to Amot or AmotL2. Binding was mapped to a 83- amino acid region from the C-terminal portion of AmotL1. Overexpression of M- binding AmotL1-derived polypeptides inhibited production of PIV5 and mumps virus-like particles (VLPs), while overexpression of the corresponding regions of Amot and AmotL2 had little effect on VLP production. Co-immunoprecipitation studies support the presence of a three-way interaction between Nedd4, AmotL1, and M. Efficient pulldown of M with Nedd4 was observed only when AmotL1 was expressed to bridge the gap. Our findings support a model in which paramyxoviruses indirectly recruit the same WW domain-containing proteins to virus assembly sites through AmotL1 that other enveloped viruses recruit directly via PPXY late domains.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12197], "author_name_tesi": "Ray, Greeshma Vivekananda", "last_name_ssi": "Ray", "middle_name_ssi": "Vivekananda", "first_name_ssi": "Greeshma", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Paul Schmitt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Paul Schmitt, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["paramyxovirus", "assembly", "budding", "virology"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Designing a Knowledge Management System: A Sensemaking Perspective", "id": "6053", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2888", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Knowledge management (KM) aims to provide a foundation to support an organization\u2019s sustained competitive advantage by building and sustaining the value and uniqueness of organizational knowledge resources and processes.  From an inductive theory-building case study of an organization struggling with the design of its knowledge management system (KMS), a conceptualization of KM as a sensemaking system emerged.  This takes place in a sensecrafting environment whose principal components are contexts, triggers, knowledge actors, and dynamic tensions.  \n\nA key finding is the central role played by knowledge actors in crafting sense and driving change in KMS initiatives.  They were active players in designing their own shape and trajectory.  Multiple organizational contexts were found to be of particular importance to sensemaking around knowledge management.  Change in the KMS was found to be driven from two different sides.  First, triggers for KMS change originate in organization\u2019s strategic actions and reactions to events in external environment.  Additionally, this study uncovered the action of proximate triggers\u2014close-at-hand triggers into which effects of more distant triggers are funneled and that initiate change processes within the KMS.

The RON RTK is expressed on tissue-resident macrophages, and inhibits classical macrophage activation while promoting hallmarks of alternative activation, thus regulating the critical balance between the inflammatory and wound-healing properties of activated macrophages. \n\tHere we demonstrate that, in response to in vivo lipopolysaccharide challenge, RON-/- mice harbor significantly increased systemic levels of IFN-&#61543;&#61472;and IL-12, and increased levels of IL-12p40 transcript in their spleen. This elevation of IFN-&#61543;&#61472;&#61472;can be attributed to splenic NK cells responding to the elevated levels of IL-12. Analysis of RON/IFN-&#947; receptor double knockout mice indicates that the enhanced susceptibility of RON-/- mice to endotoxin challenge is dependent on IFN-&#61543;&#61472;receptor mediated signals. In vitro studies demonstrate that stimulation of primary peritoneal macrophages with macrophage stimulating protein (MSP), the ligand for RON, inhibits IFN-&#61543;-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and CIITA expression, resulting in reduced surface levels of MHC Class II, a classic IFN-&#61543;&#61472; responsive gene. Taken together, these results indicate that the RON receptor regulates both the production of, and response to, IFN-&#61543;&#61484; resulting in enhanced susceptibility to endotoxin challenge.\n\tIn vivo following LPS challenge, RON-/- mice harbor elevated levels of IL-12. We also show here that signaling through MSP/RON inhibits LPS induced IL-12p40 expression at least in part by inhibiting various aspects of the TLR-4 and TLR-4 induced IFN-&#946; signaling pathways. Our results demonstrate that signaling through RON not only retards LPS induced IkB-&#945; degradation but also inhibits the phosphorylation of p65 serine 536. While signaling through MSP/RON has no effect on LPS induced IRF-3 activation, it does however inhibit LPS/IFN-&#946; induced STAT-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition as we find that LPS induces RON expression, this suggests that RON functions in a negative feed back loop to inhibit LPS signaling. Finally, at a receptor proximal level we show that the second docking site tyrosine of RON and the GRB-2 adaptor protein are required for the MSP/RON mediated inhibition of LPS induced IL-12p40. \n\tThe stimulation of macrophages with MSP results in the induction of SOCS1 and SOCS3. These data are highly correlative with our findings that signaling via MSP/RON induces ERK and STAT-3 activation, both of which have been shown to be important for SOCS expression.  The manner in which RON inhibits LPS and IFN-&#947; induced signals is very similar to the manner in which the SOCS proteins do so. It therefore seems likely that signaling through RON indirectly inhibits IFN-&#947; and LPS induced signals via SOCS1 and SOCS3.\n\tTaken together, work done in this dissertation provides an insight into the mechanism by which RON regulates LPS induced, and IFN-&#947; potentiated macrophage activation and the systemic effects of this regulation. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4504], "author_name_tesi": "Ray, Manujendra ", "last_name_ssi": "Ray", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Manujendra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Avery August", "Robert Paulson", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Aimin Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Aimin Liu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Receptor Tyrosine Kinase", "RON", "Lipopolysaccharide", "Interferon Gamma", "Endotoxic Shock", "Inflammation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRUCTURAL AWARENESS:THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGE, SKILL, AND TEXT\n\n", "id": "11822", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4304", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An important aspect of expository text comprehension is structural awareness, readers\u2019 ability to perceive and use the author\u2019s organization to organize their own understandings.

Both of these projects utilize in-situ Raman spectroscopy for exploring gas-surface interactions. Chapters 2 and 3 explore the interaction of molecular Nitrogen on carbon surfaces. With complementary theoretical studies and systematic experimental studies at various temperatures and pressures for different surfaces, I demonstrate how the spectroscopic peak features of N2 gives an indication of gas-surface binding energy, pore structure, and surface chemistry. Using 1D and 3D carbon architectures, spectroscopic perturbation of Nitrogen is probed as a function of adsorption potential and pore dimension, and the spectroscopic response is mapped to the cryogenic volumetric adsorption isotherms. Whereas the latter required multiple days and ~100 mg of sample, the spectroscopic technique provided similar structural information in the matter of a few hours for a few micrograms of the sample. It is anticipated that the development of the site-specific spectroscopic technique will advance the understanding of adsorbent geometry versus chemical functionality in a way not possible with deconstruction of bulk gas adsorption measurements of pore dimension, surface area, and diffusivity.\nThe second project probed mechanochemical means to polymerize aromatics and hydro-aromatics in the presence of hydrogen in an attempt to form localized carbon cages that trap hydrogen.

I examined plant defense responses to another important caterpillar behavior, their defecation. Fall armyworms (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda), a major threat to maize (Zea mays), are voracious eaters and deposit copious amounts of frass in the enclosed whorl tissue surrounding their feeding site where it remains for long periods of time. FAW frass is composed of molecules derived from the host plant, the insect itself and associated microbes and hence provides abundant cues that may alter plant defense responses. I observed that proteins from FAW frass initially induced wound-responsive defense genes in maize; however, a pathogenesis-related (pr) defense gene was induced as the time after application increased. Elicitation of pathogen defenses by frass proteins was correlated with increased herbivore and reduced fungal pathogen performance over time. These responses differ from the typical plant response to oral secretions of the FAW. Fractionation of the proteins from caterpillar frass led to the identification of plant chitinase Pr4 and insect gut protein Insect Intestinal Mucin (IIM) that triggered pathogen and wound-induced defenses in maize, respectively. Application of purified Pr4 on maize plants induced pathogen defenses, suppressed herbivore defenses and increased performance of the herbivores on plants treated with Pr4. Immuno-depletion of the IIM resulted in an attenuation of herbivore-triggered wound response in maize and an elevation of pathogen defenses in maize leaves. Therefore in maize, Pr4 functions as an effector of herbivore defenses, while IIM acts as an elicitor of herbivore defenses. I also measured frass-induced defenses in host-herbivore systems where frass accumulates in enclosed feeding sites of the herbivore and compared them to those where it does not. Tomato fruitworm (Helicoverpa zea or TFW) frass from larvae fed on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) leaves induced a sustained herbivore defense response in tomato leaves where frass does not accumulate close to feeding sites. However, TFW frass from larvae fed on tomato fruits induced pathogen defenses when injected in tomato fruits where frass does accumulate in close proximity to the herbivore\u2019s feeding site. Therefore, frass-mediated elicitation of plant defenses are specific to host-herbivore systems and depends on the insect and plant species involved, the diet of the herbivore, and the tissue on which it is deposited.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11468], "author_name_tesi": "Ray, Swayamjit ", "last_name_ssi": "Ray", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Swayamjit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dawn S Luthe", "Teh Hui Kao", "Surinder Chopra", "Gary Felton", "Benjamin A Mcgraw"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dawn S Luthe, Dissertation Advisor", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Member", "Gary Felton, Committee Member", "Benjamin A Mcgraw, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Frass", "herbivore defense", "pathogen defense", "caterpillar", "plants."]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Culture of Food in Colonial Bengal", "id": "10260", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6374", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In \u201cCulture of Food in Colonial Bengal\u201d I seek to relate the rise of a new middle- class in colonial Bengal to the development of a new gastronomic culture. I argue that the colonial transformation of the relations of production contextualized the cultural articulation of a new set of values, prejudices, and tastes for the Bengali Hindu middle- class. These cultural values, together with the political and economic conditions of colonialism, formed the habitus of this class. I investigate the historical specificities of this instance of class-formation through an exploration of the discursive and non-discursive social practices that went into the production of a new \u201cBengali\u201d cuisine. Drawing on government proceedings, periodical literature, recipe books, and visual materials, I demonstrate that the Bengali Hindu middle-class created a new cuisine, one that reflects both an enthusiasm to partake of the pleasures of capitalist modernity and an anxiety about colonial rule. The Bengali Hindu middle-class gave a double-faceted response to these new gastronomic possibilities. A distinct enthusiasm for the satisfactions of modernity was counterbalanced by an agonized awareness that this specific cultural innovation arose within a political context that was fundamentally alien, racist, and exploitative. This double-faceted response resulted in a discursive project, the articulation of a set of values, prejudices, and tastes that I have called the \u201crhetoric of cuisine\u201d of the Bengali Hindu middle-class. The \u201crhetoric of cuisine\u201d was an aesthetic choice tied to the upper caste and patriarchal agenda of middle-class social reform.  My dissertation investigates how this rhetoric made possible certain social practices, including the imagination of the act of cooking as a classic feminine act and the domestic kitchen as a sacred space. These acts of imagination possess important elements of continuity from pre-colonial times, especially evidenced in the reinstitution of caste-based norms of gastronomy. Thus, the deployment of the \u201crhetoric of cuisine\u201d was simultaneously anti-colonial yet capitalist, cosmopolitan yet gendered and caste-based.

The discovery of many classes of antibiotics seemed to put an end to human infection and protect us indefinitely from our microbial enemies. However, we have come to realize that our enemies are entities subject to evolution and selection as all living systems on earth have been since the appearance of life. This strong selection for resistant bacteria has resulted in the diminished efficacy of antibiotics. Added to this is the high cost of screening new compounds that are safe and effective for their use in humans. Despite over a little more than a century of microbiology, bacteria keep surprising us with the myriad of mechanisms that they have acquired throughout the ages to adapt to a constantly changing environment. In this work, we present evidence for the first time that a genetic switch that is capable of increasing the mutation rate of the host bacterium was responsible for treatment failure in a case of Staphylococcus aureus infection. We show that this is the case by fully sequencing blood isolates taken from the patient. This sequencing revealed an evolution pattern consistent with a hypermutator infection. We also measure the mutation rate increase that this switch imparts onto its containing bacterium. We define a statistical model to differentiate mutator/non-mutator bacteria based on the results of whole genome sequencing. Finally, we measure the switching rate of the genetic element responsible for the increase in the mutation rate.

As a result, it is paramount to ensure safety after longer reactor exposure times in the case of design-basis accidents, such as reactivity-initiated accidents (RIA).  Previously proposed failure criteria do not directly address the particular cladding failure mechanism during a RIA, in which crack initiation in brittle outer-layers is immediately followed by crack growth through the thickness of the thin-wall tubing.  In such a case, the fracture toughness of hydrided thin-wall cladding material must be known for the conditions of through-thickness crack growth in order to predict the failure of high-burnup cladding.\n\nThe fracture toughness of hydrided Zircaloy-4 in the form of thin-sheet has been examined for the condition of through-thickness crack growth as a function of hydride content and distribution at 25\u00b0C, 300\u00b0C, and 375\u00b0C.  To achieve this goal, an experimental procedure was developed in which a linear hydride blister formed across the width of a four-point bend specimen was used to inject a sharp crack that was subsequently extended by fatigue pre-cracking.  The electrical potential drop method was used to monitor the crack length during fracture toughness testing, thus allowing for correlation of the load-displacement record with the crack length.  Elastic-plastic fracture mechanics were used to interpret the experimental test results in terms of fracture toughness, and J-R crack growth resistance curves were generated.  Finite element modeling was performed to adapt the classic theories of fracture mechanics applicable to thick-plate specimens to the case of through-thickness crack growth in thin-sheet materials, and to account for non-uniform crack fronts.  Finally, the hydride microstructure was characterized in the vicinity of the crack tip by means of digital image processing, so as to understand the influence of the hydride microstructure on fracture toughness, at the various test temperatures.  \n\nCrack growth occurred through a microstructure which varied within the thickness of the thin-sheet Zircaloy-4 such that the hydrogen concentration and the radial hydride content decreased with increasing distance from the hydride blister.  At 25\u00b0C, the fracture toughness was sensitive to the changes in hydride microstructure, such that the toughness KJi decreased from 39 MPa&#8730;m to 24 MPa&#8730;m with increasing hydrogen content and increasing the fraction of radial hydrides.  The hydride particles present in the Zircaloy-4 substrate fractured ahead of the crack tip, and crack growth occurred by linking the crack-tip with the next hydride-induced primary void ahead of it.  Unstable crack growth was observed at 25\u00b0C prior to any stable crack growth in the specimens where the hydrogen content was the highest. \n \nAt 375\u00b0C as well as in most cases at 300\u00b0C, the hydride particles were resistant to cracking and the resistance to crack-growth initiation was very high.  As a result,, for this bend test procedure, crack extension was solely due to crack-tip blunting instead of crack growth in all tests at 375\u00b0C and in most cases at 300\u00b0C.  The lower bound for fracture toughness at these temperatures, the parameter KJPmax, had values of KJPmax~54MPa&#8730;m at both 300\u00b0C and 375\u00b0C.  For cases where stable crack growth occurred at 300\u00b0C, the fracture toughness was KJi~58MPa&#8730;m and the tearing modulus was twice as high as that at 25\u00b0C.\n\nIt is believed that the failure of hydrided Zircaloy-4 thin-wall cladding can be predicted using fracture mechanics analyses when failure occurs by crack growth.  This failure mechanism was observed to occur in all cases at 25\u00b0C and in some cases at 300\u00b0C.  However, at more elevated temperatures, such as 375\u00b0C, failure will likely occur by a mechanism other than crack growth, possibly by an imperfection-induced shear instability. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4829], "author_name_tesi": "Raynaud, Patrick A.C.", "last_name_ssi": "Raynaud", "middle_name_ssi": "A.C.", "first_name_ssi": "Patrick", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Donald Albert Koss", "Christopher L Muhlstein", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Kwai S Chan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Dissertation Advisor", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Chair", "Donald Albert Koss, Committee Chair", "Christopher L Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Kwai S Chan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["zircaloy", "cladding", "fracture", "toughness", "hydride", "crack", "thickness", "RIA", "sheet", "hydrogen"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Teamwork Experience on the Collaborative Information Seeking Behaviors of Students Working in Teams\n\n", "id": "10437", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6929", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Information seeking has primarily been viewed as an individual not collaborative activity.

Consequently, it is important to develop a more detailed understanding of CIS behavior in order to support this behavior through the development of appropriate processes and technologies.  \n      Information seeking is an important aspect of student teamwork. In this thesis, the relationship between experience working in teams and CIS behavior is examined through a survey given to students in three IST 301 classes in Fall, 2007. Through the survey, I examine whether the level of experience that students have working in teams affects their communications methods and information source preferences among other features during CIS activities.

I also found that the level of teamwork experience of students did not affect communication or source preferences nor did it affect the obstacles that students may face during CIS activities.

Although climate change is now discussed in U.S. national security policy and doctrine, scholarly research linking climate change and security has been debated, and has not yet adequately dealt with high levels of uncertainty in the associated complex socio-environmental systems.  Scenario planning represents a strategic planning methodology with roots in post World War II military planning.  Since the mid-1980s, scenario planning has been employed extensively in the business community, and recently has been applied to complex socio-environmental problems.  Scenario planning is well suited for studying highly uncertain problems. This dissertation seeks to understand how scenario planning can be applied to understand and plan in light of climate change-security challenges and opportunities.  The dissertation examines past climate change-security scenarios, including interviews with scenario participants and practitioners.  A case study examines a scenario planning exercise that employs a novel method, foresight scenario planning, to understand climate change-security issues in Vietnam.  The findings suggest that foresight scenario planning provides a simple, effective method to understand and plan through uncertainty related to climate change-security problems, and can be useful for conducting multilevel scenario planning and identifying surprise.

Studies have demonstrated that an ongoing GABAergic input to DMV neurons plays a major role in regulating vagal efferent output from the DMV. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a perinatal high fat diet (HFD) affects the GABAergic regulation of vagal efferent output to the stomach. Male Sprague Dawley rats were fed a HFD (60% kcal from fat) from embryonic day 13 until experimentation at 12 weeks of age. Miniaturized strain gauges sutured to the ventral surface of the gastric corpus were used to record gastric motility. The GABAA\u00ac receptor antagonists, bicuculline methiodide (BMI; 25, 50, 100pmol) and gabazine (GBZ; 0.78, 3.125, 6.25pmol) were microinjected (60nl) into the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) and the resulting increase in gastric tone was measured at 10 time points after injection (1-10 min) and averaged. A motility index was used to identify changes in motility response and was measured over two five minute periods before and after drug microinjection. Gastric tone responses were represented as a percentage of maximal stomach contraction induced by i.v. injection of the non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist, bethanecol (50\u00b5g/kg; 1ml), which itself was unaffected by diet (19.5\u00b13.0g in control vs 25.5\u00b13.6g in HFD; P>0.05). \nIn control rats, BMI induced a dose-dependent increase in gastric tone (2.2\u00b10.34%, 5.4\u00b11.1% and 9.5\u00b13.5% at 25, 50 and 100pmol, n=6, 7, 3, respectively, P<0.05 for each) and showed a trend towards a dose-dependent increase following the perinatal HFD (5.3\u00b12.2%, 8\u00b14.1% and 9.7\u00b14.7% at 25, 50 and 100pmol, n= 4,5,7, respectively, P<0.06).

More accurately, there are two principal sources of vibration excitation in meshing gear pairs: transmission error fluctuation and fluctuation in the load transmitted by the gear mesh.  This dissertation formulates the gear mesh vibration excitation problem in such a way that explicitly accounts for the aggregate contributions of these excitation components. The Fourier Null Matching Technique does this by imposing a constant value on the transmission error and solving for the requisite contact region on a tooth surface that yields a constant load transmitted by the gear mesh. An example helical gear is created to demonstrate this approach and the resultant compensatory geometry. The final gear tooth geometry is controlled in such a way that modifications to the nominal involute tooth form exactly account for deformation under load across a range of loadings. Effectively, the procedure adds material to the tooth face to control the contact area thereby negating the effects of deformation and deviation from involute.  To assess the applicability of the technique, six deformation steps that correlate to loads ranging from light loading to the approximate full loading for steel gears are used. A nearly complete reduction in transmission error fluctuations for any given constant gear loading should result from the procedure solution.

Adult children often offer support and become surrogate decision makers.  However, children and their aging parents do not always see eye-to-eye on daily care goals.  When goals clash, an older adult may be perceived as insisting, resisting, or persisting in their ways or opinions, or acting in a way commonly attributed to stubbornness.  Such situations likely affect relationship and individual outcomes of families; yet, they are not well understood.  \n\nThis dissertation compiles three studies that examine elders\u2019 behaviors commonly attributed to stubbornness.  Study 1 uses semi-structured interviews with aging parents and their adult daughter caregivers (N = 10 dyads) to develop a broad understanding of how elders influence their care (including through stubbornness).  Study 2 (N = 88 dyads) and Study 3 (N = 221 adult children) use survey data to examine the association between elders\u2019 persistent behaviors and individual and relationship-based characteristics, as well as the effect of children\u2019s responses to such behaviors.  \nStudy 1 demonstrates complex patterns of responses within families when there is conflict in care goals.  Parents most commonly let go of their requests, while daughters reason with their parents and make decisions when they perceive safety or health-related needs.  However, parents also display insisting and persisting behaviors.  Study 2 confirms that adult children perceive their parents as acting in ways commonly attributed to stubbornness fairly often, and aging parents also self-report acting in this way.  However, perceptions are linked to differential individual and relationship-based factors, and there are systematic differences in perceived parent stubbornness by adult children and their aging parents.  Last, Study 3 shows that it is not just the perception of behavior that matters, but how adult children respond to their parents\u2019 persistent behaviors that affect children\u2019s depression, relationship quality, and support provided.  \n\nOverall, this dissertation demonstrates that micro-level processes of responses to goal conflict within families affect care and support.

Mitochondria harbor multiple copies of their own genome (mtDNA), which in humans corresponds to a 16.5-kb circular molecule, responsible for the expression of 13 subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes (OXPHOS). \nDysfunctional mitochondria lead to a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders commonly referred as mitochondrial disease. Pathogenic mutations that can cause disease usually affect only a proportion of the total mitochondrial genomes, generating the coexistence of mutant and wild-type mtDNA within the same individual, a state called heteroplasmy.  Transmission of the mitochondrial genome is non-Mendelian: the offspring strictly receives the mtDNA from the mother alone. Moreover, it is observed that the frequency of heteroplasmic alleles can change dramatically between generations (i.e., the frequency can be significantly higher or lower in the next generation), due to the existence of a bottleneck (of unknown size in humans) occurring during the formation of the germ-line. \nSince there is no cure for mitochondrial disease, understanding the dynamics of transmission of mitochondrial DNA variants is critical to advance towards a solution. Also, unraveling the mechanism of mitochondrial gene expression is required to understand, and perhaps remedy, mitochondrial disease.\nMy long-term goal is to understand mitochondrial DNA and RNA variability in humans: prevalence, dynamics of transmission, and mechanisms that lead to mitochondrial disease. In this dissertation I addressed this goal by using high throughput next generation sequencing technologies and bioinformatics, to explore the mitochondrial genome variability at the DNA (chapters 2 and 3) and RNA (chapter 4) levels. I asked and provided answers to the following questions:\n\n(1) What is the prevalence of mtDNA heteroplasmy in healthy individuals?\nOn average, each individual carried one heteroplasmy, and one in eight individuals carried a disease-associated heteroplasmy, with minor allele frequency \u2265 1%.\n\n(2) What is the size of the maternal germ-line bottleneck in humans?\n30\u201335 segregating units (interquartile range from 9 to 141).\n\n(3) What is the mitochondrial DNA mutation rate accounting for heteroplasmies?\n1.3 \u00d7 10\u22128 (interquartile range from 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22129 to 4.1 \u00d7 10\u22128) mutations per site per year.\n\n(4) Is there any correlation between the age of a mother and the number of heteroplasmies observed in her child?\nA positive association between the number of heteroplasmies in a child and maternal age at fertilization was observed, likely attributable to oocyte aging.\n\n(5) What is the prevalence of mitochondrial RNA variation in humans?\nOn average, blood tissue had the highest number of heteroplasmic variants per individual: 22 sites vs. \u226410 in liver, skeletal muscle, heart, visceral fat and subcutaneous fat.\n\n(6) Are there any tissue-specific patterns in the mtRNA variability?\nIt was observed that the expression levels of the 13 mitochondrial protein coding genes is highly variable in blood, and that the expression of subunits of the same OXPHOS complex do not necessarily correlate to each other.\n\nThe results from this dissertation contributed to understanding the evolution, transmission dynamics, disease association, and transcriptional regulation of the mitochondrial genome.

A descriptive correlational mixed-method research design was used to examine the relationships between two predictor variables (patients\u2019 expectations before hospitalization, and nurses\u2019 assessments of patients\u2019 expectations of care) and the outcome variable (patient satisfaction with nursing care). The existing Patient Satisfaction with Nursing Care Quality Questionnaire was modified  to create a questionnaire to measure patients\u2019 expectations with nursing care (Patient Expectations for Nursing Care Quality Questionnaire) and one to measure nurses\u2019 assessments of their patients\u2019 expectations (Nurse\u2019s Assessment of the Patient\u2019s Expectations Questionnaire). The qualitative portion of this study was based on data obtained from a subgroup of the initial patients\u2019 responses to four open-ended questions regarding their nursing-care experience. The convenience sample for the study consisted of 109 patient-nurse dyads at an academic medical center. The target patient population consisted of patients hospitalized with an anticipated length of stay of two or more days. In each dyad, the nurse was the nurse who cared for the patient. The study found no relationship between nurses\u2019 assessments of patients\u2019 expectations and patients\u2019 ratings of their own expectations, or between nurses\u2019 assessments of patients\u2019 expectations and patients\u2019 satisfaction. There was, however, a moderate relationship between patients\u2019 expectations and satisfaction, and the meaning of the relationship was considered. The qualitative comments were consistent with the quantitative results and both types of data support the same conclusion about the patients\u2019 experiences. A significant outcome of this study was the development of a measure that allows patients to rate their expectations for nursing care and another measure that allowed nurses to give their assessment of patients\u2019 expectations. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1674], "author_name_tesi": "Reck, Donna Hart", "last_name_ssi": "Reck", "middle_name_ssi": "Hart", "first_name_ssi": "Donna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Paula Milone Nuzzo", "Paula F Milone Nuzzo", "Judith E Hupcey", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli", "James Truman Ziegenfuss Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Paula Milone Nuzzo, Dissertation Advisor", "Paula F Milone Nuzzo, Committee Chair", "Judith E Hupcey, Committee Member", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Committee Member", "James Truman Ziegenfuss Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["patient satisfaction with nursing care", "descriptive correlational mixed-method design", "nurrse-patient relationship", "patients\u2019 expectations", "nurses\u2019 assessments of patients\u2019 expectations"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Post-Processing of SPC Convective Outlooks to Add Value for the Insurance Industry", "id": "24778", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10938", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to add forecast value to the SPC Convective Day 1 Outlooks for the insurance industry through statistical post-processing.

Research pertaining to MFCs is rapidly increasing and involves researchers from several different fields, due to its bioelectrochemical nature.  Many groups are looking at ways in which to increase and evaluate MFC performance, once of which is to use electrochemical techniques that are widely used in non-microbial fuel cell studies.  Cyclic voltammetry (CV) is gaining in popularity as a rapid method of evaluating the performance of electron transfer mechanisms that are used in the cell.  Since this is a relatively new application of CV involving living organisms which can be sensitive to voltage levels, there have not been any guidelines set for its appropriate use.  The main purpose of this study was to determine if, and at what applied potential, CV affects MFC performance and bacterial viability of the anodic biofilm.\nSix identical single-chamber air-cathode acetate-fed cube MFCs were constructed for use in this study, and inoculated with an uncharacterized mixed anaerobic consortium obtained from the Penn State Wastewater Treatment Plant\u2019s primary digester.  CV was performed at a fixed scan rate of 5 mV s-1.  Two cells were repeatedly tested at high applied voltage ranges up to +/- 1600 mV, with one consistently being exposed for 5 cycles and the other for 50 cycles.  Another cell was tested at a low applied voltage range (-500 to 400 mV) for 50 cycles, and a different cell was tested only once at +/- 1500 mV for 50 cycles.  It was determined that the point at which CV affected MFC performance was +/- 1500 mV.  Three cells were exposed to this range, with the following results: the cell exposed to 5 cycles returned from CV at 91% of pre-CV power output; the cell exposed to 50 cycles in fresh substrate returned at 0.52% power output; and the cell exposed to 50 cycles in partially-consumed substrate returned at 18.8% of its full power output.  When another experiment was performed using a +/- 1600 mV range, the cell exposed to 5 cycles returned at 27% power and the cell exposed to 50 cycles returned at 0.30% power output.    All cells with reduced power output were fully recovered within three days.  While this CV exposure did reduce the power production of the MFCs, Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM) images indicated that the power loss was not due to death of bacteria.  In fact, the MFC that was tested at +/- 1500 mV immediately before LSCM imaging had an almost equal percent viability to the untested control.\nThe cyclic voltammograms in this study were not typical of others found in literature due to the multiple anodic-cathodic curve-crossings.  It is proposed that the very high acetate concentration, combined with the low scan rate, produced these results.  The mechanisms that induced the curve-crossings at this high acetate concentration need to be investigated further.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5785], "author_name_tesi": "Red Cloud-Owen, Susan S.", "last_name_ssi": "Red Cloud-Owen", "middle_name_ssi": "S.", "first_name_ssi": "Susan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clinton Matthew Mench", "Matthew M Mench"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clinton Matthew Mench, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew M Mench, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["curve-crossing", "microbial fuel cell", "cyclic voltammetry", "biofilm", "MFC"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Conditioning Systems on Baling and Harvest of Miscanthus", "id": "27380", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12179", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Miscanthus is an emerging dedicated energy crop that will be crucial in helping to meet the goal set forth by the Department of Energy to produce 36 billion gallons of biofuels by 2022.  While miscanthus provides excellent yield on marginal land, it is more difficult to harvest than many conventional energy crops such as corn stover and switchgrass due to its tall and rigid stalks.  The harvesting of miscanthus was analyzed in this research to determine ways of cost reduction in the production of biofuels and to gather more information to be used in logistics models such as the BioFeed model.\nIn order to determine the best method to harvest miscanthus, a series of field tests was performed to compare existing conditioning methods.  Data on the processing capacities, energy requirements, and bale quality were collected.  The information shows differences between the steel chevron roll and flail conditioning modules.  A self-propelled windrower with a discbine header and a large square baler were used to harvest the miscanthus from a 20-hectare field in Illinois.  Crop was collected from the field to determine the effects of roll spacing, roll speed, and crop input on the quality of conditioning in a lab setting.\nIn the lab test the roll spacing was found to have the most significant impact on conditioning quality, shown by a 115% increase in conditioning over a 0.95 cm (75%) reduction in spacing.  Increased roll spacing and speed were shown to decrease the amount of torque required to condition the miscanthus.  In the field test, the windrower performed better statistically (p < 0.001) while using the flail conditioning module, increasing the average travel speed to 1.86 m/s, a 16% increase over steel roll conditioning.  The fuel consumption of the windrower using the flail conditioning module (1.46 L/Mg DM) yielded a 17% reduction over the roll conditioning module (1.71 L/Mg DM) for windrower fuel consumption.  The bales made from the flail-conditioned crop were also statistically shorter (p = 0.068) in length (2.49 m) and higher (p = 0.017) in density (168.09 kg m-3) than the length (2.54 m) and density (160.9 kg m-3) of roll-conditioned bales, suggesting that the flail conditioning method did a better job of breaking up the crop and creating more fractures than the roll conditioning.  The information obtained from this study helps to better predict machine and manpower requirements for miscanthus harvest as well as monetary and energy costs associated with those requirements.  \n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11578], "author_name_tesi": "Redcay, Sebastian Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Redcay", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Sebastian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jude Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jude Liu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Miscanthus", "Harvest", "Baling", "Conditioning", "Model"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "development and evaluation of a desk-compatible energy expenditure device\n", "id": "18069", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8652", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "According to the CDC, over the past three decades obesity has adversely affected both developing countries and developed countries with a 200% increase in obesity during 1980-2010.

Culture and transplantation of SSCs in bulls has the potential to enhance the efficiency of cattle production and provide a novel avenue for generation of transgenic animals.  Because of their rarity, these techniques depend on the ability to isolate SSCs from the total testis cell population.  However, this capability is currently unavailable for any livestock species.  In both the mouse and nonhuman primate, SSCs express the cell surface molecule Thy1 and selection of Thy1+ cells from the total testis cell population results in SSC-enrichment.  In this study, the hypothesis that Thy1 is a conserved marker of SSCs in the bull testis was tested.  Flow cytometric analysis showed that the Thy1+ cell fraction comprises a rare subpopulation of cells in the testis of prepubertal bulls.  Next, Thy1+ cells were isolated from prepubertal bull testes using magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) and further examined for characteristics of the proliferating spermatogonial population.  Expression of Plzf, a transcription factor expressed exclusively by proliferating spermatogonia, was highly enriched in isolated Thy1+ cells compared to the unselected total testis cell population.  Further analysis revealed that the majority of cells in the isolated Thy1+ testis cell population are Plzf+.  Lastly, xenogeneic transplantation of bull testis cells into seminiferous tubules of immunodeficient nude mice resulted in a greater than 6-fold increase of germ cell colonies from Thy1+ cells compared to the unselected total testis cell population.

Most of these planets were discovered by measuring the radial velocity (hereafter, RV) of the host star, which wobbles under the gravitational influence of any existing planetary companions.  However, this method has yet to achieve the sub-m/s precision necessary to detect an Earth-mass planet in the Habitable Zone (the region around a star that can support liquid water; hereafter, HZ) citep{1993Icar..101..108K} around a Solar-type star.  Even though Kepler citep{2010Sci...327..977B} has announced several Earth-sized HZ candidates, these targets will be exceptionally difficult to confirm with current astrophysical spectrographs citep{2011arXiv1102.0541B}.  The fastest way to discover and confirm potentially-habitable Earth-mass planets is to observe stars with lower masses - in particular, late M dwarfs.  \n\nWhile M dwarfs are readily abundant, comprising some $70\\%$ of the local stellar population, their low optical luminosity presents a formidable challenge to current optical RV instruments.  By observing in the near-infrared (hereafter, NIR), where the flux from M dwarfs peaks, we can potentially reach low RV precisions with significantly less telescope time than would be required by a comparable optical instrument.  However, NIR precision RV measurements are a relatively new idea and replete with challenges: IR arrays, unlike CCDs, are sensitive to the thermal background; modal noise is a bigger issue in the NIR than in the optical; and the NIR currently lacks the calibration sources like the very successful thorium-argon (hereafter, ThAr) hollow-cathode lamp and Iodine gas cell of the optical.  The PSU Pathfinder (hereafter, Pathfinder) was designed to explore these technical issues with the intention of mitigating these problems for future NIR high-resolution spectrographs, such as the Habitable-Zone Planet Finder (HZPF) citep{mahadevan2010habitable}, and forms the core of my dissertation.\n\nI have investigated and quantified several aspects of making precision radial velocity measurements in the NIR using Pathfinder.  Between $2006$ and $2008$, I made precise measurements of the Earth's rotational velocity with respect to the solar spectrum, with which we were able to achieve precisions of less than $10$ m/s.  In late $2008$ and $2009$, I worked on optimizing the spectrograph and reduction code in preparation for our first on-sky tests.  I also began characterizing a new calibration source for the NIR, the emission spectrum of a uranium-neon hollow-cathode lamp.  During $2010$, Pathfinder saw first light at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (hereafter, HET), where we observed almost a dozen radial velocity standard stars and bright planet-hosting stars.  Using uranium-neon as a calibration source, we were able to achieve a precision of $20$ m/s in the Y band.  In collaboration with Colorado University and the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), we fed Pathfinder with a laser frequency comb, and were able to achieve precisions of less than $5$ m/s in the H band.  These are some of the highest-precision radial velocity measurements in the Y and H bands to date, and represent an enormous advancement in our ability to make precision measurements in the NIR.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5665], "author_name_tesi": "Redman, Stephen Lewis", "last_name_ssi": "Redman", "middle_name_ssi": "Lewis", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Larry Ramsey", "Lawrence William Ramsey", "James Kasting", "Kevin Luhman", "Mercedes Richards", "Steinn Sigurdsson", "Alexander Wolszczan", "Jason Wright"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Larry Ramsey, Dissertation Advisor", "Lawrence William Ramsey, Committee Chair", "James Kasting, Committee Member", "Kevin Luhman, Committee Member", "Mercedes Richards, Committee Member", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Committee Member", "Alexander Wolszczan, Committee Member", "Jason Wright, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["instrumentation", "spectrograph", "infrared array", "exoplanets", "near infrared", "uranium"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Comparison of Satellite and Ground-based Retrievals of Total Column Ozone and Nitrogen Dioxide, During DISCOVER-AQ", "id": "15382", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7734", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An analysis is presented for both ground- and satellite-based retrievals of ozone and nitrogen dioxide levels from both the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, areas during the NASA-sponsored July 2011 campaign of Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ).

I find that mean flood heights increased by ~1.24 m at The Battery in New York City (due mainly to sea level rise) from ~AD 850 to the anthropogenic era, a result that is significant at the 99% confidence level.  Additionally, changes in tropical cyclone characteristics have led to increases in the extremes of the types of storms that create the largest storm surges for New York City.   As a result, flood risk has greatly increased for the region; for example, the 500 year return period for a ~2.25 m flood height during the pre-anthropogenic era has decreased to less than 25 years in the anthropogenic era.  \nFinally, as sea levels continue to rise over the next several centuries, we expect additional risk of coastal flooding for the United States\u2019 Atlantic Coast in general, and for New York City in particular, associated with storm surge events.  I thus turn to an analysis of future projections of storm surge heights in New York City through the year 2300 in the context of my long-term historical analysis.  Using CMIP5 model projections that extend to 2300 CE, I generate large datasets of downscaled tropical cyclones.  Combining storm surge model results with several potential sea level rise scenarios for the New York City region through the year 2300, I find greatly increased risk of flooding for the metropolitan area.  I show that mean flood heights are projected to increase by ~0.24 to ~0.97 meters across three CMIP5 models through the year 2100.  By 2300, mean flood heights could increase by as much as ~2.85- ~4.99 meters.  These results are significant at the 99% confidence level.  I show that, although it is possible that shifting storm tracks could spare NYC from increases in severe storm surge heights in coming centuries, rising relative sea levels are likely to greatly increase overall flood heights, regardless of changes in TCs and their resultant storm-surge heights.  Results from this research indicate the impacts of climate change on coastal inundation, and call for advanced risk management strategies in our coastal communities, especially in the New York City region.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12294], "author_name_tesi": "Reed, Andra Jenn", "last_name_ssi": "Reed", "middle_name_ssi": "Jenn", "first_name_ssi": "Andra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Mann", "Michael Mann", "David W Titley", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr.", "Richard B Alley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Mann, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Mann, Committee Chair", "David W Titley, Committee Member", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Committee Member", "Richard B Alley, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tropical Cyclones", "NYC", "Flooding", "Storm surge", "Atlantic Basin", "New York", "Historical", "Future Risk", "Flood Height"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Water Quality of Three Forest Streams in Pennsylvania Impacted by Acidic Atmospheric Deposition", "id": "25025", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9887", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Acidic atmospheric deposition has impacted forests and waterways of the northeastern United States.  Acidic deposition is largely attributed to compounds emitted to the atmosphere from combustion of fossil fuels for power generation.  Major impacts of acid deposition on forested watersheds are part of an acidification process.   Declines in pH of soils can lead to leaching of base cations from soils that decrease the ability of a watershed to buffer itself from incoming acids.  Declines in pH of streamwater are often accompanied by changes in stream base cation loads and increases in dissolved inorganic aluminum concentrations, which in turn negatively affect aquatic life.  Due to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and other policies, rates of acidic atmospheric deposition have greatly decreased in the northeastern United States in recent decades.  Questions remain, however, about whether acid-sensitive forested watersheds will be able to recover from decades of acid deposition, and the length of time that it will take for this recovery to occur.  \nThis project quantified improvement in water quality in forested Pennsylvania streams in response to decreases in acidic atmospheric deposition since the early 1990s.  In addition to analyzing long-term records of a single sampling site on each stream, I conducted synoptic sampling of stream segments throughout three forested headwater watersheds under summer baseflow conditions in order to characterize how water quality in the main channels changed from headwaters to outlet.  All three watersheds have been subject to heavy loadings of acid deposition in recent decades, two of the watersheds (Roberts Run and Stone Run) were poorly buffered and thus acid-sensitive, while one of the watersheds (Young Womans Creek) was well buffered and thus acid-tolerant.  Results show that some chemical recovery (i.e., increased pH, decreased aluminum concentrations) has occurred in the acid-sensitive streams. However, the sensitive watersheds are still considered to be chronically acidified along much of their stream length in terms of water quality parameters.  The measured acid neutralizing capacity has not shown significant increases over the period of record.  The acid-sensitive streams are thus still at high risk of episodic acidification, and biological recovery has likely not yet fully occurred.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9622], "author_name_tesi": "Reed, Brendan Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Reed", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Brendan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Weeks Boyer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Weeks Boyer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["acid deposition", "water quality", "forest stream", "deposition", "acid", "clean air act", "recovery", "atmospheric deposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Physiological Ecology of an Entomopathogenic Fungus: Examining Host-niche Through Metabolic Footprinting of Ophiocordyceps unilateralis s.l.", "id": "14514cjr5340", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14514", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Difficulties persist in the study of host-parasite relationships, and these challenges can be exacerbated when these pathogenic relationships involve fungi as their causative agents.

These conditions, either alone or in combination, pose significant health risks to exercising women. The overall goal of this dissertation was to help increase our understanding of EA, defined as the difference between dietary energy intake and exercise energy expenditure, normalized to kilograms of lean body mass, as a tool for assessing energy and menstrual status in a field setting.  Short-term laboratory studies in sedentary women have identified a threshold of EA below which reproductive hormone secretion is disrupted, i.e., < 30 kcal/kg lean body mass but no studies have thoroughly examined the association of low EA and menstrual disturbances in trained women using more conventional methods to assess EA. We therefore assessed the prevalence of low EA (< 30 kcal/kg lean body mass) and its association with menstrual status and other indices of energy balance in exercising women outside controlled laboratory conditions. \n\nStudy 1 was designed to assess the risk of low EA in Division I female soccer players during the pre, mid, and post season. We demonstrated that although the mean EA of the group was not low, a concerning percentage of these athletes exhibited low EA at some point during the season and that negative eating attitudes were also observed in athletes with low EA. Study 2 was designed to test whether EA discriminates disruptions in menstrual function in exercising premenopausal women. In contrast to our hypothesis, we demonstrated that EA did not discriminate menstrual status in a large sample of exercising women when using conventional methods to assess EA including self-reported diet logs, exercise logs, and heart rate monitors. The purpose of Study 3 was to determine if exercising women with menstrual disturbances who display reproductive recovery experience a greater increase in EA when compared to exercising women with menstrual disturbances who do not display reproductive recovery. We also tested the association between crossing a threshold value of 30 kcal/kg lean body mass and reproductive recovery. In contrast to our hypothesis, we demonstrated that trained women with menstrual disturbances who displayed reproductive recovery, whether defined as the resumption of menstrual bleeding or the resumption of menstrual bleeding preceded by ovulation, did not experience a greater increase in EA when compared to their counterparts who did not display reproductive recovery. Study 4 was designed to assess which of several indices of energy status best predicts the presence of an energy deficit and the presence of menstrual disturbances. We demonstrated that EA best predicts an energy deficiency, but that the ratio of measured to predicted resting energy expenditure best predicts a menstrual disturbance in exercising premenopausal women.  \n\nTaken together, these data suggest that EA may not be a useful tool in assessing menstrual status in exercising women. Since an energy deficit is known to be related to disruptions in the menstrual cycle, the strong correlation between EA and energy deficiency we observed in Study 4, in the face of a non-significant association between EA and menstrual status found in Studies 2 and 3, is paradoxical. Possible explanations for the lack of association between EA and menstrual status include high variability in the measurement of the components of the EA index, dependence of menstrual status on aspects of energy balance not captured by EA, low statistical power, under or over reporting of dietary energy intake, and/or misclassification of menstrual status. Future studies are needed to more clearly understand the specific associations between the components of energy balance and menstrual status and to improve the accuracy of EA measurements.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7158], "author_name_tesi": "Reed, Jennifer Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Reed", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy Williams", "Mary Jane De Souza", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Cynthia Bartok"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy Williams, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Jane De Souza, Committee Member", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Cynthia Bartok, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Energy availability", "reproductive", "exercise", "females", "athletes"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "New destinations, new destinies?

I use variables related to school policies, school receptivity environment, and school coethnic community to measure the school context of reception. Hispanic influx is the proportion of students in a school who are newcomer Hispanic (the difference in the Hispanic student population over approximately ten years), and is a new way of identifying new Latino destination schools (Massey, 2008). \nWith respect to my first research question, I find that college preparation curriculum, teacher encouragement, and achievement-oriented friend groups are all associated with higher educational attainment. Being in a school with a dropout prevention program is associated with lower odds of attending a four-year college.  I also find that students in new destination (i.e., higher Hispanic influx) schools are significantly less likely to go to four-year colleges. For my third research question, I find no significant interactions with race/ethnicity or immigrant generation, suggesting that the effects of school context of reception and Hispanic influx apply universally. Taken together, my findings suggest that Hispanic and immigrant-heritage students are not especially benefited or disadvantaged relative to their peers; instead, all students seem to benefit fairly equally when they attend supportive schools. I therefore conclude that the school context of reception is not a model of immigrant incorporation per se. Interestingly, I find universal negative effects of attending a new destination school on going to a four-year college. Much previous research has focused on the negative effects for Hispanic students in particular (e.g., Wortham, Mortimer, & Allard, 2009), but my findings suggest that these population changes have far-reaching consequences. I interpret this universal effect in the context of other research on school compositional effects that finds students who attend schools with poor, majority-minority schools are often disadvantaged (e.g., Rumberger, 1995; Rumberger & Palardy, 2005). \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8357], "author_name_tesi": "Reed, Katherine Rose", "last_name_ssi": "Reed", "middle_name_ssi": "Rose", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katerina Bodovski", "Suet Ling Pong", "David Post", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katerina Bodovski, Dissertation Advisor", "Suet Ling Pong, Committee Member", "David Post, Committee Member", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["school effects", "assimilation", "immigrants", "new Latino destinations", "educational attainment"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A Comparative Study on Adsorption Desulfurization of Liquid Transportation Fuels Over Different Sorbents for Fuel Cell Applications", "id": "8695", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4667", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines the performance of different materials for adsorption desulfurization of liquid transportation fuels for fuel cell applications.  Fixed-bed, continuous flow experiments were performed on eight different materials treating six different fuel mixtures representing gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.  Adsorbents are compared according to the 1 ppmw sulfur breakthrough capacity and capacity at saturation.  Results indicate that for the same fuel, different adsorbents perform differently, and for the same adsorbent, different fuels interact differently.  Comparisons are made on the basis of adsorbent weight, volume, and surface area.  Nickel-based adsorbents have the highest overall sulfur capacity. Supported nickel (A-5) is significantly better than NiAl (A-2) for all fuels except model jet fuel, even when comparing on a surface area basis.  The breakthrough capacity per surface area for nickel-based adsorbent materials is about ten times greater than for metal oxides, which are about twice as active as activated carbon. The activated carbon adsorptive capacity is greater on a weight basis than on a volume or surface area basis due to the high surface are of this material.  \nAlthough typical sulfur compounds are the same, the breakthrough capacity is lower for real fuels than for model fuels, possibly due to fuel additives and additional compounds in real fuels such as olefins and aromatic compounds present in higher concentrations than sulfur.  Among the real fuels used in this study, diesel is the most difficult fuel to treat, probably due to the presence of sterically hindered refractory sulfur compounds, which are not suitable for adsorbents that act through a direct sulfur-metal interaction such as the nickel-based adsorbents.  No significant difference in performance between the metal oxide adsorbents A-8 and A-9 is observed, indicating that these adsorbents function through similar mechanisms. \n\tThe impact of temperature and liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV) on the desulfurization performance of nickel-based adsorbents is also reported.  The sulfur capacity of nickel-based adsorbents is higher at 200 \u00b0C than room temperature, indicating that adsorption proceeds via a surface reaction for these adsorbents.  The breakthrough and saturation capacity increases at lower space velocities of 1.2 h-1 LHSV versus 4.8 h-1 LHSV.  The results of this study help to assess the potential for using different adsorbents with different liquid fuels for portable fuel cell applications. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4633], "author_name_tesi": "Reed, Nicole J.", "last_name_ssi": "Reed", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Yaw D Yeboah", "Yongsheng Chen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Thesis Advisor", "Yaw D Yeboah, Thesis Advisor", "Yongsheng Chen, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fuels", "adsorption", "desulfurization"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY: THE ROLE OF MUSIC IN THE MEANING-MAKING PROCESSES OF OLDER PERFORMING MUSICIANS", "id": "8313", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5704", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-01-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this narrative inquiry was to determine the role that music plays in the meaning-making processes of older performing musicians.

Second, the commingling of context, repertoire, performers, and audience created musical experiences for narrators that were profound, and for some of them, spiritual. Data supporting this cross-theme also highlighted music's capacity to influence narrators' emotions and spirit, thereby contributing to the development of a more mature spirituality.

The introductory chapter explores critical writing about mass culture from the end of the nineteenth century through postmodern theory, followed by an overview of existing criticism dedicated to the theme of mass culture in Spanish literature. A summary of Spain\u2019s major political developments since 1978 then helps to establish the social and historical context in which the novels were published. \n     In Rosa Montero\u2019s La funci\u00f3n delta (1981), contrasting representations of mass culture both praise its potential to encourage the imagination and imply that it can impede the development of relationships. The novel criticizes a society that is primarily concerned with the satisfaction of desire, but also suggests that storytelling, love, and solidarity are possible solutions to existential angst. The text proposes the need for society to embrace fiction but simultaneously warns against its seductive and potentially harmful nature.\n     Antonio Mu\u00f1oz Molina\u2019s El invierno en Lisboa (1987) examines the relationship between fiction and perception. While on one hand mass culture offers aesthetic models around which the plot and the characters are constructed, it also blurs the boundaries between illusion and reality to show that both are characterized by deceptively utopian ideals. The work\u2019s focus on the textual nature of reality underscores the ubiquitous presence of mass culture in the contemporary world and highlights the inevitable mediation of perception by popular culture.\n     Eduardo Mendicutti\u2019s Una mala noche la tiene cualquiera (1988) relates mass culture to gendered identity as it influences the construction of a transvestite\u2019s female persona. Despite the protagonist\u2019s struggle for political and sexual emancipation, the mass cultural icons that she regards as symbols of liberation are problematic because they also promote traditional gender roles and encourage conformity with paternalistic tradition.

Thin TiN coatings have been applied to compressor components to mitigate erosion from hard particles. However, the TiN coatings deposited upon stainless steel components have created a galvanic coupling which leads to unsatisfactory corrosion performance. Chromium has been incorporated into the binary TiN system to create a ternary (Ti,Cr)N coating system to improve erosion and corrosion resistance. Cathodic arc deposition was used to deposit coatings using co-evaporation of a titanium and chromium cathode as well as evaporation of a titanium-chromium alloyed cathode. The coatings were characterized using x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and Vickers microhardness testing. In addition, the coating corrosion and erosion performance was analyzed. ASTM B117 corrosion testing was performed and the corrosion performance was largely dependent on the coating thickness and density. Nanolayered (Ti,Cr)N coatings deposited at low bias had the least corrosion resistance. Erosion testing was conducted in an in-house erosion rig at 30o and 90o critical impingement angles at particle velocities of 475 fps and 325 fps, respectively. Erosion performance decreased as the chromium composition was increased in the (Ti,Cr)N coatings. When chromium evaporator current was varied, the nanolayered (Ti,Cr)N coating erosion performance was bounded within TiN (upper limit) and CrN (lower limit) coating erosion performance. The nanolayered coatings possessed the erosion performance of both the binary TiN and CrN coatings and were dependent on the coating TiN / CrN phase volume. Nanolayered (Ti,Cr)N composite coatings deposited with low substrate bias values (-25 V, -50 V and -100 V) had improved erosion performance above the TiN coating. (Ti,Cr)N coatings deposited using a titanium-chromium alloyed source yielded monolithic single-phase (Ti,Cr)N coatings; however, analysis was limited due to processing issues. Finite element method (FEM) leading edge deformation modeling of a GE T58 first-stage compressor blade showed that particle velocity was more detrimental than particle size, and horizontal and vertical displacement values varied with particle impingement angle.

Near-surface air temperature innovations were also applied to the top soil layer temperature to minimize disruption to the surface energy balance.

Subtractive hybridization was used in previous studies to uncover any common gene products present in TMT-sensitive tissues that might account for TMT\u2019s selective toxicity.  These studies showed that the gene product Stannin (Snn) was preferentially expressed in TMT sensitive tissues, with higher levels of Snn expression correlating with higher regional levels of TMT sensitivity.  In addition, using antisense oligonucleotides, Snn was found to be necessary, but not sufficient, for TMT toxicity.\n\n\nSnn is an 88 amino acid, membrane-bound protein with a molecular weight of 9.497 kDa.  Snn is found in vertebrate species and is highly conserved across vertebrates, with human and rat Snn showing 98% identity at the amino acid level.  Snn is widely expressed in the developing embryo; Snn expression becomes more restricted during maturation to adulthood.   In the adult, Snn is expressed in the spleen, immune cells, brain, kidney and lung.  Snn has no significant homology to any other known protein.  \n\n\nTumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) was shown to induce Snn mRNA expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).  We used quantitative, real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) to quantify the induction of Snn by TNFa in multiple cell lines.  We observed significant increases in Snn mRNA in a time-dependent manner in HUVECs and Jurkat T-cells.  To better define a potential mechanism underlying this induction, chemical inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) were used to determine if PKC played a role in TNFa-mediated Snn gene expression.  The results of these experiments indicated that one or more of the bII, d, g, or e isoforms was responsible for TNFa-mediated Snn gene expression.  To determine specifically which isoform(s) of PKC were involved, we utilized short interfering RNA technology (siRNA) and found that PKCe was responsible for mediating TNFa-induced Snn gene expression. \n\n     \nTMT can induce the expression of TNFa in mixed neuronal/glial cultures and so we hypothesized that TMT exposure would cause an increase in Snn gene expression, potentially as a necessary component of TMT toxicity.  Again, QRT-PCR was used and we found that TMT significantly upregulated Snn within 9 hours of exposure.  However, blocking TNFa with neutralizing antibodies resulted in only partial protection against TMT. \n\n   \nBy placing Snn in a defined TNFa-PKCe signaling pathway, several hypotheses arise concerning the function of Snn, such as Snn being part of a cell death or cell survival-signaling pathway.  Given the high level of conservation of Snn, generation of high-affinity, Snn-specific antisera has proven difficult.  In order to assess a potential role for Snn in the HUVEC response to TNFa, microarray technology was used.  We found that knocking Snn down via siRNA significantly altered HUVEC gene expression in response to TNFa.  After normalization and statistical analysis, we found that several genes altered by Snn knockdown are involved in the modulation of the cell cycle and cell growth.  Specifically, several genes are involved with p53 and Cyclin D1, known G1/S checkpoint proteins.  Functional assays showed that Snn knockdown resulted in significantly less HUVEC growth relative to other treatment.  Further, analysis via flow cytometry indicated that a significant portion of TNFa-, Snn siRNA co-treated HUVECs were halted in the G1 phase of the cell cycle.\n\n\nTogether, the data presented outline a signaling pathway leading to enhanced Snn gene expression as well as a potential role for Snn in normal cellular function.  A role in modulating the cell cycle would explain the high degree of conservation of Snn across vertebrate evolution as well as the tissue-specific pattern of expression of Snn during different life stages.  This work details the first known interaction of Snn in a cellular signaling pathway as well as the first evidence of a potential functional role of Snn in normal cells.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [672], "author_name_tesi": "Reese, Brian ", "last_name_ssi": "Reese", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Jong Kak Yun", "Robert J Milner", "James Robert Connor", "J Kyle Krady"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Chair", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Chair", "Robert J Milner, Committee Member", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "J Kyle Krady, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stannin", "TNFalpha", "PKC", "Trimethyltin"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Controlling Print?

These cities, like Detroit MI, Youngstown, OH, and St. Louis MO, once leaders of manufacturing and industry, now face the realities of depopulation, suburbanization, and manufacturing decline.  Many of these cities, some labeled as shrinking cities today, are accepting their changing infrastructure and seeking alternative policies in planning to help stem the losses of finance and human capital from leaving their borders.  One alternative some city planners are implementing are the planning principals of Smart Growth.  Smart Growth, developed in the early 1990s, is a universally accepted planning policy endorsed by the federal government and prominent planning organizations to help guide new and infill development in urban regions.  This policy is aimed at attempting to offset environmental damage caused by sprawling building practices and poor infill development policy.  Altoona, PA, is one such city exploring Smart Growth policies to mitigate depopulation and suburbanization through their comprehensive planning strategies.\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to examine how Smart Growth principles may be applied in shrinking cities, using Altoona, PA as a case study.  Smart Growth planning is chosen for its early history of infill development and it potential to mitigate shrinking conditions in cities like Altoona. Altoona is portrayed as a shrinking city based on four criteria: depopulation, deindustrialization, suburbanization, and globalization.  Each criterion is examined for its role in the shrinking process and related to conditions existing in Altoona today.  Based on this analysis, a demographic profile for Altoona is developed and used to more accurately compare Smart Growth planning practices in a shrinking city.  This thesis will attempt to answer two questions: 1) What Smart Growth planning principles are viable in a shrinking city like Altoona, PA? and 2) What Smart Growth planning principles are not viable in a shrinking city like Altoona, PA?  This thesis will conclude that Smart Growth planning does have a role in shrinking cities today; however, this role may be limited due to a lack of demographic diversity.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2413], "author_name_tesi": "Reese, Ian Chandler", "last_name_ssi": "Reese", "middle_name_ssi": "Chandler", "first_name_ssi": "Ian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Landscape Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean Burkholder", "Sean Burkholder", "Caru Bowns", "Kelleann Foster", "Peter John Aeschbacher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sean Burkholder, Thesis Advisor", "Sean Burkholder, Thesis Advisor", "Caru Bowns, Thesis Advisor", "Kelleann Foster, Thesis Advisor", "Peter John Aeschbacher, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Landscape Architecture", "Altoona", "Smart Growth", "Planning", "GIS"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "EDUCATION VOUCHER PROPOSALS:  A COMPARATIVE POLITICAL ANALYSIS OF SUCCESSFUL AND UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS AT LEGISLATION IN COLORADO AND PENNSYLVANIA", "id": "7600", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3126", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study focused on the politics and policy specifics surrounding voucher proposals and the factors affecting their legislative outcome.  The central questions guiding this research were: (1) What factors contributed to the successful voucher bills? (2) How were these factors present or absent in unsuccessful proposals? (3) What was different in the political process, \"policy windows,\" and circumstances surrounding the successful bills? (4) Why were the opponents not able to defeat the successful bills?  In short, why did a few voucher proposals succeed where the others failed?\n\tIn order to address these questions, a comparative case study was conducted.  The study used interviews and document analysis to collect data about the political environment and events surrounding education voucher proposals in Colorado and Pennsylvania.  Interviews with twenty four individuals identified by various sources as key voucher actors in the two states provided much insight to the events surrounding each proposal. Coverage from major newspapers and legislative archives offered additional data.  A review of the literature on successful proposals in Milwaukee, Cleveland, Florida, and Washington, D.C. provided points of contrast and comparison for the successful Colorado voucher proposal.\n\tThe framework for policy agenda setting established by John Kingdon (2003 [1984 1st ed., 1995 2nd ed.]), was used to identify, sort, and analyze the data of this study.  Specifically, the events surrounding the voucher proposals were aligned with the policy streams identified by Kingdon.  These streams included the problems that vouchers were to address, the politics involved in the legislative process, and the specifics of each policy offered as solutions to the problems.  Other contributing/contextual factors were also considered that were associated with the legislative outcome of each proposal.\n\tIn response to the guiding questions, this study found a combination of factors that were associated with the success of a proposal.  All successful proposals were based on a perception of a problem with public schools failing to provide an adequate education to all students, or as the catch phrase refers to \u201cstudents trapped in failing urban schools.\u201d The problem was most notable among poor, minority students.  The specifics of the successful voucher proposals included both sectarian and religious private schools, and provided enough money to allow students to attend the school of choice.  The successful proposals were also all targeted at and limited to disadvantaged students.  In terms of the politics surrounding the successful voucher proposals, all were introduced with Republican leadership.  The teachers unions were identified as the most significant group in opposition to the proposals.\nOther contributing/contextual factors including, funding for the proposals, non-traditional voucher advocates, disarray of the opposition, careful planning of a proposal, and a \u201cbest alternative\u201d attitude also seemed to impact the outcomes.  More than one of these contributing/contextual factors was associated with each of the successful proposals.  In Milwaukee, the funding was shifted from a failing desegregation law and a strong coalition of urban parents, led by policy entrepreneur Polly Williams, pushed for the law.  The Cleveland proposal also found support from a coalition of urban parents, and the plan was passed as part of the overall state budget.  The Florida proposal, also passed as part of the overall budget, had strong leadership from the Governor and support from the Democratic State Attorney General.  The disarray of the teacher\u2019s union in Washington, D.C. along with support from the Democratic mayor and school board president were associated with the success of that proposal.  Finally, the Colorado plan found support from the Democratic attorney general as well as a prominent, liberal child advocacy group.  The successful Colorado voucher proposal was well-crafted and noted as the \u201clesser evil\u201d of the three proposals introduced during the same legislative session.\nWhile these positive influences in terms of passing voucher legislation were found with the successful proposals, negative influences were coupled with the failed proposals.  In Pennsylvania, many participants discussed legislators being turned off by the doggedness of the Governor leading the charge for vouchers.  Participants suggested that legislators were turned off by the Governor\u2019s heavy handedness, and many simply did not want to give him what he wanted.  In both Colorado and Pennsylvania, the failed proposals were identified as vague or in constant flux.  Participants and media coverage in PA discussed how the details of the plans were often argued until the bitter end.  And, in Colorado, the two proposals introduced simultaneously with the successful plan, left many of the details to be determined after legislation.\nThe findings from this study can contribute to a discussion on future successful voucher legislation, both from an advocacy and opposition standpoint.  Also, a more careful examination of the role of the contributing/contextual factors may further enhance the policy agenda setting framework used in this study.  Further studies on other failed attempts at legislation may increase the validity of this study.  Finally, it is suggested that future research look at the role of the teachers unions in voucher legislation.  More specifically, research should focus on how well union opposition reflects the views of its members.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3115], "author_name_tesi": "Reese, Jillian P", "last_name_ssi": "Reese", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Jillian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr William L Boyd", "Nona Ann Prestine", "Dr John W Tippeconnic", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr William L Boyd, Committee Chair", "Nona Ann Prestine, Committee Member", "Dr John W Tippeconnic, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["school choice", "vouchers", "voucher proposals", "policy analysis", "Kingdon", "policy agenda setting"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "CRITICAL MEMBER REMOVAL AND LOAD REDISTRIBUTION OF A DETERIORATED TRUSS BRIDGE\n", "id": "9842", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3737", "abstract_tesi": "Serious questions surrounding the strength and stability of truss bridges and the adequacy of the aging infrastructure have arisen due to the collapses of the I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota and the Dysart Bridge in Cambria County, Pennsylvania.

Being able to understand the load redistribution as well as the global response of deteriorated truss bridges when critical members are removed needs to be fully understood to prevent any further collapses from occurring.  A pristine and deteriorated model was created to determine the effects of aging and deterioration on the critical member removal and load redistribution response of a truss bridge.  Key information in the analysis was the critical member (assumed to fail when it reached its yield capacity or critical buckling load), the critical load that caused the member to yield, the location of the critical load, and the failure sequence once the critical member was removed from the structure.  Eight stacked side-by-side HS-20 trucks caused the pristine model to fail while a loading of seven stacked side-by-side HS-20 trucks caused the deteriorated model to fail.

Numerical models were developed for each experimental test to calibrate material constitutive models.  \nFour full-scale vehicular tests were conducted to assess the performance and behavior of single boulders embedded in compacted AASHTO soil.

Two modeling techniques were recommended based on the expected boulder and soil deformation.

Ozone is a very powerful oxidizing agent. As such, it readily reacts with biological molecules found within the mucous layer of the respiratory system including glycoproteins, lipids and antioxidants. The reaction of O3 with the molecules in the mucous layer is so rapid that O3 itself might not contact the underlying endothelial tissue of the lung. Instead, the reaction products are frequently toxic and could diffuse through the mucous layer and produce the physiological\nresponses that are responsible for observed decrements in lung function.\n\nNumerous studies have established that while decrements in pulmonary function are reproducible within subjects, there exists a large variability between subjects for a\ngiven inhaled O3 concentration, ventilation rate, body surface area and age of the subject.\nIt is hypothesized that this unexplained variability in response between subjects is due to differences in local dose to target tissues which, in turn, may depend upon variations in\nthe anatomy and biochemistry of their respiratory system. An understanding of the local\ndose and uptake of O3 within the human lung is important for predicting the detrimental health effects for individuals exposed to O3. To this end, mathematical models that predict the uptake of O3 within the lung may be used to determine important model parameters and infer the uptake of O3 for exposure conditions that would be unsafe for human subjects. In this work, the specific objectives were: 1) to measure the uptake efficiency of O3 for a large group of men and women for a given exposure condition, 2)to use a mathematical model to predict uptake efficiency of O3 for a given subject and exposure condition and 3) to identify model parameters that can be adjusted for each subject to match the predicted uptake efficiency of the model to that individual\u2019s uptake\ndata.\n\nSixty subjects were exposed to continuous O3 concentrations of 0.25 parts per million for a 1-hour exposure at a target ventilation of 30 liters per minute. An apparatus monitored both the respired flow and O3 concentration at the airway opening from which the overall O3 uptake, tidal volume, breathing frequency and uptake efficiency were calculated for each minute of the exposure. Physiological measurements were also made to determine the total lung volume and respiratory dead space for each subject.\n\nA single-path model of the respiratory system was used to calculate the internal O3 distribution and uptake efficiency for a given inhaled O3 concentration, tidal volume, minute volume, lung volume and respiratory dead space. Physical parameters were identified in the single-path model as likely candidates to explain the between-subject variation, including mucous layer thickness, hydraulic diameter, longitudinal dispersion constant and reaction rate constant. Parameters that would likely explain the differences in uptake efficiency between the model and the data were identified by sensitivity analysis using physiologically relevant variation of the parameters.\n\nIt is demonstrated that reaction rate constants of substrates within the mucous layer can be adjusted on a subject by subject basis in the simulation to generate estimates of uptake efficiency that match individual subject data.

Researchers have commonly used Likert scales to measure help-seeking tendencies in many studies. However, the existing scales of executive help-seeking have been unable to distinguish executive help-seeking (seeking an answer from an external source) from avoidant help-seeking (not seeking help when help is needed) in academic contexts.  Therefore, in the first study, a new scale that measured executive help-seeking is created to reflect the positive aspects of executive help-seeking, which may be more evident in entrepreneurship education. Results from the study provided two types of validity evidence to suggest that the Pragmatic Executive Help-seeking scale measures a distinct element of help-seeking.\n      The second study continues to provide a foundation for studying help-seeking in entrepreneurship education.  A majority of help-seeking research has considered an individual\u2019s help-seeking tendencies to be fairly consistent within a given environment and has not examined how different problems may influence help-seeking behavior.  However, the type of problem (i.e. interpersonal vs. technological) likely influences help-seeking behavior. Since little research exists about the types of problems that arise when working on projects within entrepreneurship education, entrepreneurial students are interviewed about their experiences in Study 2. The results indicate that students encountered several different types of problems including: cultural problems; problems evaluating or integrating information; problems obtaining or managing resources and finances; problems during the idea generation process; legal problems; problems managing or working with teammates; problems arising from a lack of prior knowledge; problems with technology; and problems managing time. The results from Study 2 inform the creation of an instrument containing general problem scenarios that can be used to examine help-seeking intentions at a problem level. \t\n      The third study utilizes the scale and the instrument that were developed in the previous studies to test for differences in help-seeking tendencies and intention between entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial students.  Additionally, analyses examine how the perception of problems\u2019 characteristics (i.e. problem severity, difficulty, novelty, etc.) impacts students\u2019 intention to seek help. The results of Study 3 indicate that when holding other characteristics constant, confidence in ability to overcome a problem significantly predicted help-seeking intention across all the problem scenarios.

This structure, the Futaba fault, bounds the exhumed Abukuma massif on the east and places Cretaceous granites in fault contact with Miocene to Pliocene near-shore to terrestrial, tephra-rich sands and silts.  Recent uplift of the massif by slip along the Futaba fault is implied by a regionally extensive footwall syncline, the absence of Neogene sediments in the hanging wall, and high relief on the eastern margin of the massif. New structural field data and existing map data that characterize the surface expression of the fold are used as inputs in a kinematic fault related-fold model to constrain subsurface fault geometry and total slip for the Futaba fault. Results of forward trishear models show that the structure is best modeled as the result of deformation associated with ~2.2 km of slip along a 50\u00ba-75\u00ba west-dipping reverse fault.  Dated tephra beds that span the transition from pre-growth to growth units at the southern tip of the fault bracket the onset of deformation between 3.95 - 5.6 Ma, and result in average slip rate of 0.4-0.6 mm/yr, an uplift rate of 0.4-0.5 mm/yr, and a shortening rate of 0.1-0.2 mm/yr. Inner forearc shortening along the Futaba fault is contemporaneous with offshore subsidence along the northeastern Japan margin, which has been interpreted to reflect basal erosion of the upper plate. The shortening along the Futaba fault and other contractional structures across the upper plate suggests that the entire forearc may be responding to changes in plate boundary tractions and that inner forearc shortening and outer forearc subsidence may be genetically linked.  Inner forearc shortening may result in changes in forearc slope, loading of the outer forearc, and an increase in sediment supply to offshore basins.  This suggests that a portion of the subsidence record previously interpreted to reflect basal erosion may be the result of shortening in the inner forearc, and that inner forearc shortening is an important contributor to mass balance of the subduction zone.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [923], "author_name_tesi": "Regalla, Christine Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Regalla", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Christine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Myron Fisher", "Donald Myron Fisher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Myron Fisher, Thesis Advisor", "Donald Myron Fisher, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["active tectonics", "Japan", "forearc", "reverse fault"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Cenozoic forearc tectonics in northeastern Japan: Relationships between outer forearc subsidence and plate boundary kinematics  ", "id": "18897", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8999", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Here we investigate the relationships between outer forearc subsidence, the timing and kinematics of upper plate deformation and plate convergence rate in Northeast Japan to evaluate the role of plate boundary dynamics in driving forearc subsidence.

However, we propose that a significant component of forearc subsidence could be the result of dynamic changes in plate boundary geometry. We provide new constraints on the timing and kinematics of deformation along inner forearc faults, new analyses of the evolution of outer forearc tectonic subsidence, and updated calculations of plate convergence rate.  These data collectively reveal a temporal correlation between the onset of regional forearc subsidence, the initiation of upper plate extension, and an acceleration in local plate convergence rate. A similar analysis of the kinematic evolution of the Tonga, Izu-Bonin, and Mariana subduction zones indicates that the temporal correlations observed in Japan are also characteristic of these three non-accretionary margins.  Comparison of these data with published geodynamic models suggests that forearc subsidence is the result of temporal variability in slab geometry due to changes in slab buoyancy and plate convergence rate.

Although ecological indicators such as aquatic macroinvertebrates are widely used to assess stream integrity, the relationship between nutrient runoff and stream ecological response remains indistinct.  This ambiguity is due, in part, to the logistical and financial hurdles of obtaining high-resolution empirical measurements of nutrients to compare to ecological metrics.  However, landscape models that simulate runoff may be a more practical alternative.  The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is one such model and was used in this study to simulate nutrient runoff in a small, upland, agricultural watershed in east-central Pennsylvania that drains into Mahantango Creek, a tributary to the Susquehanna River.  Macroinvertebrate communities were sampled at 13 sites during May 2014 and described using an Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI).  A broad range of scores was observed, indicating differential levels of degradation within the study area that ranged from low to very high.  The distribution of IBI scores also indicated that biological integrity was moderately degraded in many reaches throughout the study area.  Land cover metrics and the Stream-Wetland-Riparian (SWR) Index, an in-field rapid assessment of site condition, both indicated that agricultural stressors were a major cause of this degradation.\nThirty spatio-temporal scales of nutrient data were identified from SWAT model output, and three nutrients were considered in the analyses:  total phosphorus, total nitrate, and total organic nitrogen.  Best Subsets Regression was performed on the IBI scores using SWAT, land cover, and SWR variables, and regression models were found to be highly significant.  Grab samples of nitrate concentrations were also collected once per season at each site and compared with modeled nitrate levels.  In contrast to the SWAT-modeled nutrient outputs, grab sample nitrate showed no significant relationship with IBI score, supporting the premise that sporadic empirical sampling is an insufficient measure of overall nutrient pollution and is inadequate for characterizing the relationship between nutrient runoff and macroinvertebrate community integrity.  This study is among the first to illustrate the value of the SWAT model as a viable alternative to empirical sampling of nutrients in aquatic systems.

In previous work anomalous increases in electrical conductivity measured in and around contaminated aquifers have been associated with biogeochemical activity.  The respiration and growth of micro-organisms has been suggested as a possible cause of these conductivity signals.  However, a quantitative link between the activity of micro-organisms and electrical conductivity has not been established. \nIn this dissertation changes in the fluid electrical conductivity (&#963;f) and &#963;b are related to changes in chemical concentrations at multiple scales.  Changes in &#963;f can be interpreted as reaction rates if the stoichiometry of the reaction is understood.  Results from batch experiments demonstrate that measured changes in &#963;f over time document rates of abiotic and biotic reduction of goethite. \nIn two column reactors packed with sediments from Oyster Virginia and fed with an input containing dissolved acetate, measured changes in &#963;b initially document biogeochemical reaction rates of iron reduction or nitrate reduction.  Eventually, &#963;b becomes decoupled from changes in chemical concentrations and increases significantly.  Fe(II) adsorption does not cause &#963;b to become decoupled from aqueous chemistry.  Instead, this decoupling is attributed to the growth and presence of an electrically conductive biofilm.  Reactive transport modeling is used to constrain the amount of biomass produced in each reactor.  A value for electrical conductivity is estimated that depends on the calculated growth in biomass and the assumed density of that biomass.  For iron-reducing conditions biofilms, the model is consistent with values of biofilm conductivity > 2.2 S/m, and for nitrate reducing conditions, with conductivity > 300 S/m.  These values are the first estimates for biofilm electrical conductivity based on column reactor experiments.  \nThe results of a field-scale tracer test involving nitrate reduction are also presented.  The results suggest that electrical conductivity may be able to track biogeochemical activity if the tracers are large enough and conductive enough to be detectable.

This and other factors such as the negative environmental impact of heavy chemical applications and limited availability of commercially acceptable LB resistant tomato cultivars have prompted the identification and use of genetic resistance to complement other management practices in an integrated pest management program for LB.

The objective of this project is to continue the transfer of these LB resistant genes into Penn State fresh market and processing tomato lines, which have been bred for other desirable horticultural characteristics.  The resistance genes were traced through a combination of phenotypic selection (PS) and marker-assisted selection (MAS).  Tomato families containing at least one resistance gene were inoculated with a LB isolate and screened for LB resistance under greenhouse conditions.  Plants exhibiting the most phenotypic resistance were genotyped using CAPS and SSR markers.  Plants selected based on PS and MAS were grown under field conditions and evaluated for other desirable horticultural characteristics, including fruit quality and yield.  The selected plants were hybridized with other Penn State inbred lines for further improvement.  The phenotypic and genotypic screening process was repeated to develop further advanced populations.  The ultimate goal of this project is to develop advanced breeding lines with LB resistance and other desirable horticultural characteristics suitable for production in PA and the Northeast.

The second phase focused on flow visualization and measurement on a rotor hub and rotor hub/pylon geometry in the 12-inch diameter water tunnel.  Stereo PIV was conducted in a cross plane downstream of the hub and flow visualization was conducted using oil paint and fluorescent dye. The third phase concentrated on high accuracy load measurement and prediction up to full-scale Reynolds number on a 1:4.25 scale model in the 48-inch diameter water tunnel.  Measurements include 6 degree of freedom loads on the hub and two-component laser-Doppler velocimetry in the wake.

Apart from this Lewis basic role, phosphines also engage in redox chemistries, acting primarily as stoichiometric O-atom acceptors for classical P(III)/P(V)=O processes such as the Wittig reaction. Recent advances have begun to render many of these transformations catalytic in phosphorus, demonstrating the capacity of phosphines to behave as competent main group redox catalysts. Yet despite the significant progress in this area, applying the redox-active nature of organophosphorus compounds towards non-deoxygenative organic synthesis remains a substantial challenge. This dissertation seeks to address this potentially impactful challenge, and therefore describes the development of several non-oxo P(III)/P(III+n) (n = 1, 2) redox processes. Specifically, Chapter 2 details the reversible single electron oxidation of P-stereogenic phosphines, and the ensuing consequences with respect to structural/stereochemical integrity. Chapters 3 and 4 concern a novel phosphorus-catalyzed regioselective reduction of allylic bromides, and the critical role of strained phosphacycles on the P(III)/P(V) redox cycle. Chapter 5 further demonstrates the impact of organophosphorus structure on reactivity, allowing for the divergent reactivity of ethynylphosphonium cations. Taken together, these individual processes provide further insight into the fundamental impacts of both oxidation state and structural perturbations on the reactivity of organophosphorus compounds, and develop a framework with which to further expand redox-active organophosphorus processes.

Yet much of the basic the physiology of these organisms is poorly understood.  This dissertation strives to further the understanding of gene regulation in the methanogenic archaea using the model organism, Methanosarcina acetivorans.  The first two chapters provide overviews of the methanogens and of the current understanding on archaeal transcription.  The final four chapters describe the experimental work performed.  A functional investigation of the three TATA-binding protein (TBP) homologs in M. acetivorans is described in chapter 3.  TBP1 was found to function as the primary general transcription factor (GTF) and was essential for M. acetivorans growth.  The minor TBPs, TBP2 and TBP3 were dispensable for growth but required for optimal fitness during culturing with acetate likely due to a role in the optimization of gene expression.  Chapter 4 analyzes the transcriptional response of M. acetivorans diauxic growth with methanol and acetate.   This analysis of a metabolic transition, the first of its kind for a methanogen, significantly contributed to the understanding of M. acetivorans physiology and ascribed potential biological roles to numerous previously uncharacterized or poorly characterized genes.  The fifth chapter describes a functional investigation of MA3302, a member of a widespread yet uncharacterized family of euryarchaeal transcription factors.  MA3302 expression was elevated during acetoclastic growth, was required for optimal growth on this substrate and was highly conserved in acetotrophic methanogens consistent with an involvement in transcriptional regulation during growth on acetate.  Future investigations will seek to identify target genes for regulation by MA3302 and to overexpress, purify and characterize the recombinant MA3302 protein.  Ongoing investigations addressing the roles of the three M. acetivorans TBP homologs are presented in the final chapter.  Unresolved issues under investigation include assessments of why tbp1 is essential for M. acetivorans growth and of physiological consequence resulting from the simultaneous deletion of tbp2 and tbp3 and to identify DNA-binding loci for each TBP isomer on the M. acetivorans chromosome.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an early numeracy intervention designed specifically for use in Head Start classrooms. Ninety-six children from six Head Start classrooms (three intervention and three comparison) participated in the study. During a 13-week period, intervention teachers facilitated one whole- or small-group activity and one transition activity per day. In addition, intervention teachers provided mathematics activities for children to explore independently at a math center. Child outcomes were measured before and after the intervention using the Test of Early Mathematics Ability \u2013 3rd Edition and the EARLI Numeracy probes. Teacher reports and classroom observations were used to assess implementation fidelity, quality of mathematics instruction in the classrooms, and teacher acceptability of the intervention.\n\nHierarchical regression analyses were run to determine if intervention condition was a significant predictor of the criterion variables when controlling for pretest scores and demographic characteristics. Overall, children who participated in the intervention made significant gains on the post-test measures. However, the gains were not significantly greater than those made by children in the comparison condition. Descriptive data indicated that intervention teachers spent more time facilitating mathematics activities and provided higher quality instruction than comparison teachers. Classroom observation and teacher report indicated the intervention teachers conducted the intervention as designed; however, the accuracy of the teacher report data was questionable due to several inconsistencies in reporting. Intervention teachers reported satisfaction with the intervention, but indicated ways in which the intervention could be improved. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1740], "author_name_tesi": "Reid, Erin E", "last_name_ssi": "Reid", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Erin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "School Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Clyde Diperna", "James Clyde Diperna", "Mark T Greenberg", "Robert Leslie Hale", "Pui Wa Lei"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Clyde Diperna, Dissertation Advisor", "James Clyde Diperna, Committee Chair", "Mark T Greenberg, Committee Member", "Robert Leslie Hale, Committee Member", "Pui Wa Lei, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["numeracy", "mathematics", "preschool", "Head Start", "early childhood education", "intervention"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Validity and Diagnostic Accuracy of Scores from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-generic", "id": "15379", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7687", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the internal structure, relationships with other variables, and diagnostic accuracy of scores on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule \u2013 Generic (ADOS-G; Lord et al., 1999) for the purpose of diagnostic decision-making. Participants were 462 children enrolled in a public school district in the southern U.S. who were referred for a school-based psychoeducational evaluation. Four hypotheses were tested with mixed results. The first prediction was that items included in the Original Scoring Algorithm (OSA) would reflect a uni-dimensional construct, and items included in the Revised Scoring Algorithm (RSA) would reflect two constructs across modules. Exploratory factor analysis confirmed the one-factor structure of the OSA across modules. However, a two-factor structure was not retained for the Module 2 or Module 3 RSA. Second, it was predicted that total scores on the ADOS-G, across modules and scoring algorithms, would demonstrate moderate to strong relations with scores from other measures of autistic behavior, and weak relations with measures of emotional functioning. Weak relationships were consistently measured between participants\u2019 scores on the ADOS-G across modules and algorithms and other measures of autistic and emotional functioning. Third, it was predicted that scores obtained from application of the RSA would result in greater diagnostic accuracy than those obtained from the OSA. Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ADOS-G scores. Consistent with hypotheses, the RSA typically resulted in greater diagnostic accuracy, and a better balance between sensitivity and specificity than did the OSA. Finally, the fourth hypothesis, which predicted that the diagnostic accuracy of the ADOS-G would be lower with an independent criterion relative to an interdependent criterion, was not consistently supported.  In general, results of the current study confirm the structural validity and overall diagnostic accuracy of the ADOS-G, but also highlight some of the limitations of the instrument.

I show herein that the syn conformation is common in functional RNA, often in functional locations in riboswitches, aptamers, and ribozymes.  In the hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, as an example, only one base in 100 takes the syn conformation, but mutation of that base reduces catalytic activity as much as 3000-fold.

These CRNs have already been incorporated systematically to improve kinetics in the leadzyme system.  I present preliminary evidence that 8BrGTP and 8BrATP can be incorporated during transcription.

The pleotropic biological role of NF-kB is explained by its involvement in the regulation of growth factors, immune receptors and ligands, and apoptosis inhibitors.  Knock-out mice studies have further defined the specific function of individual NF-kB members in regulating different aspects of immune function as well as the development of lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues.  In concert with functional studies, a vast amount of knowledge has been gained about how NF-kB is activated, how it is regulated and the genes which it in turn regulates.  The activation of NF-kB occurs through a highly ordered pathway whereby the activation of a large kinase complex, IkB kinase (IKK), leads to the phosphorylation of IkB, its subsequent ubiquitination, proteasome-mediated degradation, and the concurrent release and nuclear translocation of NF-kB. IKK is clearly a cornerstone in the signaling pathway leading to NF-kB activation. \n\nA major missing link in the NF-kB signaling pathway is the mechanism that connects IKK to different upstream signals.  It is generally believed that IKK may be activated by distinct upstream kinases in response to different stimuli.  Indeed, a number of upstream kinases have been shown to activate IKK; these include members of the MAP3 kinase family, such as MEKK1, MEKK3, NIK and TAK1.  Further, the physiological role of these upstream kinases in mediating receptor-specific IKK activation is becoming increasingly recognized.  Connecting the MAP3Ks to the cell surface receptors, especially those belonging to the TNF receptor (TNFR) superfamily, are the adaptor proteins TRAFs.  TRAFs may activate the MAP3Ks via a novel signaling mechanism involving ubiquitination, which occurs through lysine-63 linkages that do not target protein degradation but appear to specifically lead to signal activation.  Emerging evidence suggests that TRAF-mediated ubiquitination is important for the activation of both IKK and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by various TNFR members, as well as certain other immune receptors, such as the toll-like receptors and IL-1 receptors.  It is thus apparent that the ubiquitination activity of TRAFs must be under tight control.  \n\nRecent biochemical studies have identified a negative regulator of TRAF-ubiquitination.  This factor, CYLD, was originally discovered as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in cylindromatosis, a predisposition to tumors of skin appendages.  CYLD belongs to the deubiquitination enzyme (DUB) family, which digests ubiquitin chains.  At least in transfected cells, CYLD inhibited the ubiquitination of two major TRAF members, TRAF2 and TRAF6, as well as the ubiquitination of a downstream target, IKKg.  Consistent with its DUB activity, CYLD negatively regulates the activation of NF-kB by TRAFs and TNFRs.  These in vitro studies provide an insight into the tumor suppressor function of CYLD and shed light on the signaling role of this DUB.  However, the physiological function of CYLD in the immune system and other biological systems remain unclear.  Hence, the work described in this thesis was aimed at understanding the physiological role of CYLD.  A number of unique findings are presented here:\n\n1) CYLD is a non-redundant DUB of TRAF2.  Although initial reports suggest that overexpressed CYLD inhibits the ubiquitination of transfected TRAF2, it has remained unclear whether CYLD indeed serves as a critical regulator of TRAF2 under endogenous conditions.  By RNA interference-(RNAi)-mediated CYLD knock down, we demonstrated that the loss of endogenous CYLD resulted in constitutive ubiquitination of endogenous TRAF2.  This finding suggest that CYLD is a key DUB that controls the state of TRAF2 ubiquitination.  \n\n2) CYLD is a negative regulator of both IKK and JNK.  Our CYLD knock down studies reveal that the loss of endogenous CYLD caused hyperactivation of not only IKK, but also JNK.  Further, the ability of CYLD to regulate JNK was specific for immune receptors and involved the upstream kinase MKK7, but not MKK4.  \n\n3) The DUB function of CYLD is negatively regulated by its phosphorylation.  CYLD becomes transiently phosphorylated along with signal-induced activation of JNK and IKK.  We mapped the phosphorylation sites of CYLD to seven serines.  Interestingly, the phosphorylation of CYLD appears to involve IKK, and this posttranslational modification caused inactivation of CYLDs ability to deubiquitinate TRAF2.  Consequently, CYLD mutants that are defective in phosphorylation prevents signal-induced TRAF2 ubiquitination and a loss in the negative regulation of JNK and IKK.  These findings suggest a model where CYLD phosphorylation serves as a mechanism to inactivate its DUB function, thus allowing transient activation of TRAF2 ubiquitination and initiation of downstream signaling pathways.  \n\n4) Establishment of CYLD as an immune regulator.  In order to understand the physiological functions of CYLD, we generated CYLD knockout mice.  Although these mutant mice had no gross abnormalities in growth or survival, they displayed clear defects in the immune system.  First, the number of peripheral T cells was significantly reduced in the spleens of CYLD -/- mice.  This defect was at least partially due to a defect in thymocyte development from the double-positive to the single-positive stage, which was more pronounced for CD4+ T cells.  Second, CYLD -/- T cells were hyper-responsive to TCR stimulation, producing markedly larger amounts of cytokines than control T cells.  These findings suggest that CYLD is a negative regulator of T cell activation, where it is required for T cell development in the thymus.  Since it is the step of negative selection that appears to be affected by the loss of CYLD, the CYLD deficiency may cause abnormal TCR signaling, resulting in uncontrolled T cell deletion during this stage of development.   \nIn summary, the work presented here 1) defines a signaling function for CYLD in regulating TRAF ubiquitination and activation of NF-kB and JNK, 2) elucidates a mechanism of CYLD regulation, which involves its site specific phosphorylation and 3) demonstrates a role for CYLD in the regulation of T cell development and activation.  These results provide significant insight into the physiological function of CYLD as well as the mechanism of its regulation.  These findings also provide an example for how a DUB participates in signal regulation of the immune system.    \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6568], "author_name_tesi": "Reiley, William  Walter", "last_name_ssi": "Reiley", "middle_name_ssi": " Walter", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shao Cong Sun", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Vincent Chau", "Neil David Christensen", "David Joseph Spector"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shao Cong Sun, Committee Chair", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Vincent Chau, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["IKKgamma", "Cylindromatosis", "Deubiquitinating Enzyme", "CYLD", "NF-kappaB"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Reading Gender(ing) through Pedagoggy in Action: A Multiple Case Study Employing Critical Discourse Analysis\n", "id": "10007", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1302", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Feminism as a frame of reference (and feminist pedagogy in particular) attributes the socialization process of gendering primarily to cultural influences and media representations along with attitudes and ideals taught/learned at home.

At some level, schools unavoidably do teach such cultural constructions.

Specifically, this research employs Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) to illustrate how discourses of gender are pedagogically engaged within and throughout such interactions. Four emergent themes of discourse are identified: 1) binary conventions [e.g., constructing activities, perspectives, (cap)abilities, and consequences as gendered]; 2) feminized identities [e.g., princess- and sissy-talk]; 3) designer labels off-the-rack [e.g., using clothing to construct, allow for, motivate, and/or exoticize gendered identities]; and 4) \u201cinformed outsiders\u201d [e.g., courtship, marriage, and child rearing as understood by children]. Ultimately, this study aims to encourage ongoing reflection as well as consciousness raising among veteran and preservice teachers with regard to the gendered discourses they might encourage, exercise, and/or exclude as part of their overall instruction, beyond just those lessons that entail reading aloud to others.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1291], "author_name_tesi": "Reilly, Cole ", "last_name_ssi": "Reilly", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["J Daniel Marshall Ph D", "John Daniel Marshall", "Stephanie Cayot Serriere", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Lorraine Dowler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["J Daniel Marshall Ph D, Dissertation Advisor", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Chair", "Stephanie Cayot Serriere, Committee Chair", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Lorraine Dowler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["feminist pedagogy", "pedagogy", "read-alouds", "discourse analysis", "gendering", "gender", "class discussions", "social constructivism"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Deep Pore Pressures and Seafloor Venting in the Auger Basin, Gulf of Mexico\n", "id": "9148", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4197", "abstract_tesi": "I map the distribution of subsurface pressures in thick interconnected sand bodies that are present across the Auger Basin, Gulf of Mexico.

Fundamental studies aimed at providing information to aid in the design of more efficient and selective catalysts for the abatement of this harmful environmental pollutant were conducted. Gas phase metal oxide cluster studies are a valuable complementary technique to surface methods for elucidating the mechanistic details and active sites of catalytic systems. To this end, gas phase studies were utilized to uncover possible species responsible for the increased activity and selectivity of noble metal and transition metal nanoparticle catalysts. A guided ion beam\nmass spectrometer was employed to study the dissociation patterns and interactions with\nCO of mass selected clusters. This provides information into specific reaction pathways\nbased on cluster size, ionic charge and oxidation state, stoichiometry and coordinative\nsaturation.\n   There has been recent interest in the activity of gold nanoparticles toward the oxidation of CO and studies herein have focused on the effects of charge state in elucidating the mechanism. Most reactions of gold oxide cations underwent oxygen replacement by CO, however evidence of other reaction pathways including CO oxidation for both Au4O2+ and Au4O3+ species were also observed. Compared to anionic gold oxide clusters of the same stoichiometry, CO oxidation was previously found to be the dominant reaction channel. Anionic clusters were governed by a structure-reactivity\nrelationship in which a peripheral oxygen atom was the most efficient reaction center for\neffecting CO oxidation. Density functional calculations found molecularly bound oxygen in the ground state structure of cationic clusters in which oxygen atom replacement by CO was observed in experiments. High barriers to O-O bond dissociation suggest the role of ionic charge may be an important factor governing the reaction. A mechanism based on a triplet-singlet spin state transition was proposed that may provide a pathway with lower barriers for O2 dissociation in order to explain the experimentally observed reaction products.\n   Next, studies involving mixed metal oxide clusters were undertaken to probe to effects of catalyst-dopant interactions and gain a deeper understanding of the principles governing the oxidation of CO. Comparison of the reactions of pure metal oxides with CO to experiments of bimetallic oxides can aid in determining the influence that each individual metal exhibits and the changes that occur in reactivity when another metal is present. Studies involving silver-gold dimer oxide clusters were conducted and provide insight into the role of charge transfer between different metals. AgAuO1,2+ species showed similar reaction products as pure gold oxide cationic clusters, while AgAuO3,4+\nreacted similar to pure silver oxide clusters with the same stoichiometry. Only AgAuO2- exhibited oxygen atom transfer which was different from reactions of either pure metal\noxide. This provides experimental evidence of density functional calculations that previously predicted the reaction of AgAu- with O2 and CO promotes CO oxidation.\n   Studies concerning 3d transition metals were conducted to investigate their activity as common catalytic support materials and their ability toward direct oxidation of CO. Structural elucidation was conducted through CID experiments and density functional calculations were performed for iron oxide ionic clusters. Reactions of iron oxide cations with CO were compared to anionic clusters. Both ionic charge states were shown promote CO oxidation; however, attachment of CO onto the metal cluster was\nonly observed for cationic clusters. Calculated energy profiles of the reaction demonstrated that the oxidation efficiency was governed by the strength of oxygen binding to the iron atom. The results provide important insight into the nature of the active site for condensed phase catalysis, shedding light on the role of charge state for CO oxidation in the presence of iron oxide clusters. \n   The behavior of several other 3d transition metal oxide clusters, cobalt, nickel and copper, were undertaken to examine possible periodic trends. The dissociation patterns and reactivity in the presence of CO for these metal oxides were similar to iron oxides for each respective charge state. The most active stoichiometry for CO oxidation was MxOy+ where y=x for cationic clusters and MxOy- where y=x+1 for anionic clusters with the exception of  Cu3O3-. The same number of Cu atoms and oxygen atoms was a particularly active stoichiometry. This may be a consequence of the electron density for copper, which possesses a full orbital shell. Comparison of cations and anions showed that cations were more efficient in their particular reaction channels requiring less CO\nreactant gas to observe reaction products.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4582], "author_name_tesi": "Reilly, Nelly Moore", "last_name_ssi": "Reilly", "middle_name_ssi": "Moore", "first_name_ssi": "Nelly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "James Bernhard Anderson", "Nicholas Winograd", "Robert John Santoro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Chair", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CO oxidation", "catalysis", "gold oxide", "gas-phase"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "It\u2019s just good leadership, or is it?

With this focus I both draw from then contribute to STIN development in three ways. First, I articulate that STIN focuses attention to social change rather than simply a technical change with social consequences. Second, I argue that STIN should focus on the values associated with information.

A key objective of such programs is to understand the performance of these fuels and materials during irradiation. In DOE-NE\u2019s FCRD program, ultrasonic based technology was identified as a key approach that should be pursued to obtain the high-fidelity, high-accuracy data required to characterize the behavior and performance of new candidate fuels and structural materials during irradiation testing.\nThe radiation, high temperatures, and pressure can limit the available tools and characterization methods.  In this thesis, two ultrasonic characterization techniques will be explored.  The first, finite amplitude wave propagation has been demonstrated to be sensitive to microstructural material property changes.  It is a strong candidate to determine fuel evolution; however, it has not been demonstrated for in-situ reactor applications.  In this thesis, finite amplitude wave propagation will be used to measure the microstructural evolution in Al-6061.  This is the first demonstration of finite amplitude wave propagation at temperatures in excess of 200 \u00b0C and during an irradiation test.  Second, a method based on contact nonlinear acoustic theory will be developed to identify compressed cracks.  Compressed cracks are typically transparent to ultrasonic wave propagation; however, by measuring harmonic content developed during finite amplitude wave propagation, it is shown that even compressed cracks can be characterized.\nLastly, piezoelectric transducers capable of making these measurements are developed.

Within a social-functional framework, a series of analyses are conducted on learner data from a corpus of directive language produced by ITAs in preparation courses participating in office hour role plays and expert data from a genre-comparable subcorpus of office hours in MICASE, the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (Simpson et al., 2002). The five interrelated studies are comprised of 1) a grounded analysis to identify directive constructions, 2) a corpus-based register analysis to compare learner and expert use, 3) a genre analysis of the contextual features and text-based moves of office hours, 4) an analysis of individual usage focusing on three learners, and 5) an experimental study of the efficacy of a directives instructional unit. Findings show that compared to expert speakers, learners use fewer inclusion and independence appeals towards students, and use preferred constructions more frequently and from a smaller repertoire, often relying on multi-functional constructions like \u2018you can\u2019. Findings from the analysis of individual usage show a disconnect among how ITAs have been socialized by their schooling, what they are taught in ITA preparation courses, what they do and experience in their departments, classrooms, and offices, and the kinds of academic teaching professionals they say they want to become. Results from the experimental intervention show that instruction using a corpus-informed language awareness approach has a positive impact on use. Overall, the project has implications for ITA preparation, usage-based materials design, corpus-based pragmatics and politeness research, and the nascent field of applied learner corpus analysis.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3012], "author_name_tesi": "Reinhardt, Jonathon S", "last_name_ssi": "Reinhardt", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steve L Thorne", "Karen E Johnson", "Paula Golombek", "Celeste S Kinginger", "Michael Mc Carthy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steve L Thorne, Committee Chair", "Karen E Johnson, Committee Member", "Paula Golombek, Committee Member", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member", "Michael Mc Carthy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["office hours", "genre analysis", "contrastive corpus analysis", "international teaching assistants", "directive language", "language awareness"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "A COMPARATIVE SOCIO-HISTORICAL CONTENT ANALYSIS OF TREATIES AND CURRENT AMERICAN INDIAN EDUCATION\nLEGISLATION WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR THE STATE OF MICHIGAN\n", "id": "6428", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4191", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study is focused on the relationship between two historical policy era of American Indian education--the Constitutional/Treaty Provisions Era and the Self-Determination/Revitalization Era.

Thus, due in great part to the notion of an idealized NS teacher of ESL (Leun, Harris, & Rampton, 1997) that circulates within various professional discourses, many skilled NNESTs struggle to form a professional identity as legitimate TESOL professionals in the contexts where they teach (Canagarajah, 1999), since NS status permanently eludes them. In light of this challenge, making sure that NNESTs are supported in developing and asserting a professional identity is a key concern in second language teacher education. The present, ethnographically-oriented study argues that participation in dialogic narrative inquiry as a form of professional development can support NNESTs in their efforts to claim professional authority vis-\u00e0-vis the NS myth and ideology. Specifically, it explores how a focus on NNEST-related issues provided useful resources to participants (teaching assistants in the ESL program of a large American university) as they challenged the NS myth, while conceiving of, articulating, and internalizing alternative ESL teacher identities with which to (re)position themselves as  legitimate language professionals. This interventional focus, implemented through participation in online group discussions and via a dialogic blog with the researcher, as well as through engagement with an instructional curriculum addressing NNEST issues, served as mediational means for the teachers to reconceptualize their instructional practices, and influenced the way in which their very students (undergraduate-level ESL learners) came to think of themselves as English speakers and users. Data excerpts from a variety of sources, including online discussions, dialogic blogs, classroom observations, stimulated recall sessions, teacher interviews, and students\u2019 writing, are used to illustrate the findings. The overall theoretical framework for this project is Vygotskian sociocultural theory, complemented by a grounded content analysis based on the principles of ethnographic semantics (Spradley, 1979; Spradley & McCurdy, 1972) and on the constant comparative method (Bogdan & Biklin, 1998; Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Goetz & LeCompte, 1981).

A central protein implicated in the regulation of protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis is referred to as the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).  However, while the protein kinase referred to as the mTOR has been implicated in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis in the liver, inhibition of mTOR does not alter the rate of protein synthesis.  The overall objective of the research presented herein was to gain insight into the translational regulation of gene expression in rat liver in response to two physiological perturbations, food intake and endurance exercise.  In response to food intake, phosphorylation of two substrates of mTOR, the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)4E binding protein-1 4E-BP1 and the ribosomal protein (rp) S6 kinase S6K1 and its substrate rpS6, was increased within 15 min and was sustained for at least 180 min.  Activation of S6K1 has been linked to upregulated translation of a subset of mRNAs. To identify translationally regulated mRNAs, polysomal (i.e. actively translated) and nonpolysomal (non-translated) fractions were isolated and subjected to microarray analysis. The mRNAs encoding 78 proteins, including 42 proteins involved in protein synthesis, exhibited increased abundance in polysomes in response to feeding.  In contrast, the mRNAs encoding 50 proteins displayed decreased abundance in polysomes in response to feeding. \nIn another study, the effect of a single bout of treadmill running on signaling through mTOR in liver was examined in 12 h fasted rats.  Phosphorylation of a downstream target of mTOR, 4E-BP1, was decreased after exercise to values even lower than the fasting-induced basal levels.  Phosphorylation of another mTOR target, S6K1, was already maximally repressed by fasting and was not further reduced by exercise, and phosphorylation of rpS6 was unaltered by endurance exercise.  Neither the global rate of protein synthesis nor the proportion of the mRNA encoding b-actin associated with polysomes was changed after exercise from the basal fasting state.  However, the proportion of the mRNAs containing a 5\u2019-TOP sequence associated with polysomes was significantly lower in liver after exercise suggesting that the translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins was specifically repressed.\nActivation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) occurs in response to extended food deprivation and endurance exercise and could act as a common mediator for the changes in mTOR signaling.  For this reason, the role of AMPK activation in the regulation of mTOR was evaluated in the intact liver.  Phosphorylation of AMPK either in vivo or in situ was associated with a repression of protein synthesis as well as decreased phosphorylation of a number of targets of mTOR signaling including S6K1, eIF4G, and 4E-BP1.  Together, the results demonstrate a coordinated response in the liver to changes in nutrient and hormonal status to alter gene expression through translational control mechanisms in the liver.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [192], "author_name_tesi": "Reiter, Ali Kathleen", "last_name_ssi": "Reiter", "middle_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "first_name_ssi": "Ali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Scot R Kimball", "Charles H Lang", "Kathryn F Lanoue", "Ian Alexander Simpson", "Peter A Farrell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Committee Chair", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Kathryn F Lanoue, Committee Member", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Member", "Peter A Farrell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["eukaryotic translation initiation factor", "translation", "mTOR", "gene expression", "liver", "AMPK", "exercise"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Constitutive insulin receptor signaling in retina and changes induced by diabetes\n", "id": "6379", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "976", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tDiabetes is a growing epidemic in Western society which afflicts over 17 million Americans and over 151 million people world wide.  People with diabetes are at a greater risk of developing vascular complications such as atherosclerosis, stroke, and heart failure, as well as complications in specific tissues such as nephropathy and kidney failure, neuropathy and amputation of extremities, and retinopathy and blindness.\n\tDiabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults, and it is diagnosed by visual inspection of vascular alterations in the retina.  Over time, the retinal blood vessels become leaky and undergo neovascularization.  This leaking leads to macular edema, hemorrhaging, and build-up of opaque exudates, and the neovascularization causes severe loss of vision due to vitreous hemorrhages and/or retinal detachment.  Currently, the only treatment for DR is laser ablation of the growing and leaky vessels.  The procedure temporarily slows the abnormal blood vessel growth, but this \u00a1\u00a7amputation\u00a1\u00a8 procedure also damages the neural retina, and patients often require numerous treatments.  In addition to vascular abnormalities in DR, the neural retina also is affected by diabetes, and apoptosis is increased in the neural retina of diabetic rats and humans.  Clearly, alternative treatments are necessary to slow and prevent DR to preserve vision.\n\tIn a general sense, diabetes is a disease of improper insulin action leading to hyperglycemia.  Insulin causes many cell-signaling events to occur through the insulin receptor (IR) to promote glucose uptake, but insulin also generates a cellular survival signal which is mediated by the protein kinase Akt.  While hyperglycemia has been assumed to be the major factor that promotes diabetic complications, and despite the current knowledge of insulin signal transduction on tissues that directly mediate nutrient storage, relatively little is known about insulin physiology and the effects of diabetes in complication-prone tissues, such as the retina.  Therefore, the focus of this project is to elucidate proximal IR signaling and its regulation of Akt in retina tissue, and to test the hypothesis that the retina, similar to other classical insulin target tissues, has insulin signaling defects with diabetes.  This work provides a better understanding of mechanisms which may contribute to apoptosis in the diseased retina.\n\tThe first specific aim of this project was to determine the early IR signaling events, and to test the hypothesis that retinal insulin receptors are active in vivo.  When insulin was injected systemically into fasting rats, muscle insulin receptor \u0192\u00d2 subunit (IR\u0192\u00d2) autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues significantly increased within five minutes, but retinal IR\u0192\u00d2 autophosphorylation did not increase until 30 minutes after the injection.  Furthermore, the insulin injection increased Akt phosphorylation on serine 473 in retina.  Interestingly, it was determined that the basal IR and Akt-1 kinase activities were elevated in retina compared to liver and muscle, and retinal IR kinase activity, in contrast to IRs in liver, did not decrease in fasted rats.  Using ex vivo retina preparations, 10 nM insulin increased IR\u0192\u00d2 autophosphorylation and phosphotyrosine (PY) content in insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 2, but not IRS-1.  Akt serine 473 phosphorylation was increased in the nuclear layers of the retina ex vivo with insulin treatment.  Of the three Akt isoforms, only Akt-1 kinase activity was increased with insulin in this model.  Together, these results suggest that the retina is an insulin-sensitive tissue, the steady-state kinase activity of the IR and Akt are constitutively elevated compared to other insulin-responsive tissues, and exogenous insulin further stimulates serine 473 phosphorylation and kinase activity of the pro-survival kinase Akt.\n\tTo test the hypothesis that the constitutive retinal insulin signal is altered in diabetes, the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model was used.  The basal level of IR\u0192\u00d2 and IRS-2 PY content and Akt serine 473 phosphorylation in retina remained constant after 4 weeks of STZ diabetes, but IR and Akt-1 kinase activities were significantly reduced.  A similar reduction in IR kinase activity was also found in retinas of diabetic Ins2Akita mice.  Likewise, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K, a key enzyme linking signal transduction from IRS to Akt) activity was also reduced.  Additionally, serine 9 phosphorylation on GSK3\u0192\u00d2, a downstream substrate for Akt, was also significantly reduced in retinas of diabetic rats.  When whole retinas from STZ rats were cultured in normoglycemic media and treated with 10 nM insulin ex vivo, IR\u0192\u00d2 autophosphorylation was significantly greater than control retinas, similar to other insulin responsive tissues in the STZ rat when challenged with an insulin bolus.  These data suggest that the constitutive protein kinase activity of insulin signaling proteins in retina is reduced by insulin deficient diabetes.  Furthermore, the mechanism by which this occurs may be different from known protein phosphorylation events.\n\tThe third specific aim of this project is to examine the mechanism of the constitutive autophosphorylation of the retinal IR.  The first approach utilized intravenous somatostatin (SST) infusion to lower basal circulating insulin in normal fasted rats.  This significantly reduced liver IR\u0192\u00d2 autophosphorylation, but had no effect on retinal IR\u0192\u00d2 autophosphorylation.  The second approach utilized vitreal injection of neutralizing antibodies against IR ligands: \u0192\u00d1insulin, \u0192\u00d1insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and \u0192\u00d1IGF-II.  Surprisingly, only \u0192\u00d1IGF-II antibody reduced the constitutive IR\u0192\u00d2 and IGF-1R\u0192\u00d2 autophosphorylation.  Together, these results suggest that novel mechanisms, such as alternative non-insulin ligands, namely IGF-II, regulate constitutive IR autophosphorylation and downstream pro-survival signaling in retina.\n\tCollectively, the data contained in this thesis suggests the importance of insulin receptor signaling in retina tissue and will potentially lead to novel therapies for treating DR or other neurodegenerative diseases of the retina.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [967], "author_name_tesi": "Reiter, Chad ", "last_name_ssi": "Reiter", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Wright Gardner", "David A Antonetti", "Scot R Kimball", "Charles H Lang", "Kathryn F Lanoue", "Ian Alexander Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Wright Gardner, Committee Chair", "David A Antonetti, Committee Member", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Kathryn F Lanoue, Committee Member", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["insulin receptor", "diabetic retinopathy", "retina", "insulin", "signal transduction"]}]
