In order to achieve this level of performance it is necessary to look toward non-periodic, or aperiodic, element distributions.  Unlike the widely studied and rather straightforward design of periodic arrays, the design of aperiodic arrays typically involves complex and often non-intuitive element distributions.  Adjusting, or perturbing, element locations based on a periodic lattice is one of the traditional approaches but it lacks the ability appreciably extend the bandwidth of an array.  Moreover, it has only been shown to be well suited for linear arrays with a relatively small number of elements, not medium to large-N arrays which would require the adjustment of many element locations.  This dissertation introduces a design methodology that looks toward iteratively constructed geometries to mitigate these limitations.  Rather than adjusting every element location in an array, it is based on adjusting a small number of elements and then exploiting the recursive properties of these geometries to generate large array distributions.  A key aspect of this approach is that it reduces the representation of arbitrarily large-N planar arrays to a very small set of parameters.  This is significant because it provides for a tractable design problem.  Additionally, with a small set of parameters, these methodologies are easily combined with a global optimizer for a robust optimization procedure.  The efficacy of the concept of recursive-perturbation will be demonstrated through the introduction of two design techniques.  One of these techniques is based on exploiting space-filling curves to generate highly modular, ultra-wideband planar arrays.  This approach is explored through several examples, including a 962-element array that maintains a sidelobe level below \u201310 dB over more than a 10:1 bandwidth.  The other technique is based on a perturbation scheme that is incorporated into the basic aperiodic tiling generation process.  A variety of examples will be investigated to demonstrate its versatility, including a design that maintains a sidelobe level below \u201311 dB over more than a 22:1 bandwidth.  In addition to ultra-wide bandwidths, there are a number of other desirable properties associated with the arrays of these design techniques, including highly sparse apertures and modular architectures.

First, it may be better to know that one will have to repeat the task, for this way one can work on improving their affect. Thus, people who expect the second task might experience the first task as better than those who do not know about the second task. Second, it may actually be worse to know that one will have to repeat the task, because this knowledge might result in people dreading the second task while they are working on the first task. In two experiments, compared to people who did not know that they would have to repeat the task, people who expected to do the task twice felt more negative affect (but not more positive affect) during the initial task. This effect remained even when the participants were in a condition designed to increase their intrinsic motivation to perform well on the task. A third study examined people\u2019s desire to know about the fact that the task would be repeated and if they thought that this knowledge would help or hinder their affect during initial task. It revealed that respondents expressed a desire to know ahead of time that they would have to repeat the task and that they did not realize that knowing about the second task would result in more negative affect. Thus, if the goal is to improve initial task affect, in contrast to people\u2019s assumptions, ignorance is bliss.

Entry into an undergraduate or graduate program requires that applicants demonstrate suitable English language proficiency by means of a standardized test score such as the Test of English (TOEFL) or the International English Language Tests (IELTS). Increasingly, international student applicants seek an alternate path to college admittance in the United States. One option to meet English language admission requirements are Intensive English Programs (IEPs). These programs, typically located on college and university campuses, provide English language education for these hopeful students. Varying in co-curricular support, opportunities to enroll in credit-bearing courses, academic advising, and social activities, IEPs provide a revenue for their host institutions; however, less is known about student outcomes. That is, how former IEP students adjust once they have matriculated to undergraduate or graduate status and the ways in which IEPs may have contributed to less stressful adjustment.\n\tTo demonstrate the utility of IEPs, which are often marginalized within college and university settings, more evidence of positive student outcomes is needed. Studies that have examined former IEP student outcomes have typically been single-site studies. One purpose of the present study was to address this gap in research. Using data collected from IEP students at 28 colleges and universities across the United States, this study examined the social and academic adjustment of specific student populations, their experiences in IEPs, and adjustment to college in their first semester as matriculated students. \nIn addition to program advocacy, another goal for this study was advocacy for international students. In a recent large-scale study, international students reported high levels of academic and social stress compared to domestic student populations. Additionally, academic and linguistic under-preparation have increasingly caused tensions among faculty, administrators, and international students in U.S. colleges and universities. Due to their particular adjustment challenges, the following populations were examined: students from China, Saudi Arabia, and adult learners (in this study, defined as a student satisfying at least one of the following criteria: age [being at least 25 years old], being married, or having significant childcare responsibilities). \n\tDrawing on theories of psychosocial well-being, social and cultural capital, and language socialization, I examined IEP students\u2019 academic and social adjustment. Inspired by models of student persistence and retention, I then examined their predictive power for students\u2019 intent to persist, or graduate from their current institution. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between independent variables and the three outcomes: academic adjustment, social adjustment, and intent to persist. Results for academic adjustment model (R2 = .372, F(10, 74) = 2.736, p < .001), and the social adjustment model (R2 = .350, F(11, 80) = 1.806, p < .001) were significant. The intent to persist model was also significant (R2 = .227, F(9, 80) = 2.028, p < .05). The findings of this study suggest that students from China attend fewer IEP social events than students from other countries,; that having a mentor may contribute to greater academic adjustment; and that the English language proficiency gained while attending an IEP can contribute to both academic and social adjustment. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16169], "author_name_tesi": "Spencer, Thomas Nelson", "last_name_ssi": "Spencer", "middle_name_ssi": "Nelson", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Esther Susana Prins", "Esther Susana Prins", "Adnan A Qayyum", "Leticia Oseguera", "Robert William Schrauf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Esther Susana Prins, Dissertation Advisor", "Esther Susana Prins, Committee Chair", "Adnan A Qayyum, Committee Member", "Leticia Oseguera, Committee Member", "Robert William Schrauf, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Intensive English Program", "Academic Adjustment", "Social Adjustment", "Adult Learners", "English as a Second Language", "English for Academic Purposes"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Evolution of the Oxide Microstructure and Oxide Growth Induced Residual Strains During Waterside Corrosion of Zirconium Alloys", "id": "15495", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7772", "abstract_tesi": "The oxide layer formed on Zircaloy-4 during high temperature waterside corrosion was characterized in an attempt to understand the mechanisms behind the corrosion process and the oxide transition.  The samples examined were Zircaloy-4 and zirconium corroded with pure water at temperatures between 270 \u00b0C (520 \u00b0F) and 360 \u00b0C (680 \u00b0F) in an autoclave environment.  The oxides were characterized using microbeam synchrotron x-ray diffraction and fluorescence, 3-D Laue x-ray microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy.\n\tThe crystal structure and chemical composition of the oxide as a function of position within the oxide layer were determined at the sub-micron scale using the x-ray microbeam at the 2-ID-D beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL).  This facility is unique in that it combines high spatial resolution with high flux and allowed us to examine the oxide in an extremely detailed manner to produce new information on the oxide structure.\n\tThe oxide was found to be comprised primarily of monoclinic ZrO2 with a small amount of tetragonal ZrO2 as well.  Well-defined periodic variations in the diffracted intensity from both phases as a function of distance from the oxide-metal interface were observed, with an average period of 1.9 \u00b5m corresponding to the oxide transition thickness.  Strong in-phase relationships were observed between several of the main monoclinic and tetragonal diffraction peaks, and an out of phase relationship was seen in one monoclinic peak.  The oxide grains were shown to grow with their monoclinic (200) planes parallel to the oxide-metal interface.  A Zr3O \u201csuboxide\u201d phase was observed in a small (1-2 \u00b5m) region of metal immediately adjacent to the oxide-metal interface.  This observation corresponds well to previous transmission electron microscopy studies which found a region of high oxygen content at this location.  The measured tetragonal phase fraction was found to be highest at the oxide-metal interface, reducing over a range of approximately the oxide transition thickness to a constant bulk oxide value.  Both the monoclinic and tetragonal grain sizes were observed to be smallest at the oxide-metal interface and grow in size to a maximum value with residence time in the oxide.  The maximum tetragonal grain size was seen to be smaller than the monoclinic grain size.  These studies helped us investigate the basic corrosion mechanisms through observation of the oxide structure which helped us answer questions on the role of each oxide phase during the corrosion process.\n\tStrains in the metal substrate induced by volume expansion during oxide formation were investigated using the 3-D x-ray microscope at beamline 34-ID-E at the APS at ANL.  This beamline has the capability to measure very small changes in d-spacing as a function of depth into a material, allowing us to measure changes in d-spacing (and thus calculate strain and stress) in metal grains immediately beneath the oxide layer.  Since stresses in the oxide correspond to those in the metal, we were able to indirectly examine the oxide stress state and level as well as investigate the effect of oxide thickness and the oxide transition on accumulated stresses.  Experiments were performed at room temperature and with the samples at the corrosion temperature to mitigate the effects of differential cooling between the metal and oxide.\n\tThe oxide grown on Zircaloy-4 was shown to induce some level of both plastic and elastic deformation in the underlying metal.  Plastic deformation was visible in the streaking of the Laue x-ray spots.  The degree and mode of plastic deformation were not calculated but were qualitatively observed to vary with position between metal grains or even within different locations in a single metal grain.  Bare metal Zircaloy-4 and crystal bar zirconium did not show evidence of plastic deformation in the metal.  The level of stress in the oxide may be a result of the oxide thickness and oxide transition.  Oxides just before transition were found to have a higher level of stress compared to oxides just after transition, and high stresses were again observed in oxides nearing their second transition thickness.  The stress state in the metal was found to vary with position, as both tensile and compressive stresses were measured in different samples and grains in the same sample despite our expectations of an overall tensile stress in the metal.  Temperature was shown to play a significant role in the measured strains in the metal.  Stresses calculated from high temperature strains were lower than room temperature stresses, indicating that the stresses present during corrosion are lower than those measured at room temperature.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7703], "author_name_tesi": "Spengler, David Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Spengler", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["zircaloy-4", "corrosion", "zirconium oxide", "synchrotron radiation", "X-ray diffraction"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Intervention Effectiveness For Postsecondary Students With\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n\n\n", "id": "9090", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1899", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-01-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This literature review was conducted to investigate the effects of interventions and accommodations on the academic achievement of post-secondary students diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Studies have already identified some of the cellular proteins which interact with various late (L) domains.  The L domain of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) interacts with a ubiquitin (Ub) ligase, a cellular enzyme which conjugates Ub to a target lysine.  Indeed, all retroviruses examined so far contain ~100 molecules of Ub, suggesting Ub might have a role during budding.  However, unlike all other retroviruses, Ub conjugated to RSV Gag has never been detected.  This observation seems inconsistent with the observation that budding of this virus (and many others) is dependent on the presence of free cellular Ub.  Therefore, the role of Ub during RSV budding was examined.\nIf transient ubiquitination of RSV Gag is required during budding, the five lysines located just upstream of the RSV L domain in matrix (MA) would be the most likely targets of ubiquitination based on known sites of ubiquitination of Gag in other viruses.  These residues were changed to arginines to eliminate the potential for ubiquitination.  As predicted, substitution of these five residues with arginine (mutant 1-5KR) reduced budding by 80-90%.  The block to budding was found to be on the plasma membrane, and the few virions released had normal size, morphology, and infectivity.  Budding was restored when any one of the residues was changed back to lysine or when lysines were inserted in novel positions within the region of the original five substituted residues or C-terminal in the p10 region.  Similar to an L domain mutant, the 1-5KR mutant could be rescued into particles by coexpression of budding-competent Gag molecules.  These data suggest that ubiquitination of Gag is likely important for budding.\nThrough examination of lysines involved in RSV budding, a lysine (K244) in capsid (CA) was found to be required for efficient replication.  Analysis of the amino acids flanking K244 revealed it resides in a sumoylation consensus sequence \u00d8KxE, where \u00d8 is a hydrophobic residue and x is any residue (243IKTE246 in RSV CA).  Small Ub-like MOdifier (SUMO)-1 is a member of the Ub-like protein family that transiently modifies lysines of various target proteins in a manner similar to Ub.  Sumoylation of target proteins is important for nuclear events such as nuclear entry, subnuclear structure formation, and modulation of transcriptional activity.  The enzyme Ubc9 is capable of conjugating SUMO-1 to a target lysine within the sumoylation consensus sequence.  Indeed, sumoylation has been hypothesized to be involved in the replication of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus where CA was shown to interact and colocalize with Ubc9 in vivo.  The RSV mutants K244R and E246A were found to be normal for budding and assembly but were reduced in infectivity, revealing a potential role for sumoylation of Gag or CA in replication.  The virions contained normal amounts of Pol, Env, and RNA and were normal in core morphology.  The defect was during reverse transcription and possibly nuclear import of the preintegration complex (PIC).\nRevertant viruses of the mutants K224R and E246A were isolated, and the genomes sequenced to identify second-site suppressors.  The K244R phenotype was suppressed by the double mutation R325C/C431R; the E246A phenotype was suppressed by a N343D mutation.  C431 is thought to be involved in CA-CA interactions based on its position in the predicted dimerization helix.  The involvement of C431 in the suppression of the K244R phenotype suggests the K244R and E246A substitutions may disrupt intra- or intermolecular interactions in CA which is repaired in the suppressors.  Further experimentation is required to determine if the K244 and E246 are important in the structural stability of CA or if the suppressors allow for SUMO-independent replication.  Whatever the function of K244 and E246, these data support a model whereby CA plays an active role during reverse transcription and/or nuclear import of the PIC.\nThe exact function of Ub in retrovirus budding is unknown.  Ub has many cellular functions, including involvement in cellular budding events that produce multivesicular bodies (MVBs), and, interestingly, viral budding is similar in topology to this budding.  Therefore, the cellular proteins which interact with Ub to mediate MVB formation could feasibly be involved in viral release.  Ubiquitination of a target protein acts to recruit complexes known as ESCRT-I, -II, and -III to facilitate sorting of the target protein into the budding vesicles.  To determine the role of the ESCRT complexes during RSV budding, dominant-negative forms of these proteins were coexpressed with RSV Gag.  ESCRT-I protein Tsg101, the ESCRT-III proteins CHMP3, CHMP4A, CHMP4B, CHMP4C, and CHMP6, and Vps4A inhibit RSV budding implicating a role for these proteins during budding.  During the course of this study it was noticed that RSV Gag also contains a YPxL sequence that may allow binding to AIP1/ALIX which itself interacts with ESCRT-III and is important for HIV and EIAV budding.  Substituting this sequence with alanines had a modest effect on budding suggesting this sequence may have a slight role during budding.  This site may interact with AIP1/ALIX to stabilize ESCRT complexes with RSV Gag, and failure to do so results in inefficient budding.  Therefore, from these data it appears that RSV and HIV utilize a similar mechanism and cellular proteins for their release.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2807], "author_name_tesi": "Spidel, Jared ", "last_name_ssi": "Spidel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jared", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Warren Wills", "Richard James Courtney", "Leslie Joan Parent", "David Joseph Spector", "Vincent Chau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Warren Wills, Committee Chair", "Richard James Courtney, Committee Member", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Vincent Chau, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rous sarcoma virus", "retrovirus", "Gag", "budding", "assembly", "ubiquitin", "SUMO-1", "multivesicular bodies"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Money, Class, and Realism in Eighteenth-century English Fiction from Robinson Crusoe to Amelia.", "id": "16243", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8161", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project challenges a number of long-held assumptions about some of the most studied novels in the period (such as Robinson Crusoe, Pamela, and Tom Jones) by asking how their original readers might have responded to them when they were first published.

Many of these family caregivers have expressed distress with behaviors displayed by the person with dementia during caregiver-assisted activities.  Nurse researchers interested in dementia behaviors have defined these episodes as resistiveness to care and have investigated the use of interventions with family caregivers to modify the resistive behaviors and to decrease family caregiver distress when the behaviors occur.  Only modest success has been achieved with these current interventions.  Therefore a scientific phenomenology study was conducted to investigate the lived family caregiver experience of resistiveness to care.  This method incorporates a human science approach, a disciplinary perspective, and is ideal for studying behavioral phenomenon that may not be readily studied by the natural sciences.  A nursing disciplinary perspective was used during the analysis of this study and permitted the nurse researcher to grasp objectively the subjective structural meaning assigned to this phenomenon by family caregivers.  The outcome of the descriptive scientific phenomenology method is to identify and define perceptions of an experience.  Upon Institutional Review Board approval eight dementia family caregivers were recruited from Alzheimer\u2019s support group meetings, provided informed consent and were interviewed individually at a mutually agreed upon location.  Each participant provided in depth descriptions of chosen resistive events that they experienced.  Analysis using the scientific phenomenology method revealed a structure of resistiveness to care experience that nurses can use to gain incites into resistiveness to care as perceived by family caregivers.  The structure contained five essential constituents.

In addition, rates of childhood overweight and obesity have been rising over the past 3 decades. Children\u2019s dietary habits are likely to continue into adulthood and can affect their risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. Therefore, it is imperative to identify strategies to improve the diet habits of children particularly through increasing vegetable intake and decreasing energy intake. \nServing larger portions of low-energy-dense vegetables at a meal could have beneficial effects on children\u2019s food and energy intake. We investigated whether increasing the portion size of vegetables served at the start of a meal leads to increased vegetable consumption and decreased meal energy intake in children. Using a crossover design, 3- to 5-year-old children (n=51) in a daycare center were served a test lunch once a week for 4 weeks. In 3 of the meals, a first course of raw carrots was varied in portion size (30, 60, or 90 g), and in the control meal, no first course was served. Children consumed the first course ad libitum over 10 minutes and then were served a main course of pasta, broccoli, applesauce, and milk, also consumed ad libitum. Total vegetable consumption at the meal increased as the portion size of carrots was increased (P<0.0001). Doubling the portion size of the first course increased carrot consumption by 47%, or 12\u00b12 g (P<0.0001). Tripling the portion size of carrots, however, did not lead to a further increase in intake (P=0.61). Meal energy intake was not significantly affected by the amount of carrots served in the first course. The effect of portion size on intake was not significantly influenced by the children\u2019s age or body weight status. Increasing the portion size of a vegetable served as a first course can be an effective strategy to increase vegetable consumption in preschool children.\n\nStudy 2 tested whether varying the portion of low-energy-dense vegetable soup served at the start of a meal affects meal energy and vegetable intakes in children.  Subjects were 3- to 5-year-olds (n=72) in daycare facilities.  Using a crossover design, children were served lunch once a week for four weeks.  On three occasions, different portions of tomato soup (150, 225, and 300 g) were served at the start of the meal, and on one occasion no soup was served.  Children had 10 minutes to consume the soup before being served the main course which consisted of pasta, broccoli, applesauce, and milk.  All foods were consumed ad libitum.  The primary outcomes were soup intake as well as energy and vegetable intake at the main course.  A mixed linear model tested the effect of soup portion size on intake.  Serving any portion of soup reduced entr\u00e9e energy intake compared with serving no soup, but total meal energy intake was only reduced when 150 g of soup was served.  Increasing the portion size increased soup and vegetable intake.  Serving low-energy-dense, vegetable soup as a first course is an effective strategy to reduce children\u2019s intake of a more energy-dense main entr\u00e9e and increase vegetable consumption at the meal. \nSubstantial amounts of vegetables can be incorporated into foods to reduce their energy density (kcal/g; ED) without children noticing. This strategy, which has the potential to increase vegetable intake and decrease energy intake, was tested in a crossover study with 3- to 5-year-old children. In a daycare center, 40 children were served all meals and snacks one day a week for 3 weeks. Across conditions, breakfast, lunch, and dinner entr\u00e9es were reduced in ED by increasing the proportion of pur\u00e9ed vegetables. The conditions were 100% ED (standard), 85% ED (tripled vegetable content), and 75% ED (quadrupled vegetable content). These were served with unmanipulated side dishes, and children were instructed to eat as much as they liked. The results showed that daily vegetable intake increased significantly by 52 g (50%) in the 85% ED condition and 73 g (73%) in the 75% ED condition compared to the standard condition (both p<0.0001). Consuming more vegetables in the entr\u00e9es did not affect consumption of the vegetable side dishes. Children ate a similar weight of food across conditions, thus significantly decreasing daily energy intake by 142 kcal (12%) from the 100% ED to the 75% ED condition (p<0.05).  Children rated their liking of the manipulated foods similarly. Incorporating substantial amounts of pur\u00e9ed vegetables into foods is an effective strategy to increase vegetable intake and decrease energy intake in young children.\nThese studies have provided evidence that increasing the portion size vegetables served to children and incorporating pur\u00e9ed vegetables into children\u2019s entr\u00e9es can be used to increase children\u2019s vegetable intake. Serving vegetables at the start of the meal and within the entr\u00e9es added to intake of vegetable side dishes at the meal and increased total vegetable intake. Providing soup at the start of the meal reduced energy intake of the energy-dense entr\u00e9e, and may be an effective strategy to decrease energy intake in children. Incorporating pur\u00e9ed vegetables into entr\u00e9es led to a significant reduction of children\u2019s daily energy intake. Offering vegetables as a first course, providing large portions of well-liked vegetables, serving vegetable-enhanced entr\u00e9e, and serving vegetable side dishes are all methods that parents and caregivers should incorporate into their daily meal routines to significantly increase children\u2019s vegetable consumption. Used together these techniques are likely to have a substantial impact on the number of children meeting their recommended vegetable intake levels.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4197], "author_name_tesi": "Spill, Maureen  ", "last_name_ssi": "Spill", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Maureen ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Jean Rolls", "Barbara Jean Rolls", "Leann L Birch", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Cynthia Bartok", "Danielle Symons Downs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Jean Rolls, Dissertation Advisor", "Barbara Jean Rolls, Committee Chair", "Leann L Birch, Committee Member", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Cynthia Bartok, Committee Member", "Danielle Symons Downs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy density", "portion size", "children", "energy intake", "vegetable"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Nation in Peril?

Fear had multiple historical sources that informed how different groups understood fear in a variety of ways and defined how people should feel fear and express those feelings (or not) in the politics of Imperial Germany.  Much of this history of fear is not necessarily unique to German political culture, when compared to Western Europe and North America, and Germans were not overwhelmed by any one fear, but the prospects of defeat in the First World radicalized how Germans increasingly invoked fear in their politics after the war.  \nActivists of various kinds increasingly cultivated social realities of fear in the Weimar Republic in order to valorize certain \u201cemotional economies\u201d that framed how both men and women should feel and express their feelings.  The most radical emotional economies sanctioned more aggressive forms of politics that threatened to undermine the dominant forms of respectable middle class political culture and any chances of cooperation with moderate working class activism or other opponents.  Yet the threats that radical activists posed also led to a vigorous defense of the republic at the local level and a variety of alternative emotional economies to counter the fear emanating from the extremes.  \nAntisemitism was a key source for fear in the provincial Germany, but more so through ordinary, everyday life than currently understood in the scholarship, not only motivating Jewish and non-Jewish German resistance to increasing antisemitic violence, but also undermining Jewish and non-Jewish German relations and racially transforming local communities in the process.  \nFinally, the focus on central German communities demonstrates that nationalist economies of fear played a key role in forging nationalist solidarity in the latter years of Weimar Republic, suppressing nationalist dissent to the emergence of the Nazi movement in Thuringia, and informing a social reality of fear that must be considered more seriously in current thinking about the relationship of terror and persuasion in the Nazi seizure of power.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5085], "author_name_tesi": "Spinney, Russell Alfred", "last_name_ssi": "Spinney", "middle_name_ssi": "Alfred", "first_name_ssi": "Russell", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Greg Eghigian", "Greg Eghigian", "Catherine Wanner", "Sophie C De Schaepdrijver", "Tobias Heinrich Albert Brinkmann", "John Philip Christman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Greg Eghigian, Dissertation Advisor", "Greg Eghigian, Committee Chair", "Catherine Wanner, Committee Member", "Sophie C De Schaepdrijver, Committee Member", "Tobias Heinrich Albert Brinkmann, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Emotions", "Fear", "Everyday Life", "Politics", "Weimar Republic", "Nazism"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "MODEL FOLLOWING AND HIGH ORDER AUGMENTATION FOR ROTORCRAFT CONTROL, APPLIED VIA PARTIAL AUTHORITY", "id": "13773jms1188", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13773", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of two main studies, a few small studies, and design documentation, all aimed at improving rotorcraft control by employing multi-input multi-output (MIMO) command-model-following control as a baseline, together with a selectable (and de-selectable) MIMO high order compensator that augments the baseline.\nTwo methods of MIMO command-model-following control design are compared for rotorcraft flight control.  The first, Explicit Model Following (EMF), employs SISO inverse plants with a dynamic decoupling matrix, which is a purely feed-forward approach to inverting the plant.  The second is Dynamic Inversion (DI), which involves both feed-forward and feedback path elements to invert the plant.  The EMF design is purely linear, while the DI design has some nonlinear elements in vertical rate control.  For each of these methods, an architecture is presented that provides angular rate model-following with selectable vertical rate model-following.  Implementation challenges of both EMF and DI are covered, and methods of dealing with them are presented.  These two MIMO model-following approaches are evaluated regarding (1) fidelity to the command model, and (2) turbulence rejection.  Both are found to provide good tracking of commands and reduction of cross coupling.\nNext, an architecture and design methodology for high order compensator (HOC) augmentation of a baseline controller for rotorcraft is presented.  With this architecture, the HOC compensator is selectable and can easily be authority-limited, which might ease certification.  Also, the plant for this augmentative MIMO compensator design is a stabilized helicopter system, so good flight test data could be safely gathered for more accurate plant identification.  The design methodology is carried out twice on an example helicopter model, once with turbulence rejection as the objective, and once with the additional objective of closely following pilot commands.  The turbulence rejection HOC is feedback only (HOC_FB), while the combined objective HOC has both feedback and feedforward elements (HOC_FBFF).  The HOC_FB was found to be better at improving turbulence rejection but generally degrades the following of pilot commands.  The HOC_FBFF improves turbulence rejection relative to the Baseline controller, but not by as much as HOC_FB.  However, HOC_FBFF also generally improves the following of pilot commands.\nFuture work is suggested and facilitated in the areas of DI, MIMO EMF, and HOC augmentation.  High frequency dynamics, neglected in the DI design, unexpectedly change the low frequency behavior of the DI-plant system, in addition to the expected change in high frequency dynamics.  This dissertation shows why, and suggests a technique for designing a pseudo-command pre-filter that at least partially restores the intended DI-plant dynamics.  For EMF, a procedure is presented that avoids use of a reduced-order model, and instead uses a full-order model or even frequency-domain flight test data.  With HOC augmentation, future research might investigate the utility of adding an H\u221e constraint to the design objective, which is known as an equal-weighting mixed-norm H2/H\u221e design.  Because all the formulas in the published literature either require solution of three coupled Riccati Equations (for which there is no readily available tool), or make assumptions that do not fit the present problem, appropriate equal-weighting H2/H\u221e design formulas are derived which involve two de-coupled Riccati Equations.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14717], "author_name_tesi": "Spires, James Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Spires", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Horn", "Joseph Horn", "Edward Smith", "Jacob Langelaan", "Chris Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Horn, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Horn, Committee Chair", "Edward Smith, Committee Member", "Jacob Langelaan, Committee Member", "Chris Rahn, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rotorcraft control", "model following control", "dynamic decoupling", "explicit model following", "H2", "Hinf", "dynamic inversion", "nonlinear dynamic inversion", "handling qualities", "partial authority control", "feed forward", "turbulence rejection", "piggyback compensation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A multisite, prospective, one health investigation of zoonotic swine influenza among 4-H Members and their swine at agricultural fairs in Pennsylvania.", "id": "26544", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11594", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The unique animal-human interface created in an agricultural fair setting is a potential hot-spot for transmission of zoonotic influenza.  Swine have the ability to undergo infection from swine, human, and avian influenza viruses, thus making them a likely source for emergent influenza viruses capable of spreading in humans.  Since 2005, 373 cases of variant influenza (swine origin influenza virus that infects humans) have been reported in the United States.  Swine exhibitors, such as those from 4-H and their swine, may be responsible for outbreaks of zoonotic influenza (e.g. H3N2v) at agricultural fairs.  Although youth who exhibit swine at fairs are recognized for their risk of contracting and/or introducing zoonotic influenza to the general public, we know very little about their farm biosecurity risks or knowledge and behaviors regarding zoonotic influenza. \n \tA multi-site, prospective, One Health investigation that assessed interactions between humans, animals, and the environment was conducted.  This study used a convenience sample of 138 4-H members and leaders of 4-H groups attending five county fairs in western, south-central, and south-eastern Pennsylvania during the summer of 2014.  The first aim of the present study was to assess the incidence of influenza like illness in 4-H members and their swine through fair and follow-up interviews and collection of nasal swab samples (human and swine) and saliva samples (swine); swine samples were tested for influenza virus using RT-PCR and virus isolation.  The second aim was to quantify interrelated risk factors from multiple levels including: fair environment, farm environment, and individual level knowledge and behaviors.  Observational assessments at each fair were used to characterize the fair environment.  Biosecurity risks for 4-H members were assessed in four domains: housing, transportation/sharing, animal, and human through three surveys conducted prior to, during and after the fair.\nNo ILI or influenza virus was detected in humans or swine.  Fair environment assessments revealed that the availability of hand sanitization facilities and related informational signage was poor across most fairs.  Assessment of farm-level biosecurity risk in the housing and transportation/sharing domains found that almost all participants\u2019 swine (91.3%) were kept on a farm with other types of livestock, 17% indicated they house their swine on a farm with commercial livestock, and 16% transported their swine to other shows where contact with other swine increases risk for influenza infection.  Among the animal biosecurity risk factors, poor quarantine procedures were indicated in 73% of respondents who traveled to/exhibited at another event.  As belief in biosecurity importance increased, the odds of quarantining new or returning animals on the farm increased (OR:2.2; CI:1.0-4.8).  Knowledge summary scores from the human biosecurity domain were low, with the mean score below the 50% correct bench-mark.  Approximately 27% of the participants did not know or did not believe humans could contract disease from animals.  4-H members exhibited moderate risk in personal protective equipment (PPE) use as evident by a mean PPE use score of 7.1 (range: 1-15; low-high risk).  For every one point increase in the knowledge summary score there was a 0.4 point (CI: -0.7 - -0.05) decrease in the PPE risk score.  4-H member social networks did not appear to be highly sex-assortative, but did assort by age and on average, participants who shared their tools had much higher degree or number of connections than the participants who did not share their tools.  \nWhile no ILI was detected, the fair environment lacked disease control measures.  4-H members were largely unaware of zoonotic risk and their behaviors supported transmission of variant swine influenza.

Their model is appropriate for older workers and highly educated workers, which makes it applicable to the Baby Boomer generation.  The target population was workers age 50 or older in two healthcare organizations, with a target population of 716.  Using a web-based survey consisting of closed-ended response survey items supplemented with open-ended qualitative response items, a return rate of 22% was obtained.  The survey also collected information on the personal demographics of the older workers in addition to employment background information.  The investigator utilized several instruments from prior research to measure the primary variables of interest\u2014quality of work life, social support, job demand, role ambiguity, decision latitude, rewards, burnout, emotional exhaustion, training opportunities, and career opportunities.\nThe first analysis examined factors influencing older workers\u2019 self-reported quality-of-life.  Six variables were found to statistically influence older workers\u2019 self-reported quality-of-life.  Overall, these six variables explained 66% of the variance in the quality-of-life index scores.  The six variables and the relative contribution of each to explaining the variance in quality of life were level of job burnout (39%), level of organizational involvement (12%), desire to seek other employment (6%), perceived extent of corporate fit (6%), level of job tension (2%), and social support received from the supervisor (2%).

For this analysis, binary logistic regression was used to examine the variables that significantly influenced the worker\u2019s decision to seek other employment.  Of the study participants, 28% indicated their intention to leave.  Three variables were found to significantly (p < .05) influence the older workers\u2019 intentions to leave.

The results indicated that older workers with higher quality-of-life index scores were less likely to leave.  Conversely, a higher score on the role ambiguity index indicated that a healthcare worker above the age of 50 was more likely to leave.

The initial three phases also assisted in the development of a multi-criteria decision support tool that incorporates a House of Quality approach to guide a pre-audit planning activity.\nFor the fourth and final research phase explored the impacts and evaluation methods of a pre-audit planning activity using two comparative energy audits as case studies. In each case, an energy audit professionals was asked to complete an audit using their traditional methods along with an audit which involved them first participating in a pre-audit planning activity that aligned the owner\u2019s priorities with the data collection. A comparative analysis was then used to evaluate the effects of the pre-audit planning activity in developing a more strategic method for collecting data and representing findings in an energy audit report to a facility owner.\nThe case studies demonstrated that pre-audit planning has the potential to improve the efficiency of an energy audit process through reductions in transition time waste. The cases also demonstrated the value of audit report designs that are perceived by owners to be project specific vs. generic. The research demonstrated the ability to influence and alter an auditors\u2019 behavior through participating in a pre-audit planning activity. It also shows the potential benefits of using the House of Quality as a method of aligning data collection with owner\u2019s goals and priorities to develop reports that have increased value.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10117], "author_name_tesi": "Sprau, Tabitha Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Sprau", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Tabitha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Riley Ii", "David R Riley Ii", "Robert Michael Leicht", "James Freihaut", "Seth Adam Blumsack"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Riley Ii, Dissertation Advisor", "David R Riley Ii, Committee Chair", "Robert Michael Leicht, Committee Member", "James Freihaut, Committee Member", "Seth Adam Blumsack, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy auditing", "energy modeling", "audit process", "energy auditor", "retrofit", "building performance"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Formalizing a Methodology for Human Factors Requirements Analysis in Military Settings\n", "id": "12017", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3345", "abstract_tesi": "Information visualization supports human decision making, particularly in complex and highly cognitive situations.

Understanding the consequences will help improve the effectiveness of home energy audits, in an industry seeking improved communication and interaction with its customers. The presentation of information can affect recall of past memories and emotions, perception of current ideas, and future decision-making. \n\nThe research presented in this dissertation helps clarify the relationship between individual differences and decision-making, particularly in a home energy audit setting. Using the Object-Spatial-Verbal model and assessment tool of cognitive style, a detailed model of information format and cognitive style is explored. The Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality, and the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) measuring pro-environmental propensity, represent additional internal factors. Utility theory provides a structure on which decision-making is measured and tested.\n\nThrough a series of experiments, it is shown that cognitive style plays an important role in both the usability of information as well as subsequent decision-making processes. The appropriate presentation of information can resonate with the user. Matching primary, secondary, and tertiary cognitive style to information formats demonstrated significant differences in the perception and comprehension of information. In the laboratory-based study, a student population recalled significantly more information when the format matched either their primary or secondary cognitive styles. In a more applied setting, using homeowners and home energy assessment reports, a model was created through the significant relationships between personality, cognitive style, and decision-making variables. \n\nCognitive style variables affect the relationship between personality factors and decision-making variables. The correlation between positive usability scores and the positive change in ecological paradigms suggests that if an information stimulus is usable, there is higher potential for a shift to a more \u201cgreen\u201d or \u201cecologically-friendly\u201d perspective. The converse may also be true; if a person experiences a positive shift in ecological paradigms, they are likely to consider a home energy assessment report more usable. \n\nThe Cognitive Style and Personality in Decision Making (CSPDM) model adds to the literature in providing the insight that cognitive style, in combination with personality, will relate to decision-making risk tolerance levels. The experimentation is done in such a way as to add potential influential correlates in a naturalistic setting. This addition provides stronger correlations among the variables of personality and decision-making and inspires continued research in the integration of individual differences into decision-making models.

Teacher pedagogy (as measured on a scale from didactic to constructivist) will not change due to participation in a statewide laptop initiative, 2.  Teachers of different subjects will exhibit similar patterns in terms of the didactic or constructivist nature of their teaching styles at the beginning of the CFF program, 3.  Teachers of different subjects will be equally likely to change along the spectrum from didactic to constructivist as a result of the CFF laptop initiative, 4. Teachers with different amounts of teaching experience will be equally likely to change their teaching styles due to their participation in a laptop initiative.  This dissertation looks at three data sources, a teacher survey and student survey, and classroom observation data. \n\tFindings show that the first hypothesis is indeed rejected in that teachers are perceived to show significant changes in their teaching styles.  The second hypothesis looked at descriptive survey results at the beginning of the program, which indicated that there are different perceived patterns in the nature of the different subjects teaching styles so the hypothesis is rejected.  The findings for the third hypothesis show that teachers of different subject areas are perceived to change the way they teach, in different ways in a one-to-one laptop initiative.

The study focused on the experiences of the educators and learners within this program that targets these Latina learners and attempted to understand the influence of sociocultural factors on their education in financial matters. Of special interest was the pedagogical approach that was used, and the role that ethnicity, gender, and the Latino culture played in the teaching and learning process.

First, the program uses a holistic approach to financial education, which emphasizes community leadership and the creation of cultural community of support for the learners, including the provision of multiple resources for the learners. Second the pedagogy in use emphasizes both content and process making use of alternative techniques with an emphasis on learner needs and the use of personal stories that assists the educators in creating this community of support and in the delivery of financial content. Third, the promotion of financial behavior change motivates learners to set goals, make small changes, and demonstrate improvement in their savings, credit scores, and reduction in debt.

Results reveal that communications using interactive techniques such as voice calling (telephone feature) helped in reassurance at a time when the offline world provided very little social connections. \nWhile self- expression was seen as an important need on Facebook, contrary to popular theories, the type of wall post (video vs text) did not affect the number of subsequent responses received. Refugees however, preferred longer wall posts, providing support to the length equals strength argument. Longer wall posts received more number of responses.

They subscribed to more number of communities from home than community subscriptions from the host nation.

Deposition of times of 20 mins and 10 mins with a density of .1mg/ml is chosen with the QDs suspended in toluene.

However, due to the complexity of these phenomena, they were not modeled in previous studies. Since two-phase heat transfer equations and relationships rely heavily on experimental data, many closure relationships that were used in previous studies to solve the problem are empirical in nature. Also, in deriving the relationships, the experimental data were often extrapolated beyond the intended range of conditions, causing errors in predictions. In some cases, empirical correlations that were derived from situations other than IAFB, and whose applicability to IAFB was questionable, were used. Moreover, arbitrary constants were introduced in the model developed in previous studies to provide good fit to the experimental data. These constants have no physical basis, thereby leading to questionable accuracy in the model predictions. \n\nIn the present work, modeling of Inverted Annular Film Boiling (IAFB) is done using Integral Method. Two-dimensional formulation of IAFB is presented. Separate equations for the conservation of mass, momentum and energy are derived from first principles, for the vapor film and the liquid core. Turbulence is incorporated in the formulation. The system of second-order partial differential equations is integrated over the radial direction to obtain a system of integral differential equations. In order to solve the system of equations, second order polynomial profiles are used to describe the non-dimensional velocity and temperatures. The unknown coefficients in the profiles are functions of the axial direction alone. Using the boundary conditions that govern the physical problem, equations for the unknown coefficients are derived in terms of the primary dependent variables: wall shear stress, interfacial shear stress, film thickness, pressure, wall temperature and the mass transfer rate due to evaporation. A system of non-linear first order coupled ordinary differential equations is obtained.\n\nDue to the inherent mathematical complexity of the system of equations, simplifying assumptions are made to obtain a numerical solution. The system of equations is solved numerically to obtain values of the unknown quantities at each subsequent axial location. Derived quantities like void fraction and heat transfer coefficient are calculated at each axial location. The calculation is terminated when the void fraction reaches a value of 0.6, the upper limit of IAFB. The results obtained agree with the experimental trends observed. Void fraction increases along the heated length, while the heat transfer coefficient drops due to the increased resistance of the vapor film as expected. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5908], "author_name_tesi": "Sridharan, Arunkumar ", "last_name_ssi": "Sridharan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Arunkumar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr L E Hochreiter", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni", "Thomas Fu Yuan Lin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr L E Hochreiter, Committee Chair", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Chair", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni, Committee Member", "Thomas Fu Yuan Lin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Reactor Safety", "Two-Phase heat transfer", "Inverted Annular Film Boiling", "Modeling of Two-Phase flows", "Integral Method"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Performance-reliability trade-offs in designing Re-Order Buffers ", "id": "8392", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5877", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent research efforts to enable quantitative analysis of the architectural transient fault-tolerance solutions has led to a key metric named Architectural Vulnerability Factor (AVF).

In this paper, we propose a new design of Re-Order Buffer (ROB), a key structure in superscalar architectures, to reduce its AVF without disrupting the AVF of other structures. This new design, which is employed using a technique named Late Instruction Binding (LIB), provides better reliability without compromising on performance. LIB postpones the binding of instruction information to the ROB from the time of allocation to the time when the results are written back from the execution units. \nIn order to enable LIB, we propose a Target Address Buffer (TAB) which stores only the target addresses of the taken branch instructions. With TAB and the Program Counter (PC) of the last committed instruction, the PC of the exception raising instruction can be easily obtained, thus eliminating the need to buffer the PCs all in-flight instructions in ROB. This also reduces the overall ROB size. Detailed simulation with SPEC CPU 2000 benchmarks show that LIB achieves an average of 33.4% and up to 56.5% reduction in AVF over the conventional instruction binding in ROB. Furthermore, with a slight increase in the width of the issue queue and execution units, LIB achieves an average of 38.7% and up to 64.5% reduction in AVF of ROB. This increase in width also lend towards an average improvement of 9.5% and up to 57.2% in IPC. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5873], "author_name_tesi": "Sridharan, Srinath ", "last_name_ssi": "Sridharan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Srinath", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Chitaranjan Das"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Thesis Advisor", "Chitaranjan Das, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ROB", "Late Binding", "vulberability"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Dynamic Shared Resource Management for Providing Predictable Performance in Multicore Processors\n", "id": "12062", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5794", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are being accepted as the microprocessor architecture of choice and have received strong impetus from almost all leading chip manufactures. The dream run for computer architects of cruising on the performance benefits of Moore\u2019s law by increasing a single processor's clock rate and pipeline depth to exploit instruction level parallelism is nearing its end. With memory latency starting to dominate the application execution time as opposed to instruction execution time, scaling the \"memory wall\" attains prominence. The leverage obtained by exploiting thread level parallelism and the resultant improvement in processor utilization is diminished by low utilization of several on-chip resources. To alleviate these problems, computer architects and designers alike, have suggested to share several resources on-chip.\n\nShared resources in a CMP environment are like \"double edged swords\". They pose unique challenges to the seamless adoption of CMPs in both virtualization based environments and high performance computing systems. On the one hand, sharing resources (like cores, on-chip last level cache, off-chip memory bandwidth etc) is beneficial due to increased resource utilization. On the other hand, lack of control over management of these shared resources leads to destructive interference among different threads/applications. Consequently, there is a general loss of determinism, faded performance isolation, and an overall lack of the notion of performance quality of service (QoS) provided to applications. This has direct ramifications on adhering to service level agreements in environments involving consolidation of multiple heterogeneous applications/workloads.\n\nThe advent of the CMP era has resulted in a sustained emphasis on the need for development of techniques to extract thread-level parallelism. Given the limited ability of current compilers to extract a large fraction of the available parallelism, it is evident that a typical workload in future multicore processors would consist of a dynamic and diverse range of applications that exhibit varying degrees of thread level parallelism. This has resulted in changes in the application space besides the changes in the resource landscape due to shared resources.\n\nTo address the aforementioned problems in CMPs, in my thesis work, I have focussed on developing an integrated framework for managing the different shared resources in CMPs. Scenarios like management of shared resources among multiple threads of a single application are simpler to handle than scenarios where multiple applications (possibly multi-threaded) are executing concurrently. For the former case, we can adopt some hardware efficient, yet effective solutions. However, such solutions may not suffice to address the latter case. Dynamically partitioning shared resources in CMPs among multiple concurrently executing applications in a controlled manner may be a more effective solution to guarantee QoS as both heuristic and formal methods can be adopted in such solutions. This dissertation proposes different techniques to manage on-chip resources in CMPs with an emphasis on managing different shared resources in the memory hierarchy (different levels of shared caches, translation look-aside buffer, and off-chip memory bandwidth) as well as the cores themselves.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5790], "author_name_tesi": "Srikantaiah, Shekhar Shashi", "last_name_ssi": "Srikantaiah", "middle_name_ssi": "Shashi", "first_name_ssi": "Shekhar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Mahmut Kandemir", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Chitaranjan Das", "Dr Mahmut Kandemir", "Dr Qian Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Mahmut Kandemir, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Member", "Dr Mahmut Kandemir, Committee Chair", "Dr Qian Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multicore", "Shared cache", "predictable performance"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Roles of CCR4-NOT in ubiquitination and the last resort mechanism of RNA polymerase II degradation", "id": "5x21tf405", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12069", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Several studies have explored the relationship between the cellular transcription machinery, the stress response mechanism and mRNA decay factors. Despite the identification of multiple factors that function in linking the three responses together, studies are constantly being conducted to explore the extent of cellular responses to various stress conditions. Cells mitigate the effect of stress damage by balancing transcription and mRNA decay effectively.\n\tThe understanding of the transcription machinery covers various aspects of activation, regulation, and repression under normal cell conditions, as well as proofreading and repair response during a stress or damage-induced arrest. However, studies are still revealing new mechanisms for these responses and the proteins involved in performing these functions. One such response is the selective ubiquitination and degradation of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Rpb1) upon DNA damage. Previous published work by Jesper Svejstrup\u2019s laboratory showed the processing of Def-1 and the Def-1 dependent ubiquitination and degradation of Rpb1 in response to DNA damage induced arrest of PolII. As a follow-up to this work, it was shown that this degradation is a last-resort mechanism and can be reversed by deubiquitination factors (DUBs) like Ubp3 and its cofactor Bre5. \n\tIn this thesis, I have explored the role of one such protein complex, the Ccr4-Not complex, in transcription, mRNA decay and DNA damage response. The Ccr4-Not complex has previously been implicated as a transcriptional elongation factor and Ccr4 is the primary deadenylase in yeast. In my study, I explored a novel function for Not4, one of the components of the complex, in the stress-induced ubiquitination of Rpb1. Not4 is required for the turnover of Rpb1 under UV-induced stress and the absence of Not4 leads to a loss of ubiquitination of PolII under 4-NQO stress. Furthermore, the Ccr4-Not complex was also shown to have a physical interaction with the DUBs that reverse the ubiquitination of Rpb1. These results indicate a previously unknown role for the Not4 module of the Ccr4-Not complex that is required for the ubiquitination of Rpb1 and a possible interaction with the DUBs Ubp3/Bre5 to set up a novel stress-response process that will be discussed in the following chapters of this thesis.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12737], "author_name_tesi": "Srikanth, Abhinaya ", "last_name_ssi": "Srikanth", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abhinaya", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph C.

In addition to the traditional pre-booked appointments, outpatient hospitals and clinics are also experimenting with same day appointments. Designing a hybrid appointment system (combination of same-day and pre-booked) involves multiple decisions such as determining the appointment types, patient sequence, and appointment time. Further, various factors such as patient flow, demand uncertainty, and patient no-shows (patients who do not arrive for scheduled appointments) must be considered to develop an effective design. Inefficiencies in the appointment system design and patient no-shows cost the U.S. healthcare system more than $150 billion a year. In addition, they also reduce productivity and timely access to care. \n\nMost of the previous work on outpatient appointment systems consider a simplified clinic setting with single phase (one-stop service) and single provider. Further, they rarely consider patient\u2019s provider preference, patient availability, patient specific no-show rate, uncertainty in patient demand and service times. However, in practice, most outpatient departments have multi-phase settings (e.g., pre-screening, visit nurse, visit doctor, checkout) with multiple providers. A detailed simulation analysis indicated that ignoring the multi-phase nature of patient flow, patient\u2019s provider preference and patient\u2019s availability lead to unmet demand, patient dissatisfaction and inefficient resource utilization. Further, the associated uncertainties complicate the task of designing the appointment system. This research focuses on designing a data-driven multi-phase multi-provider appointment system for outpatient clinics with the objective of improving resource utilization and patient satisfaction.\n\nFirst, a new approach to design a hybrid appointment system, a combination of pre-booking and open access (same day) appointment types, is proposed. The objective is to determine the schedule configuration of a hybrid appointment system under uncertainty for a multi-phase multi-provider clinic that incorporates patient\u2019s provider preference and availability. A mathematical programming model is proposed to determine the optimal percentage of appointments reserved for pre-booking and open access, and a scenario-based Monte Carlo approach is used to account for uncertainty. Finally, heuristics are developed to determine the best configuration for the hybrid appointment system. \n\nNext, a new framework for sequentially scheduling patients is proposed by using a combination of data analytics and simulation. In the proposed framework, patient-related data from various sources are used to develop predictive models to identify the risk of patient no-show. Finally, different scheduling rules that leverage the patient specific no-show risk are proposed. Their effectiveness is evaluated with respect to current scheduling practices. The results indicate that the proposed rules consistently outperform the current practice for all the clinic settings tested.\n\nA case study with real data from a Family Medicine Clinic in Pennsylvania is used to show the feasibility and applicability of the proposed models.

Designing image classification algorithms that exhibit robustness to acquisition noise and image distortions, particularly when the available training data are insufficient to learn accurate models, is a significant challenge. This dissertation explores the development of discriminative models for robust image classification that exploit underlying signal structure, via probabilistic graphical models and sparse signal representations.\n\nProbabilistic graphical models are widely used in many applications to approximate high-dimensional data in a reduced complexity set-up. Learning graphical structures to approximate probability distributions is an area of active research. Recent work has focused on learning graphs in a discriminative manner with the goal of minimizing classification error. In the first part of the dissertation, we develop a discriminative learning framework that exploits the complementary yet correlated information offered by multiple representations (or projections) of a given signal/image. Specifically, we propose a discriminative tree-based scheme for feature fusion by explicitly learning the conditional correlations among such multiple projections in an iterative manner. Experiments reveal the robustness of the resulting graphical model classifier to training insufficiency.\n\nThe next part of this dissertation leverages the discriminative power of sparse signal representations. The value of parsimony in signal representation has been recognized for a long time, most recently in the emergence of compressive sensing. A recent significant contribution to image classification has incorporated the analytical underpinnings of compressive sensing for classification tasks via class-specific dictionaries. In continuation of our theme of exploiting information from multiple signal representations, we propose a discriminative sparsity model for image classification applicable to a general multi-sensor fusion scenario. As a specific instance, we develop a color image classification framework that combines the complementary merits of the the red, green and blue channels of color images. Here signal structure manifests itself in the form of block-sparse coefficient matrices, leading to the formulation and solution of new optimization problems.\n\nAs a logical consummation of these ideas, we explore the possibility of learning discriminative graphical models on sparse signal representations. Our efforts are inspired by exciting ongoing work towards uncovering fundamental relationships between graphical models and sparse signals. First, we show the effectiveness of the graph-based feature fusion framework wherein the trees are learned on multiple sparse representations obtained from a collection of training images. A caveat for the success of sparse classification methods is the requirement of abundant training information. On the other hand, many practical situations suffer from the limitation of limited available training. So next, we revisit the sparse representation-based classification problem from a Bayesian perspective. We show that using class-specific priors in conjunction with class-specific dictionaries leads to better discrimination. We employ spike-and-slab graphical priors to simultaneously capture the class-specific structure and sparsity inherent in the signal coefficients. We demonstrate that using graphical priors in a Bayesian set-up alleviates the burden on training set size for sparsity-based classification methods.\n\nAn important goal of this dissertation is to demonstrate the wide applicability of these algorithmic tools for practical applications. To that end, we consider important problems in the areas of:\n1.

However, because photolithography is a top-down approach, it faces substantial technological and economic challenges in maintaining the downward scaling trends of feature sizes below 30 nm.  Concurrently, fundamental research on chemical self-assembly has enabled the path to access molecular length scales.  The key to the success of photolithography is its inherent economies of scale, which justify the large capital investment for its implementation.  In this thesis research, top-down and bottom-up approaches have been combined synergistically,, and these hybrid strategies have been employed in applications that do not have the economies of scale found in semiconductor chip manufacturing.  The specific instances of techniques developed here include molecular-ruler lithography and a series of nanoscale chemical patterning methods.\n\n    Molecular-ruler lithography utilizes self-assembled multilayered films as a sidewall spacer on initial photolithographically patterned gold features (parent) to place a second- generation feature (daughter) in precise proximity to the parent.  The parent-daughter separation, which is on the nanometer length scale, is defined by the thickness of the molecular-ruler resist.  Analogous to protocols followed in industry to evaluate lithographic performance, electrical test-pad structures were designed to interrogate the nanostructures patterned by molecular-ruler nanolithography, failure modes creating electrical shorts were mapped to each lithographic step, and subsequent lithographic optimization was performed to pattern nanoscale devices with excellent electrical performance.\n\n    The optimized lithographic processes were applied to generate nanoscale devices such as nanowires and thin-film transistors (TFTs).  Metallic nanowires were patterned by depositing a tertiary generation material in the nanogap and surrounding micron-scale regions, and then chemically removing the parent and daughter structures selectively.  This processing was also performed on silicon-on-insulator substrates and the metallic nanowires were used as a hard mask to transfer the pattern to the single crystalline silicon epilayer resulting in a quaternary generation structure of single-crystalline silicon nanowire field-effect transistors.  Additionally, the proof of concept for patterning nanoscale pentacene TFTs utilizing molecular-rulers was demonstrated.  For applications in sub-100-nm lithography, the limitations on the relative heights of parent and daughter structures were overcome and processes to integrate molecular-ruler nanolithography with existing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing were developed.  Pattern transfer to underlying SiO2 substrates has opened a new avenue of opportunities to apply these nanostructures in nanofluidics and in non-traditional lithography such as imprint lithography.   Additionally, the molecular-ruler process has been shown to increase the spatial density of features created by high-resolution techniques such as electron-beam lithography.\n\n    A limitation of photolithography is its inability to pattern chemical functionality on surfaces.  To overcome this limitation, two techniques were developed to extend nanolithography beyond semiconductors and apply them to patterning of self-assembled monolayers.  First, a novel bilayer resist was devised to protect and to pattern chemical functionality on surfaces by being able to withstand conditions necessary for both chemical self-assembly and photooxidation of the Au-S bond while not disrupting the preexisting SAM.  In addition to photolithography, soft-lithographic approaches such as microcontact printing are often used to create chemical patterns.  In this work, a technique for the creation of chemical patterns of inserted molecules with dilute coverages (&#8804;10%) was implemented.  As part of the research in chemical patterning, a method for characterizing chemical patterns using scanning electron microscopy has been developed.

These are: (1) periodic review inventory systems under order crossover and (2) periodic review inventory systems with multiple supply options. The main focus in this dissertation is investigating optimal and approximate policies and comparing the cost performance of these policies to other sub-optimal order up-to form of base-stock policies. A majority of the work done till date in the area of inventory systems modeling and analysis has ignored or circumvented the issue of order crossover. Order crossover occurs whenever replenishment orders do not arrive in the same sequence in which they were placed. It is observed that of late there are a number of factors which make order crossover more likely than in the past. By ignoring order crossover, the traditional single cycle approach used to model inventory systems and set inventory policies overstates shortages. First we consider a model with a single supply source/option and formulate the order crossover problem as a Markov Decision Process and investigate the optimal policy. Through computational experiments, we show that considering order crossover in setting the inventory policy results in a potential reduction in inventory levels and inventory costs due to a lowering of the order-up-to level, if the inventory policy is an order-up-to-level form of policy. We also propose approximate policies and demonstrate through simulation that these policies perform substantially better than, or at least perform as well as, the sub-optimal \u201corder-up-to\u201d base-stock form of policies and are easier to compute and implement as compared to the optimal policy. \nFurther, we extend the order crossover problem to include two supply sources/ options having stochastic supply lead times. The supply options are characterized by a faster source (mode) of supply which is usually more expensive and a slower source (mode) of supply which is comparatively more economical. Under such a scenario, the decision maker is faced with the task of making a choice between the two supply (mode) options or using a combination of both these supply (mode) options. We investigate the optimal and near-optimal inventory policies under such scenarios and compute the performance of these policies under various demand lead-time distributions. Through numerical experiments, we show that for a vast majority of problem instances, not considering the use of the fast supply option can result in sub-optimal policies and significant additional costs as high as 21-23 percent, even when the cost of using the fast supply option is ten times more than the cost of using the slow supply option. Even when the cost of using the fast supply option is substantially higher, (twenty times more expensive), a significant portion of the orders are placed using this option, especially when stock-out costs are high\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4405], "author_name_tesi": "Srinivasan, Mahesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Srinivasan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mahesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas J Thomas", "Robert Alexander Novack", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick", "Jose Antonio Ventura"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas J Thomas, Committee Chair", "Robert Alexander Novack, Committee Member", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick, Committee Member", "Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["supply chain management", "inventory policy", "periodic review", "order crossover", "two modes"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Protein-cofactor interactions in bioenergetic complexes: The phylloquinone cofactors in Photosystem I", "id": "10857", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4801", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The electron transfer chain in Photosystem I contains two phylloquinone molecules, A1A and A1B, that operate at highly reducing midpoint potentials.

More importantly, the absence of the hydrogen bond renders the A1A quinone susceptible to double reduction/protonation, thus generating a high potential thermodynamic well, which prevents electron transfer to the FX cluster. The blockage of electron transfer along the PsaA-branch due to the formation of the doubly reduced A1A phyllohydroquinone and the reduction of the iron-sulfur clusters FA and FB allows the direct observation of electron transfer along the PsaB-branch. This discovery led to the unambiguous assignment of an EPR spectroscopic signature to the previously elusive A1B quinone. We propose that the primary purpose of the H-bond is to tie up the C4 carbonyl group of phylloquinone in a H-bond so as to prevent protonation and hence lower the probability of double reduction during periods of high intensity illumination.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4778], "author_name_tesi": "Srinivasan, Nithya ", "last_name_ssi": "Srinivasan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nithya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John H Golbeck", "John H Golbeck", "Donald Bryant", "Carsten Krebs", "Katsuhiko Murakami", "David D Boehr"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John H Golbeck, Dissertation Advisor", "John H Golbeck, Committee Chair", "Donald Bryant, Committee Member", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "Katsuhiko Murakami, Committee Member", "David D Boehr, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Phylloquinone", "Photosystem I", "Electron Transfer"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Toward Low Power and Reliable FPGA Design\n", "id": "7915", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5873", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are seen to be the emerging future\narchitectures due to their extremely low NRE costs and \ntremendous design flexibility.

We addressed questions concerning how components of variance within a redundant system (multi-digit pressing and prehension) change with increase in force rate in these two kinds of tasks. In experiment 1, during cyclical force production we found that the component of variance that affects task performance increased with force rate within a cycle. However, it did not increase with an increase in the task frequency. We explain this discrepancy within an earlier model as pointing at an ability of the central nervous system to adjust the timing parameter to achieve the same level of variability across different frequencies. In experiment 2, we used a discrete pressing task and found that the component of variance that affects task performance increased with force derivative both within a task and across tasks with different characteristic times. Taken together, results from the first two experiments suggest that the central nervous system is able to adjust the timing parameter in cyclical tasks but this ability is impaired in discrete tasks. In experiment 3, we studied both cyclical and discrete production of tangential force on a mechanically fixed object. We found that the force variance was higher for discrete tasks when compared with cyclical tasks. The component of variance that affects task performance\nshowed a correlation with force rate, and the regression coefficient of the\ncorrelation dropped with task frequency for both types of actions. We found that this drop was faster for\nthe cyclical actions. We found that these results were robust across two levels of an assumed control hierarchy of hand actions. In addition, we found that these results were true only for the task force but not the non-task (implicit) force. Overall, these results are consistent with the hypothesis on different control strategies for discrete and cyclical tasks.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6466], "author_name_tesi": "Srinivasan KariyaMaanikam, Varadhan ", "last_name_ssi": "Srinivasan KariyaMaanikam", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Varadhan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Latash", "Mark Latash", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky", "Robert L Sainburg", "Joseph Paul Cusumano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Latash, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Latash, Committee Chair", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky, Committee Member", "Robert L Sainburg, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Discrete", "Cyclic", "Finger", "Force", "Pressing", "Prehension"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DETECTION OF SUBSURFACE VOIDS IN STRATIFIED MEDIA USING SEISMIC WAVE METHODS \n\n", "id": "9745", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "447", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of sub-surface anomalies such as voids in the stratified soil media on surface wave propagation. A data processing protocol was developed for processing seismic wave data for void detection by studying the signal simultaneously in the time and frequency domain using continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). The effect of voids in the soil media was examined by qualitatively comparing the signal properties acquired from the controlled laboratory experiments on the soil media, both with and without voids. For the controlled experimental study, a wooden box of dimensions 4.5m x 1.67m x 1.37m ( ), was constructed and filled with sand and gravel in two layers. A void of known dimension was excavated in the soil mass in the box at a known location. Micro seismic waves were produced using a 7.25kg (16-lb) sledge hammer and a rubber mallet. The vertical response of the soil mass surface was recorded using the SignalCalc\u00ae620 Dynamic Signal Analyzer and was processed using the MATLAB\u00ae 7.0 wavelet toolbox. Time-frequency plots of the seismic wave signals obtained from the unvoided soil mass experiment indicate that damped, uniform undulations are due to the surface wave dispersive behavior. Also, data obtained from the voided soil mass experiment indicate that the void anomalies cause low strength ripples in the time-frequency plots, usually in the low frequency region of the time-frequency plots. This observation has been used to study the properties of voids.\nIn addition to the experimental study, a numerical study was also conducted. The wave propagation phenomenon was simulated for voided and stratified regions using the finite difference method in the Wave2000pro software. Thus, a refraction test was performed in the soil box to determine the shear wave velocity profile. The receiver data was processed with the same protocol that was used for analyzing the experimental test data conducted in the soil box with void. The time-frequency maps constructed using the experimental data confirm the numerical results. \nFinally, the time-frequency maps using different types of wavelets for the same set of experimental data were compared. From this analysis it was concluded that the wavelets that correlates with the properties of the original signal produce time-frequency plots with all the signal features distinctively so that all the signal properties can be separately studied. Thus, wavelet analysis of the seismic wave signals obtain from the micro-seismic tests can effectively investigate the sub surface void anomalies.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [444], "author_name_tesi": "Srivastaa, Ashutosh  ", "last_name_ssi": "Srivastaa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ashutosh ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey A Laman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey A Laman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wave propagation; Void detection; Continuous wavel"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Collaboration and Pattern Recognition in Distributed Sensor Networks: A statistical mechanics based approach\n", "id": "10005", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "550", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent advances in the technologies of microcomputers and wireless communications have enabled usage of inexpensive and miniaturized sensor nodes that can be densely deployed in both benign and harsh environments as a sensor network for various applications. Distributed sensor networks can be used for both military (e.g., target tracking and surveillance) and civilian (e.g., weather, habitat and pollution monitoring, and structural health monitoring) applications. This dissertation addresses the issues of collaboration and pattern recognition in sensor networks.\n\nAt the node level, the task of individual sensor node is to extract and identify primary temporal patterns contained in the time series data. An approach based on symbolic dynamic filtering is proposed for extraction of local patterns that are represented as probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA). A new measure of information gain is proposed based on the concepts derived from statistical thermodynamics, symbolic dynamics and information theory. The efficacy of this measure is demonstrated for anomaly detection in complex systems with known and unknown structures.\n\nPrimary patterns, detected at the node level, may contain only partial information of the corresponding event and may not be sufficient for event identification and tracking. Also, sensor nodes in a network are often resource-constrained. Thus, at a higher level, collaboration among nodes is necessary for pattern identification, task allocation and division of labor. A mathematical framework - interacting Probabilistic Finite State Automata (i-PFSA) is proposed for modeling and analyzing collaborative principles in sensor networks. The sensor network is modeled as a Markov Random Field (MRF) and each node is represented as a discrete-event system with a finite number of states. Using a mean-field theoretic approach, interactions are modeled in terms of their node dynamics or the state occupation probability vectors. Each node is represented as an i-PFSA, that interacts with the dynamics of its neighboring nodes and takes events from the environments as inputs. This is a generic formulation for task assignment and collaboration and the proposed methodology is applied to address collaboration issues in sensor networks in simulated and laboratory settings.\n\nThe proposed research takes a multidisciplinary approach for both pattern recognition and collaboration in sensor networks. A decentralized organization and control is envisioned for enhanced robustness and scalability of sensor networks. Moreover, a bottom-up organizational principle, found in many natural systems, allows for adaptability to localized or isolated disturbances in the operational environment without causing an overall change of the network dynamics.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [547], "author_name_tesi": "Srivastav, Abhishek ", "last_name_ssi": "Srivastav", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abhishek", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Asok Ray", "Asok Ray", "Alok Sinha", "Shashi Phoha", "Mark Levi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Asok Ray, Dissertation Advisor", "Asok Ray, Committee Chair", "Alok Sinha, Committee Member", "Shashi Phoha, Committee Member", "Mark Levi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Symbolic dynamics", "Statistical mechanics", "Information gain", "Markov random fields", "Sensor networks", "Anomaly detection", "Probabilisitc finite state automata"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "WHAT DO I NEED TO KNOW AND WHERE DO I FIND IT? - AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF INFORMATION NEEDS IN ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION PROJECTS\n\n\n", "id": "8943", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6437", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Enterprise Integration can be briefly stated as the capability of an organization to integrate different system functionalities for enhanced operation of its business.

In PEFCs, the cathode performance is often limiting due to both the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and mass transport limitation caused by limited oxygen diffusion and liquid water flooding at high current density. This study is motivated by the achievement of ultra-high current density through the elimination of the channel/land (C/L) paradigm in PEFC flow field design. An open metallic element (OME) flow field capable of operating at unprecedented ultra-high current density (3 A/cm2) introduces new advantages and limitations for PEFC operation. The first part of this study compares the OME with a conventional C/L flow field, through performance and electrochemical diagnostic tools such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results indicate the uniqueness of the OME\u2019s mass transport improvement. No sign of operation limitation due to flooding is noted. The second part specifically examines water management at high current density using the OME flow field. A unique experimental setup is developed to measure steady-state and transient net water drag across the membrane, in order to characterize the fundamental aspects of water transport at high current density with the OME. Instead of flooding, the new limitation is identified to be anode side dry-out of the membrane, caused by electroosmotic drag. The OME improves water removal from the cathode, which immediately improves oxygen transport and performance. However, the low water content in the cathode reduces back diffusion of water to the membrane, and electroosmotic drag dominates at high current density, leading to dry-out. The third part employs the OME flow field as a tool that avoids C/L effects endemic to a typical flow field, in order to study oxygen transport resistance at the catalyst layer of a PEFC. In open literature, a resistance of unknown origin, was shown to directly or indirectly scale with Pt loading. A lack of understanding of the mechanism responsible for such resistance is noted, and several possible theories have been proposed. This lack of fundamental understanding of the origins of this resistance adds complexity to computational models which are designed to capture performance behavior with ultra-low loading electrodes. By employing the OME flow field as a tool to study this phenomena, the origins of the transport resistance appearing at ultra-low Platinum (Pt) loading is proposed to be an increase in oxygen dilution resistance through water film.

In addition to uncooled imaging platforms based on vanadium oxide, several constant-bias microbolometer FPAs have been developed using doped hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) as the active sensing material.  While a-Si:H and the broader Si1-xGex:H system have been studied within the context of photovoltaic (PV) devices, only recently have these materials been studied with the purpose of qualifying and optimizing them for potential use in microbolometer applications, which demand thinner films deposited onto substrates different than those used in PV.  The behavior of Ge:H is of particular interest for microbolometers due to its intrinsically low resistivity without the introduction of dopants, which alter the growth behavior and frustrate any attempt to address the merits of protocrystalline a-Ge:H. \nThis work reports the optical, microstructural, and electrical characterization and qualification of a variety of Si:H, Si1-xGex:H, and Ge:H films deposited using a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process, including a-Ge:H films which exhibit high TCR   (4-6 -%/K) and low 1/f noise at resistivities of interest for microbolometers (4000 \u2013 6000 \u03a9 cm).  Thin film deposition has been performed simultaneously with real-time optical characterization of the growth evolution dynamics, providing measurement of optical properties and surface roughness evolutions relevant to controlling the growth process for deliberate variations in film microstructure. Infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry has been used to characterize the Si-H and Ge-H absorption modes allowing assessment of the hydrogen content and local bonding behavior in thinner films than measured traditionally.  This method allows IR absorption analysis of hydrogen bonding and other IR modes to be extended to arbitrary substrates, including absorbing and/or device-like substrate configurations not amenable to traditional methods of assessing hydrogen related absorption using infrared transmission measurements.  \nIn addition to novel optical assessments of hydrogen in Si1-xGex:H films, the role of carrier type in a-Si:H has been studied, with n-type material providing a consistently higher TCR and 1/f noise character than p-type material for films of similar resistivity.  As the introduction of dopant gas complicates microstructural growth, assessment of undoped material was performed, finding that only Ge-rich films possess suitable resitivities for electrical measurement.\nThe inclusion of nanocrystalline material into otherwise amorphous films has been explored in both Si:H and Ge:H, finding that decreases in resistivity and TCR were not accompanied by a decrease in the 1/f noise character.  This suggests that mixed (a+nc) Si1-xGex:H material may be less suitable for microbolometer applications than optimized amorphous material.

Much of this forest is in the northeast USA where anthropogenic influences are significant.  Over the last few decades, symptoms of health decline in sensitive tree species have been observed. The decline of sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) has been particularly well documented.  Symptoms have included reduction in growth, canopy deterioration, leaf chlorosis, tree mortality, and low rates of seedling regeneration. Soil acidification and the disruption of nutrient cycles appears to be an important factor that weakens sugar maple resistance to both abiotic and biotic stresses and predisposes them to health decline symptoms.  However, very little is known about the biochemical and physiological mechanisms that underlie this relationship or the external factors that may increase sugar maple sensitivity to nutrient stress.  The objective of this thesis was to examine sugar maple responses to foliar nutrient imbalances (which in this thesis is generally defined as excessive manganese and aluminum and deficiencies of calcium and magnesium, which commonly co-occur in acid soils) as influenced by light environment.  I hypothesized that sugar maple relative to other tree species would exhibit sensitivity to foliar nutrient imbalances particularly in high light environments through mechanisms of oxidative stress.  This hypothesis was thoroughly tested in five studies conducted in controlled and/or natural environments.  In the first study, five deciduous tree seedling species including sugar maple and three evergreen species were grown in a sand culture system with adequate or excessive Mn concentrations.  In a second sand culture study, the responses of sugar maple and red maple seedlings to excess Mn were examined in contrasting light environments.  In the third study, sugar maple and red maple seedlings were grown in natural soil cores from field sites that contrasted in Mn, Ca and Mg availability in variable light environments.  In the fourth study, overstory sugar maple stands growing on soils contrasting in Mn, Ca and Mg availability were compared throughout the growing season. The fifth study was designed to examine how mycorrhizal associations influence foliar nutrient balance in sugar maple and red maple seedlings growing on acidic, nutrient-poor soils.  In each of these studies foliar element concentrations, photosynthesis and growth parameters were quantified to determine how differences in foliar nutrtion affect growth responses and function of the photosynthetic apparatus.  In three of the studies antioxidant enzyme activity was also assessed to determine whether foliar nutrient imbalances induced oxidative stress in sugar maple.  The studies generally supported the hypothesis.  In all studies sugar maple was the most sensitive species to foliar nutrient imbalances with foliar Ca, Mg and Mn having the strongest influence.  High light exacerbated Mn toxicity and increased sensitivity to foliar nutrient imbalances in sugar maple seedlings.  The data suggests that foliar Ca and Mg deficiency but not Mn toxicity impair photosynthetic function through mechanisms of oxidative stress.  Finally, photosynthetic sensitivity to foliar nutrient imbalances in sugar maple appears to be at least partly a function of a loss of its mycorrhizal associations under acidic soil conditions.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5517], "author_name_tesi": "St.Clair, Samuel Breck", "last_name_ssi": "St.Clair", "middle_name_ssi": "Breck", "first_name_ssi": "Samuel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch", "John Edward Carlson", "William Edward Sharpe", "Ming Tien", "John Charles Schultz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Chair", "John Edward Carlson, Committee Member", "William Edward Sharpe, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "John Charles Schultz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Acer", "aluminum", "antioxidant", "calcium", "magnesium", "manganese", "oxidative stress", "phosphorus", "red maple"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Tactile Pleasures: Secular Gothic Ivory", "id": "23514", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10664", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study approaches secular Gothic ivory mirror cases from the fourteenth century.

I investigate, through the imagery and physical evidence, the ways in which these objects inform and are informed by tactile exploration. The size, material, and subjects of these ivories both encouraged and rewarded close study and touching. Secular Gothic ivory appealed to the sense of touch and Gothic people touched and were inclined to think about touch when looking at and holding these objects. The repetition in ivory decoration of men and women looking, touching, and offering themselves as objects to be looked at and touched suggests to me that these individuals were seeing surrogate selves represented in ivory. Ideally, the reader comes away with an appreciation for the role of the sense of touch in experiencing art.

They have, however, been applied almost exclusively at the epidemiological scale and there exist numerous challenges to be addressed in order for them to be successfully applied at lower spatiotemporal levels.\nThese challenges arise from (1) the lack of understanding about what information genetic sequences contain regarding RNA virus epidemic dynamics, which are often complex and not well-understood from an evolutionary standpoint, and (2) the fact that viral evolution manifests in the viral genetic sequence data much differently at higher levels than at lower spatiotemporal scales.\nIn regard to the first of these challenges, I explore how the protocol used to sample viral genetic sequences affects the quality of phylodynamic inference.  Using large-scale epidemic and evolutionary simulations, I find that viral genetic data sets collected under different protocols can return very different inferences of a virus's epidemic history.  Based on these findings, I suggest how data might be collected so as to maximize their utility in phylodynamic analyses.\nA prerequisite for adapting phylodynamic methods to lower spatiotemporal scales is having a high-resolution picture of epidemic dynamics at these scales and some understanding about how these dynamics correlate with observed patterns of viral evolution.  I present two research studies to help address this need.  I present an extensible, Bayesian method which employs minimal epidemiological data to make inferences about population structure by selecting between different contact network models.  This method is rigorously evaluated using both simulated and empirical data and I find that it is helpful in determining aspects of host population structure, given reasonable assumptions.  I also evaluate how viral genetic sequence data correlate with a highly resolved picture of viral transmission (epidemic) dynamics.  Using influenza A virus genetic sequences from three case studies, I demonstrate how certain genetic variants, but not others, accurately correlate with the virus's known transmission history.  These findings provide the basis for further phylodynamic analyses and highlight the predominant evolutionary forces that will need to be accounted for.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7693], "author_name_tesi": "Stack, Joseph Conrad", "last_name_ssi": "Stack", "middle_name_ssi": "Conrad", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ottar N Bjornstad", "Edward C Holmes", "Beth Shapiro", "Matthew Joseph Ferrari", "David Russell Hunter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Chair", "Edward C Holmes, Dissertation Advisor", "Beth Shapiro, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Joseph Ferrari, Committee Member", "David Russell Hunter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["evolution", "disease", "infection", "epidemiology", "phylodynamics", "coalescent"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE ROLE OF APC IN KINESIN-II-MEDIATED MICROTUBULE GROWTH AT DENDRITIC BRANCH POINTS AND EXPLORING NOVEL TECHNIQUES IN VIVO\n", "id": "11571", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4601", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nNeurons are highly specialized cells, which contain two major compartments known as axons and dendrites. Drosophila dendrites have been shown to have a uniform microtubule polarity with 98% of microtubules growing towards the cell body, unlike the mixed polarity seen in dendrites of cultured mammalian hippocampal neurons. Since Drosophila dendrites are branched, it provides a unique opportunity for understanding the mechanisms involved in maintaining this polarity. Kinesin-II has been shown to be an important player in directing microtubule growth at branch points; however, the Kap3 accessory protein of Kinesin-II does not contain a microtubule-binding site that is needed to interact with the growing microtubule. \nSince Kap3 is known to interact with APC, a plus tip protein, it seemed to be a good candidate for this mechanism. To explore the role of APC in Kinesin-II mediated microtubule growth, EB1-dynamics was observed in Apc2 and Apc mutants to determine if microtubule polarity changed. Results of the double mutant showed 7% of microtubules growing away from the cell body compared to 3% in heterozygous controls. RNAi of Apc2 was also conducted in Drosophila sensory neurons, while observing EB1-GFP comet movement. Apc2 RNAi showed 15% of microtubules turning away from the cell body, compared to 11% in Rtnl2 controls. These results suggest a role for Apc2 in Kinesin-II mediated microtubule growth in Drosophila sensory neurons. \nIn addition to this work, I used the temperature sensitive degron, in vivo, to degrade GFP. It works by unfolding at high temperatures, which provides a signal to be ubiquinated and degraded by the proteasome. This technique had previously been used in Drosophila fillet preps, but not in vivo. By overexpressing the degron in transgenic flies, homozygous and heterozygous, I determined reliable conditions for a 1-hr and a 24-hour heat shock. I also started to explore KillerRed, which locally degrades an attached protein through ROS when activated by green light. This technique has been used successfully in cell culture, but has yet to be used in vivo. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4568], "author_name_tesi": "Stackpole, Megan  Mary", "last_name_ssi": "Stackpole", "middle_name_ssi": "Mary", "first_name_ssi": "Megan ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Rolls", "Melissa Rolls"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Rolls, Thesis Advisor", "Melissa Rolls, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microtubules", "Kinesin-II", "APC", "Degron", "KillerRed"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Putting a Price on Participation: The Role of Consumer Costs and Benefits", "id": "28832", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12397", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Building on past consumer participation and behavioral pricing research, the author investigates how participation in firm activities (e.g., in design or production) affects consumer price perceptions and the process by which these perceptions form.

Scaling up MFCs will require compact and efficient reactor designs, stable performance, inexpensive electrode materials, and high power production using domestic wastewater. In this study, small graphite fiber brush anodes were used in larger-scale MFCs to determine if stable anode potentials and high power production could be achieved when using domestic wastewater in fed batch and continuous flow modes. Additionally, a new activated carbon cathode material incorporating nitrogen and phosphorus was tested in cube MFCs to determine if power generation would be higher compared to other activated carbon cathode materials when using a phase inversion process to produce these cathodes.\nSmall diameter graphite brush anodes were examined using three different cathode configurations: a platinum catalyst on carbon cloth without a separator (Pt-NS); a platinum catalyst on carbon cloth with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (Pt-PVA) separator; and an activated carbon cathode with cloth separator (AC-CS). The Pt-NS and Pt-PVA configurations achieved similar maximum power densities in batch mode, but the Pt-NS had a lower maximum power density in continuous flow mode. Long-term operation using wastewater and the Pt-NS cathode resulted in erratic anode performance based on power generation in continuous flow mode, likely as a result of oxygen contamination of the anodes. The use of a PVA separator to reduce oxygen crossover into the anode chamber did not stabilize performance. An AC-CS cathode was then examined as a method to restore anode performance, but this cathode produced only half the maximum power density obtained with the Pt-NS or Pt-PVA MFCS operated in fed batch mode. It was hypothesized that the poor stability in performance of the MFC was due to low wastewater strength. Therefore, the wastewater was amended with 1 g/L sodium acetate and operated using the AC-CS cathode in continuous flow mode.  The use of the acetate amended wastewater resulted in stable operation and reproducible performance between replicate reactors. The anodes had a high negative potential and polarization data did not show signs of power overshoot. This indicates that the graphite fiber brush anodes will perform better under high COD conditions.\nAn alternative cathode material was examined in separate tests using smaller cube type MFCs to determine if incorporating nitrogen and phosphorus into the activated carbon material would improve performance, as reported by others by a press process, when cathodes were instead constructed using a phase inversion process. After immersing cellulose in an ammonium phosphate solution, allowing it to air dry, and then heating in a nitrogen atmosphere at 5\u00b0C/min to 900\u00b0C, this material was then used to make a cathode by a phase inversion process. The power performance achieved with this dual doped cellulose-derived activated carbon cathode (cellulose N+P) was compared to a plain, self-manufactured cellulose activated carbon (cellulose) and a purchased (Norit) peat-based activated carbon (AC). All cathodes were constructed using a phase inversion process and tested with a buffered solution using sodium acetate as the substrate in a cube MFC. It was anticipated that the cellulose N+P cathode MFC would perform the best, as it was previously reported by others to have performed better than a platinum catalyst cathode MFC. However, the performance achieved in this study was only half that previously reported when using nearly identical reactors and solution conditions, but using a phase inversion process to bind the catalyst to the current collector. The plain AC cathode MFC performed the best among the three cathode materials tested, producing a maximum power density of 1460 mW/m2. The cellulose cathode MFC produced only 192 mW/m2. Doping the cellulose material with nitrogen and phosphorus improved performance relative to the cellulose material, but the cathode did not result in power densities greater than those using plain AC cathodes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10841], "author_name_tesi": "Stager, Jennifer L", "last_name_ssi": "Stager", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microbial Fuel Cell", "Anode", "Cathode"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Exploring the Relationship Between Culture and Participation In An Introduction To Art MOOC", "id": "28916", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12060", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Massive online open courses (MOOCs) are high enrollment college-level courses that serve learners from around the world and provide a mechanism for studying large, diverse populations of learners.

Chapter 2 reports a new method for filtering mass spectrometric data using the percent hydrogen of a compound.  To demonstrate the utility of the data filter, it was used to accelerate bioactive compound discovery by directing biological assays toward anticipated neutral lipids.  Through the use of accurate mass measurements from time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and fragment ion masses generated using nonselective collision-induced dissociation (CID), a previously unknown lipid activator of constitutive androstane receptor 2 (CAR2) was identified as di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP).  Chapter 3 advances the ability of mass spectrometry to selectively detect isomers, using a rapid ultra high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for distinguishing two dioctyl phthalate esters, di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP).  Elution of the lipid standards is achieved in a 5 minute chromatography run and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) tandem mass spectrometry methods yield data for quantification.  In Chapter 4, a MS/MS method is developed upon existing technologies to determine the relative ratios of isomeric phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids in Arabidopsis thaliana extracts.  After demonstrating the ability of the method to distinguish between isomers, the fragmentation behavior of PE lipids was investigated.

We have found that amiodarone interacts with muscarinic receptors in a specifically allosteric manner.  In radioligand binding studies, amiodarone was only able to partially inhibit the binding of the orthosteric antagonist [3H]N-methylscopolamine (NMS).  Additionally, amiodarone was able to alter the rate of dissociation of [3H]NMS from M1, M2, and M5 receptors.  These findings suggest that NMS and amiodarone are able to bind to the receptor simultaneously.  Furthermore, the pharmacology of the effect on NMS dissociation demonstrated that amiodarone does not interact with the \u201ccommon\u201d site at which gallamine, obidoxime, and many other muscarinic allosteric ligands are known to bind.  \nIn functional studies, amiodarone enhanced the response stimulated by an acetylcholine concentration that produced about 20% of maximal arachidonic acid release from the M5 receptor.  However, under the same conditions, amiodarone did not enhance M1 arachidonic acid release.  More detailed studies at M5 found that the effect of amiodarone was to enhance the efficacy of acetylcholine, without increasing its potency.  This was the first demonstration of allosteric enhancement of efficacy at the M5 receptor, and the first demonstration of enhancement of efficacy but not potency at any muscarinic receptor.  \nAmiodarone also enhanced the maximal level of agonist-stimulated release of arachidonic acid (AA) by the M3 muscarinic receptor; this enhancement was observed for acetylcholine and for the partial agonist pilocarpine.  A similar effect of amiodarone was observed when pilocarpine was used to stimulate inositol phosphate (IP) metabolism, but not when acetylcholine was used.  Subsequent studies showed that the IP response exhibited a much larger receptor reserve than the AA response, and reduction of that reserve by receptor alkylation unmasked amiodarone\u2019s enhancement of the maximal IP response to acetylcholine.  Modulating the receptor reserve also revealed acetylcholine\u2019s greater affinity (KA) for the conformation of the receptor that mediates the AA response.  \nThe amiodarone analog N\u00adethylamiodarone (NEA) did not alter the maximal agonist response stimulated by M3, but merely reduced agonist potency (that is, it appeared to be an antagonist).  However, the action of NEA could be clearly distinguished from the action of the orthosteric antagonist NMS. Demonstration of this point was facilitated by an elaboration of Hall\u2019s allosteric two-state model; this new model represents a system composed of two ligands that compete with each other at the orthosteric site and two ligands that compete with each other at the allosteric site.  In conclusion, amiodarone competes with NEA at a novel, extracellular, allosteric site to enhance the maximal stimulation evoked by acetylcholine and pilocarpine in two different responses.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1789, 1790], "author_name_tesi": "Stahl, Edward L", "last_name_ssi": "Stahl", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Edward", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Ellis", "John Ellis", "Victor Alan Canfield", "Robert G Levenson", "Blaise Peterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Ellis, Dissertation Advisor", "John Ellis, Committee Chair", "Victor Alan Canfield, Committee Member", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member", "Blaise Peterson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["G protein-coupled receptors", "acetylcholine", "muscarinic", "allosteric", "amiodarone"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Genetic, Epigenetic and Chromosomal Domain Influences on Gene Expression from the Inactive X Chromosome", "id": "19242", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9220", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "X chromosome inactivation (XCI) silences one X chromosome in females to equalize expression between males and females. Despite the chromosome-wide nature of XCI, ~15% of genes escape inactivation. Escapees are frequently found as clusters, suggesting coordinate regulation.

The goal of this thesis is to better understand regulation of Xi gene expression by evaluating variable genes in an effort to reveal genetic and epigenetic influences.\nTo evaluate variable Xi expression, I isolated a large number of clonal cell lines from both related and unrelated individuals and scored transcribed polymorphisms to quantitatively measure allele-specific expression. The basis of variability due to cell-to-cell differences was examined by testing Xi gene expression in multiple independent clonal lines, and showed that despite inter-individual variation, intra-individual expression is remarkably stable. Strikingly, Xi levels are inherent to a given X as expression can differ even between maternal and paternal Xi clones derived from a single individual. Nonetheless, these results also exclude trans-acting influences for two genes (HCFC1 and NAA10) as the isogenic lines share an autosomal background. Xi heritability was also assessed. For NAA10, divergent Xi expression of the same X in related females excludes heritability, yet similar analysis of HCFC1 is consistent with cis-acting influences.\nTo assess regional influences associated with coordinate regulation of escape, variable genes from two escape domains were examined. Remarkably, clustered genes show extensive Xi variability, prompting redefinition of these domains as \u2018escape-prone.\u2019 Within domains Xi levels correlated for most genes, suggesting coordinate regulation of expression within a cluster. Lastly, epigenetic analysis showed promoter hypomethylation for three variable genes independent of Xi expression level, whereas NAA10 methylation was inversely correlated, suggesting hypomethylation contributes to a poised state for some genes.

Management objectives include maintaining the landscape as it existed during the historic 1863 Civil War battle (e.g., dense understory in woodlots) in GNMP, and as it existed during the Eisenhowers\u2019 occupancy (e.g., patchwork of cropfields). Browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) diminished regeneration of native trees in woodlots and prevented crops from reaching maturity. Thus, to increase regeneration in woodlots and reduce crop damage, the National Park Service (NPS) began culling deer in 1995 to reach a density of 10 deer per square km of forest. However, park managers required an accurate population estimate to determine if this management goal has been met. Therefore, I captured and fitted adult and juvenile male and female deer with Global Positioning System (GPS) collars and performed surveys at dusk and at night, from April 2009 to November 2010, to estimate abundance using mark-resight methods. I found that the average detection probability during the April 2010 dusk count was 0.25, compared to 0.54 from research conducted over 20 years prior. Previous research used only marked female deer, and a number of factors that influence detectability of deer likely changed over time. Park managers can use my updated as their sighting index to estimate deer abundance during future deer counts, which may provide more accurate estimates of abundance. However, factors that influence detection probability can change over time; thus, accuracy of future estimates of abundance could change.\n\nAdditionally, I conducted distance sampling surveys from roads during mark-resight surveys at night to test assumptions when roads are used as transects with distance sampling. A critical requirement of distance sampling is that transects are placed randomly on the landscape to obtain a representative sampling of the study area and to meet the assumption that the distribution of deer is uniform with respect to perpendicular distances to transects. Roads have been used as transects for distance sampling and provide logistical advantages, but roads may be correlated with habitat characteristics and the distribution of the animals. Distance sampling can be a useful estimator for monitoring abundance; however, if roads are used as transects, the magnitude and direction of the bias are unknown unless information on the distribution of the animal is available. Therefore, I used GPS locations from GPS-collared deer to model the distribution of deer relative to roads using a resource selection function (RSF). During the hours when I conducted spotlight surveys, the distribution of deer was not uniform with respect to the location of roads in both forested and non-forested areas. Deer avoided areas close to roads, were more likely to be found near the park boundary, and selected for forested areas and open areas near forest edges. The estimator of detection probability was positively biased when deer avoided roads; thus, estimates of density in the sampled area were negatively biased. Although I failed to reject the null hypothesis that using roads as transects provided a representative sampling of the study area, extrapolating biased density estimates from the sample to the study area likely resulted in biased estimates of abundance in the study area. Further, estimates of abundance from distance sampling, using roads as transects, were lower than estimates of abundance from mark-resight estimators. Additionally, I demonstrated how the RSF can be used to account for non-random placement of transects to obtain more accurate estimates of abundance. \n\nBoth mark-resight and distance sampling estimators provided density estimates approximately 4 times greater than the park\u2019s goal of 10 deer per square km of forested land. I estimated abundance for April 2010 as 368 (95% CI = 322 \u2013 421) and density as 43 deer/km2 of forest during dusk mark-resight surveys; 403 (95% CI = 297 \u2013 546; density = 48 deer per square km of forest) during spotlight mark-resight surveys; and 381 (95% CI = 238 \u2013 607; density = 45 deer per square km of forest) during distance sampling surveys. I estimated abundance for November 2010 as 425 (95% CI = 196 \u2013 921; density = 50 deer per square km of forest) during dusk mark-resight surveys; 598 (95% CI = 420 \u2013 852; density = 71 deer per square km of forest) during spotlight mark-resight surveys; and 366 (95% CI = 255 \u2013 525; density = 43 deer per square km of forest) during distance sampling surveys. However, density within the entire study area was not homogenous. I observed more deer on private lands in the study area and fewer deer on NPS owned property. Park staff have observed increased tree regeneration and reduced crop damage since culling was initiated, even though current deer densities are approximately 4 times greater than the goal specified in the GNMP-ENHS deer management plan. Consequently, the NPS may want to consider re-evaluating deer density goals.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1521], "author_name_tesi": "Stainbrook, David Philip", "last_name_ssi": "Stainbrook", "middle_name_ssi": "Philip", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach", "Duane R Diefenbach"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor", "Duane R Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Global Positioning System (GPS)", "Lincoln-Petersen", "mark-resight", "Bowden", "abundance", "density", "bias", "non-uniform transects", "roads", "distance sampling", "Odocoileus virginianus", "white-tailed deer", "resource selection", "habitat use", "Gettysburg", "Pennsylvania"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "A STUDY OF IONIZATION DYNAMICS IN CLUSTERS", "id": "6314", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2989", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Delayed ionization is a fascinating phenomenon in which the ionization of a cluster is measured on a microsecond time-scale; one billion times slower than prompt ionization described by Einstein\u2019s photoelectric effect.

The multidomain Gag polyprotein of RSV assembles nascent viral particles by first binding the viral genome and then trafficking to the plasma membrane where budding occurs. Gag trafficks through the nucleus during assembly, and nuclear trafficking of Gag is required for efficient packaging of the viral genome. Gag is directed into the nucleus by two distinct nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that bind three different host nuclear import factors. One NLS in the nucleocapsid (NC) domain contains a canonical stretch of basic residues that mediates nuclear entry through the Importin !/\" pathway. The other NLS resides in the matrix (MA) domain and does not contain sequence similarity to any previously described NLS. This NLS interacts with the non-canonical import factors Importin 11 and Transportin 3 (TNPO3). The role of each NLS and import factor in virus assembly is not clearly defined. Here, the contribution of TNPO3 to Gag nuclear import is examined.\n\nIn cells, the C-terminal cargo-binding domain of TNPO3 binds serine-arginine rich regions of splicing factors to import the splicing factor into the nucleus. Quantitative microscopy data presented here demonstrate that overexpression of TNPO3 facilitates the entry of Gag into the nuclei of transfected cells. GST pull down assays revealed that Gag and TNPO3 engage in a novel, direct protein-protein interaction. The MA domain does not contain a serine- arginine-rich domain characteristic of TNPO3 cargoes, and the cargo-binding domain of TNPO3 is dispensable for this interaction. Additional quantitative imaging experiments presented here show that TNPO3 cooperates with Imp\" but not Imp11 to mediate Gag nuclear import. Future experiments will address the roles of each NLS and individual import factors in Gag nuclear trafficking and virus replication, as well as the relationships between them.

Data centers will thus find it more challenging to meet their SLAs (Service Level Agreements), as the latency of the 90th percentile of requests may become quite unpredictable. To alleviate this growing concern, we utilize a stacked DRAM architecture as a LLC (last-level cache) that is modified to exploit some common power-law access patterns in user requests. More specifically, we observe that the majority of the memory traffic generated by a key-value store is due to requests for large values, even though large values account for a very small portion (typically around 5%) of overall requests. Thus, we choose to prioritize the cachelines that belong to large values in the stacked DRAM cache by allowing priority cachelines to only be evicted by other priority cachelines.

This work started with an effort to explore the possibility of superconductivity within a single unit cell crystalline flake.  This represents one form of extreme confinement, such that superconductivity is restricted to a two-dimensional sheet.  In this section of the dissertation I focused on the layered superconductor NbSe$_2$, and successfully measured superconducting single unit cell flake devices.  In these devices I show that the superconducting T$_c$ is strongly suppressed as the thickness of the flake is reduced.  Furthermore, electrostatic tuning of the charge carrier density in these thin flakes of NbSe$_2$ shows stronger than expected T$_c$ modulation.  This suggests that a simple single band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer(BCS) model is insufficient to describe the superconductivity in NbSe$_2$, possibly due to segregated superconducting bands, charge freezing due to the charge density wave transition(CDW), or a crossover to strongly coupled superconductivity in these ultrathin flakes of NbSe$_2$.  \n\nIn an effort to understand the effects of geometric constraints and sample topology further we performed a series of experiments on lithographically fabricated Aluminum devices.  The first of these experiments focused on ultrasmall superconducting squares, with lateral sizes, L,  approaching the zero temperature superconducting coherence length, $\\xi$(0).  Samples of this size should not be able to host a Abrikosov vortex, and the superconducting order parameter cannot widely vary.  Therefore in the Ginzburg-Landau theory minimal variation of the order parameter is expected, and these devices approach a 0-dimensional limit.  We measured the phase diagrams of samples ranging from 140 nm, the quasi- 0-dimensional squares, to 620 nm, mesoscopic squares which are expected to host vortices, and found that the large samples indeed host few vortex states, while intermediate sized samples show the expected vortex free regime.  However for the smallest samples we found an unexpected quantization in the phase diagrams, which possibly suggests novel physics, but is more readily attributed to the influence of the measurement electrodes on the device.  \n\nThese lithographically fabricated ultrasmall devices provide an experimental system to study the effects of different sample topology.  Specifically we focused on nanoscopic loops, where de Gennes predicted that superconductivity could be destroyed when the loop was threaded with half flux quanta, resulting in a ``destructive regime.''  de Gennes also predicted that superconductivity within the destructive regime could be restored by adding a superconducting side branch to the loop.  We report the first experimental observation of this effect in these lithographically fabricated loops.  Furthermore the experimental design, using a loop rather than a cylinder, allows the study of quantum superconducting fluctuations near the destructive regime.   \n\nThe strong effect of the side branch on superconductivity in ultra small loops stresses the importance of the topology of the entire device on superconductivity.  To gain additional insight into this problem we also studied thin lithographically fabricated superconducting nanowires connected to bulk electrodes.  In this system, similar to previous experimental results, we observe a magnetic field enhancement of the superconducting critical current, I$_c$, which is correlated to the suppression of superconductivity within the bulk electrodes.  This non-equilibrium effect we attribute to the diffusion of quasi-particles into and out of the superconducting nanowire, leading to enhanced dissipation and cooling respectively.

Conventionally designed and constructed masonry does not fare well against such intense out-of-plane loading due to its low flexural capacity and brittle nature.

Alfalfa and weed yield were most influenced by herbicide treatment.  Season alfalfa yields were increased and weed yields were decreased by herbicide application.  In the first harvest following herbicide application there was some injury from imazethapyr resulting in reduced alfalfa yield compared to the glyphosate plots but the injury was temporary and at the end of the year, alfalfa yield was no different between the two herbicides.  Lengthening harvest intervals increased alfalfa yield while weed yield remained unchanged.  This lengthening of time between harvests also resulted in higher overall forage yield that contained a higher percentage of alfalfa when no herbicide was used.

Currently, there is no efficient means of generating CMV-specific CTL from CMV-seronegative donors; therefore, CMV disease remains problematic for CMV-seropositive HSC transplant recipients from CMV-seronegative donor.  The general objective of this thesis project was to develop new methods for generating and enriching CMV-specific CTL from CMV-seronegative donors.  Furthermore, this project focuses on understanding the changes in primary CMV-specific T cell responses over the course of in vitro culture in addition to determining the initial cell population from which CMV-specific CTL are in vitro primed and expanded.  To address the main objective, we first determined whether CMV-specific CTL could be in vitro generated from CMV-seronegative donor PBMC stimulated with CMV lysate-matured DC (DC-L), CMV lysate-matured DC which were peptide mix-pulsed (DC-L+P), or CMV peptide mix-pulsed DC (DC-P).  CMV-seronegative DC-L+P-stimulated cells exhibited the greatest cytotoxicity and IFN-&#947; production against pp65 peptide mix-pulsed target cells as compared to DC-L- and DC-P-stimulated cells.  Therefore, we used CMV-seronegative DC-L+P-stimulated cells to assess the functional and phenotypic changes of CMV-specific CTL throughout in vitro culture.  We determined that four stimulations with DC-L+P and enrichment were required before cytotoxicity was exhibited against endogenously processed CMV-antigens.  Furthermore, CMV-specific IFN-&#947; production could be detected prior to the detection of CMV-specific cytotoxicity.  Lastly, to determine the initial cell population from which CMV-specific CTL are generated from CMV-seronegative donors, we magnetically sorted PBMC based on CCR7+ and CD45RA+ expression using MACS-beads prior to DC-L+P-stimulation.  CCR7-CD45RA+  but not CCR7+ or CCR7-CD45RA- DC-L+P stimulated cells from one out of two CMV-seronegative donors tested exhibited CMV-specific cytotoxicity against peptide mix-pulsed target cells and target cells expressing endogenously processed CMV-antigens.  Since CCR7-CD45RA+ cells are considered to be effector memory cells, the CMV-specific responses exhibited by CCR7-CD45RA+ cells may have been caused by contaminating CCR7+CD45RA+ na\u00efve cells.  The contributions of the na\u00efve cell population should be further studied using a more efficient selection method.  Optimization of the in vitro culture conditions is required for consistent expansion of CMV-specific CTL from CMV-seronegative donors.  CMV-specific responses from a larger number of CMV-seronegative donors in vitro stimulated with DC-L+P still needs to be determined.  Potentially, the CMV-specific CTL generated in vitro from CMV-seronegative donors following DC-L+P-stimulation could be used for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of fatal CMV infections of CMV-seropositive stem cell transplant recipients from CMV-seronegative donors.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4261], "author_name_tesi": "Stamer, Mindy Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Stamer", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Mindy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth G Lucas", "Kenneth G Lucas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth G Lucas, Thesis Advisor", "Kenneth G Lucas, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["T cells", "adoptive T cell therapy", "cytomegalovirus", "T cell priming"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Bringing the Adult Learning Experience of Successful Weight Loss Maintenance into Focus: A Narrative Analysis with Implications for Educators and Clinicians", "id": "19674", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9318", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In light of the many social, medical, and political viewpoints on obesity, little is known of the weight loss maintenance experience and the impact on learning processes and outcomes among adults.

This effort can be roughly categorized into three parts. Part 1 is a mathematical and numerical analysis of the general characteristics of circular arrays. The analysis includes a derivation of pattern functions for arrays of isotropic and endfire elements that extends beyond what has been presented in the literature to the limits of manageability (Chapter 2). This includes the derivation of a new closed form expression for the directivity of either isotropic (in the plane of the array) or analytically specified endfire element patterns with a variable elevation beamwidth.\n\n\nA parameter study of the circular array follows (Chapter 5). An empirical approach was undertaken to answer questions left unresolved from the mathematical analysis, which, because of the inherent complexity, is inconclusive. The resulting parameter study documents the relative performance available from a specific array as a function of the physical size, the number of elements, and the element beamwidth. The study demonstrates that the number of array elements is the primary factor limiting the ability to minimize the beamwidth (in the plane of the array) and sidelobe levels. Other discussions include the unavoidable element-element coupling (Chapter 3), relative energy contained in element patterns of various beamwidths, and the observation of a positive relationship between inter-element coupling and element phase center movement towards the array center.\n\n\nUtilizing the results from Part 1, Part 2 discusses the optimization strategy of the element and the array (Chapter 6). Two moment method codes-one of which works directly with a quasi-Newton optimizer-were used to complete the physical design. A complete array was fabricated and tested. Two critically important concepts are presented here. The first is that assuming the pre-1983 IEEE definition of gain is adopted, referred to throughout the thesis as system gain, then the voltage excitation that maximizes the system gain for an array of arbitrary geometry is simply proportional to the field contributions at a given beam angle from the respective elements. The second concept is that despite strong inter-element coupling, an array with a desirable set of element characteristics can be created by performing an optimization on an isolated element. This is of significance because the optimization of the electromagnetic model of the array can be prohibitive, for the sheer number of unknowns present.\n\n\nPart 3 develops the appropriate beamforming methods. Several techniques are used. The first, based upon a linear least-squares method (LLS), is suitable for reception (Chapter 4). Here it is shown that the LLS method can be used to maximize the directivity. Along this line, the effect that the so-called target null-to-null beamwidth has on the array efficiency (and consequent system gain) is noted and discussed. Both weighted and unweighted versions are considered. With weighting, sidelobes of -40 dB are demonstrated. For transmission, a new means of placing a taper across the aperture while simultaneously operating all amplifiers at full power is introduced. An eight-port vector combiner, which forms the basis of this capability, is explained. The sequential quadratic programming method is employed to permit non-linear array weighting constraints (Chapter 7). Non-linear constraints are needed to maximize the effectiveness of the combiner. This approach to a tapered transmit beam affords the full system gain of a uniform excitation (or more), while reducing peak sidelobes by approximately 11 dB.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2884], "author_name_tesi": "Stamm, James Matthew", "last_name_ssi": "Stamm", "middle_name_ssi": "Matthew", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Kenneth Jenkins", "Raymond J Luebbers", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Anthony J Ferraro", "Douglas Henry Werner", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", "Raymond J Luebbers, Committee Member", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Chair", "Anthony J Ferraro, Committee Member", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Member", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Circular Array", "Optimization", "Scanning"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Exploring Two Drug and Alcohol Policies: Where are the Best Interests of the Student?\n\n", "id": "8125", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4109", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "How schools weigh their response to students involved with drugs and alcohol against the needs of society, the school, and the student is a decision with implications that reach beyond the immediate issue of possession.\nShapiro and Stefkovich (2005) and Stefkovich (2006) propose a model for making ethical decisions regarding the welfare of students in the midst of competing interests.

This qualitative multiple case study sought to explore the rationale for provisions of regional student drug and alcohol policies and determine to what extent they served the best interests of the student.  To that end the following research questions were posed: (a) how do different social actors representing individuals, the state, and the public define what constitutes best interests of the student, (b) how do these criteria differ across different institutional actors, and (c) what structural factors shape the criteria used by these different actors?\nAt the initial site, data was collected and analyzed to identify patterns and themes relative to the research questions.

This preliminary evaluation was intended to determine whether further design and development of the RGWPS is a warranted endeavor. The structural performance of the RGWPS transparent polycarbonate sheathing was evaluated under monotonic and cyclical in-plane lateral shear loads using ASTM E 2126-08, and the compressive load performance of the RGWPS backup frame was evaluated using ASTM E 72-05. Thermal and energy performances were evaluated using THERM, WINDOW and Energy-10 software.

Patients with a higher level of self-efficacy for communicating pain were expected to be more likely to disclose their pain-related experiences to their spouse (H1).  Higher pain disclosure was expected to be associated with increased marital satisfaction for only those patients who feel understood in their pain (H2). Lastly, using dyadic modeling, it was anticipated that patients and spouses who reported increased levels of spouse understanding patient pain would report, and have a partner who reports, greater marital satisfaction (H3a) and lesser depressive symptoms (H3b). \nResults partially confirmed hypotheses. Patients with a higher efficacy for communicating their pain to their spouse tended to disclose more of their pain to the spouse. Contrary to hypothesis, patients who felt more understood in their pain and disclosed more were not more satisfied in their marriages. Additionally, results suggested that patients who feel more understood by their spouse report, and have spouses who report, higher levels of marital satisfaction. Neither patient nor spouse perceptions of spouse understanding had an influence on depressive symptomatology for patients or spouses. In sum, results suggest the complexity of patient pain disclosure and highlight the importance of patient perceptions of spouse understanding for both dyad members\u2019 relational well-being.

Though usually the responsibility for medieval cathedral building belonged to the clergy, the Oeuvre Notre-Dame workshop at Strasbourg had been governed by lay citizen administration since the late thirteenth century. Though these early citizen patrons came from the ruling patrician class, in a few decades they were joined in their building efforts by the very artisans who were struggling to gain political enfranchisement. Donations to the fabric of the west front began to increase as the result of the creation of a manuscript. This little studied \"Liber Donationum\" of c. 1320, in which the name of each donor was written, was in large measure responsible for the financial success of the west front project. The book was kept on the altar of the Virgin chapel, where masses were said for the souls of the departed patrons. The book and chapel, together with the west front itself, provided a perpetual memorial for these faithful that was at once more elaborate than any other monument in the city and at the same time affordable to nearly everyone. The completion of Strasbourg's west front, with its famous single spire, is due ultimately to the critical years of the early fourteenth century, when the citizens were persuaded to fund an expensive structure that both offered individual spiritual benefits and promoted the growth of civic unity and pride.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1260], "author_name_tesi": "Stanford, Charlotte A", "last_name_ssi": "Stanford", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Charlotte", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Bradford Smith", "Craig Robert Zabel", "Charlotte Marie Houghton", "James R Sweeney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Bradford Smith, Committee Chair", "Craig Robert Zabel, Committee Member", "Charlotte Marie Houghton, Committee Member", "James R Sweeney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["medieval history", "Gothic architecture", "church patronage"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "LOCAL TETRAHYDROBIOPTERIN AUGMENTS REFLEX CUTANEOUS VASODILATION IN AGED HUMAN SKIN\n", "id": "12355", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "542", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reflex cutaneous vasodilation (VD) is attenuated in aged skin, potentially resulting in decreased heat loss during heat exposure.

Therefore, the purpose of this series of studies was to examine the efficacy of oral intervention strategies that could potentially increase bioavailable BH4 in improved reflex cutaneous VD and VC in a healthy, older population. In the first set of studies, we hypothesized that acute oral sapropterin (Kuvan\u00ae, shelf-stable pharmaceutical formulation of BH4) would acutely augment reflex VD and VC in aged skin through nitric oxide (NO)-mediated  and adrenergic mechanisms, respectively. Oral sapropterin acutely increased bioavailable BH4 in aged skin microvasculature sufficiently to (1) increase NO-dependent dilation and restore reflex VD, and (2) increase both reflex and pharmacologically-induced VC through adrenergic mechanisms. In a follow up study, we tested a chronic sapropterin intervention in 4 older adults. The results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that chronic sapropterin augments reflex VD in older human skin. However, there was not sufficient evidence to suggest efficacy in improved reflex VC in the same population. Collectively, these findings suggest that sapropterin acutely restores vessel function in healthy, older adults and that chronic sapropterin may be a viable intervention for improved vascular function in this population. Finally, we hypothesized that chronic folic acid supplementation, which increases endogenous BH4 bioavailability, would augment reflex VD in aged skin. Folic acid (5mg/daily for 6 weeks) increased reflex VD in healthy, older cutaneous microvasculature through NO-dependent mechanisms. These findings suggest that folic acid treatment may be an effective intervention strategy for improved vascular endothelial function in older adults. Taken together, this series of studies suggests that oral intervention strategies that increase BH4 bioavailability are capable of restoring cutaneous vascular function in healthy, older adults.

Studying such complex systems through experiment encounters many challenges, including availability and resolution of experimental data, and control over system parameters to be studied.

In order to simulate these large systems for the durations required for the desired behavior to evolve, atomistic structure is often represented approximately by \u201ccoarse-grain\u201d techniques.  Dissipative particle dynamics is one simulation technique which makes large size- and time-scales accessible.  Current DPD simulations typically represent two surfaces for adsorption, even when the second surface merely serves to bound the opposite one end of the simulation box.  To eliminate the computational demand of such a redundant system, here we use a specular reflecting boundary condition as an alternative.  This boundary inverts bead Z-velocity at the box ceiling to bounce them back into the simulation.  We identify requirements for a successful reflecting boundary.  This boundary is validated by comparison with results of a reference system with a second surface and no reflective boundary.  Simulation results including surface adsorption, fluid bead density and temperature are used to confirm the equivalence of the results with both boundary methods.  Simulation data are evaluated to assess the adsorption behavior of model protein chains of varying geometry onto simulated surfaces of varying hydrophilicity.

A Python framework is developed to automate the generation of airfoil performance tables using the RANS CFD solver OVERFLOW 2.2i allowing the optimization methodology to be extended to rotorcraft applications. An empirical maximum lift coefficient criteria is developed and incorporated into the table generation process to overcome inaccuracies associated with stall prediction in CFD-based methods. The methodology presented is used to perform a single point shape optimization on the tip airfoil of a UH-60A baseline rotor.

On a per serving basis, cocoa has a higher phenolic content and antioxidant activity than green tea and red wine.  Cocoa polyphenols are primarily flavan-3-ol monomers and proanthocyanidins (PaCs) with degree of polymerization (DP) previously identified up to ten. Ongoing research suggests that these polyphenols may account for potential health benefits of cocoa products.  Polyphenols are oxidatively unstable, and processing operations such as roasting and alkalization have been suggested to reduce total polyphenol (TP) content, measured as non-specific estimations of total phenolic content and low DP PaCs. There is a need for investigation of the effects of cocoa processing on high DP PaCs.  The objectives of this thesis were to: (1) develop a new method for quantification of PaCs using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD), (2) investigate the effects of alkalization of cocoa powder on color, TP, and PaC composition, and (3) investigate the effects of whole bean cocoa roasting on color, TP, PaC composition, and aroma. \n\nFor the alkalization study, commercial cocoa powder was dispersed in water and then heated to 92\u02daC in 6 min. Sodium hydroxide was added to achieve a pH of 8. Color (L, a, b, \u0394E), pH, TP, and PaC concentration data was collected 0.5, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min after base addition. For the roasting study, 100 g cocoa beans were roasted in a convection oven for various time/temperature combinations (10, 20, 30, 40 minutes at 100, 130, 150, 170, 190\u02daC) using a full factorial design. Samples were analyzed for TP, color, and flavan-3-ol monomers, PaCs, and aroma.  \n\nAll alkalization treatments caused a significant change in color (p < 0.0001). (+)-Catechin increased by 40%, while EC and PaCs decreased by 23-66%. PaC loss was modeled using a two-phase exponential decay model. The fit was best for EC and PaCs of odd DP, with R2 > 0.7.  Roasting treatments reduced TP up to 40%. All treatments at 190\u02daC, 170\u02daC, and 150\u02daC except 10 min, significantly decreased EC content and significantly increased (+)-catechin content as compared to unroasted beans (p < 0.05). For all PaCs DP 2-5, a decreasing trend in PaC content was observed with increasing time and temperature of roasting. Interestingly, DP 6 and DP 7 significantly increased from the unroasted control for some of the170\u02daC and 190\u02daC treatments, with upwards of 280% and 214%, respectively (p < 0.05).  \n\nFormation of high DP PaCs are important when biological significance is taken into account, in terms on antioxidant activity and inhibition of digestive enzymes pancreatic lipase and phospholipase A2.  Alkalization of cocoa powders does not reduce these compounds to the extent previously believed. Roasting cocoa beans at 170\u02daC or above results in the highest production of DP 6 and 7 PaCs. In addition to meeting the sensory quality based on consumer needs, processing conditions used to produce cocoa products should confer greater health benefits to consumers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10060], "author_name_tesi": "Stanley, Todd Harvey", "last_name_ssi": "Stanley", "middle_name_ssi": "Harvey", "first_name_ssi": "Todd", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert, Thesis Advisor", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cocoa", "polyphenols", "roasting", "alkalization", "HPLC-ECD"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND EMERGENT LITERACY: DIRECT AND MEDIATED PREDICTORS\n\n\n", "id": "11231", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1090", "abstract_tesi": "Although recent research supports Executive Function (EF) as a predictor of Emergent Literacy, multiple questions remain.

Toward this end, etiological work in college alcohol prevention has identified several decision-making variables related to underage drinking including alcohol expectancies, perceived peer norms, and social influences (Borsari, Murphy, & Barnett, 2007; Sher & Rutledge, 2007).  In addition, patterns of heavy alcohol use during the college experience have been established (Del Boca, Darkes, Greenbaum, & Goldman, 2004; Goudriaan, Grekin, & Sher, 2007).  However, little is known about how complex, naturally occurring patterns of decision-making variables may influence students\u2019 alcohol consumption during college.\n  \nThere were 3 aims of the dissertation: (1) to examine naturally occurring patterns of drinking-related decision-making variables measured during the summer prior to college matriculation, (2) to examine trajectories of alcohol consumption in first year college students to identify points in time that students are at the greatest risk for alcohol harm, and (3) to integrate the models from Aims 1 and 2 into a comprehensive model that tested the association between each of the decision-making profiles from Aim 1 with the alcohol consumption trajectories determined from Aim 2.  \n\nThere were several findings in the current study.  First, four distinct decision-making profiles were identified.  Individuals within each of these profiles reported decision-making variable patterns that varied in their amount of favorable beliefs about alcohol use.  In addition, four distinct drinking trajectories were identified.  These trajectories modeled weekly alcohol consumption and included drinking trajectories that described participants who drank alcohol at low levels, moderately-low levels, moderately-high levels, and at high levels.  Finally, these drinking trajectories were modeled within each of the decision-making profiles.  These analyses provided insights into how pre-college variables are related to alcohol consumption in college.  The findings suggested that there was a general increase in drinking upon college matriculation but the amount and consistency of this increase was highly variable within each of the decision-making profiles.  The implications of these findings were discussed in terms of informing efforts to identify at-risk students prior to college matriculation and referring them to appropriate prevention programs.  The findings suggest that screening students for inclusion into intervention efforts based on behavioral measures alone may be inadequate.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2811], "author_name_tesi": "Stapleton, Jerod ", "last_name_ssi": "Stapleton", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jerod", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert James Turrisi", "Robert James Turrisi", "William Gerin", "John Walter Graham", "Michael L Hecht", "Michael John Cleveland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert James Turrisi, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert James Turrisi, Committee Chair", "William Gerin, Committee Member", "John Walter Graham, Committee Member", "Michael L Hecht, Committee Member", "Michael John Cleveland, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["college alcohol use; adolescents; interventions; p"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "SELF-ASSEMBLY AND CHARACTERIZATION OF CANDIDATE MOLECULES FOR MOLECULAR ELECTRONIC AND QUANTUM COMPUTING APPLICATIONS", "id": "6527", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2748", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chapter 1:  An overview of how self-assembly may be utilized in the molecular electronics and quantum computing fields.  \n\nChapter 2: SAMs of the nitro-substituted oligo(phenylene-ethynylene) (OPE), 4,4'-(diethynylphenyl)-2'-nitro-1-benzenethiolate, on Au{111} were prepared.

In contrast, when the nitro-OPE SAM is assembled by hydrolysis of the thioacetate derivative under basic conditions, extensive redox reactions arise in which oxidation of the S atoms occurs with accompanying reduction of -NO2 to -NH2, to form mixed composition SAMs.  Further, the nitro-OPE SAM, regardless of the preparation method, shows significant chemical instability under storage in air and/or light exposure.  \n\nChapter 3:  SAMs of the isocyano derivative of 4,4\u0081f-di(phenylene-ethynylene)benzene, a member of the \u0081gOPE\u0081h family of \u0081gmolecular wires\u0081h, have been prepared on Au{111} and Pd{111} surfaces.

A human sample (4-12 yrs.) consisting of 3D facial surface images (n = 55 for four separate samples: i.e. n = 220 overall) was used to explore developmental instability of the face and patterns of facial covariation between individuals with DS, their siblings, and typically developing sibling pairs. Morphometric analyses were used to infer how gene-dosage imbalance, caused by trisomy 21, is affecting DS craniofacial development. Overall we found increased fluctuating asymmetry in the faces of individuals with DS, which provides evidence for the \"amplified developmental instability\" model put forth by Shapiro (1975, 1983). However, the patterns of differences that we found suggest specific disruptions to regions of the face during craniofacial development rather than the generalized disruptions described by Shapiro under the amplified developmental instability model. Additionally, the results of our investigation found that covariation of facial metrics is different in DS individuals and in DS siblings relative to typically developing siblings. Based on differences in the pattern and strength of integration within and between facial regions in the DS and DS sibling samples, we put forth an \"aneuploid conception model\" to explain why facial integration is lowest in DS siblings and strengthened in DS relative to DS siblings. \n\nIn addition to the human-based analyses, micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) scans and morphometric analysis were employed to evaluate a complete genetic mouse model for DS - the Ts1Yey mouse.

With its ability to broadcast multiple channels HD Radio gives public radio stations a unique opportunity to reconsider localism and provide meaningful citizen access to the airwaves.  The ability to provide diverse local content is particularly important for public radio since it has historically held a position of serving audiences that are underrepresented and underserved by commercial media.\n     Until now, all policymaking attempts to foster localism have used indirect methods that rely on structural regulation or station management to determine how best to serve the local community.  This has resulted in ineffective and inconsistent localism efforts that fail to support a robust public sphere where minority and unorthodox perspectives can be heard.  The full range of opinions and viewpoints and the expression of what matters most to the community is more likely to be achieved by giving members of the local community direct access to the airwaves. \n     Historically, direct access has been considered unfeasible because of the scarcity of frequencies available under the government\u2019s management of the broadcast spectrum.  Digital radio technology now gives stations the ability to transmit additional channels of content.  Under current First Amendment jurisprudence, public radio stations can be required to provide access to broadcasting facilities and equipment for the local public.  Access theory, as applied to broadcasting in prior Supreme Court cases provides a constitutional basis for this proposal.  Current guidelines for PEG channels on cable television provide a workable, practical blueprint for citizen access to public radio.  The potential of HD Radio to be used as a positive force for promoting localism can best be achieved with public radio stations providing public access to broadcasting and production facilities, as well as access to a digital channel on their HD Radio spectrum for the creation and distribution of local content. \n     The intent of this dissertation is to provide a proposal that encourages public radio stations employing HD Radio technology to provide at least one digital channel for local public production and access.  This is proposed in order for public radio stations to help foster the ideals and potential of broadcast localism as well as create a listening environment where local expression is encouraged and developed.  When implemented this proposal will expand the public sphere and afford all individuals an opportunity to participate in public dialogue and democratic self-governance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [927], "author_name_tesi": "Stark, Craig ", "last_name_ssi": "Stark", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Craig", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Jackson", "Matthew Jackson", "Ronald V Bettig", "Rosa A Eberly", "Richard Denny Taylor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Jackson, Committee Chair", "Ronald V Bettig, Committee Member", "Rosa A Eberly, Committee Member", "Richard Denny Taylor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["radio", "localism", "democracy", "HD Radio", "public access", "public radio", "broadcasting"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Engineered Self-Lubricating Coatings Utilizing Cold Spray Technology", "id": "11378", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3829", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It is often beneficial to modify the surface of engineered components to gain desirable properties, such as improved wear resistance.

The nickel encapsulation, via electroless nickel plating, gives the particles desirable properties for the cold spray process.  In fact, this ductile nickel encapsulation protects the brittle boron nitride and allows particle deformation, which is critical for the success of cold spray deposition.  The resulting nickel coating contains imbedded lubricant particles, which are released during intimate contact with a surface. The release of the lubricant particles reduces the interaction between mating materials and the potential for wear.\n \tHexagonal boron nitride particles have been successfully encapsulated through the electroless nickel deposition procedure resulting in powder of 20 micron mean particle size.

The decision to create a new park close to the nation\u2019s capital created the opportunity for an intersection of the mountain culture and outside modern ideals.  As the Commonwealth and federal government worked with developers to build the new Park, those inhabiting the mountain lands were forced to uproot themselves and resettle in the \u201clowlands\u201d.  An examination of what knowledge and information, obtained in formal and informal ways, provided the means for the mountain people of Greene County, Virginia to evolve from isolated mountaineers to residents of the lowlands of rural Virginia.\n\tThis narrative inquiry, framed by conflict theory, and collected as individual interviews to gather oral histories, examination of personal correspondence, and listening to additional interviews gathered by other researchers, tells the story of the Greene County mountain people and their learning experiences.  From lessons taught by mission school teachers, to agricultural and medical knowledge passed down from older generation to young, the stories analyzed and related in this research explain the lives of the mountain people and show the importance they placed on both literacy gained in formal schooling and survival skills such as planting and food preservation taught by parent and grandparents.  That importance, related in almost every field observation, is combined with obstacles that still exist between the mountain people and those in positions of authority, where an air of unawareness about the mountain culture still leads to policy implementation that is not effective for the County\u2019s population.  This research highlights some of those obstacles and seeks to provide insights to help resolve the conflict and improve educational opportunities for all of the County\u2019s population.

An estimated 350 million individuals suffer from chronic HBV infection worldwide, and although several Food and Drug Administration approved therapeutics exist for the treatment of chronic HBV, many are effective only over short administration periods due to their adverse side effect of selecting for drug resistant mutants.  This characteristic of current HBV therapies can have long-term debilitating consequences for the patient. Long-term treatment with existing therapeutic agents can select for drug resistant mutants, many of which are cross-resistant to multiple drugs.  As a result, the infection is even more difficult to clear due to continued HBV replication driven by the stable nuclear viral covalently closed circular (CCC) DNA, which would otherwise be suppressed by pharmacologic management.  This ongoing viral replication can cause continued liver injury, thereby increasing the patient\u2019s risk for developing HCC.  Therefore, novel potent inhibitors of HBV replication capable of targeting multiple aspects of the viral life cycle, and thereby decreasing the chance for the development of resistance, need to be developed and evaluated in models of persistent HBV infection in which their effect on HBV CCC DNA can be monitored.\nRNA interference (RNAi)-based therapy thereby represents a potential treatment for the control and inhibition of multiple diseases.  RNAi is the process by which gene expression is silenced through the sequence-specific degradation of mRNA.  The unique arrangement of the HBV transcripts and the fact that replication occurs through an RNA intermediate make HBV an attractive target for RNAi-based therapy.\nThe aim of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of RNAi technology as a potential anti-HBV therapeutic agent.  To this end, a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequence to a specific, critical region of the HBV genome was tested as follows: 1) for its ability to prevent establishment of HBV infection (pre-HBV exposure system); and 2) for its ability to silence expression of the HBV genome in a model of persistent infection (subculture system).  Lastly, liposomes containing anti-HBV small interfering RNA (siRNA) were assessed as a potential delivery system of RNAi to cells of hepatic origin.\n\tTo accomplish these goals, HBV replication was initiated in HepG2 cells by transduction with HBV\u2013expressing recombinant baculovirus.  Subculture of HBV-expressing HepG2 cells at 10 days post-transduction generates a system in which HBV replication is ongoing and HBV is expressed largely from CCC DNA thus simulating chronic HBV infection.  HepG2 cells were transduced with shRNA expressing baculovirus prior to initiation of HBV replication or during chronic HBV replication and the levels of HBV RNA, HBsAg, replicative intermediates (RI), extracellular (EC) and CCC DNA species were measured.  HBsAg, HBV RNA and DNA levels were markedly reduced through day 8 whether cells were transduced with shRNA prior to or during a chronic infection; however, the CCC DNA species were only affected when shRNA was administered prior to initiation of infection.  These data suggest that RNAi may have therapeutic value for controlling HBV replication at the level of RI and EC DNA and for reducing establishment of CCC DNA during HBV infection.\nTo assess the utility of novel cationic liposomes for the delivery of siRNA to cell lines of hepatic origin, three different liposome formulations were generated: 1) Li-100, 2) Li-75, and 3) LiC-75. Liposome binding efficiency was tested using rhodamine-tagged fluorescent liposomes.  For the HepG2 and C3A cells, all three liposome formulations displayed a strong rhodamine signal suggesting 100% binding efficiencies, while only Li-100 and Li-75 displayed strong signals for Huh7.5 cells.  The ability of cationic liposomes to deliver siRNA to cells of hepatic origin was evaluated using GAPDH-specific siRNA.  Of the liposome formulations tested, only Li-75 was able to deliver anti-GAPDH siRNA to HepG2 and C3A cells, as indicated by a subsequent decrease in GAPDH mRNA.  The ability of anti-HBV siRNA containing Li-75 cationic liposomes to inhibit a persistent HBV infection was evaluated.  Subcultured HBV-infected HepG2 cells were treated with anti-HBV siRNA containing Li-75 cationic liposomes.  Total mRNA was extracted and a marked decrease in HBV mRNA was observed in liposome-treated cells compared to mock-treated cells.  These data suggest that specific cationic liposomes are potential useful delivery vehicles for RNA-based therapeutics to cells of hepatic origin.\nChronic HBV infections will surely continue to prove difficult to treat without the development of novel and effective therapeutics capable of inhibiting multiple aspects of the viral life cycle.  The continued investigation of RNAi-based therapeutics and novel methods of their delivery, both alone and in combination with existing nucleos(t)ide analogues, for the treatment of chronic HBV infections represents a principal area of study to further pharmacotherapeutic management of HBV infections worldwide.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2810], "author_name_tesi": "Starkey, Jason Leonard", "last_name_ssi": "Starkey", "middle_name_ssi": "Leonard", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet C Isom", "Harriet C Isom", "Richard James Courtney", "Jianming Hu", "Neil David Christensen", "Victor Alan Canfield"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harriet C Isom, Dissertation Advisor", "Harriet C Isom, Committee Chair", "Richard James Courtney, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Victor Alan Canfield, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CCC DNA", "RNA Interference", "Hepatitis B Virus", "HepG2 Cells", "shRNA"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Residue Management for Enhancing Sequestration of Legume-Based Nitrogen\n", "id": "9082", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "539", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The practice of cover cropping has long been promoted for its ability to alleviate soil erosion and to help build soil organic matter content.  However, variable results have been reported on the nutrient dynamics of cover crop decomposition, particularly on nitrogen (N) mineralization.  Numerous studies have highlighted the benefits of cereal residues at immobilizing residual N and others have looked at the efficiency of legume covers at providing plant available N as compared to commercial fertilizers.  However, it is still unclear how residue mixes influence overall N leakiness of the system or whether they are economically viable as part of the cash grain rotations.  This project investigates the potential of mixed straw and legume residues for minimizing legume N losses and supplying adequate amounts of N to the follow-up corn crop. Within the study, three levels of Avena sativa (Oat) straw residues (0, 1 or 2 Mg ha-1) were spread over plots with and without planted Vicia villosa sp. (Hairy Vetch). The purpose of the residue addition was to promote N immobilization following vetch termination. Inorganic N was monitored throughout the field season through soil sampling and residue decomposition and N losses from residue were assessed through residue bag sampling.  Results showed a 40 kg ha-1 reduction in mid-summer soil inorganic N levels in vetch plots with straw amendments.  However, straw addition also caused a 7 and 24% corn grain yield reduction for 1 and 2 Mg ha-1 straw additions, respectively. The addition of straw residues appeared to affect the rate of residue decomposition and promoted N retention within residues with approximately 10 kg N ha-1 being sequestered for every megagram of straw retained.  These results suggest an opportunity for reducing N losses in legume-based fertility management systems through retention of small grain residues prior to green-manure termination.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [536], "author_name_tesi": "Starovoytov, Anna ", "last_name_ssi": "Starovoytov", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Paul Gallagher Iii", "Robert Paul Gallagher Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Paul Gallagher Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Paul Gallagher Iii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hairy vetch", "residue", "Nitrogen", "legume", "no till"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "NESTING ECOLOGY AND SITE FIDELITY OF GRASSLAND SPARROWS \nON RECLAIMED SURFACE MINES IN PENNSYLVANIA\n\n", "id": "8360", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2039", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Population declines of many migratory grassland bird populations in North America over the last several decades are thought to be the result of widespread loss of suitable breeding habitat. However, reclamation of surface mining operations in the midwestern and eastern United States has created breeding habitat for many grassland bird species. In western Pennsylvania, >35,000 ha of reclaimed surface mine grasslands are occupied by grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), Henslow\u2019s sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii), and Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) in densities comparable to traditional grassland habitats. Henslow\u2019s sparrows in Pennsylvania nest almost exclusively on reclaimed surface mines. Many species of grassland birds suffer increased nest predation on small (<100 ha) grasslands, and although successful reproduction of grassland sparrows has been documented on large (&#8805;1,000) reclaimed mine grasslands, most reclaimed mine grasslands in Pennsylvania are small (&#8804;100 ha) and nesting success has not been quantitatively described. To assess habitat suitability of reclaimed mine grasslands for nesting grassland sparrows, I investigated nest survival, nest site selection, and site fidelity of grasshopper, Henslow\u2019s, and Savannah sparrows on four reclaimed surface mines in Clearfield and Clarion counties in western Pennsylvania, USA, in 2006 \u2013 2007.\nThere were few clear and consistent patterns in nest site selection, but, in general, all three species placed nests in areas with few shrubs, even though they frequently used shrubs as perches. Henslow\u2019s sparrows placed nests in deeper litter than grasshopper and Savannah sparrows. Henslow\u2019s and Savannah sparrows tended to avoid steep slopes more than grasshopper sparrows, and grasshopper and Henslow\u2019s sparrows preferred areas where the view to the horizon was not steep. All three species avoided placing nests in areas with extensive bare ground.\nGrasshopper and Henslow\u2019s sparrow nests that were well concealed were less likely to fail than highly visible nests, and nests in areas with a deep litter layer were more likely to fail than nests in shallow litter. Savannah sparrow nests in areas with high visual obstruction by vegetation were less likely to fail than nests in areas with sparse and short vegetation. Daily probability of survival for grasshopper sparrow nests followed a quadratic seasonal trend where survival was greatest early and late in the breeding season. Survival of Savannah sparrow nests followed a decreasing linear seasonal trend. There was no seasonal trend in survival of Henslow\u2019s sparrow nests. For all three species, nest survival was greater on days with rainfall events, and for nests of grasshopper and Henslow\u2019s sparrows, but not Savannah sparrows, survival increased with increasing maximum daily temperatures. Overall nest success was 0.422 (95% CI = 0.362 \u2013 0.493) for grasshopper sparrows, 0.369 (95% CI = 0.288 \u2013 0.472) for Henslow\u2019s sparrows, and 0.158 (95% CI = 0.066 \u2013 0.379) for Savannah sparrows.\nAverage annual apparent survival was 0.41 (95% CI = 0.31 \u2013 0.54) for male grasshopper sparrows and detection probability was 1. For male Henslow\u2019s sparrows, average annual apparent survival was 0.33 (95% CI 0.10 \u2013 0.68) and detection probability was 0.43 (95% CI 0.08 \u2013 0.87). \nMale grasshopper sparrows banded in 2006 were 5.6 (95% CI = 1.7 \u2013 18.5) times more likely than females to return in 2007, but the female return rate likely was underestimated because I could not estimate a detection probability. Measures of reproductive success poorly predicted probability of return for both males and females. The median inter-annual territory shift was greater for female grasshopper sparrows (median = 69 m) than for male grasshopper sparrows (median = 33 m), and both males and females that had at least one successful nest in 2006 shifted territories shorter distances in 2007 than birds that had no successful nests in 2006. No returning female Henslow\u2019s sparrows were detected. Of 30 male and 14 female Savannah sparrows present on the study areas in 2006, 11 males (37.7%) and 2 females (14.3%) were seen in 2007.\nSimulations of finite rates of population increase, &#955;, suggested that reproductive success of grassland sparrows on my study areas, especially of grasshopper and Henslow\u2019s sparrows, was adequate to maintain stable populations. Lambda was more sensitive to juvenile survival than to adult survival, and for grasshopper and Henslow\u2019s sparrows, exceeded 1 when juvenile survival was &#8805;0.2. When survival of juvenile Savannah sparrows was 0.2, &#955; was >1 only when adult survival was 0.6, but always was >1 when juvenile survival was &#8805;0.4. \nResults of this study confirm that reclaimed surface mines likely support sustainable populations of grasshopper, Henslow\u2019s, and possibly Savannah sparrows, and thus can play an important role in the conservation of these species in Pennsylvania. This especially is the case for Henslow\u2019s sparrows in Pennsylvania, which nest almost exclusively on reclaimed surface mine grasslands. Reclaimed surface mines require less active management that other grasslands to prevent succession to woody species, and also generally are not attractive for agricultural purposes. Consequently, and in light of relatively poor reproductive success on of these species on agricultural grasslands, reclaimed surface mines are ideally suited for management as grassland bird habitat.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2021], "author_name_tesi": "Stauffer, Glenn E.", "last_name_ssi": "Stauffer", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Glenn", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["site fidelity", "nest site selection", "Reclaimed surface mines", "Grasslands", "nest survival"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Cis-acting sequences involved in targeting Trm1p-II to the inner nuclear membrane in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n", "id": "10108", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3339", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The mechanism of targeting a peripheral protein to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) is not understood. Sequences of Trm1p-II, a peripheral INM protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, were examined to define the cis-acting regions mediating targeting. Both a 9-amino acid nuclear localization sequence (NLS) targeting &#61538;-galactosidase to the nuclear interior as well as a 60-amino acid membrane targeting sequence directing &#61538;-galactosidase to the INM were uncovered. Trm1p-II may possess two NLSs; a classical basic NLS at amino acids 95-102 (NLS#1) and a putative NLS at amino acids 544-552 (NLS#2). NLS#1 is likely recognized by the classical importin, importin &#61538;, based on amino acid sequence similarities with known importin &#61538; substrates, while NLS#2 is recognized by the non-classical importers, Nmd5p and Kap120p. Several regions of Trm1p-II are necessary for INM targeting, including the N-terminus and two internal regions, as deleting these regions releases Trm1-II-GFP from the INM into the nucleoplasm. However, a single cis-acting sequence of Trm1p-II (amino acids 89-151) is sufficient to target passenger protein(s) to the INM. Competition experiments suggest Trm1p-II may be tethered to a second nuclear component, functioning in addition to the membrane partner, to retain Trm1p-II within the nucleus. Ice2p was identified in a genome-wide screen for mutants that mislocate Trm1-II-GFP, suggesting Ice2p may have a role in targeting of Trm1p-II to the INM; deletion of ICE2 releases Trm1-II-GFP from the INM into the nucleoplasm. However, a &#61538;-galactosidase fusion protein containing amino acids 73-151 of Trm1p-II is maintained at the INM in ice2 cells suggesting Ice2p may have a role in the distribution of Trm1p-II around the INM (possibly by regulating a protein(s) involved in this process) rather than functioning directly by binding Trm1p-II at the membrane. As Trm1p-II is acetylated at its N-terminus, we propose a bipartite model for targeting to the INM that requires this protein modification to expose a cis-acting sequence within amino acids 89-151 for binding Trm1p-II to its INM-binding partner. We believe Trm1p-II is targeted to a specific site at the INM and subsequently spread from this site, accounting for the variations in nuclear localization observed with different Trm1p-II fusion proteins.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3329], "author_name_tesi": "Stauffer, Karen A", "last_name_ssi": "Stauffer", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Karen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anita Klein Hopper", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Hui Ling Chiang", "Richard John Frisque", "Leslie Joan Parent"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anita Klein Hopper, Committee Chair", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Chair", "Hui Ling Chiang, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["protein targeting", "peripheral protein", "nucleus", "inner nuclear membrane", "tRNA modification", "yeast"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Community Acceptance of Natural Remediation Methods in Baltimore, Md", "id": "21834", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7468", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Partly due to declining industry and population, the city of Baltimore, MD is left with a brownfield problem - currently containing an estimated 1500 potentially harmful contaminated sites (brownfields). Even though some public funding is available to address these sites, the average cost of assessment and remediation using traditional systems is roughly $211,000 per acre \u2013 causing public funding to fall far short of the task (DeSousa 2002). This points to a need for solutions that are cost effective and easy to implement. Phytoremediation (using plants to absorb pollution) can be such a solution. While not applicable on all sites, phytoremediation is often far less expensive \u2013 up to 1/3 of the cost of traditional remediation techniques such as concrete capping and dig and dump (removing contamination and taking it off site). However, brownfield sites being renewed through phytoremediation tend to look messy and unkempt (Schnoor 1995, 1997; Rafson & Rafson 1999). Since these regenerative landscapes are often seen by the public as \u201craw\u201d and \u201cmessy\u201d, this research examines the question \u2013 how would the community of Baltimore relate to potential phytoremediation systems in their neighborhood?\nAvailable research on brownfields and phytoremediation largely addresses either technical issues of remediation or the theoretical underpinnings of community response to urban nature. This exploratory research synthesized these two research themes and identified 3 key factors that are most likely to impact community acceptance of natural remediation: risk level, cultural cues used in the design of the site, and knowledge/information about the remediation process. In order to asses community acceptance of phytoremediation sites, a survey instrument was developed in which brownfield remediation strategies were displayed visually (using photoreal renderings of each solution) with varying degrees of risk (low to high) and varying cultural cues ranging along a continuum from completely natural to completely orderly. Additionally, two survey versions were developed: one with information associated with each image and one without. The version with information was given to one group of participants and one without information was given to a separate group. Study participants were then asked to rank their acceptance of each proposed solution. Participants also answered questions related to: attractiveness and naturalness of the sites, safety concerns, knowledge about brownfields, attitudes towards natural and conventional remediation strategies and demographic information. This information was analyzed to gain insight into the relationship between acceptance, risk level and design elements or cultural cues. \nAnalysis of the survey results (using a mixed model ANOVA approach) led to several interesting conclusions. The primary finding is that increasing the number of cultural cues or design elements increases acceptance. This implies that the more cues or design elements that are woven into the remediation design; the more likely the community will be to accept it. Relative to concrete capping (the most common remediation technique), any and all forms of natural remediation involving at least one cultural cue are significantly more acceptable.\nWith regards to information it seems ignorance is bliss; i.e. without information people were more accepting of all design solutions than those with information (save for concrete which was equally disliked by both groups). In respect to risk level, a steady decline in acceptance of all proposed solutions can be seen as risk level increased. \nThis study demonstrates that there is a strong public desire for more natural remediation of brownfields relative to traditional techniques. This study also confirms that adding even one cultural cue will likely boost acceptance of messy nature. The major implication of this finding is that cities can make simple interventions (place a sign, mow a strip, plant in rows) that are likely to increase community acceptance of natural remediation projects. Additionally, adding more cues will help people better relate to the site as it will conform more to their idea of what nature should look like in an urban setting. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7414], "author_name_tesi": "Stauffer, Kyle D", "last_name_ssi": "Stauffer", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Landscape Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mallika Bose", "Brian A Orland", "Barry Kew"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mallika Bose, Thesis Advisor", "Brian A Orland, Thesis Advisor", "Barry Kew, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Brownfields", "phytoremediation", "natural remediation", "landscape architecture", "community acceptance", "Baltimore", "Risk Perception"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Bay Breeze Impact on Surface Ozone at Two Coastal Sites Along the Chesapeake Bay from 1986-2010", "id": "14078", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7337", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hourly surface meteorological measurements were coupled with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) surface ozone (O3) mixing ratio measurements at Hampton, Virginia and Baltimore, Maryland, two sites along the Chesapeake Bay, to determine the behavior of surface ozone during bay breeze events and quantify the importance of the bay breeze in a manner similar to Martins et al.

Each day was marked either as a bay breeze day, a non-bay breeze day, or a rainy/cloudy day based on the meteorological data, and ozone analyses were separated likewise.  Eight hour averaged surface ozone values were typically 3 to 5 ppbv higher at Hampton and Baltimore during bay breeze events compared to days without a bay breeze.  Average ozone anomalies in the afternoon were highest at both sites during bay breeze days in the study period 2003-2010.  In conjunction with an overall lowering of ozone levels, the percentage of total exceedances of the EPA eight hour standard of 75 ppbv of ozone during bay breeze days increased dramatically at Hampton for 2003-2010, while remaining relatively the same at Baltimore.  These results suggest that bay breeze circulations are becoming more important to causing pollution events at particular sites in the region, and support the hypothesis of Martins et al.

Since then, global ozonesonde networks have amassed vast data sets, compiling O3 climatologies with which to develop and validate satellite retrieval algorithms, and evaluate chemical transport model output.  A typical way to formulate O3 climatologies is to average ozonesonde profiles on a monthly or seasonal basis, either for specific regions or zonally.  Shortcomings of this simplistic averaging are quantified in this dissertation through use of a statistical clustering technique, self-organizing maps (SOM).  First, the SOM algorithm and its application to ozonesonde profiles are detailed.  Sensitivity tests comparing SOM with the similar k-means algorithm lead to the decision to employ SOM to ozonesonde data sets, and justified the choice of a 3x3 SOM with nine clusters.  SOM is then applied to >4500 ozonesonde profiles from the long-term U.S. monitoring sites Boulder, CO; Huntsville, AL; Trinidad Head, CA; and Wallops Island, VA.  The clusters of surface \u2013 12 km amsl O3 mixing ratio data are closely linked to large-scale meteorological conditions.  At all four sites, profiles in SOM clusters exhibit similar tropopause height, 500 hPa height and temperature, and total and tropospheric column O3.  When profiles from each SOM cluster are compared to monthly O3 means, near-tropopause O3 in three of the clusters is double (over +100 ppbv) the climatological O3 mixing ratio.  The three clusters include 13\u201316% of all profiles, mostly from winter and spring.  Large mid-tropospheric deviations from monthly means (-6 ppbv, +7 \u2013 10 ppbv O3 at 6 km) are found in two highly-populated clusters with a combined 36\u201339% of profiles.  The latter clusters represent both distinctly polluted (summer) and clean O3 (fall-winter, high tropopause) profiles.\nFinally, we explore the capability of SOM clusters to identify high surface O3 events.  Clusters of O3 profile data over a narrowed altitude range (surface \u2013 6 km amsl) from Trinidad Head, CA, are linked to surface O3 monitor data at inland locations in CA.  SOM clusters of O3 profile data from the lower troposphere can discriminate background vs polluted O3 and the conditions linked with each.  Two of nine O3 clusters exhibit thin layers (~100s of m thick) of high O3, typically between 1 and 4 km, and residing above a subsidence inversion associated with a northern location of the semi-permanent Pacific subtropical high.  Ozone in these clusters is upwind of high-altitude surface O3 monitors at inland locations.  The surface O3 monitors at Lassen Volcanic and Yosemite National Parks, and Truckee, CA, display a marked impact of the elevated tropospheric O\u00ac\u00ac3.  Days corresponding to the high O3 clusters exhibit hourly surface O3 anomalies at these sites of +5\u201310 ppbv compared to a climatology; the anomalies can last up to four days. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11767], "author_name_tesi": "Stauffer, Ryan Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Stauffer", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anne Mee Thompson", "William Henry Brune", "George Spencer Young", "John Harlim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anne Mee Thompson, Dissertation Advisor", "William Henry Brune, Committee Chair", "George Spencer Young, Committee Member", "John Harlim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ozone", "Radiosondes", "Climatology", "Meteorology"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Design of Contact-aided Compliant Cellular Mechanisms for Use as Passive Variable Thermal Conductivity Structures", "id": "19261", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9106", "abstract_tesi": "Thermal switches are systems that are capable of switching between high and low effective conductivity.  Contact-aided Cellular Compliant Mechanisms (C3M) are cellular structures that employ internal contact mechanisms to enable high effective strains in response to mechanical loads.  When active, these contacts also introduce new thermal conductive pathways and provide a novel avenue to passive thermal control.  The research described herein is concerned with the design and characterization of a structure that exhibits effective variable thermal conductivity.  Such a structure would be useful aboard small satellites as a thermal-control-interface layer between an electronics box and the spacecraft structure. \nA finite element model of a bi-material C3M cell was built in ANSYS and subjected to thermal loads experienced by typical spacecraft equipment.  The cell exhibited a large range of thermal conductivities by passively adapting to the changing thermal environment.  The reference temperature, from which thermal strain is calculated, plays an important role in centering the adaptive response to best fit the target performance goals.\nUsing a model for thermal contact resistance (TCR)  as a function of pressure, the cell was able to meet a high-conductivity goal under high thermal loading and change to a low effective conductivity more than 20 times less than the high-conductivity value under different thermal loading.  TCR depends greatly on the pressure applied at the interface, which makes the \u201cswitch\u201d less of a discrete step-change between modes and closer to a continuous thermal valve.  A proposed T-shaped cell was shown to achieve a high conductivity state that surpassed the target value, using ideal TCR values.   \nFuture work includes fabricating the bi-material cell.  Work also needs to be done in determining how the compliant cells can be configured into a 3D structure.  The capacity of the cell to withstand a structural load to survive the launch phase of a satellite must also be investigated to determine how the structural response changes the design approach, which has been entirely driven by the thermal performance in this thesis.  There is still much work to be done, but the analysis presented herein indicates that this concept has the potential to replace a bulky active thermal control system with a low-footprint passive system with the ability to self-regulate its effective conductivity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8932], "author_name_tesi": "Stavely, Rebecca Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Stavely", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["George A Lesieutre, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["passive thermal switch", "thermal contact resistance", "compliant mechanism", "thermal conductivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Technologies of Psychological Empowerment: The Role of Agency and Community in Blogging", "id": "7848", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "959", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Internet communication environments have been lauded equally for celebrating the individual, as well as for fostering communities.  On the one hand, new media technologies empower individual users to control various aspects of the communication interaction, as manifest in portals.  On the other hand, they empower users to connect with proximal or distal others, as most obvious in chatrooms.  It was not until the recent introduction of blogs that these capabilities were featured simultaneously, under the full control of the blogger.  This dissertation proposes that through both their voice-enhancing and community-oriented functions, blogs are all the more psychologically empowering by affording users the psychological benefits of both a sense of agency and a sense of community.  \nThe present dissertation addressed the role of blogging in imbuing a sense of psychological empowerment in users belonging to traditionally underprivileged, marginalized groups in society (i.e., women), and tested the intervening role of sense of community and sense of agency in leading to psychological empowerment.  A survey (N = 340) was first conducted to investigate women bloggers\u2019 perceptions of their own empowerment, as a function of their type of blogging, motivations for blogging and blogging experience.  Findings indicate that by affording users either a strong sense of community, or a deep sense of agency, or both, blogging is indeed psychologically empowering to those undertaking it.  This was shown to be true for two different types of blogs, as well as for people with diverse motivations for use and various levels of experience with blogging.  Due to the correlational nature of the survey, a second experimental study was conducted next (N = 233), in order to tackle more directly the two theoretical routes leading to psychological empowerment.  This was addressed via a moderated mediation model, i.e., manipulating sense of agency and sense of community.  Results showed that while psychological empowerment did not differ across the two types of blogs this time, it was again elicited by sense of agency and sense of community.  Theoretical and practical implications of these findings, study limitations and suggestions for future research are outlined in the end.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [952], "author_name_tesi": "Stavrositu, Carmen ", "last_name_ssi": "Stavrositu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Carmen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["S.
