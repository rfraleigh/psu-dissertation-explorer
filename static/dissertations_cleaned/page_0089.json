Chemicals, including sulfite- and chlorine-based agents, are commonly used in the fresh-cut potato industry to prevent browning and to sanitize produce. Sulfites are allowed for fresh potatoes because cooking evaporates sulfur dioxide which is considered the offending component in sulfite-sensitivity. Nevertheless, there is a concern about these compounds which can provoke allergic reactions and produce carcinogens. Frozen potato strips, although not fresh-like, are preferred in deep-fat frying because fresh and fresh-cut potato strips become soggy, limp, greasy and too dark. In this study, alternative processing and packaging techniques were investigated to produce safe and high quality refrigerated potato strips with a shelf-life up to four weeks, to be used as an alternative to fresh-cut or frozen potato strips for French frying.\n\nThe effects of processing conditions \u2014blanching time, ascorbic acid (AA) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) concentrations and potato variety\u2014 on color and textural quality of refrigerated potato strips were investigated. The highest peak force was determined in potato fries blanched at low temperature (60\u00b0C) for 30 min and then blanched at high temperature (~98\u00b0C) for 5 min. However, there was no significant difference in peak force of potato fries blanched at low temperature for 30 or 20 min followed by high temperature blanching for 10 or 5 min. Changes in blanching time did not affect the lightness of potato fries. Increasing CaCl2 concentration caused a significant increase in peak force of potato strips. Ascorbic acid did not affect color. The highest peak force was obtained in potato fries prepared from the Russet Burbank variety. The results indicate that blanching the Russet Burbank variety of potato strips at low temperature (60\u00b0C) in 0.5% CaCl2 solution for 20 or 30 min followed by blanching at high temperature (~98\u00b0C) in boiling water for 5 or 10 min was effective in potato strips processing to improve color and textural quality. However, optimal quality varies based on customer preferences. \n\nMoreover, hot water blanching is also necessary for surface pasteurization of potato strips. However, microbial recontamination and resulting growth will occur unless a proper environment is provided during packaging. Near-aseptic packaging was found to be an alternative non-chemical method to extend shelf-life of blanched potato strips. In near-aseptic packaging of potato strips, blanched and cooled strips are packaged in a near-aseptic environment in which the packaging chamber and packaging materials are pasteurized with steam at atmospheric pressure for 30 min, then cooled to room temperature and continuously pressurized with filter sterilized air. In this part of the study, the effect of low (60\u00b0C) and high (~98\u00b0C) temperature blanching time and storage time on microbial, color and textural quality of near-aseptically packaged refrigerated potato strips were examined. Microbial spoilage was observed for all treatments which received a high temperature blanch of only one minute. No microbial growth was observed within 28 days of refrigerated storage for strips treated for either 10- or 20-min in low temperature blanch followed by 5- or 10-min in high temperature blanch. Near-aseptically packaged refrigerated potato fries were lighter in color (P < 0.05) than unprocessed fries (neither blanched nor near-aseptically packaged) and less color difference (P < 0.05) was observed in near-aseptic potato fries compared to unprocessed fries. Near-aseptic potato fries were higher in peak force (P < 0.05) compared to unprocessed fries. No significant changes were observed in the quality of near-aseptically packaged refrigerated potato strips during 28 days of storage at 7\u00b0C. \n\nGaseous ozone, a strong antimicrobial agent, was studied as an in-package treatment of blanched potato strips to extend shelf-life. Potato strips were subjected to a batch ozone treatment for 20 s or a continuous ozone treatment for 5, 15 or 30 min by injecting ozone gas into the package. Microbial growth was observed the following day for bags with no ozone treatments. Continuous ozone treatment was effective in extending shelf-life of refrigerated potato strips compared to batch ozone treatment. No microbial growth was observed in 30- and 15-min continuous ozone treated strips after 28 and 21 days storage, respectively. There was no significant difference between the color of blanched strips and ozone treated blanched strips. \n\nFinally, using the best treatments for the earlier experiments, the effects of near-aseptic packaging and in-package chemical treatments with gaseous ozone, sodium metabisulfite (SM) solution and FIT Fruit and Vegetable Wash\u2122 solution on 2-step blanched potato strips were investigated. There was no microbial growth on any of the potato strips during 28 days of refrigerated storage. In SM treated strips, lighter color (P < 0.05) and less color difference (P < 0.05) were observed after frying compared to other treatments. Near-aseptic packaging was found to be an effective non-chemical alternative because there was no significant difference in before-frying color, textural quality and oil content compared to SM treatment which is currently the industry practice. FIT was found to be the most effective chemical treatment because the FIT significantly increased after-frying peak force of fries. Gaseous ozone treatment significantly decreased the color quality of potato strips. There was no significant difference in the oil content of near-aseptically packaged potato fries, in package chemically treated potato fries and unprocessed fries. \n\nOverall, the research results indicate that two-step blanching is necessary in improving color and textural quality of potato strips. Near-aseptic packaging as a non-chemical treatment and in-package FIT treatment are the better alternatives for blanched potato strips to extend shelf-life and maintain quality.

In most science classrooms, critique is often, if not only, made by the teacher as expert. This dissertation explores the possibility of sharing the role of critique among the students and the teacher, so as to improve students\u2019 critique practice. The study contrasts an intervention focused on a student-centered critique learning environment with a comparative teacher-centered critique learning environment. The study took place in two small science classes (two groups of triads per class) in a Singapore public school offering an inquiry science course. Students worked in groups to design and implement a science research project over three semesters. The intervention class experienced the intervention curriculum in the first semester that emphasizes students\u2019 critique using scientific soundness criteria valued by scientific communities. Data includes individual students and their group\u2019s performance on a critique activity before and after the intervention phase i.e. pre- and post-test, as well as transcribed video recordings of four group discussion sessions during epistemic activities i.e. making research decisions for the group\u2019s own inquiry or critiquing others\u2019 research artefacts. The data was analyzed using the productive disciplinary engagement in critique and construction (PDE-CC) framework interpreted from Engle and Conant\u2019s productive disciplinary engagement framework. Findings indicate differentiated improvement in PDE-CC across groups within and across classes. Relatively high PDE-CC among the groups was displayed consistently by one of the two intervention class groups. The four guiding principles for fostering PDE-CC were used to explain the differences in group PDE-CC. The principles of problematizing, epistemic authority, and disciplinary accountability were consistently incorporated by the group demonstrating highest PDE-CC among groups, while at least one of these three guiding principles was not incorporated for groups demonstrating lower PDE-CC. Findings imply the student-centered critique intervention was effective in improving students\u2019 critique practices and how students and teachers interact with each other\u2019s ideas play an important role in students\u2019 engagement with an epistemic activity.

Both educators and researchers have realized that educational practices need to be completely transformed and that a research-based framework should guide their reform efforts. One area where educational practices need to be completely transformed is in the teaching of economics. In recent years, the quality of economics instruction has received consistently poor reviews by undergraduate students across the United States. In response to these concerns, researchers have been studying ways of improving economics instruction. One suggested approach is the use of learner-centered teaching principles. This is based on evidence that suggests that motivation, learning, and achievement are highly enhanced where learner-centered principles and practices are in place. \tThe purpose of this study was to explore the use of learner-centered teaching (LCT) in the teaching of an introductory economics class. The theoretical framework of the study was based upon social constructivist theory and was informed by both progressive and humanistic teaching philosophies. The study utilized a self-study, action research approach to inquiry. \tThrough the use of pre-/post tests, journaling, observations, and interviews, the study revealed that learning is enhanced when learner-centered principles are in place. The study found that in order for LCT to be successfully implemented, the teacher needs to be both mentally and physically prepared for the numerous challenges posed by the new pedagogic paradigm. The study also found that if a teacher is able to clearly articulate the manner in which LCT is to be implemented, then the guardians of the institutional structures i.e. administrators, will likely support their efforts. The study further revealed that students, who initially resist the implementation of LCT, do so out of the perceived fear that LCT will lead to more work as well as deny them a source of authoritative academic guidance. The study showed that if a teacher is able to build a nurturing and caring classroom environment, students would reciprocate by working hard and taking responsibility for their learning. However, the study also found that a single semester\u2019s application of learner-centered teaching principles would not change long established teaching practices.  Persistence and repeated implementation of LCT over a number of semesters is the only way to sufficiently affect institutionalized educational instruction.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3079], "author_name_tesi": "Ongeri, Joseph  Dennis", "last_name_ssi": "Ongeri", "middle_name_ssi": "Dennis", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph ", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward W Taylor", "Edward W Taylor", "Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Lewis A Boahene", "Nihal Bayraktar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward W Taylor, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward W Taylor, Committee Chair", "Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Member", "Lewis A Boahene, Committee Member", "Nihal Bayraktar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Learner-Centered Teaching in Economics", "An Action Research."]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Securing Mobile Phones in the Evolving Mobile Ecosystem", "id": "11054", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4529", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The revolution of mobile phone industry has been altering our life and business practices over the past few decades.

In this thesis, the relationship between detrital uraninite and paleo-pO<sub>2</sub> level was critically evaluated by addressing the following two questions: 1) what is(are) the origin(s) of uraninite in the quartz-pebble conglomerate deposits, and 2) what is the kinetic stability of uraninite and pyrite in surface environments.</p>\n\nIsotopic (Pb and O) and chemical compositions were determined by combining two <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>in-situ</i> techniques, SIMS and EPMA, for ~20 <span style='font-family:Symbol'>m</span>m-diameter areas of over 50 individual grains of uraninite from the Stanleigh Mine in the Elliot Lake district, Canada.

Although these isotopic characteristics point to a non-detrital origin of uraninite, they are likely to have been overprinted at ~1.8 Ga or later. Because of high Th concentrations in uraninite (4 to 12 wt. % ThO<sub>2</sub>) and the previously published data on Pb isotopic compositions of galena, the uraninite is most likely to be detrital in origin. </p>\n\nA series of laboratory experiments was conducted to determine the dissolution kinetics of uraninite as a function of pH (4 to 7), pCO<sub>2 </sub>(10<sup>-3.5</sup> to 10<sup>-0.5</sup> atm), pO<sub>2</sub> (0.2 and <0.02 atm), and Th contents (0.1 to 8 wt. % ThO<sub>2</sub>).

The model suggests that uraninite becomes kinetically more stable than plagioclase below 10 % of present atmospheric level (PAL) pO<sub>2</sub>, but pyrite is only stable below 1 % PAL pO<sub>2</sub> under a pCO<sub>2</sub> of 1 to 1,000 PAL. Thus the presence of uraninite and pyrite and the absence of plagioclase in the quartz-pebble conglomerate indicates that atmospheric pO<sub>2</sub> was less than 1 % PAL. </p>\n\nOccurrences of pyrite and uraninite in pre-2.2 Ga quartz-pebble conglomerate deposits are the expected consequence of a low-pO<sub>2</sub> (<1% PAL) atmosphere at the time of deposition. However, this expectation is based on a number of assumptions concerning the source rocks for the pyrite, uraninite, and feldspar and the nature of the weathering and depositional environment, in particular whether it acted as a closed or open system with short or long exposure times to the atmosphere. Moreover, the dearth of pyrite in Archean and Paleoproterozoic paleosols argues for atmospheric pO<sub>2</sub> values in excess of 0.001 % PAL. Paleosols may be more representative of the weathering environment than conglomerate deposits, whose sediments may have been derived from a variety of sources, and thus may ultimately be better indicators of the oxygen level of the ancient atmosphere.</p>\n</body>\n\n</html>\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5994], "author_name_tesi": "Ono, Shuhei ", "last_name_ssi": "Ono", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shuhei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hiroshi Ohmoto", "Kwadwo Asare Osseo Asare", "Peter J Heaney", "Lee Kump"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hiroshi Ohmoto, Committee Chair", "Kwadwo Asare Osseo Asare, Committee Member", "Peter J Heaney, Committee Member", "Lee Kump, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Proterozoic", "atmosphere", "oxygen", "dissolution kinetics", "quartz-pebble conglomerate", "SIMS", "Archean", "detrital", "uraninite"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The role of environmental factors in gut homeostasis and experimental inflammatory bowel disease", "id": "16254", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8083", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is complex. In addition to genetic factors, IBD onset is proposed to be triggered by environmental exposures. Studies have shown that environmental factors influence the bacterial composition in the gut. Intestinal bacterial flora have also been linked to IBD susceptibility. Using mouse models of colitis, I explored the role of two environmental factors in IBD pathogenesis: diet and vitamin D. The first objective was to evaluate the effect of different dietary intake on intestinal bacterial flora and IBD susceptibility. My study shows that variation in diet resulted in differential susceptibility to dextran-sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice that were not genetically susceptible. In addition, 20% of lactose intake exacerbated the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis. Dramatic changes in gut bacterial composition were induced by dietary feeding in a short period of time. Furthermore, the depletion of bacteria using antibiotics protected mice from colitis regardless of diet. These findings suggest that diet-induced changes in susceptibility to colitis were associated with different varieties and amounts of bacteria present in the gut and that high lactose intake may contribute to the increased susceptibility to colitis. The second objective was to determine whether vitamin D regulates experimental IBD by modulating intestinal bacterial flora. My data show that the increased susceptibility of vitamin D-deficient mice to DSS-induced colitis was mediated by the alterations in gut bacterial flora. Vitamin D deficiency resulted in increased potentially pathogenic bacteria and decreased beneficial bacteria in the gut before colitis induction. In addition to bacterial flora, impaired epithelial barrier and decreased frequency of tolerogenic dendritic cells in vitamin D-deficient mice also predisposed them to DSS-induced colitis. These results suggest that vitamin D plays a role in regulating gut bacterial flora, intestinal epithelial integrity, and IBD pathogenesis. Lastly, I examined the source and role of extrarenal Cyp27B1 in the immune system. Cyp27B1 is an enzyme critical for vitamin D synthesis. My study shows that CD8+ T cells but not CD4+ T cells produced Cyp27B1 activity. T cells from Cyp27B1 knockout mice showed elevated IFN-gamma production post activation compared to wild-type T cells. Cyp27B1 knockout mice were protected from DSS-induced colitis by reconstitution with wild-type bone marrow cells, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role of immune-derived Cyp27B1. This study provides direct evidence of extrarenal Cyp27B1 and vitamin D production in regulating IFN-gamma-induced pro-inflammation and experimental IBD.

This decrease in the extractable material is a result of an increase in the amount of physical cross-links associated with secondary interactions. The alternate possibility of covalent cross-link formation by ether linkage was found to be unlikely because the coal hydroxyl content remains unchanged upon heat treatment.  The functional groups responsible for forming these physical cross-links and their contents vary from coal to coal with coal rank. Carboxylate/cation complexes, similar to those found in ionomers, dominate in low rank coal.  In high rank coal, the clusters involving pi-cation interactions were observed.  Both mechanisms seem to play a role in mid rank coals. These physical cross-links are responsible for a lowering of the extraction yield of coal, but are disrupted by a treatment with acid solution, resulting in an increase in the extraction yield.  As a consequence, the cross-links in coal structure should be classified into two types; a permanent covalent cross-link, which break under extreme conditions such as chemical reaction and pyrolysis, and reversible cross-links, largely associated with ionomer-like structure and pi-cation interactions.  \n\nThe interaction between a magic solvent of N-methylpyrollidone and carbon disulfide (NMP/CS2) and its role in the unusual extractability enhancement of Upper Freeport coal has also been investigated.  The results strongly suggest that NMP/CS2 mixed solvents form complexes with cations.  These mixed solvents are capable of forming a solid complex with cations from NaOH and some simple salts, such as NaCl and LiCl.  Given that Upper Freeport coal contains a large amount of mineral matter, it is not surprising that these types of complexes could be formed in the present of the mixed solvents, which in turn enhances the coal extraction yield.\n\nFinally, the evidence for the presence of a glass transition temperature in coal was examined.  The results from Differential Scanning Calorimetry showed that no transition similar to the Tg can be observed in bulk coal or its low-molecular weight fraction, pyridine soluble extracted material, at a temperature near 110 C.   In contrast, an irreversible transition that is due to water evaporation has been found.  Thermomechanical measurements, which are very sensitive to the presence of a Tg in synthetic polymers, also provided no evidence for a Tg below temperatures where chemical reactions occur.  Additionally, the results from Thermomechanical Analysis showed an expansion in size when the coal was heated to 300 C, which is associated with a caking process.   The degree of expansion during this caking process is about five times greater in the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane than the parallel, indicating an accommodation of anisotropic strain relaxation, which was generated in the direction perpendicular to the bedding plane during the coalification process.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4994], "author_name_tesi": "Opaprakasit, Pakorn ", "last_name_ssi": "Opaprakasit", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pakorn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul C Painter", "Alan W Scaroni", "Michael M Coleman", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul C Painter, Committee Chair", "Alan W Scaroni, Committee Chair", "Michael M Coleman, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["extraction", "coal network", "ionic structure", "structural transition", "thermal properties", "coal interaction", "coal structure", "infrared spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of Performance, Pay and Promotability of Gay and Straight Men and Women: Rating Variations by Rater Gender and Performance Level ", "id": "8792", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "195", "abstract_tesi": "It is estimated that between 25 and 66 percent of gay and lesbian employees experience workplace discrimination.

Further, the information on target performance level (high, average, and low) was manipulated to determine whether there are differential effects by performance level.  Results showed that target sexual orientation was a significant predictor of ratings on all four dependent variables, although effect sizes were small. An interaction effect was found between target sexual orientation and performance level on pay raise recommendations, promotion recommendations, and liking ratings, with gay people being penalized more for their sexual orientation at higher performance levels, but again the effect sizes were small.

The main purpose of this research is to understand flame behavior in the context of combustion instabilities under technically premixed conditions, which is characteristic of industrial operation.  In this operating mode, flames are exposed to both velocity and equivalence ratio fluctuations. Previous studies focused on heat release rate fluctuations due to velocity fluctuations,  typically using CH* chemiluminescence emission as an indicator of heat release rate. However, chemiluminescence emission can only be used to measure heat release rate fluctuations in the presence of velocity fluctuations or equivalence ratio fluctuations, not both. Therefore two important questions need to be addressed. First, how does a flame respond to equivalence ratio fluctuations? Second, how can heat release rate fluctuations be measured in technically premixed flames? \nFlame response to equivalence ratio fluctuations is studied with operating conditions similar to industrial gas turbine conditions, with the exception of combustor pressure. The response is primarily due to a convective mechanism. Fuel flow rate fluctuations produce equivalence ratio fluctuations at the fuel injection location and then travel through the injector and arrive at the flame with the mean flow. The flame response decreases with increasing frequency (Strouhal number). \nA previously proposed \"reconstruction technique\" is experimentally validated and applied to measure heat release rate fluctuations in technically premixed flames. The heat release rate fluctuations in technically premixed flames are a vector superposition of the heat release rate fluctuations due to velocity fluctuations and heat release rate fluctuations due to equivalence ratio fluctuations. This technique assumes that the flame\u2019s response to velocity fluctuations and equivalence fluctuations are both linear and independent. Since there is no independent measurement of heat release rate fluctuations in technically premixed flames that can be used to validate the reconstruction technique, the technique is indirectly validated over a range of operating conditions using chemiluminescence intensity fluctuation measurements. It was found that this technique is valid in both global and local measurements. The accuracy is within 20% in amplitude and 10o in phase. Strouhal number has the greatest contribution to the accuracy. \nFlame response in technically premixed flames is measured.  Flame transfer functions in technically premixed flames are the result of the constructive and destructive interactions between the flame\u2019s response to velocity and equivalence ratio fluctuations, and depend on both the relative amplitude and phase of these contributions. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8378], "author_name_tesi": "Orawannukul, Poravee ", "last_name_ssi": "Orawannukul", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Poravee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Thomas Litzinger", "Richard A Yetter", "Sarma V Pisupati"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Litzinger, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Forced flame response", "technically premixed flames", "combustion instabilities", "flame transfer function"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Acoustically Driven Micro Electro-Mechanical Mixers for Biomedical Applications", "id": "9306sz28s", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12836", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have become enabling technologies on many research areas. In this dissertation, we present the use of acoustofluidic MEMS for bioengineering applications. Firstly, we demonstrate an acoustofluidic micromixer, which can perform rapid and homogeneous mixing of highly viscous fluids in the presence of an acoustic field. In this device, two high-viscosity polyethylene glycol\u00a0(PEG) solutions were co-injected into a three-inlet PDMS microchannel with the center inlet containing a constant stream of nitrogen flow, which forms bubbles in the device. When these bubbles were excited by an acoustic field generated via a piezoelectric transducer, the two solutions mixed homogenously due to the combination of acoustic streaming, droplet ejection, and bubble eruption effects. The mixing efficiency of this acoustofluidic device was evaluated using PEG-700 solutions, which are ~106 times more viscous than deionized (DI) water. Our results indicate homogenous mixing of the PEG-700 solutions with a ~0.93 mixing index. The acoustofluidic micromixer is compact, inexpensive, easy to operate, and has the capacity to mix highly viscous fluids within 50 milliseconds. Secondly, we present acoustically actuated artificial cilia, which can also perform mixing into the PDMS microchannel as the natural cilia do. For the fabrication of artificial cilia structure into the channel, in situ fabrication method is used for the first time. In order to demonstrate the mixing performance of the artificial cilia device, we injected DI water and DI water + fluorescein powder solution via inlets and calculated the mixing index as ~0.9.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12096], "author_name_tesi": "Orbay, Sinem ", "last_name_ssi": "Orbay", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sinem", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Huang", "Jian Yang", "Siyang Zheng"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Huang, Thesis Advisor", "Jian Yang, Committee Member", "Siyang Zheng, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Micromixing", "high-viscosity fluid", "acoustofluidics", "polyethylene glycol\u00a0(PEG)", "High viscosity fluids", "Acoustofluidics", "Artificial cilia"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Rhetoric and Civic Belonging: Lynching and the Making of National Community\n\n", "id": "11838", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "1788", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When members of white society rejected Civil War Amendments that called for a radical revision of social norms and legal provisions, widespread refusal to accept blacks as fellow citizens culminated in the increased lynching of African Americans. The increased activity of lynching  during Reconstruction has drawn the attention of scholars across disciplines, all of whom have touched upon the functions, causes, and significances of American lynchings. However, while many of them have implied a connection between lynching and national citizenship, there has yet to be a sustained systematic examination of this argument. In \u201cRhetoric and Civic Belonging: Lynching and the Making of National Community,\u201d I attend to this gap in the critical literature by examining lynching as rhetorical activity that both has challenged and continues to challenge the civic status of African Americans. Using Kenneth Burke\u2019s notion of rhetorical identification and Kevin Dean\u2019s concept of rhetorical juxtaposition I examine the rhetoric of historical and legislative documents, social practices, and American public discourse before, during, and after Reconstruction and explain how they work together to rhetorically construct American citizenship as a racialized political identity.\n\u201cRhetoric and Civic Belonging: Lynching and the Making of National Community\u201d contributes to projects in the field of Rhetoric that examine diverse modes of civic engagement, how these modes contribute to the construction of national identity, and the role visual and print media play in the maintenance of this identity. At the heart of this study is a consideration of violence\u2019s centrality to the making of the nation; specifically, how official and unofficial campaigns of violence have and continue to contribute to the formation of an American national community.\nMy analysis yields three general findings.  First, that lynching was the violent refutation of African Americans\u2019 inclusion into the category of \u201ccitizen.\u201d Second, that the federal government\u2019s refusal to implement anti-lynching legislation lent an air of legitimacy to lynching while simultaneously creating a relationship between its practice and white supremacists notions of American civic identity. Among enclaves of white society lynching became a symbolic act that reaffirmed the racial and civic supremacy of white Americans, a rhetorical performance that symbolically reconstituted white supremacist worldview and confirmed followers\u2019 convictions that white Americans, not African Americans, were the sole and rightful heirs to democratic promise and protection. In this sense, lynchers and white supremacist sympathizers read lynching as patriotic duty, as civic action. My third and final finding complicates claims of America\u2019s present-day post-racial status. An examination of contemporary instantiations of lynching and the discourse surrounding it indicates that the nation\u2019s proclivity to rationalize racialized murder as an expression of civic identity is not a practice that is dead and gone, but instead a practice that is very much a part of the historical present. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1773], "author_name_tesi": "Ore, Ersula  J", "last_name_ssi": "Ore", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Ersula ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Keith Gilyard", "Keith Gilyard", "Linda Furgerson Selzer", "Xiaoye You", "Jeremy Engels"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Keith Gilyard, Dissertation Advisor", "Keith Gilyard, Committee Chair", "Linda Furgerson Selzer, Committee Member", "Xiaoye You, Committee Member", "Jeremy Engels, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Without Sanctuary", "rhetoric", "lynching", "identification", "african american"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND SIMULATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS\n", "id": "12641", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5348", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This paper presents a new way to monitor and look at adversarial networks through the Adversarial Network Analyzer (ANA) and supporting mathematical calculations.

Ambient ozone concentrations were measured on a weekly basis at 20 monitoring sites to explore spatial and temporal patterns of ozone distribution.  Passive samplers were sited at low-to-high elevations with three high-elevation sites being co-located with real-time ozone analyzers; resulting data were used for cross-correlation and for synthetically generating hourly frequency distributions of ambient ozone.  The efficiency of passive samplers was highly dependent upon climatic factors;  i.e. temperature, wind speed and relative humidity.  Ambient ozone concentrations were greater in years with greater temperatures and lower relative humidity.  During all three monitoring seasons, ambient ozone levels were positively correlated to elevation.  Ozone concentrations were greater in 2002 and moderate to low in 2003 and 2004.  In addition, spatial models of ozone distribution revealed that the central part of north-central Pennsylvania exhibits lower ozone concentrations than the surrounding areas.  \n   A linear model was developed to estimate the influence of local environmental conditions on stomatal conductance of two ozone sensitive tree species.  One year-old seedlings of black cherry (R-12) (Prunus serotina) and ramets of hybrid poplar clone NE388 (Populus maximiwizii x trichocarpa) were established in the early spring of the 2003 within open plots at the 20 ozone monitoring locations.  \n   Gas exchange measurements were performed at 12 sites (6 sites at high elevation and 6 sites at low elevation), under field conditions, on seedlings and cuttings of the two tree species.  The measurements were performed three times a day, under favorable weather conditions (clear sky) during 2003 and 2004 study seasons.  Gas exchange data from the 12 sites were used to empirically model stomatal conductance and to model and map ozone flux for the two tree species throughout the study area.  \n   Throughout both seasons variances were observed in measured stomatal conductance (gs) and photosynthetic rates (Pn) on a daily basis.  The most significant environmental factors explaining stomatal variance were:  tree species, air temperature, elevation, and measurement time.  The most significant factors in limiting gs were vapor pressure deficit (Vpdl) and air temperature.  Stomatal conductance rates were higher for hybrid poplar than for black cherry during both years.  Stomatal conductance rates were greater at noon and in the early afternoon at high-elevated sites during 2003.  During 2004 gs rates were higher at low-elevation sites.  Photosynthetic rates were greater at high-elevation sites in the morning and at noon during both study seasons.  Apparently greater air temperature at the low-elevation sites inhibited gs in 2003, reducing ozone uptake.  Also lower than normal air temperatures at the high elevation sites might have inhibited gs rates in 2004.  Since environmental factors explained less than 30% of the variation in stomatal conductance Vpdl and Pn were used to increase the accuracy of the gs model.  \n   The influences of ozone on foliar symptoms and relative growth parameters of the two ozone-sensitive species were also investigated.  One main objective was to determine whether foliar injury expressed by genetically stable ozone-sensitive plants can provide quantitative information about ozone exposures.  Visible ozone-induced foliar injury was assessed weekly.  Above-ground relative growth was measured at the end of the experiment as relative height (H) and basal diameter (D).  During both years of investigation ambient ozone and environmental conditions were conducive to development of typical ozone-induced visible symptoms on both tree species.  Percentage of total leaf area affected (expressed as percent injury %INJ) was positively correlated with cumulative ozone exposures.  Foliar injury was better correlated with a flux-based approach than for an exposure-based approach.  The best correlations in terms of exposure-based approach were obtained when the SUM40 (ozone over the threshold of 40 ppb) ozone exposure index was used.  More severe foliar injuries were observed on plants growing on plots located at higher elevation sites.  The onset of foliar injury for both tree species was first observed at sites located at higher elevation during both years.  The year-to year inconsistent plant response to ozone exposures was likely due to the strong influence of environmental factors and possible to the plant defense mechanisms.  We found that more study is required before making quantitative estimations of ozone exposures based on plant foliar injury.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6334], "author_name_tesi": "Orendovici, Teodora ", "last_name_ssi": "Orendovici", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Teodora", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Durwood Davis", "John Moore Skelly", "Dennis R Decoteau", "Dennis Lamb", "Stephen Rathbun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Durwood Davis, Committee Chair", "John Moore Skelly, Committee Chair", "Dennis R Decoteau, Committee Member", "Dennis Lamb, Committee Member", "Stephen Rathbun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ozone", "passive samplers", "stomatal conductance", "ozone uptake/flux", "ozne induced injury"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of Mixed-halogen Dioxins and Furans Generated by Combustion: Implications to First Responder Health", "id": "26203", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11389", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans are well known as environmental contaminants of concern. With the increase in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) in modern consumer products, the polyhalogenated, or mixed bromo/chloro-, (PXDD/F) and polybromo- (PBDD/F) congeners are emerging as compounds of concern. A lot of research has been performed on the polychloro- analogs (PCDD/F), both analytically and biochemically, but the same is not true for both PXDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs. Since they are known to be byproducts of BFR combustion processes, there is a large potential for these compounds to be generated in fire debris. BFR combustion products become a concern when considering exposure risks of firefighters that frequently come into contact with this type of debris. Firefighters have been shown to experience an increase in certain cancers. One source which may be attributable to such long term health effects could be chronic exposure to BFR combustion products such as polyhalogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans generated in fire debris.\n\nThe goal of these studies was two-fold; to characterize the range of PXDD/F and PBDD/F compounds generated in fire debris as well as begin to understand the toxicological implications of their exposure in a human system. Cell culture studies performed on HepG2 human liver cells were performed to determine the ability of PXDD/F compounds to induce AH receptor (AHR) mediated transcriptional activity. All compounds tested were determined to be AHR ligands, and response was AHR dependent. Potency levels of the PXDD/F compounds were similar in comparison to what is considered the most potent dibenzo-p-dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro dibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The similarity to TCDD suggests these compounds need to be addressed in toxicological and environmental screening methods, as they are currently overlooked. The results also indicate that, since TCDD is a probable human carcinogen, that firefighter exposure to these compounds may be detrimental to their health.\n\nAnalytically, dioxin analysis has historically been performed using gas chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). The present studies were conducted using different instrumental techniques to avoid the limitations of GC-HRMS analysis. Analytical characterization of fire debris samples was performed using two methods; comprehensive two dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time of flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS) and gas chromatography coupled to atmospheric pressure ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (APGC-MS/MS). GCxGC-TOFMS analysis provided initial screening of samples to determine the range of compounds present. This technique was successful at resolving the compounds of interest away from the sample matrix allowing for non-targeted analysis of complex samples. The enhanced peak capacity and orthogonal separation of the GCxGC technique was beneficial for peak resolution of the halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofuran isomers. Simulated household fire debris samples contained exclusively PBDFs, whereas, simulated electronics fire debris samples contained both PBDFs and PXDFs when analyzed on the GCxGC-TOFMS. Further sample analysis was performed using APGC-MS/MS, a much more sensitive technique that can detect dioxin compounds on the single femtogram level. The soft ionization technique and compound selective detection using multiple reaction monitoring mode (MRM) provided the sensitivity needed to fully characterize the fire debris samples. The results of these studies showed that APGC-MS/MS performed similarly, if not better, than GC-HRMS analysis for dioxin analysis and allowed for expansion of the list of dioxin compounds monitored for in the samples. Using the added sensitivity of APGC-MS/MS, the GCxGC-TOFMS data was confirmed, as well as allowed for identification of an expanded range of compounds. The polyhalogenated dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran species were also identified in the fire debris samples using this technique. The analytical characterization of fire debris samples concluded that a range of PXDD/Fs (from di- through hexa- halogenated) and PBDD/Fs (Br through Br7) were present in fire debris samples that firefighters are typically\nexposed to. This data further supports the need to reconsider firefighter training and safety procedures, as well as the need to be aware of and monitor the types of compounds they are exposed to throughout a career. In addition, the results presented here also present implications to the general public through environmental exposure. Identification of PXDD/Fs in fire debris samples representing transportable particulate matter, such as the helmet wipe and wall foil samples, suggest these compounds have the potential to be transported and deposited into the environment. In addition, identification of these compounds in particulate matter suggests that the general population is also at risk of exposure to mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. The potential occurrence of polybrominated and polyhalogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans calls for increased regulatory and environmental monitoring protocols to include PXDD/F compounds in routine procedures.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10912], "author_name_tesi": "Organtini, Kari Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Organtini", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Kari", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Franklin Lewis Dorman Jr.", "Franklin Lewis Dorman Jr.", "Gary H Perdew", "Squire J Booker", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Andrew David Patterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Franklin Lewis Dorman Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Franklin Lewis Dorman Jr., Committee Chair", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Andrew David Patterson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dibenzo-p-dioxin", "dibenzofuran", "aryl hydrocarbon receptor", "AHR", "GCxGC-TOFMS", "APGC-MS/MS"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "STRUCTURAL STUDIES OF ENTRY AND HOST EVASION BY SMALL ICOSAHEDRAL VIRUSES", "id": "14660ljo5000", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14660", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent technological advances in cryo electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have allowed for atomic resolution imaging of proteins and macromolecules. The \u201cresolution revolution,\u201d as it has become known, has outcompeted X-ray crystallography as the method of choice for structural analysis. A better method to determine interaction of complexes or structures of mixed population proteins, cryo-EM has seen a boost in interest as it has quickly come to surpass X-ray crystallography. Small, icosahedral viruses such as picornaviruses and parvoviruses are excellent candidates for structural analyses. Composed of 60 subunits of a capsid protein, the structure of both families of viruses have been studied extensively for years using both X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. However, many interactions with the host cell remained elusive as complexes between the virus and host protein were difficult to analyze to atomic resolution. Combination of both cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography, known as \u201cpseudo atomic modeling,\u201d was an acceptable method to determine interactions between the virus and host protein.\n\tCoxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) was complexed with its soluble receptor, coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR). The oversaturation of the virus by receptor was captured at low temperatures before moving the virus to physiological temperatures to convert the virus to the altered, or \u201cA,\u201d particle form. Both the CAR saturated virus and A-particle were imaged using cryo-EM. The virus-CAR complex was solved at a higher resolution than the previously published structure of the same complex. Analysis of the interaction between capsid and receptor determined a more refined footprint for the receptor on the capsid surface. Previously, interactions with the canyon floor had been determined that were shown to be an artifact of low resolution. Receptor binding to the north rim of the canyon and the \u201cpuff\u201d region was conserved across the picornavirus family that use immunoglobulin-like superfamily (IgSF) receptors. An alignment of sequences of the picornavirus-receptor structures revealed a conserved site at the northern rim of the capsid that was outside of all known antigenic regions. This site could be a target for broad spectrum antivirals against picornaviruses. The A-particle structure retained the genome. However, the genome was less dense and had more order than the CAR saturated capsid. The A-particle also contained \u201cpillars of density\u201d at the two-fold axes of symmetry that correspond to the N-termini of VP1.\n\tDeformed wing virus (DWV) has been linked to the global phenomenon known as colony collapse disorder (CCD), a sudden inexplicable loss of honey bees from the hive. As honey bees are a major source of pollinations for much of the world\u2019s food supply, the losses incurred by CCD have caused widespread economic losses. The assembly and entry structures of four capsid intermediates of DWV were solved using cryo-EM. The C terminal extension of VP1 extends around the five-fold axis of symmetry into a \u201cspike\u201d conformation. In the procapsid and infectious particle, the spike is in an \u201copen\u201d conformation as they point away from each other. A yet to be identified trigger activates the spikes to undergo a conformational change to gather closer to each other directly over the five-fold axis in a \u201cclosed\u201d conformation. The A-particle and the 80S-like particles both have the closed spike conformations. These findings suggest that the movement of the spikes are linked to genome release. \n\tCanine parvovirus (CPV) evolved from feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) in the late 1970\u2019s and quickly spread worldwide to infect domestic dogs. Only two years later, the original strain was completely replaced by an antigenic strain named CPV-2a that had only five amino acid mutations from the predecessor strain. These mutations were in sites of antibody and receptor binding. The crystal structure of CPV-2a was solved by X-ray crystallography to compare the sites of mutations between the predecessor strain and CPV-2a to understand how the antigenic variant could outcompete its precursor so successfully. Only minor changes at the five mutations sites were observed. However, the mutations did interrupt hydrogen bonds in CPV-2a, suggesting increased flexibility in the capsid that was not present in the predecessor strain. Increased flexibility in sites of receptor interaction may enhance receptor binding or introduce the ability to bind to new receptors. The flexibility may also allow for evasion of the host immune response, as antibody binding to the surface may be disrupted. Large conformational changes in the capsid itself do not need to be seen in order for a vast alteration to be made in the interaction of the capsid with the host cell.\n\tPrevious biochemical and structural studies of antibodies against CPV had shown the monoclonal antibody B5A8, also known as fragment of antibody (Fab) E, was able to neutralize the virus at low molar ratios. However, the mechanism of neutralization was unable to be determined due to low resolution of the complex structure. The availability of high resolution structural techniques made it possible to solve the CPV-Fab E complex to 4.1\u00c5. At the near atomic resolution, the Fab was built de novo. Local resolution measurements determined that the three-fold axes of symmetry has become flexible compared to the rest of the capsid. The flexibility suggests a mechanism for neutralization in that binding of Fab E induces destabilization in the capsid at sites of receptor binding. Importantly, the ability to solve the structure of the small 50 kDa Fab structure de novo was unprecedented. Virus was used as a biological platform to hold a small protein normally too small for high resolution cryo-EM reconstruction. By fully saturating the virus with the small protein, icosahedral averaging could be applied to both. The ability to attach other small proteins to a virus in order to apply icosahedral averaging during the reconstruction process would be a useful tool for small protein structural analysis.\n\tThe methods presented in this dissertation range from X-ray crystallography to the newest cryo-EM technology.

One of these characteristics is the existence of shared on-chip caches, through which different threads/processes can share data (help each other) or displace each other's data (hurt each other). Most of current commercial multicore systems on the market have on-chip cache hierarchies with multiple layers (typically, in the form of L1, L2 and L3, the last two being either fully or partially shared). In the context of database workloads, exploiting full potential of these caches can be critical. Motivated by this, our main contribution in this work is to present and experimentally evaluate a cache hierarchy-aware query mapping scheme targeting workloads that consist of batch queries to be executed on emerging multicores. Our proposed scheme distributes a given batch of queries across the cores of a target multicore architecture based on the affinity relations among the queries. The primary goal behind this scheme is to maximize the utilization of the underlying on-chip cache hierarchy while keeping the load nearly balanced across affinity domains. Each affinity domain in this context corresponds to a cache structure at a particular level of the cache hierarchy. A graph partitioning-based method is employed for distributing queries across cores, and an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation are employed for addressing locality and load balancing concerns. We evaluate our scheme using the TPC-H benchmarks on two commercial multicore machines with different on-chip cache topologies. Our solution achieves up to 25% improvement in individual query execution times and 15%-19% improvement in throughput over the default Linux-based process scheduler.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6372], "author_name_tesi": "Orhan, Umut ", "last_name_ssi": "Orhan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Umut", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Thesis Advisor", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["multicore architectures", "database systems", "cache topology"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Multiple mechanisms of ODC regulation by activated Ras: studies in an epithelial cell model\n", "id": "7490", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5787", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A majority of human cancers carry activating mutations in the Ras oncogene. One of the key effectors of Ras that is essential for its tumorigenic properties is Ornithine Decarboxylase (ODC). Studies characterizing the effects of Ras on ODC synthesis have thus far been carried out in fibroblasts. However, since most Ras-activated cancers are epithelial in origin, we aimed to determine the regulation of ODC by activated Ras using an epithelial cell model, RIE-1 cells. Ras transformation greatly induced ODC activity, which was predominantly regulated at the level of RNA stability. Increased RNA stability correlated with increased levels of ODC RNA associated with the polysomes. Treatment with the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin surprisingly inhibited this increase in RNA stability without affecting transcription or efficiency of ODC translation. Analysis of the ODC 5'UTR in control and Ras12V-transfected cells revealed the presence of four splice variants of variable length, with the presence or absence of two intronic sequences. The variants containing intronic sequences were more abundant in the Ras-transformed cells. All splice variants supported internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation, and this activity was markedly elevated in cells transformed by Ras, which was further increased by dephosphorylation of eIF4E by inhibiting either MEK or its kinase Mnk even in RIE-1 cells. When both the Raf-kinase and PI3K /mTOR pathways were inhibited in normal cells, ODC IRES activity was very low, and most cells arrested in G1. However, when these pathways were inhibited in Ras-transformed cells, cell cycle arrest did not occur and ODC IRES activity increased, thus maintaining the high levels of ODC activity. In conclusion, our study for the first time shows that Ras predominantly regulates ODC synthesis both at the level of RNA degradation and also by a novel mechanism involving IRES-mediated translation. Understanding the regulation of ODC will help us to develop better therapeutic strategies to treat Ras-activated cancers.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5783], "author_name_tesi": "Origanti, Sofia S", "last_name_ssi": "Origanti", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Sofia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa M Shantz", "Gary Alan Clawson", "Scot R Kimball", "Anthony Edward Pegg", "Stephen R Rannels"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa M Shantz, Committee Chair", "Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Member", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Anthony Edward Pegg, Committee Member", "Stephen R Rannels, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["eIF4E phsophoryaltion", "IRES", "ras", "ODC", "RNA stability"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The anatomy of weathering profiles on different lithologies in the tropical forest of northeastern Puerto Rico: from bedrock to clouds\n", "id": "22669", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10352", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Critical Zone is the zone where meteoric fluids change the structure and chemistry of rock formed at depth. Near the surface, these changes result in formation of a mantle of chemically and physically altered material defined here as regolith. Worldwide, the depth of regolith varies from zero to hundreds of meters and is highly affected by lithology and climate.  In the Luquillo Mountains in northeastern Puerto Rico, we explored the influence of lithology (quartz diorite versus volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks versus metavolcaniclastic rocks) and climate (influenced by elevation) on weathering in the Rio Icacos watershed. The Icacos watershed is defined by hornfels-facies ridges above a quartz diorite-underlain valley (down to ~610 meters above sea level (masl)).  Prominent knickpoints not attributed to lithologic variation with flat reaches directly headward can be identified in all of the watersheds in the Luquillo Experimental Forest that are draining the quartz diorite bedrock. Regolith profiles were studied by drilling deep boreholes (25-40 m) and imaging the subsurface using ground penetrating radar (GPR).  In kaolinite-rich quartz diorite derived regolith near the land surface, GPR is a useful tool for imaging subsurface structures (to ~15 m depth) related to weathering. Boreholes in the Upper Icacos revealed a highly heterogeneous subsurface characterized by intervals of decimeter- to meter-sized corestones and centimeter- to meter-thick sections of disaggregated weathered material.  Two other boreholes drilled into the quartz diorite revealed that regolith at ridgetops thickened as elevation increased.  We also investigated the neighboring Bisley catchment, a sub-watershed of the larger Mameyes watershed where regolith has developed on sedimentary volcaniclastics, with GPR to image the subsurface to depths of about 8 mbls.  Along the divide between the Rio Icacos and Mameyes watersheds, where the outcropping rocks are hornfels-grade metavolcaniclastics, the GPR data was less useful, likely due to differences in clay mineralogy or the presence of iron oxides.  The depth of regolith on ridgetops was observed to increase with elevation and also to increase from quartz diorite (QD) to hornfels (HF) to volcaniclastics (VC). This trend is similar to the trend of increasing denudation rate of the three lithologies, i.e., HF < QD < VC. At the bottom of each borehole, we always observed oxidized fractures. These were attributed either to the deepest depth of the water table at each location or to deep influxes of oxidized water along fractures.  The thick regolith (~36 m) at the highest point of the watershed divide may be caused by the large fluctuations in the water table driving oxidation and fracturing of bedrock at that elevation.  \nAnother factor controlling the weathering of rocks in El Yunque National Forest is the base level at which clouds form, as the solute chemistry and the quantity of precipitation are affected by the immersion of the forest and land surface in clouds.  The cloud condensation level in the Luquillo Experimental Forest ranges from 600 \u2013 800 masl, i.e., the lowest elevation is coincident with the knickpoint (600 masl) and the flat reach headward on the Rio Icacos. Sulfur concentrations are highest in the soils (0.060 wt % S) developed at the highest elevations in the forest.  In the highest elevations, cloud water also contains higher S concentrations (152 \uf06deq SO42- /L) than rainwater (43 \uf06deq SO42- /L), and is more acidic (pH 4.35 cloud water, pH 4.76 rain water). Sites above the cloud condensation level therefore are frequently exposed to naturally occurring acidic cloud water for long periods of time. A plausible explanation of the architecture of the Critical Zone in the upper Luquillo Mountains of Puerto Rico is that relief is dictated largely by lithology because rock type controls the fracture density. This density in turn mediates the influx of water to rock at depth, influencing the type of weathering. However, fracture density is not just a function of the fracture toughness of each rock type but is also a function of how the minerals in each rock weather. Important positive feedbacks occur when the water table reaches the quartz diorite because oxidative weathering of biotite in that felsic rock drives formation of additional fractures that in turn enhance further weathering. The combination of biotite in quartz diorite exposed to acidic waters in the cloud layer above 600 masl combine to produce some of the fastest weathering rocks in the world and may contribute to the elevation of the flat reach headward of the knickpoints on quartz diorite draining rivers. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10025], "author_name_tesi": "Orlando, Joseph James", "last_name_ssi": "Orlando", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["deep weathering", "Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory", "drilling", "ground penetrating radar", "metavolcaniclastic", "hornfels", "corestone"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "GROWING UP GAMERS: FEMALE LEISURE IN DIGITAL GAMES CULTURE", "id": "15060slo154", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15060", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores possible explanations and complexities surrounding women\u2019s relationship with leisure and video games.

I argue that such trends, which are often framed as \u201cnatural\u201d gender-based affinities for certain types of games or ways of experiencing games, might be influenced by broader social contexts such as gender socialization, the nature of women\u2019s leisure time, constraints placed upon their play such as physical and virtual spaces that restrict access based on gender, and the ambivalent relationship many women players have with the games industry.  Scholars interested in gender-based motivations and preferences in digital games should continue to explore the various constraints that are imposed on players of different gender identities.

Optimal Partitioning Theory and fixed proportion allocation are often incorporated into models to estimate biomass partitioning to root systems. While some experiments do support these types of allocation models, scaling them to the landscape level is challenging because complex topographic variation may drive spatial and temporal patterns of resource availability. We examined patterns of variation in soil inorganic nitrogen, organic matter, rock content, volumetric water content and above- and belowground carbon partitioning across a topographically diverse first-order catchment (Shale Hills CZO). In order to test both fixed proportion and optimal partitioning at the site, we compared leaf area with absorptive root surface area (RSA) and leaf litter production with simulated absorptive root production at each slope position and across an elevation gradient.\nBoth Optimal Partitioning Theory and fixed proportion allocation were moderately supported by the data. Fractional allocation analysis revealed no significant relationship between partitioning and elevation or slope position, so in general a simple scaling exponent or fixed ratio may be acceptable. However, while soil properties and aboveground growth patterns showed strong relationships with both elevation and slope position, root distribution varied widely across the catchment and followed a less clear pattern. Only soil depth correlated with increased RSA. While belowground patterns did not support optimal partitioning, aboveground patterns did indicate an increase in tree height in increased light competition, despite smaller variations in leaf production.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13733], "author_name_tesi": "Orr, Alexandra Shaw", "last_name_ssi": "Orr", "middle_name_ssi": "Shaw", "first_name_ssi": "Alexandra", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Eissenstat", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Eissenstat, Thesis Advisor", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["partitioning", "optimal allocation", "temperate forest", "root turnover", "belowground carbon", "fine roots", "optimal partitioning theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A bond stiffness study of sol-gel spray-on transducers", "id": "23743", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10891", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ferroelectric thick films (> 10 \u00b5m) are of great interest in the medical, automotive, aerospace and military industries.

Chapter 1 analyzes the approaches that previous literary historians have taken in studying this period, and compares them with the terms and definitions used to describe fiction in the early eighteenth century to argue that literary historians have misunderstood early fiction.  Chapter 2 argues that the print culture world played a large role in determining what fiction was printed, and covers topics such as the economics of print, particular booksellers who sold fiction successfully, intellectual property in the early eighteenth century, and the rhetoric used to advertise fiction for sale.  Chapter 3 considers the role of authors in writing fiction, and argues that anonymous authors were much more significant than has been acknowledged by more modern critics.  Chapters 4 through 7 analyze the types of fiction printed and read in the early eighteenth century to demonstrate that fiction was more diverse than has been thought, and that the works famous in the canon today are not necessarily those that were most successful in their own time.  These chapters cover earlier fiction reprinted in the eighteenth century, translations, \u201cfiction with purpose,\u201d and \u201cfiction for entertainment.\u201d  A brief conclusion analyzes how fiction changes over time by looking at three snapshot years (1690, 1710, and 1730), and argues that fiction was more diverse and market-driven than critics have acknowledged.

Strangely, scholars have yet to explore Civil War mobilization in a comprehensive way. Mobilization was a multi-tiered process whereby local communities organized, officered, armed, equipped, and fed soldiers before sending them to the front. It was a four-year progression that required the simultaneous participation of legislative action, military administration, benevolent voluntarism, and industrial productivity to function properly. Perhaps more than any other area of the North, cities most dramatically felt the affects of this transition to war. Generally, scholars have given areas of the urban North low marks. Statistics refute pessimistic conclusions; northern cities appeared to provide a higher percentage than the North as a whole. Out of a population of twenty million, the North sent two million, or ten percent of its total population to war. Three of the largest cities\u2014New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston\u2014numbering over 1,592,000 people altogether\u2014alone sent 260,000 men to the seat of war, or sixteen percent of their combined populations. Thus, urban military history of the war offers a strange paradox: were northeastern cities the most important wellsprings of the war effort or were they thorns in the side of Union mobilization? This dissertation explores this question by examining Union army mobilization in four cities\u2014New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, and Baltimore\u2014explaining how each city came to raise and equip Union army regiments during all four years of the conflict. My study combines a variety of historical approaches, including urban history, military history, economic history, labor history, and political history, explaining how these metropolises mobilized for war in their own unique way. Contrary to the belief that cities offered the North a decisive advantage, this dissertation demonstrates how urban residents faced difficulties in extracting resources from their communities. Indeed, it suggests that the forces of urbanism and war ran counter to each other, placing northeastern city residents at tremendous disadvantage. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6188], "author_name_tesi": "Orr, Timothy Justin", "last_name_ssi": "Orr", "middle_name_ssi": "Justin", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carol A Reardon", "Carol A Reardon", "Mark E Neely Jr.", "Matthew Bennett Restall", "Carla Mulford"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carol A Reardon, Dissertation Advisor", "Carol A Reardon, Committee Chair", "Mark E Neely Jr., Committee Member", "Matthew Bennett Restall, Committee Member", "Carla Mulford, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Baltimore", "Philadelphia", "New York City", "Mobilization", "Civil War Cities", "Boston"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A PL-manifold of nonnegative curvature homeomorphic to S^2 \u00d7 S^2 is a direct metric product\n\n", "id": "9495", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5494", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Let M^4 be a PL-manifold of nonnegative curvature that is homeomorphic to a product of two spheres, S^2 \u00d7 S^2.

My study examined this growing area of higher education in two parts.  For Part One, I addressed which types of students are most engaged in online education, how student patterns of online course-taking vary across institution types, and how both student and institutional characteristics of online learners have changed over time.  For Part Two, I provided empirical evidence to examine the impact of online education on the academic outcomes of postsecondary students across institution types.\n\t\nFor Part One, I used cross-sectional data from four different editions of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (2000, 2004, 2008, 2012) and employed multinomial logit models for each year to describe the student and institutional characteristics of postsecondary online students.  Between 2000 and 2012, these data revealed substantial growth in the proportion of online students in higher education.  More specifically, the percentage of postsecondary students enrolled in some online courses increased from 3.35% in 2000 to 19.20% in 2012 while the proportion of postsecondary students enrolled in online-only programs increased from 2.24% to 7.45% during the same time period.  For Part Two, I drew longitudinal data from the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study (2004-2009) and ran several regression analyses to examine the impact of online enrollment on three-year credential completion, six-year credential completion, GPA, and community college transfers.  \n\t \nPart One of this study reveals several interesting findings associated with the profile of postsecondary online learners.  First, I found that student characteristics associated with the highest opportunity costs of engaging with residential education\u2014such as being a full-time employee, parent, or married\u2014were more likely to enroll in some online courses and online-only programs.  Second, empirical evidence showed that historically underrepresented postsecondary students were typically not more likely to engage with online education.  Third, I found that community college students were more likely to enroll in some (but not all) online courses, but my results pertaining to the likelihood of students at for-profit institutions to enroll in online-only programs were conflicted depending on the year being examined.  Fourth, my findings suggest high-status colleges and universities appeared to be less likely to offer online courses or online-only programs.  Finally, I found that Business and Health majors disproportionately increased their reliance on online education over time.  Business majors were more likely to enroll in some online courses and online-only degree programs relative to their peers (p < .001), but Health majors were only more likely to engage with some online courses (p < .001).  \n\nIn general, empirical evidence from Part Two suggests a positive relationship between enrolling in some (but not all) online courses and sub-baccalaureate credential completion.  For instance, community college students who enrolled in some online courses appeared to be more likely to earn an Associate\u2019s degree within three years and six years relative to community college students who only enrolled in face-to-face courses. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11265], "author_name_tesi": "Ortagus, Justin Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Ortagus", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Jesse Cheslock", "Liang Zhang", "Neal H Hutchens", "Timothy Grant Pollock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Jesse Cheslock, Dissertation Advisor", "Liang Zhang, Committee Member", "Neal H Hutchens, Committee Member", "Timothy Grant Pollock, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["online education", "higher education"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Digital Practices and Literacy Identities in English Education: From Deterministic Discourses to a Dialectic Framework", "id": "8773", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3750", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My research explores the challenges and questions that pre-service teachers in two English Education programs confronted with respect to the role of technology in their professional practices and identities. It is evident from the data that the decision to incorporate different technologies in their professional practices implied much more than using an accessory to enhance their pedagogical effectiveness. These technologies were linked to significant changes in the activities of reading and producing texts in our society.\nDominant discourses about technology and literacy are predominantly deterministic, and this tendency was represented in the way that the pre-service teachers who participated in my study approached technology. Echoing policy discourses that promote technological innovation as a synonym of socioeconomic progress, participants in many cases assumed a vision of technology as a means to teaching-effectiveness. This entailed separating the means from the curricular ends, which were not significantly re-examined when incorporating digital technologies. In other cases, participants expressed fear of digital texts because they sensed that they were displacing more traditional literacy. This reactionary position, equally deterministic, was associated with efforts to teach students how to ward off the negative influence of digital texts by being \u201ccritical.\u201d I argue that in teacher education it is important to engage with these discourses and address their implications. Identification with deterministic discourses closes down the possibilities for participation in powerful literacies because meanings are constructed as pre-determined, and efforts focus on \u201cwhat works\u201d without engaging in a critical examination of the purposes of education. \nNevertheless, along with deterministic moments, there were instances of dialectical engagement with technology among the study participants. These were associated with a meaningful integration of digital texts as part of the inter-text of the English classroom, and with the construction of a community of collaborative inquiry. In these cases, students were producing and sharing multiple kinds of texts, including essays, multimedia stories, videos, comic strips, online discussions, and podcasts, among others. The concept of critical media literacy, in dialectical teaching practices, did not separate analysis from productive ability, so students were taught to simultaneously produce multimedia and be critical about it. I contend that in teacher-education programs it is important to promote this concept of dialectical praxis, because it engages students with critically participating in socially relevant discourses. For this purpose, it is crucial to integrate cultural studies and critical theory with the production of multiple kinds of texts, and to promote experimentation within an inquiry community.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3730], "author_name_tesi": "Ortega, Leticia Eugenia", "last_name_ssi": "Ortega", "middle_name_ssi": "Eugenia", "first_name_ssi": "Leticia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamie Myers", "Patrick Willard Shannon", "Jacqueline Edmondson", "Steve L Thorne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamie Myers, Committee Chair", "Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline Edmondson, Committee Member", "Steve L Thorne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["discourse", "new literacies", "digital practices", "teacher education", "educational policy", "collaborative inquiry", "literacy technologies"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY PERFECTIONISM AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND SELF-ESTEEM AMONG LATINO COLLEGE STUDENTS\n\n", "id": "10719", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4646", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined the relationship between individual and family perfectionism and mental health functioning among two hundred and seven Latino college students. One aim of this study was to test the factor structure of the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R; Slaney, Rice, Mobley, Trippi, & Ashby, 2001) with Latino college students by conducting a confirmatory factor analysis utilizing APS-R scores. Another aim of this study was to examine the relevance of the construct of family perfectionism among Latino college students by performing an exploratory factor analysis on the Almost Perfect Scale-Family (APS-F; Methikalam, Slaney, & Wang, 2005), a scale used to measure perceived family perfectionism. An examination of the underlying factors of the APS-R, and the associations between the scale\u2019s subscales and the dependent variables of the study, depression, anxiety and self-esteem suggest that the APS-R is a valid measure of perfectionism among Latino college students. The results of this study also provided support for the psychometric properties of the APS-F with Latino college students. Of interest was that the Family Discrepancy subscale of the APS-F, which measures an individual\u2019s perceptions that he or she is failing to meet the high standards set by his or her family, was significantly and positively associated with depression and anxiety, and negatively associated with self-esteem. \n     This study also investigated the differences between adaptive perfectionists, maladaptive perfectionists, and non-perfectionists on the variables of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. A two stage cluster analysis consisting of a hierarchical and a nonhierarchical analysis was conducted utilizing APS-R scores to determine perfectionism clusters based on individual perfectionism. To further investigate family perfectionism and to identify perfectionist groups based on family perfectionism, the same process of conducting a cluster analysis was performed utilizing APS-F scores.  For both cluster analyses, three groups of perfectionists were identified: adaptive perfectionists, maladaptive perfectionists and non-perfectionists. MANOVAs assessed if there were significant differences between perfectionism clusters on the variables of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. Consistent with the results of previous studies, individual maladaptive perfectionists reported significantly higher scores on depression and anxiety and significantly lower self-esteem compared to the individual adaptive perfectionists. However, individual maladaptive perfectionists were not significantly different from the individual non-perfectionists on the measures of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. \n     With regards to family perfectionism clusters, there were no significant differences between maladaptive perfectionists family, adaptive perfectionists family, and non-perfectionists family on the dependent variables of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. Several interpretations based on the results were offered highlighting the importance of familism and acculturation due to the relevance of these cultural variables among Latinos.

Recently, we have shown that surface-bound enzymes can act as pumps driving large-scale fluid flows in the presence of any substance that triggers the enzymatic reaction (e.g. substrate, co-factor, or biomarker). The fluid velocities attained in such systems depend directly on the enzymatic reaction rate and the concentration of the substance that initiates enzymatic catalysis. The use of biochemical reactions to power a micropump offers the advantages of specificity, sensitivity, and selectively, eliminating at the same time the need of an external power source, while providing biocompatibility. More importantly, these self-powered pumps overcome a significant obstacle in nano- and micro-fluidics: the need to use external pressure-driven pumps to push fluids through devices. \nCertainly, the development of enzyme-powered devices opens up new venues in biochemical engineering, particularly in the biomedical field. However, in order to take this concept to the next level, and design more precise, complex and efficient devices, a complete understanding of the fundamental principles for actuation and the factors that exert an effect in the output of the micropump, as well as an experimental assessment of some of their potential applications, is necessary. The work highlighted in this dissertation covers all the studies performed with enzyme-powered pumps, from the development of the micropump design, to the efforts invested in understanding the enzyme pump concept as a whole. The data collected to date, aims to expand our knowledge about enzyme-powered micropumps from the inside out: not only by exploring the different applications of these devices at the macroscale, but also by investigating in depth the mechanism of pump activation behind these systems. Specifically, we have focused on: (1) The general features that characterize the pumping behavior observed in enzyme-powered pumps, as well as the optimization of the device, (2) the possible mechanisms behind fluid motion, including the role of enzyme coverage and/or activity on the transduction of chemical energy into mechanical fluid flow in these devices, covering also the effect of the thermodynamics of the enzymatic reaction in the pumping behavior, and (3) the applicability of enzyme pumps as fluid flow-based inhibitor assays and as drug delivery devices. Our findings in each of these areas, gets us closer to our ultimate goal, where we aim to identify the optimal conditions needed for enzyme micropump operation, and construct a general model that could accurately predict enzyme micropump behavior for any enzyme-substrate combination.\nThe information aforementioned has been divided in four chapters. Chapter 1 gives a quick glance into the development of enzyme-powered micropumps: from the systems and observed behaviors inspiring this work, to the first systems that were developed. The stability, duration, and extent of fluid pumping of enzyme pumps in general, are also discussed, along with the optimization of the enzyme-pump design. This chapter aims to provide a general idea of the motivation behind the concept of \u201cenzyme-powered pumps\u201d, what are \u201cenzyme-powered pumps\u201d, and which are the key features that characterize these systems. Chapter 2 is an extensive analysis of the mechanisms of actuation proposed for enzyme-powered micropumps. This chapter not only covers the first attempts to understand how enzyme pumps work, but also explores further the behavior of urease-powered pumps, which fluid flow patterns cannot be completely predicted only by considering thermal or solutal gradients. The findings of these studies could allow us to rationally control fluid flow for the directed delivery of payloads at designated locations. \nIn Chapters 3 and 4, our focus was to highlight the potential application of enzyme-powered pumps for sensing and delivery. Chapter 3 explores the use of enzyme pumps as fluid flow-based inhibitor assays. At fixed concentrations of an enzyme and its substrate, the presence of an inhibitor can be detected by monitoring the decrease in fluid flow speed.  Using this principle, sensors for toxic substances, like mercury, cyanide and azide, were designed using urease and catalase-powered pumps, respectively, with limits of detection well below the concentrations permitted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Chapter 4 demonstrates that, apart from their applicability as sensors, enzyme pumps can also be used for stimuli-responsive release, if the architecture applied for the design of the enzyme pump consists of a porous scaffold (e.g. hydrogel), that serves both as the platform for enzyme immobilization and as the host for guest molecules to be released. These proof-of-concept devices were developed with the idea of using the flows generated by enzymatic catalysis to power cargo release, only in the presence of the correct stimuli (e.g. release of insulin in the presence of glucose; release of antidotes in the presence of a toxic agent). In the cases studied, cargo release was directly proportional to the concentration of enzyme substrate in solution, highlighting the sensitivity of the device and its potential for drug delivery purposes.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14115], "author_name_tesi": "Ortiz, Isamar ", "last_name_ssi": "Ortiz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Isamar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen", "Ayusman Sen", "Thomas E.

A common belief is that simply delivering information and communication technologies (ICT) to communities lacking access to and skilled use of technology will suffice.  Often solutions are developed without adequate consultation with the local community, leading to a design-reality gap. This dissertation examines the extent to which the use of ICTs like wireless mesh broadband via government-led deployments can conquer the digital divide.\n\nRecently, public elites have decided to design, develop and implement city-wide wireless broadband networks (Mu-Fi) all while offering a cornucopia of benefits.  Such benefits generally fall into three broad categories: promoting economic development, enhancing governmental services and narrowing the digital divide.  While municipalities, with their provision of Wi-Fi public access, have the desire to make their citizens feel more included in the Information Society, these municipal actions have provoked a flurry of responses from concerned constituents, including Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers (ILECs), state legislators and the U.S. Congress.  As armed rhetorical camps, both private and public elites are aggressively pushing their own agendas forward with little to no scientific evidence to support their claims.  The debate is largely framed in polarizing terms: one side is imbued with a halo of positivism, the other with negativism.  In this light, the purpose of this dissertation is to examine the impact of Mu-Fi on the digital divide, and thus contribute scientifically to the discourse.  Specifically, I am interested in investigating how network aggregate indicators (NAI) affect quality-of-life aggregate indicators (QoLAI), and thus, mitigate the so-called digital divide.  The main research question driving this study is: Does a municipal wireless broadband network have a perceived measurable impact on the digital divide?\n\nThis study adopts the term technological enthusiasm by drawing on several theoretical frameworks to inform this research. It is important to utilize multiple theories to account for the complexity of human nature and diverse perspectives when investigating the role municipal wireless systems play in promoting digital inclusion.  Using qualitative methods, multiple case study research approach, several data sources from five U.S. Cities were used.  The analysis aims to present an inter-disciplinary and holistic vision of Mu-Fi vis-\u00e0-vis a very complex, dynamic and evolving digital divide.  By doing so, the author attempts to dispel (or promote) what the public perceives as a need and what public officials see as convenience and necessity.  Specifically, data from these cities was used to evaluate the impact on the digital divide. The results from these data sets were compared in order to explore whether the relationship between NAI and QoLAI had an effect on the digital divide and if this effect varied across different organizational settings. The findings will show if these cities have failed or succeeded in achieving their digital divide objectives.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2517], "author_name_tesi": "Ortiz, Julio Angel", "last_name_ssi": "Ortiz", "middle_name_ssi": "Angel", "first_name_ssi": "Julio", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrea H Tapia", "Jorge Reina Schement", "Lynette Marie Yarger", "Richard Denny Taylor", "Angsana Techatassanasoontorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrea H Tapia, Committee Chair", "Jorge Reina Schement, Committee Member", "Lynette Marie Yarger, Committee Member", "Richard Denny Taylor, Committee Member", "Angsana Techatassanasoontorn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wi-Fi", "municipal broadband networks", "digital divide", "universal service", "quality of life"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "P and S Body Wave Tomography of Southern Africa", "id": "15029kjo146", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15029", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "P- and S-wave seismic tomography was used to investigate the seismic velocity structure of the upper mantle beneath southern Africa using data from multiple seismic networks across the region.

The surfaces of fibers that are used in such materials must be reactive to adhesives and other organics, and stable against chemical attack by humidity. The reactive sites present on the glass surface, and their roles in binding different chemical species, require investigation so that the materials can be tailored to meet specific demands. In this study the interaction of a small probe molecule (acetic acid) with sodium aluminoborosilicate glass fiber is investigated with the final goal of a predictive understanding of the oxide surface reactivity with carboxylic functional polymers. In order to study the nature of the interaction of probe molecules to the oxide surface, inverse gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (IGC-MS) and inverse gas chromatography temperature programmed desorption (IGC-TPD) are utilized. After dosing of sodium aluminoborosilicate glass fibers with acetic acid, the mass spectrum shows that carbon dioxide and water are the most abundant species that elute from the GC column at a constant temperature of 100oC, due to the presence of sodium carbonate on the fiber surface. IGC-TPD-FID and IGC-TPD-MS studies show four different regimes, one at low temperatures and three at higher temperatures. IGC-TPD-MS studies show that at the low temperature, acetic acid elutes as an intact species, revealing that at these temperatures physisorbed acetic acid is being removed. At higher temperatures, elution of acetic acid is observed from a more strongly physisorbed species (based on the temperature range of desorption) and a new species, ethenone, is also observed. Ethenone is a product of the decomposition of carboxylate species at high temperatures, which suggest that the formation of carboxylate species is occurring as an interaction of the acetic acid with the sodium aluminoborosilicate glass. Also, at higher temperatures (600oC) water desorbs as a product of silanol group condensation as well as the removal of chemisorbed water in the glass. Coupling previous NMR studies with the results of this work, we have discovered that both sodium from the glass itself and sodium found in sodium carbonates formed near the surface (presumably from interaction of the untreated glass with atmospheric carbon dioxide) can be the sites of interaction with the carboxylic acid, with the majority of binding occurring with the sodium in the glass surface. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3836], "author_name_tesi": "Ortiz Rivera, Lymaris ", "last_name_ssi": "Ortiz Rivera", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lymaris", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller", "Karl Todd Mueller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Todd Mueller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["acetic acid", "sodium aluminoborosilicate glass", "inverse gas chromatography"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Predicting Onsite Searching Using Referral Keywords: The Relationship between Search Engine and Website Search", "id": "17689", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8670", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this research, I analyze the relationship between referral queries of major web search engines and the subsequent onsite search queries of visitors that begin their searching episode on a web search engine and then continue searching on a particular website.

These settlers used the process of identifying difference or \u201cothering\u201d to various degrees and memory to identify what they believed to be acceptable and unacceptable character traits.

While race, gender and class each played an important role in helping pioneers self-identify, these provide a limited picture of what westerners considered markers of worth and civility.

A particular focus of the research is on coupled airwake effects in the helicopter / ship dynamic interface.\n\nA computationally efficient coupling interface was developed between the helicopter flight dynamics model, GENHEL-PSU and the Navier-Stokes solvers, CRUNCH/CRAFT-CFD using both FORTRAN and C/C++ programming languages. In order to achieve real-time execution speeds, the main rotor was modeled with a simplified actuator disk using unsteady momentum sources, instead of re- solving the full blade geometry in the CFD. All the airframe components, including the fuselage are represented by single aerodynamic control points in the CFD calculations. The rotor downwash influence on the fuselage and empennage are calculated by using the CFD predicted local flow velocities at these aerodynamic control points defined on the helicopter airframe. In the coupled simulations, the flight dynamics model is free to move within a computational domain, where the main rotor forces are translated into source terms in the momentum equations of the Navier-Stokes equations. Simultaneously, the CFD calculates induced velocities those are fed back to the simulation and affect the aerodynamic loads in the flight dynamics. The CFD solver models the inflow, ground effect, and interactional aerodynamics in the flight dynamics simulation, and these calculations can be coupled with solution of the external flow (e.g. ship airwake effects).\n\nThe developed framework was utilized for various investigations of hovering, forward flight and helicopter/terrain interaction simulations including standard ground effect, partial ground effect, sloped terrain, and acceleration in ground effect; and results compared with different flight and experimental data. In near ground cases, the fully-coupled flight dynamics and CFD simulations predicted roll oscillations due to interactions of the rotor downwash, ground plane, and the feedback controller, which are not predicted by the conventional simulation models. Fully coupled simulations of a helicopter accelerating near ground predicted flow formations similar to the recirculation and ground vortex flow regimes observed in experiments. The predictions of hover power reductions due to ground effect compared well to a recent experimental data and the results showed 22% power reduction for a hover flight z/R=0.55 above ground level. Fully coupled simulations performed for a helicopter hovering over and approaching to a ship flight deck and results compared with the standalone GENHEL-PSU simulations without ship airwake and one-way coupled simulations. The fully-coupled simulations showed higher pilot workload compared to the other two cases.\n\nIn order to increase the execution speeds of the CFD calculations, several improvements were made on the CFD solver. First, the initial coupling approach File I/O was replaced with a more efficient method called Multiple Program Multiple Data MPI framework, where the two executables communicate with each other by MPI calls. Next, the unstructured solver (CRUNCH CFD), which is 2nd-order accurate in space, was replaced with the faster running structured solver (CRAFT CFD) that is 5th-order accurate in space. Other improvements including a more efficient k-d tree search algorithm and the bounding of the source term search space within a small region of the grid surrounding the rotor were made on the CFD solver. The final improvement was to parallelize the search task with the CFD solver tasks within the solver. To quantify the speed-up of the improvements to the coupling interface described above, a study was performed to demonstrate the speedup achieved from each of the interface improvements. The improvements made on the CFD solver showed more than 40 times speedup from the baseline file I/O and unstructured solver CRUNCH CFD. Using a structured CFD solver with 5th-order spacial accuracy provided the largest reductions in execution times. Disregarding the solver numeric, the total speedup of all of the interface improvements including the MPMD rotor point exchange, k-d tree search algorithm, bounded search space, and paralleled search task, was approximately 231%, more than a factor of 2. All these improvements provided the necessary speedup for approach real-time CFD. \n\nFor the Pilot-in-the-loop flight dynamics and CFD simulations, a simplified backward facing step was chosen. A study was performed to quantify the grid sensitivity of the helicopter dynamic response and results showed that at least 2 ft grid resolution will be required in the airwake of the ship to capture general coupled airwake effects on the approach. Finally, a network configuration was introduced for the Pilot-in-the-loop CFD simulations and the Pilot-in-the-loop CFD simulation framework was implemented and tested in the PSU Flight Simulation lab bringing coupled CFD into a realistic flight simulation environment. A near-real-time (3x slower than real-time) Pilot-in-the-loop CFD simulation for a simple wake shedding case was demonstrated with 0.38 million structured grid cells running on 352 processors and results are presented.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16011], "author_name_tesi": "Oruc, Ilker ", "last_name_ssi": "Oruc", "first_name_ssi": "Ilker", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph F.

The exploitation of unconventional gas reservoirs has become an integral part of the North American gas supply. The economic viability of many unconventional gas developments hinges on the effective stimulation of extremely low permeability reservoir rocks. With improve drilling and stimulation technologies, many unconventional plays have become realistic contributors to the energy budget. The Marcellus shale reservoir contains large amount of natural gas resources and its proximity to high demand markets along the East Coast of the United States makes it an attractive target for energy development. According to Arthur et al (2008), the estimated original gas in place in the Marcellus shale is 1,500 TCF (Trillion Cubic Foot) which when compared to other shale plays in the United States almost doubles the estimated gas in place associated with other shale reservoirs. So, it is crucial for exploration and production companies to invest in the Marcellus shale.\nHydraulic fracturing technique is the stimulation method of choice in shale gas reservoirs. Even though hydraulic fracturing technique improves ultimate gas recovery, they are several factors that occur after hydraulic fracture treatment that impacts the production of natural gas from a hydraulically fractured shale gas well. These factors include: multi phase flow of gas and water, proppant crushing, proppant diagenesis, interaction of fracture fluid with reservoir particles, relative permeability, capillary pressure, reservoir permeability change, operational conditions, and reservoir heterogeneity among others.\nThis research study was undertaken to quantify the impact of selected post hydraulic fracture factors that affects shale gas wells. With the use of commercial reservoir simulation software that models cumulative production and production flow rate from a vertical well located in a 160 acre Marcellus shale gas reservoir, we are able to quantify how much impact this various factors will have on the ultimate gas recovered from the reservoir under consideration. An ideal case single phase flow was simulated and was used as the base result for which simulation results of other factors was compared. \nThe new knowledge from this research should enable engineers to better design fracture treatments and helps operators manage the wells in the Marcellus shale formation. The observation and recommendations will also be useful for further studies in this area.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6113], "author_name_tesi": "Osholake, Tunde A", "last_name_ssi": "Osholake", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Tunde", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Yilin Wang", "Yilin Wang", "Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Yilin Wang, Thesis Advisor", "Yilin Wang, Thesis Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["MARCELLUS SHALE", "FACTORS AFFECTING"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "FILLING THE GAPS: WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT TESOL WORKING CONDITIONS", "id": "15215mlo138", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15215", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "English Language Learners (ELLs) are a diverse and growing population in American\npublic schools.

Development and application of ReaxFF for Energy Storage Materials \nEnergy storage as a key aspect of assimilating renewable energy sources in power grids made the development of high capacity batteries an important technical challenge. The proliferation of portable electronics, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and large scale energy storage has drawn significant attention toward the development of new generation-Lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Currently, most of commercial LIBs use graphitic anodes due to its long cycle life, high conductivity, abundance, and relatively low cost. However, the low specific charge capacity \"(375 mAh\" \"g\" ^\"-1\"  \")\"  of graphite caused researchers to dedicate extensive attempts to find better alternative anode materials. Among all potential anodes, Silicon (Si), which can host a large amount of Lithium (Li) - each silicon atom can host up to 4.4 lithium atoms -  is the most promising candidate. Nevertheless, associated with its large charge capacity of\" 4200 mAh\" \"g\" ^\"-1\" , insertion of lithium into silicon causes a large volumetric expansion of up to\" 300%\" , resulting in mechanical degradation and fracture. On the other side of the battery, the cathode, which mainly controls the voltage of LIB, should be tailored so that it can react with Li in a reversible manner. Sulfur (S) has been identified as one of most promising cathode materials for its high theoretical capacity, five times higher than that of the LiCoO2/graphite system. However, since the capacity of sulfur and its intermediate lithium polysulfide products rapidly decay due to the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides into the electrolytes, the commercialization of Li/S has been hindered. In this thesis study, systematic Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have been performed using ReaxFF reactive potentials to study the atomistic mechanisms governing the chemo-mechanical degradation in high-energy density anode and cathode materials. Our modeling results have shed light on the electrochemical insertion process of Li into the new high-capacity electrodes and have provided fundamental guidance to the rational designs of the next generation high capacity electrode materials with enhanced capacity retention and durability. \n2. Application of ReaxFF for tow-dimensional materials\nWhile the first part of this thesis covers battery applications, the second part of this thesis is devoted to the application and development of ReaxFF to model two-dimensional (2D) materials. The discovery of graphene in 2004 was the moment of the birth of an emerging research realm of 2D materials. Due to its exceptional electronic, optoelectronic and chemo-mechanical properties, graphene became ushers in the field of nano-transistors, photovoltaics, light emitting devices, optical sensors and topological field effect transistors. However, the ever increasing demands of semiconductor industry to utilize novel materials with a wider band-gap and superior structural, thermal and electrical properties has stimulated extensive scientific efforts to develop and synthesis of new generation of \u2018graphene-liked\u2019 2D-materials. Of the various proposed materials, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as MoS2 and WS2 have been recognized as promising candidates. It is well established that mechanical strain and geometry changes could dramatically affect the band structure and in turn electronic properties of 2D materials and in turn affect the performance and workability of the nano-transistors made of these materials. In this study, we present  the  development  of  a  new  ReaxFF  reactive  potential  which  can accurately describe the thermodynamic and structural properties of MoS2 sheets. Extensive Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations are carried out to produce the required data-set for optimization of the new empirical potential parameters. This  force  field is  able  to  accurately predict  the  mechanical  properties  and  elastic  constants of  single  layer  MoS2. The  newly developed  potential  is  also  successfully  applied  to  estimate the  formation  energies  of various types of point-defects (5 different vacancy types) along with the vacancy migration barriers  and  transition  of  2H  (semiconducting) \u2194  1T  (metallic)  phases. The  energetics  of ripplocations, a recently  observed  defect  in  van  der  Waals  layers, is  examined  and  the interplay between these defects and sulfur (S) vacancies is studied. As strain-engineering of MoS2  sheets  is  as  an  effective  way  to  manipulate  the  electronic  and  optical  properties  of this  material,  the  new ReaxFF description  can  provide  a  comprehensive  insight  about  the morphological  changes  under  various  conditions  of  loading  and  defects  to  further  tuning the band-gap properties in these 2D-structures.  \nRecent experimental advances however confirm the possibility of further tuning the electronic properties of MoS2 through the fabrication of single-layer heterostructures consisting of semiconducting (2H) and metallic (1T) MoS2 phases. However, despite of technological and scientific interests, there exist limited information concerning the mechanical properties of these systems. Consequently, this investigation aims to provide a general vision regarding the mechanical properties of all-MoS2 single-layer structures at room temperature. This goal was achieved by performing extensive classical molecular dynamics simulations using a recently developed RexFF forcefield. We first studied the chirality dependent mechanical properties of defect-free 2H and 1T phases. Our atomistic modeling results for pristine 2H MoS2 were found to agree fairly well with the experimental tests. We finally discussed the mechanical response of 2H/1T single layer heterostructures. Our atomistic results suggest all-MoS2 heterostructures as suitable candidates to reach a strong and flexible material with tunable electronic properties.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12692], "author_name_tesi": "Ostadhossein, Alireza ", "last_name_ssi": "Ostadhossein", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alireza", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lithium ion Batteries", "Two dimensional Materials", "Atomistic Simulation", "ReaxFF"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ESTABLISHING A METHODOLOGY FOR RESOLVING CONVECTIVE HEAT TRANSFER FROM COMPLEX GEOMETRIES\n", "id": "8142", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2759", "abstract_tesi": "Current turbine airfoils must operate at extreme temperatures, which are continuously driven higher by the demand for high output engines. Internal cooling plays a key role in the longevity of gas turbine airfoils. Ribbed channels are commonly used to increase heat transfer by generating turbulence and to provide a greater convective surface area. Because of the increasing complexity in airfoil design and manufacturing, a methodology is needed to accurately measure the convection coefficient of a rib with a complex shape. Previous studies that have measured the contribution to convective heat transfer from the rib itself have used simple rib geometries. This paper presents a new methodology to measure convective heat transfer coefficients on complex ribbed surfaces. The new method was applied to a relatively simple shape so that comparisons could be made with a commonly accepted method for heat transfer measurements.\n\nA numerical analysis was performed to reduce experimental uncertainty and to verify the lumped model approximation used in the new methodology.  Experimental measurements were taken in a closed-loop channel using fully rounded, discontinuous, skewed ribs oriented 45\u00b0 to the flow. The channel aspect ratio was 1.7:1 and the ratio of rib height to hydraulic diameter was 0.075.

While many studies have investigated pin-fin heat transfer, few studies have directly measured the flowfield in pin-fin arrays.  The present work compares time-dependent flowfield measurements with time-mean heat transfer measurements to determine the relative influence of certain flowfield  features on array heat transfer.\n     For single pin-fin rows, increasing Reynolds number decreased the wake closure position downstream of the pin, which corresponded with the position of maximum heat transfer.  For multiple pin-fin rows, the wake closure position in the first row was influenced by streamwise spacing.  For low Reynolds numbers, heat transfer in the initial rows was dominated by the horseshoe vortex.  For high Reynolds number, heat transfer in the initial rows was influenced by the horseshoe vortex and generation of turbulence in the wake, close to the pin-fin.  Despite localized differences in heat transfer when varying streamwise spacing, the row-averaged heat transfer in the initial rows of the array, was independent of streamwise spacing.  In downstream rows, however, decreasing streamwise spacing (from 3.03 diameters to 2.16 diameters) was found to increase heat transfer because there was less streamwise distance for the decay of turbulence prior to the flow encountering the next row of pin-fins.\n     Decreasing spanwise spacing (from 3 diameters to 2 diameters) resulted in increased heat transfer for both low and high Reynolds numbers in multiple row pin-fin arrays.  In the initial rows, close spanwise pin spacing resulted in a significant portion of the channel walls being disturbed by the horseshoe vortex that wrapped around the pins.  In downstream rows, however, the vortex breakdown to turbulent flows resulted in increased heat transfer for close spacings.  In addition, decreasing spanwise spacing (from 3 diameters to 2 diameters) resulted in a thinner wall layer resulting in increased heat transfer compared to wider spanwise spacings.  For a given percentage decrease in either streamwise or spanwise spacing, a similar percentage increase in heat transfer was observed.\n     Improvements to pin-fin arrays may be possible through modifications to the pin-fin shape, the endwall shape, or to the pin-fin spacing.  In the present work, a non-uniform array was considered having variable streamwise pin-fin spacing.  The non-uniform array performed as well as a closely spaced array at high Reynolds number.  The important result was that improvements were realized through non-conventional spacing schemes.  Further modifications that generate turbulence and prevent the streamwise decay of turbulence would be beneficial for array heat transfer based on the results presented in this work.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7024], "author_name_tesi": "Ostanek, Jason ", "last_name_ssi": "Ostanek", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole", "Dr Eric Paterson", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Cengiz Camci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Eric Paterson, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["heat transfer", "turbulence", "heat exchangers", "pin-fins"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Prevention & Politics: An Investigation of Sex Education Policy in Pennsylvania", "id": "10855", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4281", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sex education in the United States is a complicated and expansive issue.

I approached this goal by evaluating the origins of magnetite and hematite in Banded Iron Formations (BIFs), associated iron ores, and mass-independently-fractionated sulfur isotopes (MIF-S) in Precambrian sedimentary rocks.\nThe major deposition of BIFs before 1.9 Ga has been thought to reflect a period of globally anoxic oceans, at least the deep ocean. This theory springs from the conventional model which requires the transport of Fe2+ from the deep ocean to the continental shelf. Researchers have proposed that magnetite, the most common Fe-bearing mineral in typical oxide-type BIFs (e.g., Algoma-type), was transformed from hematite by a redox reaction with organic carbon or siderite during metamorphism. However, another process that can transform hematite to magnetite may be a non-redox reaction with Fe2+-rich hydrothermal fluids. \nI have experimentally investigated the transformation mechanisms of iron oxides under hydrothermal conditions. Magnetite or hematite was reacted with an acid under H2-rich hydrothermal conditions (100-250\u00baC). Non-redox transformations between magnetite and hematite:\nFe3O4(mt) + 2H+(aq) &#8596; Fe2O3(hm) + Fe2+(aq) + H2O\t\t\t\t(1),\noccurred rapidly in both direactions, and much more efficiently than redox transformations under low temperature hydrothermal conditions (e.g., 150\u00baC). Non-redox transformation of hematite to magnetite may have been responsible for the transformation of primary hematite to magnetite in BIFs that were poor in reductants (e.g., organic matter). Because non-redox transformation of hematite to magnetite, which increases molar volume, is most likely to occur during early diagenesis, the Fe source for the BIFs would have been proximal to the depositional sites. The transformation further suggests that formation of BIFs was a local phenomenon, rather than the long distance transport of Fe from the deep ocean to continental shelves through a global anoxic ocean. This experimental study also indicates that the redox transformation of hematite to magnetite by hydrogen can be important even at 150\u00baC under certain conditions (e.g., pH, presence of catalyst). Both of the transformation mechanisms may have been important in many oxide-type BIFs that are associated with volcanic rocks, are not subjected to high-grade metamorphism, and have very low organic carbon content (<0.01%). \nThe world\u2019s major iron ores are high-grade hematite iron ores developed from low-grade BIFs through transformation of magnetite to hematite. In all previous models, molecular oxygen from the atmosphere has been considered to be the oxidant. Therefore, such ore formation has been linked to the oxygenation of the atmosphere. However, I have experimentally demonstrated that magnetite is transformed to hematite by a reaction with an acidic fluid under hydrothermal conditions. Because this transformation process facilitates water-rock interactions by increasing porosity of rocks, it is more efficient than oxidation of magnetite by O2-bearing fluids. The results suggest that the occurrence of high-grade hematite iron ores is not evidence for free oxygen, and that the formation of hematite-rich iron ores developed from BIFs may have occurred throughout geologic time.\nSince the discovery of MIF-S in many sedimentary rocks older than 2.45 Ga, the MIF-S record of such rocks has been cited by many researchers as unequivocal evidence for a dramatic change from an anoxic to oxic atmosphere around 2.4 Ga. However, multiple sulfur isotope data of these natural samples have been interpreted under the following two premises. The first premise is that the equilibrium fractionation of sulfur isotopes in nature always conforms to the Bigeleisen-Mayer approximations. The second premise is that UV photolysis of SO2 in an O2-poor atmosphere is the only cause for MIF-S in nature.\nI have theoretically evaluated the two premises using ab initio methods. The results demonstrate that mass-dependent relationships (i.e., fractionation factor ratios) during equilibrium reactions vary for S-species couples such as SO42-(aq) - H2S (e.g., 0.505 \u2013 0517 for   value), and that MIF-S signatures may be produced during adsorption, particularly at high temperatures (e.g., 200\u00baC). These results suggest that MIF-S signatures in Archean sedimentary rocks may have been created by heterogeneous reactions between organic matter and S-bearing aqueous solution under hydrothermal conditions, rather than by UV photolysis of volcanic SO2 in an O2-poor atmosphere. \nStudies in this thesis indicate that conventional models for the deposition of BIFs, formation of hematite-rich iron ores, and production of MIF-S may not be correct. Thus, their temporal distributions are not unequivocal evidence for the oxygenation of atmosphere. Both of the studies on iron oxide transformations and multiple S isotope fractionations illuminate the significance of hydrothermal activity in the genesis of BIFs and MIF-S signatures in sedimentary rocks.

The abundance of magnetite-rich BIFs in the Archean and early Proterozoic sequences may have been the result of higher heat flux from the interior to the surface of the early Earth.

The solutions and transition processes for stationary diffusions are generally unknown in closed form and therefore standard maximum likelihood methods do not apply. Moreover, the arrival rates of credit events on sovereign bonds are unobservable and a direct nonparametric estimation does not work. Chapter 1 overcomes these challenges combining a semi-nonparametric estimator in the framework of the Efficient Method of Moments, and a reduced-form model for pricing sovereign bonds and credit default swaps. The application for Brazil sovereign assets explores the performance of the model under different specifications of the intensity process.\n\nChapter 2 proves a nonparametric identification result for a stochastic dynamic discrete-choice game of incomplete information. The joint distribution of the private information and the stage game payoffs of the players are both assumed unknown for the econometrician and the private information across alternatives is allowed to have different distributions and be dependent. This setup poses a circularity problem in the identification strategy that has not been solved for dynamic games. Chapter 2 proposes a solution through exclusion restrictions and implied properties of the unknown functions.  Under the assumptions that the distribution of the private shocks for the outside option is known and the outside option's shocks are independent of other shocks, the results jointly identify the stage game payoffs and the joint distribution of the private information.\n\nChapter 3 proposes a new nonparametric identification strategy for static multiple choice models with random heterogeneity in unobservables.

A challenge when estimating ALT models is to decide how to specify the initial conditions associated with the first available time point. Among the initial condition specifications (ICSs) considered in the literature are the predetermined and ongoing endogenous specifications (Curran & Bollen, 2001; Bollen & Curran, 2004; Hamaker, 2005; Jongerling & Hamaker, 2011). The former treats the first time point as predetermined and allows the process under study to conform to different longitudinal structures prior to, and after the first collected observation; the latter is used to describe an ALT process that has started in the distant past. One other specification that is commonly assumed in empirical applications is that the ALT process simply starts at the first time point and has no prior history. Unfortunately, the rationales for adopting one of these specifications over the others, their conditions of equivalence, and the effects of using covariates to predict individual differences in the presence of different ICs are poorly understood. In this study, we show analytically that a variety of ICSs is in fact nested within the predetermined ICS.

For instance, many intensive longitudinal measurements may be collected at irregularly spaced time intervals, and involve complex, possibly nonlinear and heterogeneous (across individuals) patterns of change. Effective modeling of such change processes requires continuous-time models (i.e., differential equation models) that may be nonlinear in form and include mixed effects in key dynamic parameters of interest. To fit such models, the continuous-discrete extended Kalman filter (CDEKF; Bar-Shalom, Li, & Kirubarajan, 2001; Chow et al., 2018; Kulikov & Kulikova, 2014) approach has been proposed. However, its performance had only been partially evaluated in fitting ordinary differential equation (ODE) models with no process noise; its performance in handling stochastic differential equation (SDE) models with mixed effects was unclear. In the current project, I 1) evaluated the feasibility of using the CDEKF approach to fit nonlinear mixed-effects SDE models in which random effects are represented as latent variables, 2) mathematically derived the necessary condition under which the underlying approximate model for a mixed-effects SDE model in the CDEKF approach is identifiable; 3) extended a previously published linear mixed-effects continuous-time model of emotions to a nonlinear mixed-effects SDE model and fitted it to a set of irregularly-spaced intensive longitudinal data from the Affective Dynamics and Individual Differences (ADID; Emotions and Dynamic Systems Laboratory, 2010) study; and 4) performed a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the strengths and limitations of the CDEKF approach in fitting the nonlinear mixed-effects continuous-time model proposed in 3). Results showed that the model proposed for studying positive and negative emotions provided a reasonable fit to the empirical data, and the CDEKF approach was able to produce accurate and dependable parameter and standard error estimates in fitting mixed-effects SDE models. I also addressed how sample-size, process noise variance, and data spacing conditions could affect the performance of the CDEKF approach, and provided practical suggestions on its utility based on results from the simulation study.

In this prior research, the ultrasonic deicing prototypes failed due to actuator fracture and debonding from the host structure. The goal of this research is to advance the ultrasonic deicing technology towards a robust integrated system that achieves repeatable ice shedding. Finite Element Models (FEM) are used to predict the ultrasonic ice transverse shear stresses responsible for ice shedding. The FEM tools are experimentally validated and guidelines for mesh requirements are established. To accurately predict the dynamic response of the ultrasonic deicing system, the ultrasonic damping ratio is required. The ultrasonic damping ratio of a representative system excited at the first ultrasonic mode (~28.5 kHz) is measured to be 0.1885%. The FEMs predictions are validated by correlating experimental electro-mechanical impedance measurements. The discrepancy between the FEM predictions and experiments is determined to be 0.7% for the ultrasonic resonant frequency, 8% for the impedance and 5% for the out-of-plane velocities at this mode. The FEM tools are then utilized to guide the design of an optimized bondline between the PZT actuators and the host structure forming the ultrasonic deicing system. The optimized bondline provides the maximum ice interfacial transverse shear stresses and prevents debonding failures of the system. Details on the optimized system fabrication and integration are provided. The optimized bondline configuration is experimentally validated to increase the ice interface transverse shear stresses by 15% with respect to prior bondline approaches. To predict ice shedding due to excitation of an ultrasonic deicing system, an ultrasonic deicing rotor ice shedding prediction model is developed. The model couples a commercially available FEM with post processors to predict the ice shedding locations. The centrifugal, ice adhesion and cohesive forces are accounted for in the prediction of the shedding\niv\nlocations. The model is initially used to determine the critical ice adhesion area required to achieve ice shedding. If the critical ice adhesion area is reached, ice shedding is promoted. Based on a theoretical study for a generic rotor setup, (1.42 radius rotor, 400 RPM, 6.35 mm thick x 30.48 cm ice shape at the rotor tip) the critical ice adhesion area is determined to be 9%. To achieve the critical ice adhesion area, a multi-frequency excitation is suggested to distribute ice interfacial transverse shear stresses to avoid areas of ice bridging (local ice adhesion). The novel bondline approach is implemented to a rotor blade leading edge erosion cap representative structure (0.813 mm thick stainless steel leading edge). The test specimen is tested under impact icing and centrifugal environments (390 gs). The system is evaluated with a comprehensive set of rotational impact icing experiments within the FAR Part 25/29 Appendix C icing envelopes. Ice shedding was promoted for test cases throughout the icing envelope. The requirement for multi-frequency control is experimentally validated by promoting ice shedding when the critical ice adhesion area is met. For a single excitation frequency (no multi-frequency) with the same icing conditions and actuation input power, ice shedding was not promoted. The load power consumption of the deicing system is quantified to an average of 0.63 W/cm2. The deicing system is able to promote shedding of ice layers ranging from 1.4 to 7.1 mm in thickness for varying icing conditions within FAR Part 25/29 Appendix: C icing envelopes. During rotor impact icing tests, actuator fracture and debonding are not observed. Ice shedding experimental test cases are compared to the ultrasonic deicing shedding model with 2.3% and 4.5% error.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7333], "author_name_tesi": "Overmeyer, Austin David", "last_name_ssi": "Overmeyer", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Austin", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Palacios", "Edward Smith", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Palacios, Thesis Advisor", "Edward Smith, Thesis Advisor", "George A Lesieutre, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["deicing", "de-icing", "icing", "ultrasonic", "electro-thermal", "low power", "ice protection", "helicopter", "rotor blades"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Lyrical Strategies: The Poetics of the Twentieth-century American Novel", "id": "16859", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8361", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project takes a comparative approach to genre by examining twentieth-century American novels in relation to the lyric, rather than the narrative, tradition.

VA deficiency can lead to premature birth, low-birth weight, and incomplete development of organs, such as the lungs, resulting in respiratory complication.  Therefore it is speculated that retinol used to generate the biologically active metabolite, retinoic acid (RA), is needed to support the differentiation of rapidly growing tissues such as the lungs. The physiological requirement of neonates for VA is unknown.  Previously we have shown retinol combined with RA (VARA) is able to increase retinyl ester (RE) formation and cellular uptake of VA in lungs, increase the total time that VA resides in VA storage organs (lung, liver, kidney, and intestine), and increase the distribution of VA into various tissues, including the lung.  However, these findings, although beneficial, do not provide a comprehensive view of VA metabolism during ontogeny from birth to adult age.  In this thesis research, I hypothesized that incremental supplementation of VARA will alter the ontogenic expression patterns of retinoid homeostatic genes responsible for retinol trafficking, metabolism, and catabolism; alter the expression of proliferative genes essential for proper lung septation and maturation; and attenuate bleomycin-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) lung injury in neonatal rats.  \n\nIn the present project, several studies were carried out to 1) investigate ontogenic expression pattern of retinoid homeostatic genes from birth to adult age in VA storage organs: lung, liver, and kidney; 2) investigate how the expression pattern of retinoid homeostatic genes are altered after VARA supplementation; 3) determine if there are long-term effects of neonatal VARA supplementation on the tissues of adults; 4) explore effects of VARA supplementation on proliferative gene expression in postnatal lungs; and 5) examine therapeutic properties of VARA in treatment of lung injury resembling BPD in neonatal rats.  The results our studies have shown that expression of retinoid homeostatic genes during ontogeny as well as retinol concentration in the liver, lung, kidney, and plasma remain constant in neonates. In addition, VARA supplementation, significantly increased expression of retinoid homeostatic genes responsible for cellular uptake and storage of retinol, and terminal oxidation of RA in neonates, as well as adults. At the same time, VARA had a long-term effect on expression of these genes and total retinol concentration in liver of adult rats. Although VA is known to be important for secondary septation, our results determined that VARA supplementation did not alter expression of proliferative genes in lungs during the time of secondary septation and alveolarization in neonates. However, VARA remarkably increased plasma retinol concentrations, attenuated immune cell infiltration and hemorrhaging in lung tissues, as well as reversed early signs of fibrosis, promoted cellular proliferation, and restored secondary septation in the presence of neonatal lung injury.  \n\nOverall, our studies have shown potential benefits of VARA, in comparison to VA alone as studied previously. Our findings provided insights on 1) VA metabolism in neonates and long term effect of VA supplementation; 2) the effects of neonatal VA supplementation on proper lung development; and 3) VARA supplementation as a potential mode of therapy for BPD, or similar chronic lung diseases in preterm/term infants.  By determining effects of VA-marginal nutritional status and VA supplementation and VARA administration during neonatal development, we will better understand neonatal retinol physiology and VA nutritional requirements. Potentially, the translation of these results will improve neonatal intensive care. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11497], "author_name_tesi": "Owusu, Sarah A", "last_name_ssi": "Owusu", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Douglas Cavener", "Michael Thomas Green"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["A Catharine Ross, Dissertation Advisor", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Michael Thomas Green, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vitamin A", "Retinoic Acid", "Neonate", "Lung", "Ontogeny", "VARA", "Supplementation", "Liver", "Kidney"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A time-resolved synchrotron X-ray diffraction study of the in situ, hydrothermal synthesis of goethite from 2-line ferrihydrite", "id": "27324", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11942", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The hydrothermal transformation of 2-line ferrihydrite to goethite at pH 13.6 was studied at 80, 90, and 100 \u00b0C using time-resolved, angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Lab.  We found that these in situ experiments could be successfully performed by injecting freshly made ferrihydrite gels into polyimide capillaries that were then sealed with fast curing epoxy.  The integrity of these reaction cells held steady when heated to 100 \u00b0C for up to 6 hr, and the low background scattering from the polyimide allowed for an extremely high sensitivity for the detection of weak X-ray diffraction peaks from the first goethite nanocrystals to nucleate. \nRietveld analysis of the time-resolved series of X-ray diffraction patterns as goethite crystallized enabled a high-resolution extraction of crystallographic and kinetic data.  Particle sizes for goethite increased with time at similar rates for all three temperatures, from particle diameters of \u2248135 \u00c5 for the first crystals detected to \u2248290 \u00c5 after 6 hr.  With increasing particle size, unit-cell volume decreased, primarily as a result of a contraction along the c-axis, the direction of closest-packing (S.G. Pnma).

Both approaches yielded excellent fits to the data (R2 > 0.95), but the calculated activation energies using the JMAK and linear models were 72.74 and 100.1 kJ/mol, respectively.

Biodiesel continues to grow as a sound substitute for petro-diesel, and it can used either as 100 percent biodiesel or a blend of biodiesel and diesel, without major modifications to the diesel engine. Biodiesel is made by reacting vegetable oil and alcohol, in the presence of a catalyst to produce fatty acid alkyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerol. As research continues, special attention has been paid to improve the biodiesel production process, whether in the improvement of the feedstocks, catalysts, or reaction conditions. \nThe conventional method of producing biodiesel utilizes homogenous catalysts which require the use of water to wash away the catalysts at the end of the reaction, leading to the generation of wastewater. Since biodiesel is considered an environmentally friendly alternative to petro-diesel, it is important to minimize the generation of wastewater as much as possible. One way to reduce the amount of wastewater that is generated is by the use of heterogeneous catalysts rather than homogenous catalysts. Heterogeneous catalysts can potentially eliminate the need of the water-washing step associated with the conventional method of making biodiesel. \nThe objective of this work was to produce biodiesel using activated carbon-supported sodium hydroxide as the heterogeneous catalyst without water-wash. The goal was achieved, as biodiesel was produced. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy was used to identify the biodiesel sample that was produced. The biodiesel conversion was 99.3%, however the quality of the biodiesel was an issue. The kinematic viscosity was 4.45, which is within ASTM standards, but the free and bound glycerin in the product exceeded the standard amount allowed. The bound glycerin was attributed to the incomplete conversion of the triglyceride molecule. The water content in the sample also exceeded the acceptable amount. The ASTM standard for water content is 500ppm but the product contained 888ppm.  Therefore, even though the catalyst used shows promise as effective in the goal of eliminating water-wash, an optimization of the process is needed in order to produce biodiesel that meets standards. Conditions such as temperature, catalyst amount, and methanol amount, which can affect the conversion and quality of the product, need to be optimized. \n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7061], "author_name_tesi": "Oyetayo, Olaide M", "last_name_ssi": "Oyetayo", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Olaide", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Joseph Manuel Perez Sr.", "Yaw Yeboah"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor", "Joseph Manuel Perez Sr., Thesis Advisor", "Yaw Yeboah, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Biodiesel", "Transesterification", "Heterogeneous Catalyst"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Implementation of Statistical and Forecasting Techniques in the Assessment of Safety Intervention Effectiveness and Optimization of Resource Allocation \n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9768", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5493", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Most engineering processes involving human and technical sub-systems are designed to achieve a set of objectives. In health and safety, the need to quantify these processes using statistical models cannot be over emphasized, since the high incident rates and ineffective allocation of resources could be costly to several organizations. The objective of this research is to use statistical and forecasting tools to develop an effective resource allocation program, based on the need to reduce incident rates and safety intervention costs. Five main safety intervention factors (Factor A: Leadership and Accountability; Factor B: Qualification Selection and Pre-Job; Factor C: Employee Engagement and Planning; Factor D: Work in Progress; Factor E: Evaluation, Measurement and Verification) were highlighted and investigated to show their effects on incident rate performance. A safety intervention factor is a group of safety and health activities which are implemented in order to reduce incident rates. Analysis of variance test showed that four safety factors (A, C, D, and E) were significant. Factor B was not selected for model development, since it was not significant.  A safety model was developed to assist practitioners in making resource allocation decisions, and to better predict incident rates. Statistical techniques such as response surface designs and contour plots were used to determine the resource allocation method. The developed safety model recommended the allocation of 16.66% of the available resources to the significant safety intervention activities in order to achieve the desirable incident rate, and 10.34% of the available resources to achieve the lowest acceptable incident rate.  The developed safety model was validated using the comparison between the actual incident rates in a one-year period and the predicted incident rates that was obtained using the double exponential smoothing technique (Holt\u2019s Model). Comparison of the actual and predicted incident rates indicated a forecast accuracy of 71.58%. The analysis of the forecasting error showed an unbiased forecast with a tracking signal of -4.08. This dissertation offers a new dimension into the practice of safety intervention evaluation. For the first time, this research contributes to the body of knowledge through the use of response surface design methodology and contour plots in the determination of an effective method for the allocation of resources, with the aim of reducing incident rates.

Due to the mobile nature of the nodes, connectivity between the nodes is not fixed and routing is an important problem for these types of networks and more complex compared to their counterpart in wired networks. Multipath routing is a concept in which more than one path is used to transfer packets of data between source-destination pairs. Multiple paths can be used either as alternate (backup) paths in case of failures or simultaneously by splitting the traffic over multiple paths to balance the network load. The main goal of this research is to develop a solution methodology to the routing and scheduling problems in MANETs via distributed algorithms to select traffic flow to be transmitted and the type of routing --unipath or multipath-- to be  used at each decision point.  In this work, multipath routing in MANETs is analyzed, and the decisions for selecting the paths to be used among the available paths and determining the allocations to different paths are made. A centralized routing and scheduling problem has been formulated and sample cases have been solved using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) to help propose a heuristic for the distributed problem. A node-independent multipath routing (NIMR) algorithm which allows decision making at intermediate nodes is proposed. The node-independent multipath routing algorithm is compared with a path delay based source-based unipath (SBU) routing algorithm. The NIMR algorithm performs up to 7.12% better than the SBU routing algorithm on the average. However, the spread of the data shows that the SBU routing algorithm still performs better than the NIMR algorithm in 15% to 40% of the replications. Based on these results, a hybrid algorithm which switches between the unipath and multipath routing algorithms based on the local information of the nodes is proposed. The NIMR, SBU and hybrid algorithms are compared in terms of average packet delay via hypothesis tests. When the NIMR and hybrid algorithms are used, an improvement ratio with respect to the SBU algorithm which differs from zero statistically is obtained in most of the cases for networks with more than 15 nodes. Also, for networks with more than 20 nodes, a negative improvement ratio which differs from zero statistically is obtained when the hybrid algorithm is compared with the NIMR algorithm indicating that the NIMR algorithm performs better than the hybrid algorithm. The NIMR algorithm is also compared with five routing algorithms adapted from the literature for different size networks and mobility scenarios in terms of end-to-end delay, throughput, and overhead of the routing algorithm. In general, the NIMR algorithm performs up to 24.052% better than the unipath routing algorithms and 37.919% better than the source based multipath algorithms in terms of average packet delay.\nBased on the results of the simulation experiments, a source based unipath routing methodology based on hop count is recommended for small size networks with 8 or 10 nodes, whereas the NIMR algorithm is recommended for larger networks. The effect of four different scheduling rules on the NIMR algorithm is also analyzed. The results show that there is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant different between the scheduling rules, however, the first in first out rule is recommended since it gives lower average end-to-end delay values.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4497], "author_name_tesi": "Oz Pasaogullari, Melike ", "last_name_ssi": "Oz Pasaogullari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Melike", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Catherine Mary Harmonosky", "Sanjay B Joshi", "Natarajan Gautam", "George Kesidis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Catherine Mary Harmonosky, Committee Chair", "Sanjay B Joshi, Committee Chair", "Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member", "George Kesidis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["queue management", "traffic splitting", "mobile ad-hoc networks", "multipath routing", "wireless networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "IMPROVED CHEMISTRY MODELS FOR DSMC SIMULATIONS OF IONIZED RAREFIED HYPERSONIC FLOWS\n\n\n", "id": "7694", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6335", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes research in modeling rarefied, nonequilibrium hypersonic flows using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. \nModeling of chemical reactions and ionization processes in highly nonequilibrium flows is an important aspect in the simulation of flow fields and radiation of high-speed reentry vehicles. \nTo develop a physically accurate chemical reaction models for use in DSMC, the molecular dynamics / quasi-classical trajectory (MD/QCT) method was utilized.\nFor modeling rarefied, ionized hypersonic flows, a charge neutrality approach was followed, and an improved chemistry model involving electron collision and energy exchange mechanisms was developed. \n\nThe MD/QCT chemical reaction model was applied for the O+HCl -> OH+Cl reaction, which is an important exchange reaction in atmospheric-side jet interaction flows. \nIt was found that the MD/QCT model using a recent state-of-the-art potential energy surface predicted good agreement with the total collision energy model because this reaction is a low enthalpy reaction and does not show strong favoring of internal modes. \nFor strong favoring reactions, one should verify both reaction and collision cross sections using the MD/QCT method if an accurate potential energy surface is available. \n\nIonized hypersonic flows for the Stardust blunt body were simulated in DSMC between 68.9 and 100 km altitudes for a free stream velocity higher than 10 km/s. \nThe flow modeling included ionization processes and energy exchange assuming that charge neutrality exists in the bow-shock region. \nAccurate modeling of electron scattering collision processes and electron-vibration energy exchange using Lee's relaxation time for the first time in DSMC is presented and was found to significantly influence the vibrational and electron temperatures. \nFor further analysis, the DSMC Stardust simulations were compared with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) results at 68.9 and 80 km altitudes. \nBreakdown effects were investigated, and influences of shock stand-off distance and temperature profiles were observed. \nRadiation was calculated using the Nonequilibrium Air Radiation code, and it was found that the new DSMC chemistry and excitation models significantly affected the N and O radiation in the ultraviolet range. \nPreliminary results show that CFD predicts one order of magnitude higher radiation than DSMC overall. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6335], "author_name_tesi": "Ozawa, Takashi ", "last_name_ssi": "Ozawa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Takashi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah A Levin", "Robert Graham Melton", "Michael Matthew Micci", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "James Bernhard Anderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah A Levin, Committee Chair", "Robert Graham Melton, Committee Member", "Michael Matthew Micci, Committee Member", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MD", "QCT", "Stardust", "Ionization", "Rarefied gas", "DSMC", "Hypersonic flows"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "VANADIUM-TRANSITION METAL OXIDE ALLOY THIN FILMS FOR MICROBOLOMETER APPLICATIONS\n\n\n", "id": "12178", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "527", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, transition metal oxides were added in vanadium oxide films for microbolometer applications by co-sputtering.

Development of new acoustofluidic technologies has significantly contributed to the fields of biotechnology and nanotechnology in which gentle handling of single cells or precise manipulation of nanoscale samples such as nanowires are useful.  Acoustic tweezer technology is a new method of manipulation of cells and small organisms. In addition to acoustic based translational manipulation, controlled and precise rotational manipulation of single cells or small model organisms such as Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) can facilitate visualization and screening of normal and abnormal cell and sub-cellular morphology, contributing to our understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying human diseases. In this dissertation, I describe a novel on-chip manipulation method to rotate microparticles, cells and organisms in a controlled manner. To achieve this, I developed two different methods based on oscillating microbubbles and oscillating solid structures. For the first approach, I trapped air bubbles within predefined sidewall microcavities inside a microchannel. The trapped air bubbles were driven into oscillatory motion by an application of a low power biocompatible acoustic field. The oscillatory motion produced steady microvortices in the surrounding liquid. Depending on excitation of various modes of the bubble, effective in or out-of-plane vortex was generated, allowing rotation of objects of various shapes. Colloids, HeLa cells and C. elegans were precisely rotated using our method. For the second rotational manipulation approach, I utilize the acoustofluidic streaming vortices generated via oscillating solid structures inside microchannels. Finally, I have demonstrated the capability of our method by analyzing the reproductive system pathologies and nervous system morphology in C. elegans. Using our device, we revealed the defective vulva morphology due to abnormal cell migration in the mutant worms. ARM is an easy-to-use, compact, cheap and biocompatible method, permitting rotation regardless of optical, magnetic or the electrical properties of the sample under investigation. \nMicrofluidics has been sprouting numerous applications including chemical synthesis, biological sample preparation, point-of-care diagnostics and enzymatic reactions. Microfluidic platforms offer many advantages for these applications such as small reagent volume, rapid and high resolution analysis, and low-cost fabrication. On the other hand, realizing on-chip fast mixing of viscous samples is very challenging due to the laminar flow nature of the liquids in confined channels. In this dissertation, a new acoustofluidic method of on-chip high viscosity fluid mixing is presented. This acoustofluidic method takes advantage of the acoustic streaming and jetting flows created by the acoustically generated bubbles inside polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels. During the deep reactive ion etching process, the sidewall of a silicon mold features rough wavy structures, which can be transferred onto a PDMS microchannel through the soft lithography technique. I utilized the wavy structures of PDMS microchannel sidewalls to initiate and cavitate bubbles in the presence of acoustic waves. Through bubble cavitation, this acoustofluidic approach demonstrates fast, effective mixing in microfluidics. I characterized its performance by using viscous fluids such as polyethyleneglycol (PEG). When two PEG solutions with a resultant viscosity 54.9 times higher than that of water were used, the mixing efficiency was found to be 0.92, indicating excellent, homogenous mixing. The acoustofluidic micromixer presented here has the advantages of simple fabrication, easy integration, and capability to mix high-viscosity fluids (Reynolds number: ~0.01) in less than 100 milliseconds.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12004], "author_name_tesi": "Ozcelik, Adem  ", "last_name_ssi": "Ozcelik", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Adem ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tony Jun Huang", "Tony Jun Huang", "Bernhard R.

Auxiliary lift and thrust components have been suggested to improve performance of the helicopter substantially by reducing the loading on the main rotor. Such a configuration is called the compound rotorcraft. Rotor speed can also be varied to improve helicopter performance. In addition to improved performance, compound rotorcraft and variable RPM can provide a much larger degree of control redundancy. This additional redundancy gives the opportunity to further enhance performance and handling qualities.\nA flight control system is designed to perform in-flight optimization of redundant control effectors on a compound rotorcraft in order to minimize power required and extend range. This \u201cFly to Optimal\u201d (FTO) control law is tested in simulation using the GENHEL model. A model of the UH-60, a compound version of the UH-60A with lifting wing and vectored thrust ducted propeller (VTDP), and a generic compound version of the UH-60A with lifting wing and propeller were developed and tested in simulation. A model following dynamic inversion controller is implemented for inner loop control of roll, pitch, yaw, heave, and rotor RPM. An outer loop controller regulates airspeed and flight path during optimization.\nA Golden Section search method was used to find optimal rotor RPM on a conventional helicopter, where the single redundant control effector is rotor RPM. The FTO builds off of the Adaptive Performance Optimization (APO) method of Gilyard by performing low frequency sweeps on a redundant control for a fixed wing aircraft. A method based on the APO method was used to optimize trim on a compound rotorcraft with several redundant control effectors. The controller can be used to optimize rotor RPM and compound control effectors through flight test or simulations in order to establish a schedule. The method has been expanded to search a two-dimensional control space. Simulation results demonstrate the ability to maximize range by optimizing stabilator deflection and an airspeed set point. Another set of results minimize power required in high speed flight by optimizing collective pitch and stabilator deflection. Results show that the control laws effectively hold the flight condition while the FTO method is effective at improving performance. Optimizations show there can be issues when the control laws regulating altitude push the collective control towards it limits. So a modification was made to the control law to regulate airspeed and altitude using propeller pitch and angle of attack while the collective is held fixed or used as an optimization variable. A dynamic trim limit avoidance algorithm is applied to avoid control saturation in other axes during optimization maneuvers.\nRange and power optimization FTO simulations are compared with comprehensive sweeps of trim solutions and FTO optimization shown to be effective and reliable in reaching an optimal when optimizing up to two redundant controls. Use of redundant controls is shown to be beneficial for improving performance.\nThe search method takes almost 25 minutes of simulated flight for optimization to be complete. The optimization maneuver itself can sometimes drive the power required to high values, so a power limit is imposed to restrict the search to avoid conditions where power is more than5% higher than that of the initial trim state. With this modification, the time the optimization maneuver takes to complete is reduced down to 21 minutes without any significant change in the optimal power value.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9208], "author_name_tesi": "Ozdemir, Gurbuz Taha", "last_name_ssi": "Ozdemir", "middle_name_ssi": "Taha", "first_name_ssi": "Gurbuz", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Francis Horn", "Joseph Francis Horn", "Edward C Smith", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Christopher Rahn", "Farhan Gandhi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Francis Horn, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Francis Horn, Committee Chair", "Edward C Smith, Committee Member", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Farhan Gandhi, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rotorcraft", "Redundant Controls", "Optimization", "Compound Helicopter", "Flight Dynamics and Control", "Performance"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Synthetic Well Log Generation for Complex Well Architectures Using Artificial Intelligence Based Tools\n", "id": "26447", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11719", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The need for energy has been increasing in the world.

This PhD work presents the development and implementation of a multidimensional boron transport model with modified Godunov scheme within a thermal-hydraulic code based on a subchannel approach. The cross flow mechanism in a multiple-subchannel rod bundle geometry, heat transfer and lateral pressure drop effects are considered to simulate deboration and boration case studies accurately.\n\nThe Reactor Dynamics and Fuel Management Group (RDFMG) version of the COBRA-TF (CTF) code was chosen for the implementation of three different boron tracking models: First Order Accurate Upwind Difference Scheme, Second Order Accurate Godunov Scheme, and Modified Godunov Scheme. Based on the applied analytical and nodal sensitivity studies, the Modified Godunov Scheme approach with a physical diffusion term was determined to provide the most accurate and best estimate solution. As a part of the verification and validation activities, a code-to-code comparison was carried out with the STAR-CD Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code and presented here. The objective of this study was two-fold: 1) to verify the accuracy of the newly implemented improvements of the CTF boron tracking model against CFD calculations; and 2) to investigate its numerical advantages as compared to other thermal-hydraulics codes.

During their travel in hydrodynamic flow, tumor cells need to adhere in order to prevent from anoikis and spread through distant organs. On the other hand, tumor cells do not have appropriate receptors to adhere to the endothelium by themselves. They need to anchor themselves through different mediators such as the components of host immune system which are capable of travelling freely in the body. For this reason PMNs are known to be the best candidates for metastatic tumor cells. PMNs are immune cells which have the capability to adhere to endothelium via specific Selectins and Integrins.

The hypothesis driven deterministic approach and hypothesis deriving systematic approaches both seek mechanistic and realistic models to existing phenomenon. In this study, we combined both a deterministic model of mechanosensing of scaffold topography through RhoA/ROCK signaling and a systematic approach using siRNA mediated gene knowdown to determine the all possible kinase and phosphatases that take action in osteoinduction. We showed for the first time that osteoblasts differentiate on fibrous scaffolds in a MyosinIIa driven mechanism and siRNA screening based systematic experiments confirmed the MyosinIIa driven osteoinduction mechanism. While developing a framework for the solution, we not only developed new experimental platforms to study high-throughput interactions leading to osteogenesis, but also constructed a fundamental model aimed toward formalizing the topography sensing mechanisms leading to osteogenesis on fibrous bone tissue engineering scaffolds.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8894], "author_name_tesi": "Ozdemir, Tugba ", "last_name_ssi": "Ozdemir", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tugba", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Justin Lee Brown", "Justin Lee Brown", "William O Hancock", "Peter J Butler", "Melik C Demirel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Justin Lee Brown, Dissertation Advisor", "Justin Lee Brown, Committee Chair", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Melik C Demirel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bone Tissue Engineering", "PMMA", "microtopography sensing"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Development of Burnup Dependent Fuel Rod Model in Cobra-tf", "id": "23539", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10676", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this research was to develop a burnup dependent fuel thermal conductivity model within Pennsylvania State University, Reactor Dynamics and Fuel Management Group (RDFMG) version of the subchannel thermal-hydraulics code COBRA-TF (CTF). The model takes into account first, the degradation of fuel thermal conductivity with high burnup; and second, the fuel thermal conductivity dependence on the Gadolinium content for both UO2 and MOX fuel rods. The modified Nuclear Fuel Industries (NFI) model for UO2 fuel rods and Duriez/Modified NFI Model for MOX fuel rods were incorporated into CTF and fuel centerline predictions were compared against Halden experimental test data and FRAPCON-3.4 predictions to validate the burnup dependent fuel thermal conductivity model in CTF. Experimental test cases from Halden reactor fuel rods for UO2 fuel rods at Beginning of Life (BOL), through lifetime without Gd2O3 and through lifetime with Gd2O3 and a MOX fuel rod were simulated with CTF. Since test fuel rod and FRAPCON-3.4 results were based on single rod measurements, CTF was run for a single fuel rod surrounded with a single channel configuration. Input decks for CTF were developed for one fuel rod located at the center of a subchannel (rod-centered subchannel approach). Fuel centerline temperatures predicted by CTF were compared against the measurements from Halden experimental test data and the predictions from FRAPCON-3.4. \n\tAfter implementing the new fuel thermal conductivity model in CTF and validating the model with experimental data, CTF model was applied to steady state and transient calculations. 4x4 PWR fuel bundle configuration from Purdue MOX benchmark was used to apply the new model for steady state and transient calculations. First, one of each high burnup UO2 and MOX fuel rods from 4x4 matrix were selected to carry out single fuel rod calculations and fuel centerline temperatures predicted by CTF/TORT-TD were compared against CTF /TORT-TD /FRAPTRAN predictions. After confirming that the new fuel thermal conductivity model in CTF worked and provided consistent results with FRAPTRAN predictions for a single fuel rod configuration, the same type of analysis was carried out for a bigger system which is the 4x4 PWR bundle consisting of 15 fuel pins and one control guide tube. Steady- state calculations at Hot Full Power (HFP) conditions for control guide tube out (unrodded) were performed using the 4x4 PWR array with CTF/TORT-TD coupled code system. Fuel centerline, surface and average temperatures predicted by CTF/TORT-TD with and without the new fuel thermal conductivity model were compared against CTF/TORT-TD/FRAPTRAN predictions to demonstrate the improvement in fuel centerline predictions when new model was used. In addition to that constant and CTF dynamic gap conductance model were used with the new thermal conductivity model to show the performance of the CTF dynamic gap conductance model and its impact on fuel centerline and surface temperatures. \n \tFinally, a Rod Ejection Accident (REA) scenario using the same 4x4 PWR array was run both at Hot Zero Power (HZP) and Hot Full Power (HFP) condition, starting at a position where half of the control rod is inserted. This scenario was run using CTF/TORT-TD coupled code system with and without the new fuel thermal conductivity model. The purpose of this transient analysis was to show the impact of thermal conductivity degradation (TCD) on feedback effects, specifically Doppler Reactivity Coefficient (DRC) and, eventually, total core reactivity. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10307], "author_name_tesi": "Ozdemir Yilmaz, Mine ", "last_name_ssi": "Ozdemir Yilmaz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Turgay Ertekin", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Jens G Munthe Andersen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova, Dissertation Advisor", "Maria Nikolova Avramova, Committee Chair", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Member", "Jens G Munthe Andersen, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["COBRA-TF", "CTF", "FRAPCON", "FRAPTRAN", "subchannel", "fuel performance", "thermal conductivity degradation", "TCD", "REA", "Halden", "fuel centerline temperature", "MATPRO"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL ANALYSIS OF REDUCTION IN FOULING BY LOW ENERGY SURFACES\n\n\n", "id": "8994", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2242", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Pasteurization is essential to ensure the microbial safety and to increase the shelf life of food products such as dairy products and fruit juices. Thermal instability of fluid milk, focus of this research, causes formation of solid fouling deposits, as a result of specific reactions of milk components, on the contact surfaces of the heat transfer equipment resulting in: (1) reduction of heat transfer coefficient, (2) increase in pressure drop, (3) higher risk for microbial growth, and (4) adverse effect on product quality. Due to economic, microbial safety and quality concerns, and environmental problems caused by fouling of heat exchangers, mitigating fouling during the operation is desirable. Fouling is also a widely pervasive issue in several other industries such as automotive, aerospace, chemical, petroleum, and waste water treatment. Therefore, the breadth of industries affected by fouling, served as the motivation of this research.  \nAccordingly, the goal of this work was to develop a computational model which estimates the amount and rate of fouling on the contact surfaces of heat transfer equipment under various operating conditions. Towards this purpose, first a bench-scale test set-up that sufficiently represented the thermo-hydraulic behavior in industrial plate heat exchangers was designed and fabricated. Next, stainless steel SS316 (control) and four coated surfaces Microlube/PTFE, TM117P, AMC148, and CNT were tested to evaluate their fouling behavior. In the computational model, the same test set-up was modeled with FLUENT to obtain the temperature profile in the flow channel of the bench scale tester.  The calculated temperature profiles formed the basis for determining the change in thermal performance of the system with time due to fouling. Then with this data, the deposit amount on the test surface was calculated based on the effect of additional conductive heat transfer resistance caused by foulants deposits on the surface. Finally, the effect of surface characteristic, particularly the contact angle, of the test surfaces, on the rate and amount of foulants deposits were determined by introducing a semi-empirical correlation.\nFouling behavior on the test surfaces was analyzed experimentally and computationally for four different test conditions; two different milk flow rates, 3 g/s and 10 g/s, and two different inlet milk temperatures, 40&#61616;C and 60&#61616;C. Experimental results showed that there was up to 50% less deposit formation when the inlet milk temperature was 60&#61616;C compared to when it was 40&#61616;C. Results did not provide any definitive trend of deposit amount as a function of flow rate.\n A relationship between the contact angle of a liquid on a solid surface that is a major indicator of fouling tendency of the surface, and fouling amount for the test surfaces was found based on experimental results. When the contact angle of the liquid on the solid surface is large, the wettability of the surface is less and thus the surface is less prone to fouling. In the case of AMC148 and CNT coated surfaces, which have relatively higher contact angles (145&#61616; and 180&#61616;, respectively) compared to the contact angle of the SS316 control surface (72&#61616;), the fouling amount was reduced approximately by 90%. Whereas, Teflon&#61650; based coated surfaces, Microlube/PTFE and TM117P (contact angles are 107&#61616; and 112&#61616;, respectively) did not reduce the fouling amount as much as AMC148 and CNT coated surfaces; that is only 20 to 70% depending on the operating conditions.  The subpar performance of Teflon\u00ae based surfaces was attributed to insufficient improvement of the wettability of these surfaces.\nThe results of the computational model for each test case indicate that there is a good agreement with the measurements for control and Teflon&#61650; based coated surfaces; the average percent difference between the measured and calculated deposit amount for four test conditions was from 11.1% to 24.5%. In contrast, the average percent differences are the largest for the surfaces that are least prone to fouling (AMC148 and CNT, -57.1% and -68.2%, respectively). In other words, for the surfaces that have relatively higher contact angles the calculated and experimental fouling amount differ more.  This is most likely due to the insufficiency of the semi-empirical correlation between the contact angle and deposit amount that was obtained by using limited number of test surfaces. \nIn this study, a computational model was proposed and validated to estimate the amount of foulants deposits that can be used to improve the thermal performance of the heat exchangers. The results of this study for bench scale tester show that the proposed computational model can be used to predict the fouling amount on any surface with known contact angle at different operating conditions with less experimental work. Furthermore, for the milk industry AMC148 coated surface is recommended for further investigation since it gave the most promising results in fouling mitigation. The same methodology can be extended to other industries where fouling is a major problem.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2223], "author_name_tesi": "Ozden, Hatice Ozlem", "last_name_ssi": "Ozden", "middle_name_ssi": "Ozlem", "first_name_ssi": "Hatice", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Virendra Puri", "Virendra Puri", "Ali Demirci", "Jogender Singh", "Savas Yavuzkurt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Virendra Puri, Dissertation Advisor", "Virendra Puri, Committee Chair", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member", "Jogender Singh, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["protein denaturation", "Fouling", "contact angle", "FLUENT", "plate heat exchanger", "beta lactoglobulin", "milk pasteurization", "wettability"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF INSTANTANEOUS SHUT-IN PRESSURE IN SHALE OIL AND GAS RESERVOIRS", "id": "14379ajo5260", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14379", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "               Over the past six decades, hydraulic fracturing stimulations have been used to boost hydrocarbon production from shale oil and gas formations. Thus, the development of hydraulic fracturing treatment methods to improve production has attracted attention.

Since these changes impact on hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation, alterations in pressure are one of the pertinent factors in shale reservoirs.

The effects of closure time in different permeability values, the comparison of pressure difference in different total wellbore volume, changes in pore pressure and temperature have indicated that instantaneous shut-in pressure is not equal to minimum-in situ stress.

One of the critical research topics along this direction is to design an application-specific, customized, software-managed on-chip memory hierarchy for a chip multiprocessor. Another important issue is to optimize the application code and data for such a customized on-chip memory hierarchy. This thesis proposes solutions to the problem of memory hierarchy design and data access management. First, an integer linear programming (ILP) based solution to the combined problem of memory hierarchy design and data allocation in the context of embedded chip multiprocessors is\ngiven. The proposed solution uses compiler analysis to extract data access patterns of parallel processors and employs integer linear programming for determining the optimal on-chip memory partitioning across processors and data allocations across memory components. Second, we present and evaluate a compiler-driven approach to data compression for reducing memory space occupancy. Our goal is to study how automated compiler support can help in deciding the set of data elements to compress/decompress and the points during execution at which these compressions/decompressions should be performed. The proposed compiler support achieves this by analyzing the source code of the application\nto be optimized and identifying the order in which the different data blocks are accessed.\nBased on this analysis, the compiler then inserts compression/decompression calls in the\napplication code. The compression calls target the data blocks that are not expected to be used in the near future, whereas the decompression calls target those data blocks with expected reuse but currently in compressed form. Third, we present a constraint network based formulation of the integrated loop-data optimization problem to improve locality of data accesses for a given application code. We present two alternate solutions to the data locality problem with our constraint network based formulation and discuss the pros and cons of each scheme. The first solution is a pure backtracking based one, whereas the second one improves upon the first one by employing three additional optimizations, including backjumping. Fourth, we extend our constraint network based approach to code parallelization for chip multiprocessors. Fifth, we explore how processor cores and storage blocks can be placed in a 3D architecture to minimize data access costs under temperature. This process (topology exploration) has been implemented using integer linear programming. Finally, we present a Scratch Pad Memory space management technique for chip multiprocessors. We focus on the management of a scratch pad space shared by multiple applications executing at the same time that can potentially share data. The proposed approach has three major components; a compiler analysis phase, a runtime space partitioner, and a local partitioning phase. This thesis also presents experimental evidence, demonstrating the success of each of the proposed techniques, and compares our results with those obtained through previously-proposed approaches.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4805], "author_name_tesi": "Ozturk, Ozcan ", "last_name_ssi": "Ozturk", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ozcan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Yuan Xie", "Aylin Yener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Yuan Xie, Committee Member", "Aylin Yener, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["memory", "compiler", "management", "chip", "multiprocessor", "computer", "hierarchy", "design"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "CLAIMING GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR DISTANT SUFFERING IN MEDIA DISCOURSE: BOSNIA AND KOSOVO", "id": "8078", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1301", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores the formation of global responsibility discourses used in promoting NATO\u2019s military interventions in other sovereignties in the post-Cold War era in the mainstream US media. The study utilizes discourse analysis to examine the construction and articulation of global responsibility discourses surrounding the Bosnian War (1992-1995) and the Kosovo conflict (1998-1999). I approach the concept of global responsibility involving military interventions as one that can be assembled from the associated discourse. Accordingly, I have identified three major ways to discuss the global responsibility of \u201cwhat we ought to do\u201d at the national and global level: humanitarian responsibility, regional security responsibility, and the critiques of these two responsibilities.\n\nThe case study of global responsibility discourses surrounding the Bosnian War and the Kosovo Conflict in the mainstream US media and their intertextuality offers an account of the roles of the US media in foreign policy concerning military intervention in the post-Cold War era. The construction and articulation of global responsibility discourses in the mainstream US media were closely related to the US government\u2019s policy, and were formed within the framework of US national interest. The fact that the discourse on global responsibility functioned to facilitate US national interests and domestic responsibility not only means that the mainstream US media propagated the US government\u2019s policy and agenda. The cases of military intervention also imply that there were more fundamental structure and patterns by which the mainstream US media approached the \u201chumanitarian crises\u201d in the post-Cold War era: namely, the \u201cbenevolent domination\u201d and the subsequent construction of a \u201cmelodramatic national identity\u201d and war narratives.\n\nBased on the presumption that the discourse of the mainstream US media was a primary site for the public for learning and experiencing the two crises, this research maintains that global responsibility discourses functioned to provide US and global citizens with common knowledge and an experience of the hegemonic notion of \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d via mediated discourse. I argue that the construction and articulation of global responsibility discourses in the military interventions may have had dangerous ramifications for global democracy because the discourse of responsibility can potentially absorb the progressive energies created by the public\u2019s awareness of responsibility on a global scale in order to reinforce the relations of domination.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1290], "author_name_tesi": "PARK, CHONGDAE ", "last_name_ssi": "PARK", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "CHONGDAE", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ronald V Bettig", "Dennis Karl Davis", "Jeanne L Hall", "Jeremy Packer", "John Philip Christman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ronald V Bettig, Committee Chair", "Dennis Karl Davis, Committee Member", "Jeanne L Hall, Committee Member", "Jeremy Packer, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Global Responsibility", "Military Intervention", "the Bosnian War", "the Kosovo Conflict"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "BARRIERS TO ENTRY ANALYSIS OF BROADBAND MULTIPLE PLATFORMS: COMPARING THE U.S. AND SOUTH KOREA", "id": "8065", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1877", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study intends: to clarify the various economic factors that could prevent or make it difficult for new entrants based on multiple platforms (i.e., xDSL, Cable modem, wireless, BPL, and satellite) to successfully enter the residential broadband access market; to compare the U.S. and South Korea in terms of barriers to entry to identify their differences and to explain how those differences have affected the level of market competition in each country; and to discuss the implications of the barriers to entry in terms of future competition and regulatory policies in the US broadband access market.\n\tTo accomplish those objectives, both a comparative case study based upon government documents and industry data, and an executive survey and interview analysis were conducted. The findings are: theoretically, a broadband network requires substantial sunk investment, economies of scale and economies of scope. Positive post-entry profitability, entry costs, regulation and competition policy greatly influence the decision for new entry. The most important entry barriers in the residential broadband market in the U.S. are seemingly the access to the last mile, economies of scale, economies of scope and capital requirements. In South Korea, new entrants do not have much difficulty accessing the last mile by virtue of the government\u2019s new entrants-favorable competition policy such as open access and line sharing rules although the last mile operators seize substantial market power in the broadband service value chain in both countries.  In contrast, the FCC\u2019s policy directions have been oddly against reducing barriers to entry for new entrants and small businesses. As for new entrants without facilities who utilize wired options, such as xDSL and cable modems, access to the last mile and predatory pricing are the most important barriers. Still, a large portion of new entrants have entered the market utilizing ADSL since 1999 in the U.S. As for new entrants with facilities using other alternative technologies, technological barriers, such as frequency interference and congestion, and economic barriers, such as spectrum costs and capital requirements, have been critical entry barriers. \n\tAn executive survey of broadband access providers revealed that entry costs were the most important barriers among four factors, i.e., entry costs, absolute cost advantages, product differentiation and post-entry profitability. Interviewing executives produced five main themes: access to the incumbents\u2019 networks, incumbent phone companies\u2019 predatory retail pricing & overpricing access, political power of incumbents biasing the regulation and legislation, difficulty in access to capital due to regulatory uncertainty, and financial and technological limitations of alternative access technologies. Increasingly high barriers to entry to new entrants in xDSL and cable modem services are significant in the U.S. compared to those in South Korea. Even though alternative access technologies are available, new entrants with these technologies are more likely to have high entry barriers in terms of capital requirements and lack of profitability.

All the asphalt binders were aged with pressure aging vessel (PAV) prior to conducting the BBR tests. Both 240 second and 2 hour tests were conducted at three different temperatures, at the low temperature of the asphalt PG grade, 10\u00b0C higher than the lower temperature grade and at -5\u00b0C to obtain the flexural creep stiffness [S(t)] master curves.

Forest soils in much of the Northeast are becoming increasingly acidic and nutrient depleted as a result of land use and acid deposition.  Forest songbirds may be particularly sensitive to soil acidification because they require large amounts of calcium to reproduce, and acidification can deplete soil calcium and calcium-rich food sources required for reproduction.  The purpose of this research was to use an ecosystem-level approach to examine how forest songbird abundances and demographics are related to soil conditions, to understand how current conditions are affecting birds.  I investigated the relationships between forest songbirds and soils and potential mechanisms using a lime application experiment, and two observational studies at different scales.  Based on the results of these three studies, abundances of most bird species were associated with soil conditions in three main ways: (1) Several bird species were most abundant in areas with less acidic soils, a well-developed understory, and higher snail abundances.  These bird populations are likely at greatest risk from soil acidification.  (2) Several bird species, like the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), were abundant in most forests, regardless of soil conditions.  However, the Ovenbird may be calcium-limited in acidified forests because reproduction and territory size were related to soil calcium, and responded positively to the increased calcium availability resulting from liming.  (3) Several bird species were most abundant in areas with very acidic soils and high densities of mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia).  Habitat for these bird species may be increasing in PA as soils become increasingly acidic, but they may be calcium-limited because the abundances of many responded positively to liming. These complex relationships between birds and soils will likely result in different responses to further soil acidification.  Based on these results, I concluded that the reproduction, abundance and distribution of many forest songbird species have a strong relationship to soil conditions, mediated via vegetation structure and invertebrate prey availability.  I recommend that soil conditions be integrated into future forest songbird conservation and management activities.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5573], "author_name_tesi": "Pabian, Sarah Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Pabian", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham", "Margaret Brittingham Brant", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham, Dissertation Advisor", "Margaret Brittingham Brant, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer, Committee Member", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Member", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ovenbird", "acidic deposition", "snails", "calcium", "dolomitic lime", "habitat quality"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Dynamic Public Opinion and Policy Responsiveness in the American States\n", "id": "10571", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2812", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When public opinion changes, how closely do policies follow?  Central to democratic theory, the principle of popular sovereignty implies some degree of dynamic policy responsiveness: new policies should be enacted when mass opinion becomes supportive of that new policy.  But, for a successful democracy, public opinion must also be attentive to what government does; citizens have to react to policy changes otherwise there is little incentive for elected officials to respond to public opinion.  While dynamic models of policy responsiveness have been tested at the national level, much less is known about the American states.  This is an important shortcoming, particularly in light of evidence that state public opinion is directly responsible for policy differences across the fifty states.   Moreover, because states differ in their institutional and political contexts, testing models of dynamic responsiveness at the state level provides many opportunities to specify the conditions when policy responsiveness is higher or lower.\nI advance our knowledge about dynamic policy responsiveness at the sub-national level by measuring the longitudinal variation in state public opinion on different policy areas and linking these measures to various policy outputs at the state level.  Specifically, I show that multilevel regression coupled with imputation and post-stratification can be used to measure public opinion over time when augmented by a small (e.g., three year) moving average.  I use this approach to estimate yearly state public opinion on global attitudes (e.g., party identification and ideology) as well as specific attitudes (e.g., the death penalty, abortion, education spending, welfare spending, and smoking bans).  \nI then use these measures to explore the dynamic properties of state public opinion and to test models of policy responsiveness at the sub-national level.  In regard to the former, I find that the dynamic pattern of public opinion varies across issues.  For instance, preferences towards the death penalty, welfare spending, and anti-smoking legislation are dynamic with heterogeneous trends, preferences towards education spending are dynamic with homogeneous trends, and abortion attitudes are fairly stable.  \nThrough various time series analyses, I find that state opinion plays a critical role in policy changes at the sub-national level for three issue areas: education, welfare, and anti-smoking legislation.  Moreover, I provide additional evidence that the impact of public opinion on policy is causal. To give just one example, I estimate that if support for education spending increases by three percentage points, spending per classroom increases by over $500 immediately (assuming 25 students per classroom).  State opinion also plays a large role in whether a state adopts a new policy, such as a smoking ban in restaurants.  \nI also find that the causal relationship between public opinion and policy is a two-way street, although how opinion responds to policy changes depends on the issue.  For education and welfare, policy changes exhibited a negative relationship on public opinion, albeit, only in the long term.  On the other hand, attitudes towards anti-smoking legislation become more supportive as states enact additional restrictions.  These analyses suggest that state opinion responds in rational and reasonable ways to policy changes.\nThe broader impacts of the study are embodied in the original dataset that is publicly available, along with the details of the methodology used to generate and validate dynamic measures of state public opinion.  The methods of estimation can be extended to measure other preferences at the state level over time, as well as other attitudes such as tolerance, trust, efficacy or confidence which may also exhibit over time change across states.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2808], "author_name_tesi": "Pacheco, Julianna ", "last_name_ssi": "Pacheco", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Julianna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Plutzer", "Eric Plutzer", "Michael Barth Berkman", "Pamela Farley Short", "Frank Baumgartner", "Christopher Jon Zorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Plutzer, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Plutzer, Committee Chair", "Michael Barth Berkman, Committee Member", "Pamela Farley Short, Committee Member", "Frank Baumgartner, Committee Member", "Christopher Jon Zorn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["state public opinion", "dynamic policy responsiveness", "state policy making"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Noise generation mechanisms in short ducted rotors\n\n", "id": "11241", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6464", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ducted rotors are commonly used in helicopters as a tail rotor and in unmanned\nair vehicles for improved performance and safety.

First, I direct attention to the complexity of families by examining dyadic parent-youth and triadic parent-youth-sibling relationship experiences as well as characteristics of the larger family such as gender that may influence family dynamics. Second, because families are dynamic \u2013 changing over time as a result of changing circumstances and changes in families, I utilize 8-year longitudinal data to examine the development and potentially bidirectional correlates of Mexican-origin youth\u2019s time spent with mothers and fathers from adolescence into young adulthood, a largely uncharted area of study. And finally, answering the call of cultural ecological theorists to investigate the substantial variation that exists within ethnic groups, I use an ethnic homogenous design to study the correlates of parent-youth shared time within Mexican-origin families.\nStudy 1 charts the longitudinal trajectories of Mexican-origin youth\u2019s time with mothers and fathers from early adolescence to young adulthood and tests two models regarding the associations between parent-youth shared time and youth adjustment: (a) mother\u2019s and fathers\u2019 time predicts youth adjustment; and (b) youth adjustment problems predict mother-youth and father-youth shared time. Study 2 examines whether siblings\u2019 differential time with parents positively predicted relatively more parent-youth similarity relative to a sibling, and/or whether youth\u2019s relative similarity to parents predicted their spending more time with parents as compared to their sibling. This dissertation further explored whether mother-youth and father-youth associations differed as a function of youth\u2019s and siblings\u2019 gender.\nStudy 1 results demonstrated that youth\u2019s time with mothers and with fathers declined from early adolescence to young adulthood, and further, that the developmental course of parent-youth shared time varied by youth gender and gender constellation of the sibling dyad, such that fathers spent more time with sons as compared to daughters and both parents spent more time with youth in mixed-gender than those in same-gender dyads. Results also indicated that mother-youth shared time neither predicted nor was predicted by youth adjustment. Father-youth shared time did not predict later adjustment, however, youth from mixed gender sibling dyads who reported more risky behaviors spent more time with fathers at the next occasion of measurement. Study 2 results revealed that mothers\u2019 differential time with siblings was not associated with siblings\u2019 relative cultural similarity with mothers in either direction. For fathers, siblings\u2019 relative cultural similarity did not predict differential time with siblings, however, youth who spent more time with fathers compared to a sibling were more culturally similar to fathers than was their sibling at the next occasion of measurement. \nFindings highlight the need to incorporate both mothers and fathers as well as youth and sibling gender in studies of family processes. Such structure characteristics proved important, both in understanding patterns of change over time in parental involvement as well as the links between involvement and both youth adjustment and cultural similarity to parents. For instance, differences in time spent with parents as a function of gender constellation of the sibling dyad suggest that the presence of same-gender offspring may pull in both mothers and fathers to engage more with their opposite-gender offspring. Further, highlighting the dynamic nature of family systems, such findings demonstrate the importance of utilizing longitudinal data to illuminate patterns of change and directions of effect linking family processes and youth adjustment and development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15557], "author_name_tesi": "Padilla, Jenny ", "last_name_ssi": "Padilla", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jenny", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan McHale", "Susan McHale", "Peter Cm Molenaar", "Mayra Y Bamaca", "Rachel Annette Smith", "Gregory M Fosco"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan McHale, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan McHale, Committee Chair", "Peter Cm Molenaar, Committee Member", "Mayra Y Bamaca, Committee Member", "Rachel Annette Smith, Outside Member", "Gregory M Fosco, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["acculturation", "adjustment", "cuture", "Mexican", "shared time", "siblings", "adolescence", "young adulthood"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Social Mechanisms Regulating Reproductive Division of Labor in Bumble Bees (bombus impatiens)", "id": "22638", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10342", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Investigations into mechanisms regulating the reproductive division of labor in social insects can have wide implications regarding the evolution of social behavior.
