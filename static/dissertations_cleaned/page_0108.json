It has emerged as one of the most versatile forms of utility computing, where both applications and infrastructure facilities can be leased from an infinite pool of computing resources in the form of fine-grained pay-as-you-go mode of billing. Over recent years, there has been an unprecedented growth of cloud services from various key cloud providers like Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft. Some of the unique characteristics that make cloud computing so attractive and different from traditional distributed systems like data centers and grids include self-organization, elasticity, multi-tenancy, infinite resource pool availability and flexible economy of scale. \n\nWith all the promises and benefits offered by cloud computing, also comes the associated challenges. Amidst various challenges, performance and reliability related issues in clouds are very critical and form the main focus of this dissertation. Specifically, the focus of this dissertation is to address the following four specific performance and reliability concerns in clouds: (i) lack of representative cloud workloads and performance benchmarking that are essential to evaluate and assess the various characteristics of cloud systems; (ii) poor management of resources in big data cloud clusters running representative large scale data processing applications like Hadoop MapReduce. Specifically, this is due to the problems associated with the static, fixed-size, coarse-grained, and uncoordinated resource allocation in Hadoop framework; (iii) inefficient scheduling and resource management of representative workload mix of interactive and batch applications, running on hybrid data centers which consist of both native and virtual machines; and (iv) lack of end-to-end effective problem determination and diagnosis framework for virtualized cloud platforms that is quintessential to enhance the reliability of the cloud infrastructure and hosted services.\n\nTowards this pursuit, this dissertation addresses the above mentioned performance and reliability specific problems in clouds, explores the underlying motivations, proposes effective methodologies and solutions, conducts exhaustive evaluations through comprehensive experimental and empirical analyses, and lays foundations for future research directions. The first chapter of the dissertation focuses on the characterization and modeling of cloud workloads. In particular, the thrust is on the modeling and synthesis of an important workload property called task placement constraints, and demonstrates their significant performance impact on scheduling in terms of the incurred task pending delays. The second chapter describes an efficient dynamic resource management framework, called MROrchestrator, which alleviates the downsides of slot-based resource allocation in Hadoop MapReduce clusters. MROrchestrator monitors and analyzes the execution-time resource footprints of constituent map and reduce tasks, and constructs run-time performance models of tasks as a function of their resource allocations, thereby improving the performance of applications and boosting the cluster resource utilization. The third chapter proposes HybridMR, a hierarchical MapReduce scheduler for hybrid data centers. HybridMR operates in a 2-phase hierarchical fashion, where the first phase guides placement of MapReduce jobs on native or virtual machines, based on the expected virtualization overheads. The second phase manages the run-time resource allocations of interactive applications and collocated batch MapReduce jobs, with an objective to provide the best effort delivery to the MapReduce jobs, while complying with the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) of the interactive services. Finally, the fourth chapter addresses the reliability of clouds in the context of efficient problem determination and diagnosis in virtualized cloud platforms, through a novel fault management framework, called CloudPD. A 3-level hierarchical architecture is adopted by CloudPD, consisting of a light-weight event generation phase, comprehensive problem determination phase, and an expert knowledge driven problem diagnosis phase, to provide accurate and fast localization of various anomalies in clouds. \n\nOverall, the dissertation upholds the fact that performance and reliability issues  in cloud computing environment are very critical aspects, and need to be well tackled through effective novel research and methodological evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8310], "author_name_tesi": "Sharma, Bikash ", "last_name_ssi": "Sharma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bikash", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das", "Chitaranjan Das", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Qian Wang", "Joseph Hellerstein", "Raj Acharya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das, Dissertation Advisor", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Chair", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Member", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Committee Member", "Joseph Hellerstein, Special Member", "Raj Acharya, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cloud computing", "workload characterization", "scheduling", "resource management", "fault diagnosis", "virtualization", "mapreduce"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Fabrication, Characterization and Applications of Magnetic Nanowire Arrays", "id": "6763", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2116", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-07-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fe-Co-Ni ternary alloy nanowire arrays 32\u2013106 nm in diameter are fabricated within nanoporous alumina membranes using 15 Vrms alternating current electrodeposition at frequencies of 50, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 Hz. The alumina membranes, 10-15 microns thick, are synthesized by anodization of aluminum foil using a two-step technique to increase pore uniformity. The alumina membrane structure is tailored with the end aim being uniform magnetic nanowire electrodeposition. Using an electrodeposition frequency of 1000 Hz, 15 Vrms, consistently and repeatably yield nanowire arrays over membranes several cm2 in extent. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) is used to explain the effects of AC electrodeposition frequency. The impedance of the residual alumina barrier layer, separating the underlying aluminum metal and the nanoporous membrane, decreases drastically with electrodeposition frequency facilitating uniform pore-filling of samples several cm2 in area. The magnetic coercivity and hysteresis loop squareness-ratio (Mr /Ms ) were studied as functions of electrolyte composition, nanowire diameter, and nanowire aspect ratio. Anodic polarization studies on thin films having alloy compositions identical to the nanowires display excellent corrosion resistance properties.\nTwo potential applications of the nanowire arrays are investigated. Iron nanowire arrays, oriented perpendicular to the substrate, are fabricated by electrodeposition of iron in nanoporous alumina membranes, followed by precise wet etching of the alumina membrane to partially expose the nanowire array. It is shown that oxidation of standing iron nanowire arrays, at 600 \u00b0C in an oxygen ambient leads to standing a-Fe2O3 (hematite) nanowire arrays. These hematite nanowire arrays show a distinct photocurrent response and can be used as photocatalysts. Second, protein adsorption studies on standing Fe-Co-Ni nanowire arrays and flat Fe-Co-Ni thin films show that nanowire array morphology leads to attenuation of protein adsorption. Since protein adsorption is the first step in the biofouling process magnetic nanowire arrays can potentially find applications as non-biofouling surfaces. Placing magnetic nanowire arrays in a sinusoidally varying magnetic field leads to their oscillation that further reduces protein adsorption in comparison to stationary nanowire arrays.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2097], "author_name_tesi": "Sharma, Gaurav ", "last_name_ssi": "Sharma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gaurav", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig A Grimes", "Michael V Pishko", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig A Grimes, Committee Chair", "Michael V Pishko, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Manetic Nanowires", "Electrodeposition", "Nanotechnology", "Nanoporous Alumina", "Non-Biofouling", "Uniform Array", "Ternary Alloy"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Sense Of Purpose Inventory: Development, Psychometric \n\nexamination And Construct Validation\n", "id": "24764", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10900", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The focus of this dissertation is the measurement of construct purpose.  In an earlier study, my colleague and I constructed an instrument titled the Sense of Purpose Inventory (Sharma & Kang, 2013).  The aim of this dissertation was to establish the Sense of Purpose Inventory\u2019s factor structure, internal consistency reliability, construct validity, and relationship with a measure of social desirability.  Data were collected online through survey monkey.  The total number of participants was 302 undergraduate students.  Exploratory principal axis factoring with varimax rotation was utilized to explore the inventory\u2019s factor structure.  In the final analysis the three factor solution was considered most conceptually clear, empirically sound, and interpretable.  The three factors were labelled as Awareness of One\u2019s Purpose, Awakening to One\u2019s Purpose, and Desire to Contribute to Wellbeing of Others.  Following exploratory analysis, the Sense of Purpose Inventory\u2019s internal consistency was explored.  The overall inventory demonstrated adequate reliability with .93 as the alpha coefficient.  In addition, each factor of the Sense of Purpose Inventory displayed satisfactory reliability with alpha levels ranging from .73 to .92.  The construct validity of the Sense of Purpose Inventory was explored by examining the correlations between the scores from the inventory and instruments that measured related and unrelated constructs.  These results provided evidence for the inventory\u2019s construct validity.  Finally, the low correlation between Sense of Purpose Inventory and Social Desirability Scale indicated that Sense of Purpose Inventory\u2019s scores\u2019 are not associated with impression management.

Numerical electromagnetic modeling  and simulation of structures with multi-scale features is highly challenging due to the fact that electrically small as well as large features are simultaneously present in the model which demands for discretization of the computational domain such that the number of degrees of freedom is  very large, thus, levying a heavy burden on computational resources. The multi-scale nature of a given problem also exacerbates the challenge of generating very fine meshes which do not introduce instabilities or ill-conditioned behaviors.\n     In this work we introduce a hybrid technique, which combines frequency domain and time domain techniques in a manner such that the fine features (electrically small) of the object being modeled are handled by the Method of Moments (MoM) technique while the electrically large parts of the structure are dealt with by using the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) technique in order to reduce the computational burden. Recently, structures with multi-scale features have been simulated by using the dipole moment (DM) approach combined with the FDTD technique to handle fine features in a multi-scale geometry.  However, when the size of the scatterer becomes larger in terms of the wavelength and the quasi-static assumption becomes invalid, extensive modifications of the DM/FDTD hybrid approach are needed resulting in a high computational cost.\nThe research proposes a novel hybrid FDTD technique, which combines the Method of Moments and the Finite-Difference Time-Domain techniques directly in the time domain circumventing the need to carry out frequency transform calculations as required in the DM approach when the object size is not small (size>\u03bb/20). The proposed technique utilizes piecewise sinusoidal basis functions to represent the currents on arbitrarily shaped wires with fine features, and modified RWG basis function for surfaces. The fields scattered by the object with fine features in MoM region are computed in the time domain on a planar interface. The time domain fields obtained at the planar interface are then combined with the FDTD update equations. In contrast to the existing techniques used to handle this type of problems, the proposed technique is both efficient as well as stable.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15731], "author_name_tesi": "Sharma, Kapil ", "last_name_ssi": "Sharma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kapil", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raj Mittra", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Michael T Lanagan", "Dinesh Kumar Agrawal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raj Mittra, Dissertation Advisor", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Chair", "Ram Mohan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Dinesh Kumar Agrawal, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MoM", "FDTD", "DM", "RWG", "DoF", "TDIE", "EFIE", "MFIE", "CFIE", "Matrix", "RHS", "Finite Difference", "Lagrange Quadratic Interpolation", "Modified RWG"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Wideband Dielectric Characterization Of Triethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate Ester Plastic", "id": "19623", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8959", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Plastic materials form an important constituent of connectors and PCB substrates which are indispensable for connector and printed circuit industries. Plastics such as FR-4, PTFE (Teflon), PVC and silica glass are some of the commonly used materials for connector and printed circuit fabrication. With high-speed electronics being the increasing trend, computers, electronic chips and other electronic devices are progressively moving to higher frequencies with CPU speeds approaching 5 GHz and more in the future. Many systems are operating in 1-10 GHz range, and in the future, applications running at frequencies as high as 20 GHz with high data rates will be feasible. Knowledge of the performance of the materials constituting these devices is an imperative and challenging research task for designers. Dielectric characterization of plastic materials commonly used in electronic devices over a wide frequency range determines the electrical performance of the plastics and in turn of the electronic devices at high frequencies. In this thesis, wideband dielectric characterization of Triethylene Glycol Dimethacrylate Ester (TrEGDMA) organic plastic material (named Visi Jet SR-200 commercially) is performed using coaxial airline technique in the frequency range of 1-18 GHz and free space measurement technique in the frequency range of 8-12 GHz. This organic plastic has not been characterized over such a wide frequency range, therefore, dielectric characterization of this plastic is the main contribution of the research. The coaxial airline technique has been used to perform accurate measurements of dielectric properties of the plastic over frequency range of 1-18 GHz. A simulation analysis is also performed using known material (Teflon) as well as unknown plastic material to be characterized (TrEGDMA) to determine reflection and transmission coefficients and compare them with the measured results. Dielectric models for the measured permittivity data have been proposed to analytically describe the frequency dependency of dielectric properties of the TrEGDMA plastic over 1-18 GHz frequency range which is another important contribution of the research. Extraction of permittivity from measured scattering parameters using analytical closed form expressions has also been described. The dielectric characterization of the TrEGDMA plastic material will contribute towards determining the signal integrity performance of interconnects with this plastic as a substrate and will help to determine whether or not the material is fit to be used as a substrate in interconnects for high speed data transmission.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8796], "author_name_tesi": "Sharma, Kapil ", "last_name_ssi": "Sharma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kapil", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sedig Salem Agili", "Aldo W Morales"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sedig Salem Agili, Thesis Advisor", "Aldo W Morales, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["TrEGDMA", "free space technique", "transmission line technique", "coaxial airline", "scattering parameters", "air-gap", "NRW", "RPI", "HFSS"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE MAIZE RED ALEURONE1 ENCODES A FLAVONOID 3&#8242;-HYDROXYLASE WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF PURPLE ANTHOCYANINS AND RED PHLOBAPHENES", "id": "10326", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4543", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Maize is an economically important crop with most of the cultivated varieties susceptible to corn ear worm and leaf blight fungus. One type of resistance to these insects and pathogens has been attributed to the presence of C-glycosyl flavones and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins. The 3'-hydroxylated products of these compounds are more toxic than non-hydroxylated products. The phenylpropanoid pathway in plants leads to the synthesis of several flavonoid end products that include anthocyanin and phlobaphene pigments as well as C-glycosyl flavone and 3-deoxyanthocyanidin defense compounds in maize. Flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) is the key enzyme required for generating flavonoid compound diversity by 3'-hydroxylation of B-ring. \nWe have shown that red aleurone1/purple aleurone1 (pr1) gene is required for F3'H activity in maize. Mutations in the pr1 locus lead to the accumulation of pelargonidin (red) as oppose to cyanidin (purple) pigments in the wild-type aleurone cells. Using heterologous probes and primers from sorghum and rice f3'hs, and sequence information from maize genome, we isolated a putative maize f3'h1 sequence. PCR based polymorphism analysis showed that the red kernel phenotype co-segregates with the putative f3'h1 sequence. This polymorphism was due to the insertion of 24 dinucleotide repeats in the upstream promoter region of the two pr1 alleles. A third mutant allele had a 17 bp deletion near the TATA box. Maize populations segregating for Pr1 and pr1 were developed and a genetic ratio of 3:1 was observed for Pr1:pr1. Genetic mapping using SNP markers based on the isolated f3'h1 gene sequence confirms the previously known RFLP based map position of pr1 on chromosome 5L. Further, genetic complementation experiments using CaMV 35S::F3'H1 promoter-gene construct established that the encoded protein product was capable of performing 3'-hydroxylation reaction both in vitro and in vivo. The f3'h1 transcript was detected in floral as well as vegetative tissues of plants segregating for Pr1. On the other hand,  pr1 plants did not show any detectable levels of f3'h1 mRNA indicating that the dinucleotide repeat insertion or the deletion in 5' upstream promoter region in pr1 alleles have affected the steady state transcription of the f3'h1 gene.\nBiosynthesis of anthocyanin, phlobaphene, 3-deoxyanthocynanidin, and C-glycosyl flavone is regulated by different regulatory genes. Here we showed that the pr1 gene plays important role in the biosynthesis of 3' hydroxylated products of these flavonoid compounds and was regulated by two sets of transcription factors in separate branches of the flavonoid pathway. In one pathway, pr1 was regulated by pericarp color (p) gene to produce 3-deoxyanthocyanins and C-glycosyl flavones in maize floral tissues. In an alternate pathway, pr1 played critical role in biosynthesis of 3-hydroxyanthocyanins and was under the regulatory control of pair of transcription factors, red1 (r1) and colorless1 (c1).\nThe expression of f3&#8242;h1 was required for the biosynthesis of luteoforol, one of the flavan-4-ols that is precursor of the phlobaphenes. Flavan-4-ols are also the anticipated precursors of antifungal 3-deoxyanthocyanidins. Our results indicated that Pr1 plants accumulate significantly higher levels of luteolinidin in their silks when compared to its levels in pr1 plants. Further analysis of silk extracts revealed accumulation of higher amounts of maysin, a highly toxic insecticidal C-glycosyl flavone, in Pr1 plants compared to pr1. These plants also showed enhanced resistance to corn earworm larvae. Our study shows that the pr1 gene is playing an important role in generating diversity in flavonoid compounds and has novel role in the biosynthesis of agronomically important flavonoid defense compounds. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4511], "author_name_tesi": "Sharma, Mandeep ", "last_name_ssi": "Sharma", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mandeep", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Surinder Chopra", "Seogchan Kang", "David Robert Huff", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "David Braun", "Surinder Chopra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Surinder Chopra, Dissertation Advisor", "Seogchan Kang, Committee Member", "David Robert Huff, Committee Member", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Member", "David Braun, Committee Member", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["pr1"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "BIOCONJUGATION OF CALCIUM PHOSPHATE NANOPARTICLES FOR SELECTIVE TARGETING OF HUMAN BREAST AND PANCREATIC CANCERS IN VIVO", "id": "9932", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5419", "abstract_tesi": "This study describes the design and synthesis of targeted calcium phosphate nanoparticles (CPNPs) through bioconjugation of human holotransferrin, anti-CD71 antibody, and short gastrin peptides via avidin-biotin- or PEG-maleimide-coupling strategies.

Despite contributing significant insights, most prior inquiries have been unable to explicitly test decline-of-community theories because they lack true longitudinal data. This dissertation employs a dynamic multilevel approach that theoretically and empirically addresses changes in neighborhood attachment. Using restricted data from two waves of the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, I examine how Angelinos\u2019 attachment changes in response to changes in their personal lives and their neighborhood settings. The reciprocal relationship between residential mobility and attachment is explored as well.  \nOverall, I find that modern-day community is alive and well, as evidenced by residents\u2019 attitudes about and behaviors within their communities. Angelinos undergo important life transitions that, along with changes in their residential environments, shape their local attachments in distinct ways. Specifically, local social investments (e.g., being married, having a child) strengthen sentimental bonds to place, and economic investments (e.g., being a homeowner, obtaining a new job) boost participation in neighborhood organizations. Living near close friends and family consistently strengthens attachment, while experiencing fear or victimization in one\u2019s neighborhood weakens it considerably. Perhaps most detrimental to attachment is excessive exposure to disadvantage: in neighborhoods where the concentrations of poverty, unemployment, broken families, pollution, and social services are rising, Angelinos are becoming decidedly less connected and involved. I also find that residents who are strongly attached to their neighborhoods are less likely to move, and that mobility itself exerts substantial but differential impacts on attachment.

Literature of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) represents national citizenship as a broad, flexible, inclusive category that is ethically constituted\u2014that is, one based on action, not birth country, gender, race, or religion. The conflict between Franco\u2019s Nationalists and the democratically elected Spanish Republican government, seen by many historians as a prelude to World War II, inspired a literary outpouring as widespread as the volunteerism it engendered. Both writers who traveled to Spain and writers at a geographical remove wrote extensively about the Spanish cause. Coming at a time of high Eastern European Jewish immigration, debates over national identity and non-white citizenship, in the midst of the Depression and European fascism\u2019s rise\u2014and less violent, but no less destructive, anti-Semitism in North America\u2014the Spanish Civil War represented an important juncture for conceptualizing national identity from afar.\n\nThe very nature of the Spanish conflict\u2014the fact that a civil war spurred voluntary international participation on a level never seen before or since\u2014required those involved, whether in Spain or in their home countries, to defend their involvement.

It is composed of five sections.  The first considers issues related to the classification of psychopathology and, specifically, the ineluctably value-laden nature of nosology and the problem of demarcation.  Second, the history of mental disorder classification from antiquity to the present is evaluated with particular reference to the various editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM).  Section Three begins by tracing an historical tradition of viewing anxious and depressive symptomatology as intimately intertwined.  It is argued that this explicit recognition of interconnectedness dwindled with the publication and ascendancy of the third edition of the DSM, its ethos of \u201csplitting\u201d psychopathology into numerous disorders, and the genesis of the phenomenon of comorbidity for mental disorders.  Existing alternatives to the DSM from both Western and non-Western sources are then discussed and evaluated.  Fourth, recent research and theory on negative affectivity (NA) are reviewed, and linkages are made between current research and pre-DSM-III conceptions of anxious and depressive symptomatology.  Finally, Section Five attempts to synthesize the previous findings and proposes an alternative dimensional system for the classification of negative affectivity.  The scope of assessable NA was widened beyond DSM-IV symptoms to include concepts derived from the NA literature, past and present empirical findings, cross-cultural research, and pre-DSM-III theory.  A new clinical self-report measure derived from this system, the Inventory of Negative Affect Symptomatology \u2013 Self-Report Version (IONAS-SR), was created, and consists of 100 items that can be subdivided into seven dimensional sets.  IONAS-SR scores can be visually plotted to yield a symptomatic \u201cprofile.\u201d  Similarities and differences to existing measures are discussed as well.

The aims of this study were to characterize patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis undergoing cholecystectomy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) during index hospitalization in the US and determine predictors of index hospitalization cholecystectomy.\nMethods: Discharge data was aggregated from the Healthcare cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database for the years 2007-2011. ICD-9 codes were used to identify adult patients (>18 years) discharged with a clinical diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and cholelithiasis. We excluded patients with a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, complicated pancreatitis, and severe pancreatitis.\nResults: 496652 patients were identified with mild gallstone pancreatitis (females: 61.5%; Age: 56.8 + 20.4; 64% whites, 18.8% Hispanics, 10% African American (AA)). The overall rate of cholecystectomy was 56.5%. The cholecystectomy rate was highest among Hispanics (63%) and lowest in AA (52%). Cholecystectomy group had significantly more females (58.7% vs. 41.3%; p<. 0001) and younger patients (54.06 \u00b120.1 vs. 60.16 \u00b120.2; p.0001) when compared to non-cholecystectomy group. Overall, 27% of the patients with a diagnosis of acute gallstone pancreatitis underwent ERCP. Patients undergoing ERCP with biliary stent placement had lower cholecystectomy rate (46.8% vs. 58.7%; p<. 0001). On multivariate analysis, the odds of cholecystectomy was higher in Hispanics (OR 1.11, 95%CI 1.06-1.16), and lower is AA (OR 0.82, 95%CI 0.77-0.86) compared to whites. The odds of cholecystectomy was also higher in large size hospitals (OR 1.16, 95%CI 1.10-1.21) compared to small hospitals, and lowers in teaching hospitals (OR 0.89, 95%CI 0.86-0.92), compared to non-teaching hospitals. The Odds of receiving a cholecystectomy was also higher in the southern region (OR 1.89, 95%CI 1.82-1.98) compared to the northeast region and also in patients with private insurance (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.17-1.28) compared to Medicare beneficiaries. Mortality was lower in patients undergoing cholecystectomy compared to the non-cholecystectomy group (0.2% vs. 0.9%, p<0.0001)\nConclusion: Cholecystectomy rates at index hospitalization continue to be low among patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis.

In this thesis, we explore the utility of compressive sensing in radar imaging problems. In order to achieve good imaging resolution, we seek to build radar systems with hardware and algorithms intended for processing signals of high bandwidth. Traditionally, radar systems utilized analog processing systems. Over the last few years, with advances in computing, it has been possible to process ultra-wideband (UWB) signals digitally. The current state of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology limits our ability to effectively acquire UWB radio-frequency (RF) signals in the context of radar imaging. However, radar signals that are scattered from common target scenes are sparse when represented in appropriate basis functions. We can thus apply the theory of compressive sensing to circumvent the limitations of ADC technology and design radar systems capable of imaging at higher resolutions than conventionally thought possible. \n \nIn this thesis, we study the utility of random, noise-like transmit waveforms in compressive radar imaging. Our focus is on developing the theory and methods for the basic radar signal processing tasks of imaging, detection, and waveform design in the framework of compressive sensing. Compressive radar signal processing systems are more complex and less robust to noise and perturbations than conventional systems. We demonstrate using phase-transition diagrams that compressive noise radar is a feasible technology. Further, phase transition diagrams can be used for calibrating radar systems in real applications. The original contributions of this thesis are in developing the theory of compressive radar imaging using random stochastic waveforms. We demonstrate that compressive sensing works in real scenarios by applying it to experimental data. Hypothesis testing for target detection in the context of compressive radar imaging is different than the conventional setting since signal recovery is iterative and non-linear. We propose a method based on extreme value statistics to characterize the detection performance and determine thresholds for target detection in compressive radar imaging. We validate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to experimental noise-radar imaging data. Radar systems often require designing waveforms that are optimally suited for specific applications and target scenarios. However, optimizing the transmit waveform can make the system matrix unsuitable for compressive signal recovery. In our work, we propose a waveform design algorithm that optimizes the waveform while keeping the system matrix suitable for compressive sensing.

The kinesin superfamily of proteins is comprised of 14 subfamilies that are involved in diverse cellular tasks ranging from cargo transport in neurons to mitotic spindle organization. Understanding motor function has potential applications in elucidating mechanisms of cell division, slowing the progression of cancer, and treating infertility and neuronal diseases. Though extensive studies of the structure, biochemistry and force producing properties of diverse kinesins have contributed greatly to knowledge of the mechanism of motor function, the precise transitions underlying the kinetic cycle and the molecular basis of motor processivity are not completely understood. The overall goal of this thesis is to investigate the structural and biophysical determinants of kinesin function in order to relate the motor properties of diverse kinesins to their cellular functions. \n\nThe kinesin neck-linker, a 14-18 amino acid flexible domain that connects the catalytic core to the coiled-coil rod, is the key mechanical element that underlies coordinated stepping of dimeric motors. Consistent with their diverse cellular tasks, the processivity of kinesins \u2013 the ability to take multiple steps per interaction with a microtubule \u2013 varies from ~10 to ~1000. To test the degree to which the processivity of N-terminal kinesins is determined by their neck-linker domains, kinesins-1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 were engineered with different neck-linker lengths. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, single kinesin molecules walking along microtubules were visualized and their run lengths were characterized. With native neck-linkers, which range from 14 to 18 amino acids, run lengths of kinseins-1, 2, 3, 5 & 7 ranged from below 200 nm to 2 &#956;m. Surprisingly, when their neck-linkers were shortened to 14 amino acids, kinesin-3 and kinesin-5 run lengths matched that of kinesin-1 as did kinesin-2, after changing a kinked proline to an alanine and kinesin-7, after the end of &#945;-6 was changed to match the kinesin-1 sequence. This convergence of processivity is observed even though the speeds of these motors varied over a 25-fold range. From stochastic simulations of the hydrolysis cycle, these effects can best be explained by either a slower strain-dependent detachment of the rear head (disrupting rear head gating) or a reduced strain-dependent inhibition of ATP binding to the leading head (disrupting front head gating). These results suggest that diverse N-terminal kinesins are inherently processive to the same degree, and their wild-type behavior results from differences in the length and sequence of their neck-linker domains. \n\nMany intracellular transport activities including long range cargo transport and bi-directional neuronal transport involve multiple motors working in a coordinated manner. Though single motor properties have been studied in great detail, much less is known about the mechanism of collective motor behavior. By linking single molecule biophysics and in-vitro characterization of multi-motor behavior to cell biology, mechanistic details of cellular functions can be uncovered. Using the kinesins generated for the neck linker investigations, fast and slow motors in varying ratios were adsorbed onto flow cells and the speed at which they moved microtubules was measured.  When mixed with kinesin-3 and kinesin-5 motors, kinesin-1 and kinesin-7 speeds dominate,` and influence the mechanical properties of kinesins-3 & 5. \n\nThis study has established that inter-head tension controls kinesin processivity by altering either front-head gating or rear-head gating, while motor speeds are controlled by a different mechanism.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5722], "author_name_tesi": "Shastry, Shankar Narayan Rajagopalan", "last_name_ssi": "Shastry", "middle_name_ssi": "Narayan Rajagopalan", "first_name_ssi": "Shankar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William O Hancock", "William O Hancock", "Peter J Butler", "Sheereen Majdzarringhalamaraghy", "B Tracy Nixon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William O Hancock, Dissertation Advisor", "William O Hancock, Committee Chair", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Sheereen Majdzarringhalamaraghy, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FRET", "TIRF", "Processivity", "Kinesins", "Front and rear head gating"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Glimpses of the Global Coral Gardens:  Insights of International Adult Learners on the Interactions of Cultures in Online Distance Education", "id": "6685", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3426", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Expanding global communications over the past decade in the form of the World Wide Web and the Internet increased the possibility of cultures meeting cultures within distance education courses taught from American colleges and universities.

The simulation results were used to produce the flow visualization in an NGV passage, which provide more detailed NGV flow characteristics.\n\tSecondly, a set of a rotor flow simulations was carried out to examine the flow fields associated with different pressure side tip extension configurations, which are designed to reduce the tip leakage flow. RANS based viscous flow simulations were used to compare a number of potential aerodynamic de-sensitization designs for blade tips.\nThe last two sets use a multiple reference frames approach for a complete turbine stage with two different interface models. The first interface model is the circumferentially averaged mixing plane model. The quasi-steady state flow characteristics of the AFTRF can be obtained from this interface model. This model was not only used to investigate the flow characteristics in the turbine stage but also the effects of using pressure side rotor tip extensions. The tip leakage flow fields simulated from this model and from the linear cascade model show similar trends.\nMore detailed understanding of unsteady characteristics of a turbine flow field can be obtained using the second type of interface model, the time accurate sliding-mesh model. The potential flow interactions, wake characteristics, their effects on secondary flow formation, and the wake mixing process in a rotor passage were examined using this model. \nA comparison between the results from the circumferential average model and the time accurate flow model results is presented. It was found that the circumferential average model cannot accurately simulate flow interaction characteristics on the interface plane between the NGV trailing edge and the rotor leading edge. However, the circumferential average model does give accurate flow characteristics in the NGV domain and the rotor domain with less computational time and computer memory requirements. In contrast, the time accurate flow simulation can predict all unsteady flow characteristics occurring in the turbine stage, but with high computational resource requirements.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [589], "author_name_tesi": "Shavalikul, Akamol ", "last_name_ssi": "Shavalikul", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Akamol", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci", "Cengiz Camci", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin", "Savash Yavuzkurt", "Timothy Francis Miller", "Michael H Krane"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Dissertation Advisor", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Chair", "Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Committee Member", "Savash Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Timothy Francis Miller, Committee Member", "Michael H Krane, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CFD", "time accurate prediction", "turbine flow simulation", "tip leakage"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Worked Examples and Learner-Generated Representations: A Study in the Calculus Domain", "id": "21610", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9894", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research repeatedly demonstrates the effectiveness of pairing practice problems with similar worked examples to improve student performance on problem-solving tasks.

As engines become more powerful, structures become more lightly damped and complex, and materials become lighter, stiffer, and more complicated, the need to understand and predict structural response to aeroacoustic loads becomes more important. Despite decades of research, vibration in panels caused by random pressure loads, such as those found in a supersonic jet, is still difficult to predict. The work in this research improves on current prediction methods in several ways, in particular for the structural response due to wall pressures induced by supersonic turbulent flows. First, solutions are calculated using time-domain input pressure loads that include shock cells and their interaction with turbulent flow. The solutions include both mean (static) and oscillatory components. Second, the time series of stresses are required for many fatigue assessment counting algorithms. To do this, a method is developed to compute time-dependent solutions in the frequency domain.\n\nThe method is first applied to a single-degree-of-freedom system. The equations of motion are derived and solved in both the frequency domain and the time domain. The pressure input is a random (broadband) signal representative of jet flow. The method is then applied to a simply-supported beam vibrating in flexure using a line of pressure inputs computed with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). A modal summation approach is used to compute structural response. The coupling between the pressure field and the structure, through the joint acceptance, is reviewed and discussed for its application to more complicated structures. Results from the new method and from a direct time domain method are compared for method verification. Because the match is good and the new frequency domain method is faster computationally, it is chosen for use in a more complicated structure.\n\nThe vibration of a two-dimensional panel loaded by jet nozzle discharge flow is addressed. The surface pressures calculated at Pratt and Whitney using viscous and compressible CFD are analyzed and compared to surface pressure measurements made at the United Technologies Research Center (UTRC). A structural finite element model is constructed to represent a flexible panel also used in the UTRC setup. The mode shapes, resonance frequencies, modal loss factors, and surface pressures are input into the solution method. Displacement time series and power spectral densities are computed and compared to measurement and show good agreement. The concept of joint acceptance is further addressed for two-dimensional plates excited by supersonic jet flow. Static and alternating stresses in the panel are also computed, and the most highly stressed modes are identified.\n\nThe surface pressures are further analyzed in the wavenumber domain for insight into the physics of sonic fatigue. Most of the energy in the wall pressure wavenumber-frequency spectrum at subsonic speeds is in turbulent structures near the convective wavenumber. In supersonic flow, however, the shock region dominates the spectrum at low frequencies, but convective behavior is still dominant at higher frequencies. When the forcing function wavenumber energy overlaps the modal wavenumbers, the acceptance of energy by the structure from the flow field is greatest. The wavenumber analysis suggests a means of designing structures to minimize overlap of excitation and structural wavenumber peaks to minimize vibration and sonic fatigue.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10497], "author_name_tesi": "Shaw, Matthew David", "last_name_ssi": "Shaw", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen A Hambric", "Stephen A Hambric", "Robert Lee Campbell", "Philip John Morris", "Stephen Clarke Conlon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen A Hambric, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen A Hambric, Committee Chair", "Robert Lee Campbell, Committee Chair", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Stephen Clarke Conlon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Structural vibration", "vibroacoustics", "fatigue", "fluid-structure interaction"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "MACROPHAGE POLARIZATION: A DUAL ROLE BETWEEN INTERLEUKIN-4 SIGNALING AND SELENOPROTEIN BIOSYNTHESIS", "id": "14734aes5254", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14734", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient that utilizes a unique mechanism to be chemically converted and charged to the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec), which is incorporated into proteins at a UGA codon. Sequence analysis has revealed 25 known selenoproteins in humans and 24 in mice based on a specific 3\u2019 untranslated region element termed the Sec insertion sequence present in mRNA that forms a distinct stem-loop structure necessary for the recruitment of Sec to the actively translating ribosome. Studies have shown that either dietary Se deficiency or genetic mutations in individual selenoproteins or proteins involved in selenoprotein biosynthesis cause detrimental effects on human health. Selenoproteins have been shown to have a variety of functions, including redox homeostasis, thyroid metabolism, and protein folding. Many selenoproteins remain uncharacterized with new functions being unraveled. The goal of these studies is to identify new, uncharacterized selenoprotein functions involved in IL-4-dependent M2 macrophage polarization. \n\tAn in vivo model of parasitic infection was used to induce a T-helper type-2 (Th2) response characterized by an IL-4 release in order to mimic IL-4 stimulation in in vitro studies. Mice were kept on three custom Se diets and infected with the murine helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Wild-type mice kept on Se deficient diet (Se-Def; sodium selenite \u2264 0.01 ppm) had a significantly higher parasite burden compared to mice fed Se adequate (Se-Ade; sodium selenite = 0.08 ppm) or Se supplemented (Se-Supp; sodium selenite = 0.4ppm) diets. Additionally, jejunal macrophages from wild-type mice fed Se-Def diet had higher M1 macrophage gene expression and lower M2 macrophage gene expression compared to mice fed Se-Ade or Se-Supp diets. Macrophage-specific Sec tRNA deficient mice had similar results to wild-type mice fed Se-Def diet despite being fed Se-Supp diet. These Se dependent effects appear to be mediated through arachidonic acid metabolism and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma signaling since inhibition of either pathway led to increased parasite burden, increased M1 macrophage gene expression, and decreased M2 macrophage gene expression despite being fed Se-Ade or Se-Supp diet and was rescued by exogenous administration of 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). \n\tIn order to examine the mechanism by which IL-4 stimulation increases the production of 15d-PGJ2 to drive M2 macrophage polarization, the two isoforms important for the production of 15d-PGJ2, cyclooxygenase (Ptgs; Cox)-1 and Cox-2, were examined. Interestingly, Ptgs-2, which is a highly inducible gene regulated by diverse stimuli via mechanisms involving transcriptional and translational control of expression, was significantly downregulated by IL-4 in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), highlighting the importance of Cox-1 in a Th2 environment. This phenomenon not only challenges the dogma that Cox-1 is only developmentally regulated, but also demonstrates a novel mechanism in which IL-4\u2013dependent regulation of Cox-1 involves the activation of the feline sarcoma oncogene kinase-Akt-mechanistic target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) axis. The presence of terminal oligopyrimidine sequences in the vicinity of the transcription start site in the 5\u2019 untranslated region of both murine and human PTGS-1 mRNA further supported the involvement of mTORC. Since Cox-1 does not behave as a bona fide terminal oligopyrimidine sequence with regard to polysome-dependent control, it is likely that mTORC2 may affect Cox-1 protein expression. Downstream targets of mTORC2 are unknown and further work is needed to delineate the functional differences between mTORC1 and mTORC2 in regulating Cox-1 protein expression. That being said mTORC signaling appears to play a role in the accumulation of Cox-1 protein over the course of IL-4 stimulation potentially through either increased abundance of or increased interaction with heat shock protein chaperones. Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (Ampk) by metformin, inhibition of mTORC by torin 1, or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genetic knockout of tuberous sclerosis complex-2 blocked the IL-4-dependent expression of Cox-1 and the ability of macrophages to polarize to M2. However, use of 15d-PGJ2 partially rescued the effects of Ampk activation in-vivo, suggesting the importance of Cox-1 in macrophage polarization as well as N.brasiliensis clearance. In summary, these findings suggest a new paradigm where IL-4\u2013dependent upregulation of Cox-1 expression may play a key role in tissue homeostasis and wound healing during Th2-mediated immune responses, as seen during helminth infections.\nTo examine the Se-dependent requirement for prostaglandin J2 production and M2 macrophage polarization during IL-4 stimulation, macrophage specific Cre-Lox mouse models were utilized to knockout various components of the selenoprotein biosynthesis machinery. While loss of Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec (Trsp) in macrophages significantly reduced the expression of the entire selenoproteome, loss of Sec insertion sequence binding protein-2 (Sbp2) led to only a partial loss of the selenoproteome, reminiscent of a hierarchical control of selenoprotein expression. Complete selenoproteome loss in the TrspLysMCre model lead to decrease in the production of \u039412-PGJ2, M2 macrophage polarization, and the ability to efficiently clear N.brasiliensis despite Se-supplementation. Sbp2LysMCre BMDMs, with a select few selenoproteins upregulated by IL-4 stimulation (Seleno-I, Seleno-K, Txnrd-1, and Gpx-2), were able to produce \u039412-PGJ2 at levels similar to those in Sbp2LysMWT BMDMs. Normal production of \u039412-PGJ2 led to unaltered M2 macrophage polarization and efficient N.brasiliensis clearance in the Sbp2LysMCremodel. These results suggest that these select few selenoproteins may regulate eicosanoid class switching upon IL-4 stimulation to increase M2 macrophages and effectively clear N.brasiliensis infection. Further work needs to be performed to narrow in on which selenoprotein(s) is playing a role in polarization and determining its exact function. \n\tThis dissertation demonstrates for the first time how IL-4 and Se function in an additive manner to upregulate Cox-1 expression as well as a specific set of selenoproteins, respectively, to enhance eicosanoid class switching to produce the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligands \u039412-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2. Enhanced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma signaling increases the expression of M2 macrophages, which are required to efficiently clear helminth N.brasiliensis. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15844], "author_name_tesi": "Shay, Ashley E", "last_name_ssi": "Shay", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Ashley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Margherita Teresa-Anna Cantorna", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Girish Soorappa Kirimanjeswara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Chair", "Margherita Teresa-Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Outside Member", "Girish Soorappa Kirimanjeswara, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["macrophage", "polarization", "selenium", "selenoprotein", "helminth", "inflammation", "prostaglandin", "resolution", "cyclooxygenase", "arachidonic acid", "Nippostrongylus brasiliensis", "interleukin-4", "M2 macrophage", "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Development and Characterization of High Temperature, High Energy Density Dielectric Materials to Establish Routes towards Power Electronics Capacitive Devices", "id": "21810", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10048", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The maximum electrostatic energy density of a capacitor is a function of the relative permittivity (\u03b5r) and the square of the dielectric breakdown strength (Eb). Currently, state\u2013of\u2013the art high temperature (>200 \u00b0C), SiC\u2013based power electronics utilize CaZrO3\u2013rich NP0/C0G\u2013type capacitors, which have low relative permittivities of \u03b5r ~ 30\u201340, high breakdown strengths (> 1.0 MV/cm), and are chosen for their minimal change in energy storage with temperature. However, with operating temperatures exceeding the rated temperatures for such capacitors, there is an opportunity to develop new dielectric ceramics having higher energy densities and volumetric efficiencies at high temperatures (>200 \u00b0C) by utilizing higher permittivity dielectrics while maintaining high breakdown strengths via doping. The development strategy involves identifying binary linear dielectric compositions that combine medium permittivities with large band gaps, and either substituting end members or identifying doping strategies to minimize high temperature ionic conductivity, achieving large energy densities at elevated temperatures. \nThe solid solution behavior of Ca(TixZr1\u2013x)O3 was characterized in order to determine the optimal composition for balancing permittivity and dielectric breakdown strength to obtain high energy densities at elevated temperatures. Characterization by X\u2013ray diffraction (XRD) showed Vegard\u2019s law behavior across the solid solution with minimal 2nd phases. Microstructural analysis showed little variation in grain size across the solid solution, with grain sizes on the CaTiO3 \u2013 rich end of the composition range being ~2.0 \u2013 3.0 \u03bcm. Room temperature relative permittivities also showed a linear trend across the solid solution, with permittivities increasing with increasing CaTiO3 content. In order to mitigate ionic conduction, an investigation into various Mn doping concentrations on the Ti4+ site using Ca(Ti0.8Zr0.2)O3 (CTZ) was conducted to determine the optimum doping concentration for minimizing dielectric loss at elevated temperatures. It was determined that doping with 0.5 mol% Mn shows the earliest onset of densification during sintering in air and the lowest dielectric losses with increasing temperature. \nTo determine a Ca(TixZr1\u2013x)O3 composition that will also minimize electronic or band conduction, the optical properties of the Ca(TixZr1\u2013x)O3 solid solution were investigated to identify a composition on the CaTiO3 \u2013 rich end of the solid solution with a large band gap. Both ultraviolet\u2013visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV\u2013Vis) and spectroscopic ellipsometry were utilized to determine the Ca(TixZr1\u2013x)O3 band gaps and optical properties. Both techniques yield an asymmetric Vegard\u2019s law trend in the band gaps across the solid solution, with larger band gaps weighted towards the CaZrO3 \u2013 rich end of the solid solution. Band gaps on the CaTiO3 \u2013 rich end of the solid solution ranged from 3.7 to 3.8 eV. Divided special range analysis of spectroscopic ellipsometry data was utilized to less ambiguously determine band gaps compared to UV\u2013Vis, for which the analysis contains several assumptions. Additionally, the refractive index and optical dielectric constants were determined via ellipsometry and showed good agreement with calculated values. \nThe resistivity at 250 \u00b0C scaled with the band gap energy across the solid solution. Comparing the current\u2013voltage (I\u2013V) behavior at 250 \u00b0C for Ca(Tix\u2013yMnyZr0.2)O3  (CTZ + Mn) where x = 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and y = 0.005, it was found that the Ca(Ti0.795Mn0.005Zr0.2)O3 composition showed the lowest current density and a decrease in current density of 5 orders of magnitude compared to the un\u2013doped composition. The Ca(Ti0.795Mn0.005Zr0.2)O3 composition was selected for single layer, Pt buried electrode capacitor prototyping to evaluate high temperature electrical characteristics. Capacitors of un\u2013doped CTZ were also prototyped to compare the high temperature electrical properties and to determine the effects of Mn doping on high temperature electrical performance. \nPolarization\u2013field (P\u2013E) hysteresis measurements of CTZ showed a large increase in dielectric loss with increasing temperature, limiting the dielectric breakdown strength and recoverable energy density. When doped with Mn, CTZ + Mn showed a minimization of the temperature dependence of the breakdown strength, and maximum energy densities of 7.00 J/cm3 at a Eb of 1.1 MV/cm at room temperature and 5.36 J/cm3 at Eb = 1.0 MV/cm at 300 \u00b0C were observed. Impedance spectroscopy of the CTZ and CTZ + Mn dielectrics showed that doping with Mn resulted in a decrease in ionic conductivity and a subsequent decrease in electronic conductivity. To further increase the high temperature resistivity of the CTZ + Mn system, Zr was replaced with Hf to determine the effects of a heavier ion and higher band gap end member on the high temperature electrical properties.  \nBasic characterization of Ca(Ti0.8Hf0.2)O3 (CTH) and Ca(Ti0.795Mn0.005Hf0.2)O3 (CTH + Mn) showed similar characteristics compared to the CTZ system. High temperature impedance spectroscopy of CTH and CTH + Mn showed similar behavior to the CTZ and CTZ + Mn systems, but with overall decreases in ionic and electronic conductivity. Coupled with thermally stimulated depolarization current measurements (TSDC), oxygen vacancy migration and space charge conduction are dominant and could be minimized with Mn doping. Compared to CTZ + Mn, CTH + Mn showed an additional decrease in current density at 250 \u00b0C by an order of magnitude. Systematic energy density characterization showed minimization of the temperature dependence of the dielectric breakdown strength in CTH + Mn, with a maximum energy density of 6.5 J/cm3 and 1.1 MV/cm observed at 300 \u00b0C. \nTo gain further insight into how aliovalent Mn controls high temperature conduction in the CTH + Mn system, capacitors were quenched from the sintering temperature and an impedance study was performed. It was observed that ionic conductivity was quenched in due to oxygen vacancies compensating Mn3+, and interfacial features were observed in impedance spectra due to double back\u2013to\u2013back Schottky barriers (depletion layers). As capacitors were re\u2013oxidized, bulk resistivity increased while interfacial resistivity decreased. The hypothesis was supported by the application of dc bias during impedance measurements, which showed similar impedance behavior to the re\u2013oxidation study with a redistribution of oxygen vacancies to the interfaces after the bias was removed. \nIn a final attempt to optimize the CTH + Mn system, a rare earth co\u2013doping study with Mn and Mg was investigated to further minimize ionic conductivity and maximize high temperature energy densities. Co\u2013doping CTH with Mg and Dy yielded the lowest conductivities observed in this work, and the least temperature dependence of conductivity up to 250 \u00b0C. Room temperature energy densities of ~10 J/cm3 were observed. However, due to grain sizes approaching 9.0 \u03bcm, prototyped single layer capacitors showed a large increase in dielectric loss with increasing temperature due to the minimal number of insulating grain boundaries per dielectric layer.

The first study explored parents\u2019 preparation for gender bias in a sample of (N=190) European American two-parent families with two adolescent offspring. Mothers engaged in more preparation for gender bias than did fathers, and prepared daughters for gender bias more than sons. Preparing offspring for gender bias was associated with parents\u2019 socioeconomic status, gender attitudes, and indices of parent-offspring relationship quality. Analyses aimed at exploring the implications of preparation for gender bias for offspring\u2019s gender attitudes revealed that although preparation for gender bias did not mediate the association between parents\u2019 and offspring\u2019s attitudes, high levels of mothers\u2019 preparation for gender bias were associated with less traditional attitudes toward women among offspring. The second study examined parents\u2019 preparation for gender bias in a sample of (N = 167) two parent African American families and compared this process to preparation for racial bias by examining the correlates and within-family patterning of both socialization behaviors.  Parents reported fairly low levels of preparation for gender bias, as compared with preparation for racial bias.

Taking into account the role of parental characteristics, belonging to families where both parents engaged in high levels of preparation for gender and racial bias was linked to greater expressivity, awareness of racism, positive values, and social competence among offspring. The third study described gender socialization in the family from the perspective of emerging adult offspring in an ethnically diverse sample of college students (N = 170).

This study, which is in support of Moore\u2019s (1980, 1993) theory of transactional distance, is exploratory and descriptive, and focuses on one of the key variables in the theory dialogue. \nAs discussed by Moore (1980, 1993) and Burbules (1993), dialogue is a purposeful journey that an individual or group undertakes with others to expand understanding and create new knowledge. Dialogue is not depicted by any one singular event, but the destination hopefully results in \u201caha\u201d moments when concepts and constructs around ideas become clear. In education, as Burbules discusses, dialogue is a subset of educational exchanges and is different from chatting, arguing, or negotiating. \nThe intent of the study is to examine dialogue, one of the three main variables of the theory. Through a review of the literature on dialogue in education, the study proposes a conceptual definition of dialogue for online learning environments based on the works of Burbules (1993) and Moore (1980, 1983a, 1993), and a classification scheme for dialogue based on the philosophical work of Burbules on dialogue. \nThe study uses a form ethnography and content analysis in its research design and methodology. It is exploratory, so it does not rely on a random sample nor are the results intended to be generalizable across a large population. The results of the study discuss how the a priori classification scheme for dialogue, constructed from Burbules\u2019s work and other research studies on classroom/course interaction, is tested for inclusiveness of all observed written speech acts and for the addition of other dialogic qualifiers. The analysis demonstrates how the classification scheme is used to classify speech acts as \u201cDialogue towards Understanding,\u201d \u201cDialogue towards Conversation,\u201d or \u201cPassive/Silent\u201d by the type of dialogic form, move, and outcome that exists in the speech act. The unit of analysis for this study is an entire written speech act that may contain one or more paragraphs.\nThis study provides a definition of dialogue, which is a subset of all educational communications where the intent is dialogic exchanges that lead to the increased understanding of the student and knowledge building. The definition of dialogue and the proposed classification scheme for dialogue are intended to support further testing of the theory of transactional distance. The study only represents a starting point and provides baseline tools so future studies can explore the affect of dialogue on transactional distance and the other key variables of the theory: structure and autonomy. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5413], "author_name_tesi": "Shearer, Rick L", "last_name_ssi": "Shearer", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Rick", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Michael Moore", "Michael Grahame Moore", "Gary Kuhne", "Susan G Strauss", "Priya Sharma", "Melody M Thompson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Michael Moore, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Grahame Moore, Committee Chair", "Gary Kuhne, Committee Chair", "Susan G Strauss, Committee Member", "Priya Sharma, Committee Member", "Melody M Thompson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dialogue", "distance education", "transactional distance", "content analysis", "speech acts"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Bounded Learning Efficiency and Sources of Firm Level Productivity Growth", "id": "15136", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7617", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The measurement of productivity fluctuations has been the focus of decades-long interest in the scholarly literature and among policy makers. In addition to broad structural forces driving productivity changes, there is more recent interest in measuring and identifying the heterogeneous forces driving these changes.  A major force is learning-by-doing which is used by economists to describe the phenomenon of productivity growth arising from the accumulation of production experience by a firm. \n\nThis dissertation models the bounded learning concept with the learning progress function characterized by the degree of efficiency and the specification of the learning progress as a logistic function capturing both the slow start-up and the limit in learning progress. The inter-firm learning inefficiency is defined as the inability of a firm to reach the optimal plateau relative to the \u2018best practice\u2019 firm from the set of comparable firms. We further differentiate learning efficiency from the technical efficiency. The time varying technical efficiency is estimated based on stochastic production frontier methods and firm-specific learning efficiency is disentangled using the residual of the production frontier (productivity). The model is then used to decompose the factor productivity growth into components associated with learning, scale, technical efficiency, technological change and change in allocative efficiency. This productivity growth decomposition provides useful information and policy level insight in firm-level productivity analysis.\nThe major econometric issue in production function estimation is the possibility that there are some forces influencing production that are only observed by the firm and not by the econometrician. With firm input use being endogenous, inputs might be correlated with unobserved productivity shocks. The measure of technical efficiency by estimating the production frontier directly in presence of endogeneity of input choice can be biased in the sense that the measure of efficiency favors the firms employing higher levels of inputs. The Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) approach is extended to overcome this simultaneity problem in stochastic production frontier estimation by generating consistent estimates of production parameters and technical efficiency.\nThe model is applied to plant-level panel data on Colombian food manufacturing sector. This is a unique longitudinal firm-level database in the sense that it has information on both plant-specific physical quantities and prices for both outputs and inputs. In contrast to most of the existing literature measuring productivity by deflating sales by an industry-level price index, these data eliminate a common source of measurement error in production function estimation. Empirical results based on plant-level panel data on the Colombian food manufacturing industry for the period 1982-1998 show that the traditional stochastic frontier tends to underestimate the output elasticity of capital. The evidence in this research suggests that addressing the endogeneity issue matters in stochastic production frontier to generate consistent estimates of production parameters and technical efficiency. Productivity growth not only stems from technical progress, technical efficiency change, and scale efficiency but also from significant learning effect. The relative importance of the productivity growth components provides perspective for efficient resource allocation within the firm.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7552], "author_name_tesi": "Shee, Apurba ", "last_name_ssi": "Shee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Apurba", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou", "Karen Ann Fisher Vanden", "Alessandro Bonanno", "Mark John Roberts"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Ann Fisher Vanden, Committee Member", "Alessandro Bonanno, Committee Member", "Mark John Roberts, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Colombian food industry", "Bounded learning-by-doing", "Logistic differential equation", "Learning efficiency", "Technical efficiency", "Stochastic production frontier", "Endogeneity of input choice", "Firm-level productivity growth", "Decomposition of productivity change"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF WALKING STRATEGIES DURING SLOPE AND STAIR TRANSITIONS\n", "id": "11037", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5137", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Slope and stair walking are common, yet challenging, tasks which we encounter everyday. In addition, we are constantly transitioning between these walking tasks in a safe manner. Both slope and stair walking require modifications to force production, joint range of motion, and muscle activity from the normal level walking patterns. The overall goal of these studies was to determine the walking strategies involved in slope and stair walking, as well as the transitions between them. More specifically, I first sought to better characterize the fall risk associated with slope and stair walking as well as determine if transition steps are more or less risky than steady state steps. Second, I wanted to characterize the locomotor strategies used to safely transition between different locomotor tasks. To achieve these goals, I recorded kinetic, kinematic, and electromyography data while participants performed various walking tasks. These tasks included level walking, stair ascent and descent, and upslope and down slope walking at 4 different slopes (7\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 23\u00b0, and 31\u00b0). I collected not only steps on just the slopes and stairs, but also the transition steps onto and off of the apparatus, and 2 steps from the transition. To quantify the fall risk of these different steps I created a locomotor risk index which combined variables related to fall risk. Based on this index, I determined that transition steps have a greater fall risk than level, slope, and stair walking alone. By comparing the joint angle and muscle activity patterns of the transition steps to steps on the surfaces being transitioned between, I found that transition steps are not simply a midpoint between the two, but are more similar to a step on the new surface. This means that we are anticipating the demands of the new surface. I also found that these anticipatory changes are occurring at least 2 steps from the transition and that they scale with the demand of the new surface, i.e. angle of the slope. Overall, transition steps are a unique balance between the demands of the two surfaces being transitioned between. This leads to adaptations to the forces, joint positions, and muscle activity which may be related to the increased fall risk associated with transition steps.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5110], "author_name_tesi": "Sheehan, Riley Clifford", "last_name_ssi": "Sheehan", "middle_name_ssi": "Clifford", "first_name_ssi": "Riley", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jinger Gottschall", "Jinger Gottschall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jinger Gottschall, Thesis Advisor", "Jinger Gottschall, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Strategies", "EMG", "fall risk"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "physiological and environmental influences on hill locomotor strategies", "id": "19280", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9249", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While the majority of gait research is focused on flat, level surfaces, in everyday life individuals must navigate diverse and changing terrain. Thus it is important to investigate gait patterns on multiple surfaces, which is why this dissertation concentrates on hill walking and running as well as the transitions between level and hills. To this end, it was necessary to create a versatile, kinematic-based event detection algorithm that was capable of detecting foot strike and toe off times for multiple gaits at various surface angles. Besides detailing the specific strategies used, we sought to understand how physiological and environmental factors influence the strategies that individuals choose. Many researchers have suggested that the preferred stride frequency (PSF) is determined by mechanical factors. However, this view ignores muscles which are the primary consumers of metabolic energy during running. Thus, we investigated the role of muscle activity in influencing the PSF during downhill running. We found that the PSF may be determined by a tradeoff between the cost of muscle activity in the stance phase, which is greater at slower frequencies, and muscle activity in the swing phase, which is greater at faster frequencies. This balance would also explain why the PSF minimizes metabolic cost. It has also been shown that segment lengths affect level walking. Specifically, at the same speed, taller individuals take longer, slower steps. However, there have been no studies that investigate the influence of segment lengths on meeting the differing demands of hill walking. We found that during hill walking, muscle activity increases with decreasing shank length. This is likely due to either a smaller muscle compartment containing a smaller muscle which requires greater activation to produce the required force, or is related to shorter individuals walking at a relatively faster speed compared to their preferred speed. Older adults typically walk with a cautious gait pattern characterized by shorter steps, slower speeds, and wider base of support. In addition, age related loss of muscle mass and control result in weakness, especially in the ankle extensors which leads to additional gait modifications and compensations. Transitioning onto ramps has been shown to increase the risk of falling, and, in response, young adults employ similar cautious gait patterns. Thus, we wanted to determine how older adults, who are weaker and already cautious, handle the task of transitioning onto and off of ramps. We found that older adults exaggerate the transitions maintaining a cautious pattern, but modifying it in order to meet the demands of the transition. Besides greater fall risk, we found that during transition steps, individuals anticipate the demands of the future surface. However, we do not know what features of the ramp\u2014the angle, length, or plateau height\u2014influence our perception of the demands and ultimately what transition strategy we choose. We found that, though there are some modifications related to the total amount of work to be done, i.e. the length and height of the ramp, the angle of the ramp is the primary factor influencing the transition strategy. Overall, by focusing on the relationship between locomotor strategies and the factors that influence them, we hope to improve diagnostics and rehabilitation by approaching it as a matter of manipulating these factors through strength training or environment design.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9059], "author_name_tesi": "Sheehan, Riley Clifford", "last_name_ssi": "Sheehan", "middle_name_ssi": "Clifford", "first_name_ssi": "Riley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jinger Gottschall", "Jinger Gottschall", "Robert L Sainburg", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Matthew B Parkinson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jinger Gottschall, Dissertation Advisor", "Jinger Gottschall, Committee Chair", "Robert L Sainburg, Committee Member", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Member", "Matthew B Parkinson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["walk", "run", "treadmill", "kinematics", "kinetics", "EMG"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Knowledge Production and Transmission in an Agricultural Industry Cluster: The Poultry Business in South Central Pennsylvania", "id": "3r074t937", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12671", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "        In this study based in the poultry industry in south central Pennsylvania, I used a qualitative methodology and an ethnographic model to investigate three research questions\u2026\n\u2022\tAmong the people who are involved in the poultry industry in south central Pennsylvania, what is the impact of vertical integration on the knowledge production of producers?\n\u2022\tWhat is the nature of the community of practice that exists for the producer within the poultry industry? \n\u2022\tIn general, how do practitioners construct and apply knowledge that is produced inside and outside the community of practice?\n     Using a general interview guide, I conducted seven in-depth interviews, which I recorded and transcribed.

In East Asia, intellectual encounters conveyed by the Society of Jesus (members of which are referred to as Jesuits) constituted a crucial part of this significant history. This dissertation aims at tracing the hybridization process of religious ideas as a consequence of Jesuit encounters in two regions of East Asia: China and Korea.\n     Intellectual encounters with ideas conveyed by Jesuit missionaries have been recognized as having had a large influence on the introduction of the Western ideas. In addition, because the Jesuit mission strategy of accommodating Confucian thought enabled favorable recognition in Ming elite society and the court, Christian ideas were able to be successfully adapted into the intellectual sphere of China. However, researchers have not paid enough attention to the significance of the agency enjoyed by the Christian converts, who developed further hybridization of Catholic ideas into the Chinese intellectual milieu.\n     Therefore, this dissertation particularly aims to provide a comparative analysis of the early Catholic converts\u2019 apologetics texts. The primary focus of this dissertation project is examining the intellectual and religious discourses of Chinese Catholics during the seventeenth century and early eighteenth century. While largely influenced by Jesuit missionaries, the local Catholic discourse did not merely repeat Jesuit apologetics. The apologetics by converts, using religious/philosophical concepts and terms and, particularly, continuing the development of the thesis of buru yifo, meaning a complement of Confucianism and the replacement of Buddhism, by Xu Guangqi (1562-1633), Han Lin (1596-1649) and Zhang Geng (1570-?), Zhu Zongyuan (1616-1660), and Zhang Xingyao (1633-1715+), were some of the best examples of actively practicing hybridization even beyond the missionaries\u2019 intent. Chinese Catholics did not lose their agency for further hybridization until the rise of the Rites Controversy in the eighteenth century resulted in a strict ban on Jesuit accommodationism.\n     The agency of Catholic converts becomes even more apparent when we compare the earlier case of China with Chos\u014fn Korea, which has often been neglected in dealing with the Jesuit influence in early modern East Asia. The Catholic discourse by early Korean converts is another main focus of this dissertation. The elite society of late Chos\u014fn was closely linked with the Jesuit presence from the beginning of the seventeenth century. Despite the regional and chronological gap, we can observe that the earliest Korean converts in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, such as Ch\u014fng Yak-jong (1760-1801), Hwang Sa-y\u014fng (1775-1801), and Ch\u014fng Ha-sang (1795-1839), continued to develop hybridized ideas of Catholicism based on their interpretation of Jesuit publications. Apologetics and judicial testimonies attributed to them reveal that they also willingly took advantage of Jesuit accommodationism and enjoyed agency in their practice Catholicism.\n     The comparative study of intellectual discourse about Catholicism in China and Korea orients to a deeper understanding of connections and patterns in early modern East Asia within the context of the world history of Christianity. The consistent influence of Jesuit discourses is confirmed, particularly the paramount development of the Jesuit accommodation thesis, buru yifo, in both cases. Jesuit accommodation in China played a pivotal role in the initiation and development of Chinese Christian apologetics. In Korea, Jesuit books were crucial in allowing Christian ideas to be accepted, and the early Korean Catholics' apologetics hybridized the discourses according to their spiritual context. The story of persecution of Korean Catholics also shows that limiting accommodationism commonly resulted in a loss of opportunity to maintain religious tolerance in East Asia. Above all, we can see that, as long as Jesuit accommodationism survived, early modern Catholics in the two different regions of East Asia reproduced\u2014rather than replicated\u2014Christian apologetics of their own that were beyond the control of Western missionaries.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16515], "author_name_tesi": "Sheen, Joo Hyun", "last_name_ssi": "Sheen", "middle_name_ssi": "Hyun", "first_name_ssi": "Joo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ronnie Po-Chia Hsia", "On-Cho Ng", "Kate Merkel-Hess", "Kathlene T Baldanza", "Charlotte Diane Eubanks", "Ronnie Po-Chia Hsia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ronnie Po-Chia Hsia, Dissertation Advisor", "On-Cho Ng, Committee Member", "Kate Merkel-Hess, Committee Member", "Kathlene T Baldanza, Committee Member", "Charlotte Diane Eubanks, Outside Member", "Ronnie Po-Chia Hsia, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Religious hybridization", "The Society of Jesus", "Catholicism in China", "Catholicism in Korea", "Xu Guangqi", "Han Lin", "Zhang Geng", "Zhu Zongyuan", "Zhang Xingyao", "Ch\u014fng Yak-jong", "Hwang Sa-y\u014fng", "Ch\u014fng Ha-sang", "Matteo Ricci", "Tianzhu shiyi", "Jugyo yoji", "Pi wang", "Paeks\u014f", "buru yifo", "accommodationism", "Jesuits", "apologetics", "Catholicism and Confucianism"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "PREDICTING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CENSUS\nUSING TIME SERIES REGRESSION\n", "id": "8638", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4634", "abstract_tesi": "Hospital emergency departments (EDs) in the United States face increasing patient demand even as capacity declines, causing crowding and negatively affecting the patient experience.

We examined an extract of Hass avocado (Persea americana) seeds crushed in water as a potential source of natural orange colorants. The extract color is pH dependent, and can produce a range of colors from pale yellow near pH 2.5 to deep red and brown colors near pH 10. Treating the extract under alkaline conditions to pH 12.32 shifts the extract\u2019s color range towards the red end of the visible light spectrum. After treatment with alkali, the extract can produce rich orange colors even at low pH values near 2.5, while the native extract produces only pale yellow in this range.\nA polyphenol oxidase (PPO) catalyzed reaction produced the most abundant pigment in this extract, 2-(4-hydroxy-8-(2-((5-hydroxy-2-oxo-2,6,7,7a-tetrahydrobenzofuran-6-yl)oxy)ethyl)-5-oxo-6-((3,4,5,6-tetrahydroxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)methoxy)-5H-benzo[7]annulen-3-yl)acetic acid, or perseoranjin, which is a novel glycosylated benzotropolone compound with carboxylic acid and fused-ring butenolide containing side chains.

Although the primary interest of the research in the pulse detonation engine field is directed towards overcoming the problems associated with operating a pure PDE system, there are other worthy options to be considered for these engines.  The PDE driven ejector concept is one such option where the system would be part of a hybrid PD/Turbofan engine.  This system offers the promise of replacing the high-pressure turbine sections of the core of a high bypass turbofan engine.  The purpose of the current research is to investigate the thrust augmentation capabilities of a PDE driven ejector and provide experimental data that would assist in understanding the behavior of such a system.\nThe major potential advantages of the PDE-ejector include reduced costs due to the reduced engine weight, along with improved specific fuel consumption and specific power inherent in the incorporation of a PDE component. However, for the PDE-ejector system to become viable, the effect that various ejector geometries have on the configuration has to be understood.  There is currently insufficient data on the performance of such an ejector system to allow further development.  Some of the key issues can be resolved if suitable measurements of the thrust augmentation were available over a suitable parameter space.  \nTo achieve the goal of this research, the thrust augmentation of a PDE driven ejector was characterized for a set of configurations.  Two separate PDE\u2019s were utilized in this study.  The first PDE was capable of operating at a constant frequency of 10 Hz de to flow rate limitations, and another PDE built to have an operational frequency range of 10 Hz-70 Hz to test the effect of operational frequency on PDE-ejector systems.\nOptical diagnostics were employed at specific positions of interest to understand the physical behavior of the flow.  The thrust of the PDE operating alone, i.e. the baseline case, was measured first.  The baseline was the time averaged value of the thrust for the PDE operating at a various frequencies ranging from 10 Hz to 70 Hz and duration of 8 seconds with a propellant mixture comprising of ethylene/nitrogen/oxygen at 100% fills.  Line-of-sight laser absorption measurements of the fuel at the PDE tube exit were used to define the 100% fill condition and evaluate the PDE injector performance.  These baseline experimental results helped define and understand the operational characteristics of the PDE\u2019s utilized in this study.  \nThrust measurements were then made for PDE driven ejector configurations.  The parameters that were independently changed were the inlet geometry of a constant diameter ejector, as well as the overlap distance between the PDE tube exit and ejector tube inlet.  Ejectors of different size diameters were also tested and their performance documented.  It was found that increasing the ejector inner diameter provided better thrust augmentation for ejectors of the same length.  Then further study was devoted into the effects of varying the length of the ejector with the diameter providing the most thrust augmentation.  Along with the length, the inlet geometry of the ejector was also varied.  A rounded inlet was mounted on the ejector and the inlet\u2019s effect on thrust was recorded.  From these previous studies it was found that with a relatively short ejector having a rounded inlet, thrust augmentation up to 40% was possible.  Thus the effect of simply rounding the inlet caused a considerable increase in thrust production. Thus three different size rounded inlets are tested for thrust augmentation.  \nTo study the effect of frequency on PDE-ejector performance a PDE capable of operating at frequencies up to 70 Hz was assembled.  The thrust output of the PDE served as the baseline case and was measured for the various operating frequencies under study.  Thrust measurements were then made for PDE driven ejector configurations.  Four different ejectors with the same constant diameter but varying lengths were utilized.  The geometric parameters that were independently changed were the ejector inlet geometry, the overlap distance between the ejector and PDE tube exit, ejector tube length, and system operating frequency. Thrust augmentation levels of 120% were achieved with this system using the longest available ejector with a rounded inlet.\nA square ejector with plexi-glass sides allowing optical access into the ejector was designed. The ejector was designed to have the same hydraulic diameter as the round ejectors utilized. The ejector was first tested for thrust augmentation and proved to provide the same thrust augmentation trend as its round counterparts. Shadowgraph imaging was then used to observe the flow at various ejector locations for the duration of a single PDE cycle. These images provided insight into the behavior of the gas inside the ejector during a single detonation cycle. It was observed that the flow characteristics of the detonation cycle changes with the location of the ejector, where ejector position alters the blowdown process undergone by a PDE. It was also observed that the flow of secondary gas into the ejector tube starts earlier for the case of 25% ejector overlap position.  \nAlthough a lot of work is still to be done to understand the factors behind thrust enhancement in a PDE-ejector system, this work serves to explain and characterize some of the phenomena displayed by such systems and lay the foundation for future work into the subject.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5211], "author_name_tesi": "Shehadeh, Ra'fat ", "last_name_ssi": "Shehadeh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ra'fat", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert John Santoro", "Vigor Yang", "Richard A Yetter", "Michael Matthew Micci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert John Santoro, Committee Chair", "Vigor Yang, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Michael Matthew Micci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PDE", "Pulse Detonation Engine", "Ejector"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Moderators of Children's Food Liking and Intake", "id": "23648", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10426", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Children\u2019s food choices have long been assumed to be almost entirely driven by hedonics. Children are biologically driven to like tastes associated with high-energy foods but dislike bitter tastes often associated with nutrient dense foods. Better understanding of the relationship between food liking and intake and identifying parental influences on food liking and intake may help efforts to improve children\u2019s diet quality. To clarify the relationship between food liking and intake we determined correlations between children\u2019s food liking and intake in a cross-sectional, laboratory-based study of the strength of the relationship between liking and intake. In this study, 58 young children (mean: 5.44 +/- 0.8 years) attended two sessions in which they tasted and rated their liking of 7 foods and 2 beverages before eating self-selected, ad libitum test-meals. We found that the relationship between children\u2019s food liking and intake is more complex\nthan previous work and common assumptions indicate. Liking and intake of some foods were correlated, but overall, children\u2019s liking ratings did not significantly predict test meal intake. Mean liking and mean intake of low energy density foods (grapes, tomatoes, and broccoli) were moderately correlated (rho=0.28 p=0.03), but no significant relationship was found between mean liking and mean intake of high energy density foods (p=0.72). Contrary to our expectations, no relationship was found between combined liking scores for all test meal items and total meal intake (p=0.72).   Moderation analysis showed that the relationship between food liking and intake is influenced by sex (p=0.004), parental work status (p=0.041), and child weight status (p=0.007), with significant high energy density food liking/intake relationships among girls (r=0.46, p=0.02) but not boys (p=0.14) as well as among children with stay-at-home parents(r=-0.46, p=0.02) but not children of working parents (p=0.60).

The properties of these materials are subject to the conditions in which they are applied. Therefore, the properties must be measured in comparable high power testing environments in order to achieve relevant measurements. This dissertation addresses many topics related to the burst or transient method for measuring the properties of piezoelectric materials in high power conditions using a comprehensive approach. The burst method offers several advantages over other high power measurement methods, namely, appropriate application of linear theory, short measurement time, data collection over large range of vibration levels in single measurement, simplicity in experimental application, and no heat generation/temperature rise during measurement. \n\nThis dissertation provides the derivations for measurement of the fundamental material constants from resonance and antiresonance characterization, via the force factor A and the newly termed voltage factor B. The force factor is defined as the ratio between short circuit current and edge vibration velocity during natural vibration in short circuit conditions, corresponding to the electrical resonance condition. The voltage factor is defined as the ratio between open circuit voltage and edge displacement during natural vibration in open circuit conditions, corresponding to the electrical antiresonance condition. The resonance and antiresonance mode types are discussed relative to the velocity of sound in the direction of vibration and electromechanical coupling of the material. The derivations of the force factor and the voltage factor are provided for the k_{31}, k_{p}, and k_{33} extensional modes, beginning from the appropriate constitutive equations. The k_{31},k_{p}, and k_{33} piezoelectric resonators are among the most common vibration modes for ultrasonic applications. The force factor was found to be related to the piezoelectric stress coefficient e and the voltage factor was found to be related to the converse piezoelectric coefficient h.\n\nA complete methodology for calculating these material constants is explained, measuring the e,d, and s^{E} at resonance and k and h at antiresonance. The experimental method for achieving an open circuit condition with minimal circuitry is explained via an electromechanical relay. Extensive characterization of k_{31} samples of commercially available hard and soft PZT compositions was presented to demonstrate the impact of the technique. e, d, k and s^{E} was found to increase with vibration velocity, but h decreased with vibration velocity. Hard PZT demonstrated more stable properties than soft PZT. The quality factors in soft PZT immediately degrades with increasing vibration velocity; however, hard PZT maintains its high quality factor until a vibration velocity of 150 mm/s RMS, after which it's quality factors degrades as well. Notably, the method to determine the dielectric permittivity in high power conditions directly was considered and applied toward the experimental results. Previous methodologies assumed the permittivity in high power was constant and equal to its value measured in low power conditions at off resonance frequencies. The data shows that the clamped permittivity increases significantly with vibration velocity. The significance of this phenomenon with respect to clamping and extrinsic contributions from 180^{\\circ} and non-180^{\\circ} domain walls was discussed. The clamped permittivity for the k_{31} mode considers clamping in the 1-direction only; therefore, it can be understood that stress applied in the 1-direction will increase the domain wall motion contribution for properties in all directions.\n\nThe relationship between the elastic behavior under alternating stress of a PZT resonator and domain wall motion was analyzed using the Rayleigh law. Firstly, because existing Rayleigh law formulations in the literature apply only to a constant energy distribution, a new derivation describing the application of the law for a resonating sample, a sample with energy distribution, is performed. An effective RMS stress was used to complete the derivation, whereas the original Rayleigh law formulations utilize the maximum applied stress. The change in elastic compliance s_{11}^{E} with applied stress and the change in the elastic loss tangent \\tan\\phi_{11}^{'} with applied stress were related using the Rayleigh parameter \\alpha_{X}. This parameter describes the mobility of domain wall under an applied stress. Utilizing the traditional Rayleigh law, the elastic response for soft and hard PZT was analyzed. Soft PZT was found to have Rayleigh type behavior; however, hard PZT exhibited higher order nonlinearity until large stress levels.The elastic compliance of soft PZT increased linearly with applied stress, thereby matching the Rayleigh law well. Also, the Rayleigh parameter determined from the elastic loss behavior matched that of elastic compliance. This can verify the applicability of the Rayleigh law to the domain wall dynamics of the material. Hard PZT, however, had strong nonlinear behavior. Therefore, the Rayleigh region of the material started at a larger stress. For this material, the Rayleigh parameter determined from the elastic loss behavior did not match that of the elastic compliance. In order to address the discrepancy in hard PZT, the hyperbolic Rayleigh law was implemented. It accounts for reversible domain wall motion explicitly. It allows for the precise determination of the threshold stress as the ratio between the reversible domain wall contribution to the elastic compliance and the Rayleigh coefficient. It was found that the threshold stress of hard PZT is 9 times larger than that of the soft PZT measured. \n\nA new approach to determine the high power figure of merit, Q versus vibration velocity, was discussed using calculated vibration. The method draws off of the technique of using charge measurement to estimate the displacement of an off-resonance transducer. If the force factor or voltage factor measured from low power measurements is assumed to apply to high power conditions, the vibration velocity can be calculated by measuring current in resonance or voltage in antiresonance. Because the quality factor can change by a factor of 3 and the force factor and voltage factor changes less than 7% for large vibration velocities, the error caused by using calculated vibration is expected to be small. Using samples of hard and soft PZT  and k_{31} and k_{p} resonators, it was verified that the trend of Q vs. measured vibration velocity and calculated vibration velocity are nearly identical. Therefore, vibration does not need to be measured to determine the figure of merit: this reduces the experimental complexity, which makes the method more accessible to research and production environments. Because the resonance vibration distribution for k_{31} and k_{p} resonators are fundamentally different, the stored energy density in each resonator differs for a given edge vibration condition. Therefore, the method of comparing the k_{31} and k_{p} piezoelectric resonators using energy density was shown to equate quality factor measurements for hard and soft PZT. \n\nThe practical implications of this dissertation is that it furthers the utility of the burst mode measurement to analyze the high power properties of piezoelectric materials. The force factor and voltage factor analysis create a simple framework in which to calculate material properties from experimental measurements. The complete characterization of k_{31} mode piezoelectric resonators was shown to demonstrate the practical capability of the burst mode to provide comprehensive characterization of the electromechanical properties. The burst mode generates no temperature variation in the sample, therefore, scientific analysis of the properties from high power measurements can be correlated to internal stress levels. The Rayleigh law was specifically adapted to provide the method of analysis regarding reversible and irreversible domain wall motion. Finally, a simplified measurement approach to determine perhaps the most crucial high power figure of merit, quality factor versus vibration velocity, was presented using calculated vibration.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11952], "author_name_tesi": "Shekhani, Husain Naseem", "last_name_ssi": "Shekhani", "middle_name_ssi": "Naseem", "first_name_ssi": "Husain", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["piezoelectric", "high power", "PZT", "ceramic", "transducer"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Essays in Applied Microeconomics", "id": "2801pg33n", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12960", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My research interest lies in applying microeconomic tools to issues in Industrial Organization and Development Economics. I like doing research which helps me understand something about the world. For example, in my job market paper (Signalling, Reputation and Spinoffs), I study the following environment. Employees often leave their firm to form a new firm (spinoff) of their own. The literature attributes most of these spinoffs to the worker getting a private new idea. In this paper, I propose a different channel for new firm formation based on signalling and reputation concerns. If high ability workers are mistakenly perceived  to be low type then they would like to signal their ability to earn more. Consider a two period principal-worker problem where the worker's type is his private knowledge. If the prior belief about the worker's type is low (high type with low probability) then, despite the principal's ability to offer contracts to persuade the worker to stay, there may exist a separating equilibrium where the high type worker signals his ability by forming his own firm. This result provides theoretical support to the findings of Skogstrom (2012), who observed high rates of entrepreneurship amongst Norwegian workers with low education and high ability. When moral hazard is introduced into the environment, I show that the separating equilibrium may generate the highest incentives to work. This may have policy implications for non-compete clauses.\n\nMy paper on ethnic conflicts and rumours (Ethnic Conflicts, Rumours and an Informed Agent), with Pathikrit Basu and Souvik Dutta) studies coordination and strategic information disclosure in the context of ethnic conflicts. Rumours often precipitate ethnic conflicts and cause immense damage to life and property. There may exist an agent who knows if the rumour is true or false. We analyze a cheap talk game with multiple audiences (ethnicities) to see how this informed agent (b) may influence the outcome of rumours by sending strategic signals. Since b is biased towards her own ethnicity, she finds it difficult to convince the other ethnicity that she is giving them correct information. We show that even if b is known to be biased towards her own ethnicity, peace is possible in equilibrium. Additionally, we prove that there are only three equilibrium outcomes possible in symmetric strategies. Conflict is inevitable in one. The other outcomes have the following features. One, there may be peace whenever b deems it possible. Two, while b gives more informative signals to her own ethnicity, she may misinform a segment of her own ethnicity in equilibrium. \n\nIn another paper (What's in a Name? Reputation and Monitoring in the Audit Market), my co-author Somdutta Basu and I explore the difference in the incentives in a collective reputation environment as compared to an individual reputation environment in the context of the US Audit industry. Unlike audit reports in some countries, an audit\nreport issued in the USA does not include the name of the engagement\npartner. In December 2015, a new rule was passed (pending approval from the SEC) which requires that the name of the engagement partner be disclosed in audit reports issued after January 2017. We study the incentives of auditors under the two regimes - with\nand without disclosure of partner names. We argue that if the level\nof monitoring within the audit firm remains the same under the two\nregimes, then audit quality will be higher under the disclosure regime.\nHowever, an unintended consequence of the new rule is that partners (an engagement quality reviewer or a successor partner)\nhave lower incentives to monitor a fellow partner under the disclosure\nregime. As a result, under some parametric conditions, audit quality\nmay be lower if partner names are disclosed. This problem can be addressed\nthrough a realignment of incentives inside the accounting firm, external\nmonitoring from regulators or through increased audit fees. \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12105], "author_name_tesi": "Shekhar, Suraj ", "last_name_ssi": "Shekhar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suraj", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Edward James Green", "Kala Krishna", "Sona Nadenichek Golder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Dissertation Advisor", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "Kala Krishna, Committee Member", "Sona Nadenichek Golder, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Reputation", "Signalling", "Cheap Talk", "Collective Reputation", "Spinoffs", "Non-Compete Clauses", "Multiple Audiences"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Large-Eddy Simulations of Motored Flow and Combustion in a Homogeneous-Charge Spark-Ignition Engine", "id": "13827yss107", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13827", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cycle-to-cycle variations (CCV) of flow and combustion in internal combustion engines (ICE) limit their fuel efficiency and emissions potential.

New computational tools need to be developed that both maintain solution accuracy while minimizing the ever increasing computational cost in time and resources.\n\nThis dissertation presents a novel application of the recently developed hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) finite element method to the multi-physics simulation of coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems. Current applications of the HDG method are reviewed and shown to be limited in scope to single-physics scenarios; however, they do include both solid and fluid problems, which are necessary for FSI modeling. Utilizing these established models, HDG formulations for linear elastostatics, linear elastodynamics, nonlinear elastodynamics, Eulerian Navier-Stokes, and arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian Navier-Stokes are derived. The elasticity formulations are all written in a Lagrangian reference frame, with the nonlinear formulation restricted to hyperelastic materials.\n\nWith these individual solid and fluid formulations, the remaining challenge in FSI modeling is coupling together their disparate mathematics on the fluid-solid interface. In past work (Sheldon, 2012; Sheldon et al., 2014), a continuous Galerkin FSI model with a variety of coupling strategies was implemented, which greatly facilitated the process of creating a novel HDG FSI model. HDG FSI modeling comes with its own unique challenges, however, which are discussed and then addressed by modifications to the established component formulations. The resultant HDG FSI model is then presented.\n\nVerification of the component models, through the method of manufactured solutions, is performed and each model is shown to converge at the expected rate.

These fields are used most heavily during the fall and spring seasons. In the northeast United States (US), this time period coincides with the active growing season for cool-season turfgrass species. Field renovations often occur during the summer months and while not ideal for cool-season turfgrass establishment, this is typically the only portion of the growing season when fields are not in use. Selecting appropriate turfgrass species, cultivars, and maintenance practices that maximize traffic tolerance during this summer establishment period have not been thoroughly investigated. \n\nIn the northeast US, three turfgrass species are commonly used for athletic fields: Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub) [formerly Festuca arundinaceae Schreb.]. However, the establishment time varies between these species: perennial ryegrass < tall fescue < Kentucky bluegrass. Although perennial ryegrass establishes quickly from seed, this species may not perform as well as other species during the summer in the northeast US. During the summer, tall fescue has a greater tolerance for heat, drought, and is generally more disease resistant when compared to perennial ryegrass. Tall fescue may offer field managers a more heat tolerant alternative to the established practice of overseeding with perennial ryegrass.\n\nNew turf-type tall fescue cultivars are available that have greater tiller density and finer leaf texture compared to older cultivars. Increased tiller density has been correlated to increases in traffic tolerance; however, the establishment time required for tall fescue cultivars to develop traffic tolerance has not been investigated. Researchers have reported that more rapid turfgrass ground cover can be achieved by increasing seeding and nitrogen rates. For example, seeding above the standard recommended rates has been reported to increase perennial ryegrass traffic tolerance when traffic is initiated within three months after seeding. \n\nThe objectives of this research were to 1) compare the late summer/fall traffic tolerance of spring seeded perennial ryegrass and 11 tall fescue cultivars, 2) evaluate the influence of four seeding rates and three nitrogen regimes on the traffic tolerance of turf-type tall fescue 10 and 14 weeks after seeding, and 3) evaluate if the measurable turfgrass physiological characteristics, morphological characteristics, and shear strength can be used as a screening indicator to predict the traffic tolerance of tall fescue cultivars under various maintenance regimes.\n\nIn Experiment I, 11 tall fescue cultivars and one perennial ryegrass cultivar were established on a silt-loam soil in 2010 and 2011. The cultivars included \u2018RK4\u2019, \u2018Falcon V\u2019, \u2018Rebel IV\u2019, ATF 1376, \u2018Turbo\u2019, \u2018Shenandoah III\u2019, Kentucky-31, \u2018Justice\u2019, \u2018Firecracker LS\u2019, \u2018Rembrandt\u2019, \u2018Faith\u2019, and \u2018Fiesta IV\u2019 perennial ryegrass. All cultivar treatments were seeded on the same date in the late spring, regardless of the traffic treatment.\n\nSimulated traffic was applied from early August through late November using the Brinkman Traffic Simulator. Three traffic levels were used: 1) no traffic 2) traffic initiated 10 weeks after seeding, and 3) traffic initiated 14 weeks after seeding. Traffic was applied with 4 passes, three days per week. Both the 10- and 14-week traffic treatments ended on the same date in late November. Thus the 10-week traffic treatment received 4 additional weeks of traffic compared to the 14-week traffic treatment. \n\nPercent ground cover differences due to cultivar treatments were observed weekly from August through November of each year. When traffic was initiated 10 weeks after seeding, perennial ryegrass had higher traffic tolerance than all tall fescue cultivars. However, when traffic was initiated 14 weeks after seeding, all turf-type tall fescue cultivars had greater or equal traffic tolerance compared to perennial ryegrass. \u2018Turbo\u2019 was consistently among the top performing turf-type tall fescue cultivars. Differences in traffic tolerance were observed among the remaining 10 turf-type tall fescue cultivars, but these differences were small and not consistent from year to year.\n\nIn Experiment II, seeding rate treatments consisted of four rates of turf-type tall fescue, which were applied in either late May or early June. The seeding rates were 294, 490, 686, and 882 kg ha-1. Three nitrogen regimes were evaluated: 98.0, 220.5, and 343.0 kg N ha-1. All three regimes received approximately 98 kg N ha-1 at seeding due to the nitrogen released from Basamid. The nitrogen from the Basamid is the only nitrogen applied to one nitrogen regime treatment. This treatment is referred to as the 98 kg ha-1 nitrogen regime. In addition to the nitrogen from the Basamid, the 220.5 and 343.0 kg ha-1 nitrogen regimes received monthly applications of ammonium sulfate, which began 8 weeks after seeding when all plots had reached 100% ground cover. Simulated traffic was applied using the same method and intensity described in Experiment I.\n\nSeeding rate and nitrogen regime treatments influenced the traffic tolerance of turf-type tall fescue. The low nitrogen regime (98 kg ha-1) maximized traffic tolerance regardless of the seeding rate and traffic treatment. Seeding rates did not influence traffic tolerance when evaluated independently of nitrogen regimes and traffic treatments. However, during a dry-season, when the establishment period was limited to 10 weeks, traffic tolerance was affected by seeding rate and nitrogen regime combinations. A low seeding rate (294 kg ha-1) with a high nitrogen regime (343.0 kg ha-1) or high seeding rate (882 kg ha-1) with low nitrogen regime (98 kg ha-1) resulted in equally high traffic tolerance.\n\nThe morphological characteristics, leaf angle, tiller density, and verdure correlated with traffic tolerance when turf-type tall fescue cultivars were maintained equally. However, a consistently strong correlation between any one these characteristics and traffic tolerance was not evident. When morphological characteristics such as tiller density and leaf angle were influenced by seeding rate and nitrogen treatments, traffic tolerance was not increased.\n\nIn conclusion, limited research exists that evaluates the influence of seeding rate and nitrogen regime combinations on tall fescue traffic tolerance. The goal of this research was to determine if tall fescue is a viable option during summer establishment for athletic fields. Morphological and physiological characteristics that may explain traffic tolerance between tall fescue cultivars were also evaluated. Results of this study suggest that turf-type tall fescue is an acceptable alternative to perennial ryegrass when adequate summer establishment time exists prior to athletic field use. Generally, the seeding rates in this study did not positively or negatively influence traffic tolerance. The nitrogen fertility regime did have an influence on traffic tolerance; the lowest nitrogen regime (98 kg ha-1), applied all at once before seeding, consistently resulted in greater late summer/fall traffic tolerance. Athletic field managers that have at least a 14 week establishment period in the summer should consider using turf-type tall fescue to maintain turfgrass ground cover on their fields during the fall sporting season.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7272], "author_name_tesi": "Shelley, Michael Anthony", "last_name_ssi": "Shelley", "middle_name_ssi": "Anthony", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Scott Mc Nitt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Scott Mc Nitt, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tall fescue", "traffic tolerance", "athletic field"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "An Investigation of Sustainability Metrics in Industry to Aid Product Design, Production, and Distribution Processes\n", "id": "11374", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2640", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, resource depletion and amplified social pressures have increased environmental awareness to the point where companies must consider production and supply decisions from both ecological and economic points of view.

Experiments 2 and 3 find differential patterning of rising and falling diphthongs.  Experiment 4 tests the time course of phonological encoding and evidences differential treatment of both diphthong types across delays in a delayed naming task.  The data are interpreted as evidence in favor of sensitivity to a continuum of weight across the lexicon.  The findings challenge traditional approaches to syllable weight which call for a categorical, binary light/heavy distinction.  Rather, the results accord with a stochastic or probabilistic conception of the lexicon in which speakers of a language are able to track statistical patterns of extant combinations of sounds in order construct a phonological grammar that is gradient in nature.  Implications for two prominent psycholinguistic models of speech production (Levelt et al., 1999; Dell 1986, 1988) are also discussed.

The first essay examines bidding in U.S. Forest Service first price timber auctions in the Northern Region, where the potential for collusive bidding has been recognized. I modify the empirical methods in Porter and Zona (1993) and find a group of potentially cooperative (PC) bidders, who can submit complementary bids. Benefiting from a striking feature of data, where sealed bid auctions and ascending bid auctions were used side by side, I find further corroboration for my findings by analyzing PC bidders\u2019 bids in ascending bid auctions.\nThe second essay, joint with Shigeki Isogai, follows the empirical regularity noted by Marshall and Marx (2015). We present a reputation model in which a long-lived multi-product firm that is sequentially engaged in explicit collusion with short-lived single product firms can exploit the cartel leniency policy offered by\nantitrust enforcement authorities. The long-lived firm may have incentive to seek leniency to build and protect its reputation as a tough firm, who never tolerates any deviant conduct. This may help the long-lived firm deter deviations in the cartels. Our model provides a new insight on cartel firms\u2019 incentive to report their own cartel, a potential counterproductive effect of the leniency policy, and important policy implications to the design of the amnesty program.\nThe third essay analyzes the effect of an antitrust leniency program on the decision to merge or, alternatively, explicitly collude. Buyers use procurements but the procurement will be re-conducted when the buyer is dissatisfied with the bids of the incumbent sellers or a cartel is discovered. Additionally, production costs of\nthe sellers may change in each round of the procurement. If the production cost states in the first round are unprofitable, the sellers may switch to the re-conducted procurement by reporting the existence of the cartel and committing to act noncollusively through leniency applications. Thus, sellers that were indifferent between merging and forming a cartel with no leniency program may prefer colluding in the first round procurement in the presence of a leniency program. So a leniency program may induce both more discovery of cartels as well as more cartel formation.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14610], "author_name_tesi": "Shen, Chaohai ", "last_name_ssi": "Shen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chaohai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Clifford Marshall", "Robert Clifford Marshall", "Sung Jae Jun", "Vijay Krishna", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Clifford Marshall, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Clifford Marshall, Committee Chair", "Sung Jae Jun, Committee Member", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Timber auction", "Leniency policy", "Bidder collusion", "Collusion detection", "Procurement"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Early Childhood Educators' Perceptions of Quality and School Climate in Preschool Programs\n", "id": "6788", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1303", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-09-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary purpose of this study was to investigate preschool teachers\u00a1\u00a6 perceptions of early childhood program quality and school climate for the programs in which these teachers worked.

The Si radial junction structure can be realized by forming radial p-n junctions on Si pillar/wire arrays that have a diameter comparable to the minority carrier diffusion length.  With proper design, the Si pillar arrays are also able to enhance light trapping and thereby increase the light absorption.  However, the larger junction area and surface area on the pillar arrays compared to traditional planar junction Si solar cells makes it challenging to fabricate high performance devices due an in increase in surface defects.  Therefore, effective surface passivation strategies are essential for radial junction devices.  \nHydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) using a heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer (HIT) structure has previously been demonstrated as a very effective surface passivation layer for planar c-Si solar cells.  It is therefore of interest to use a-Si:H in a HIT layer structure for radial p-n junction c-Si pillar array solar cells.  This poses several challenges, however, including the need to fabricate ultra-thin a-Si:H layers conformally on high aspect ratio Si pillars, control the crystallinity at the a-Si:H/c-Si interface to yield a low interface state density and optimize the layer thicknesses, doping and contacts to yield high performance devices.\n\tThis research in this thesis was aimed at developing the processing technology required to apply the HIT structure to radial junction Si pillar array solar cell devices and to evaluate the device characteristics.  Initial studies focused on understanding the effects of process conditions on the growth rate and conformality of a-Si:H deposited by PECVD using SiH4 and H2 on high aspect ratio trench structures.  Experimentally, it was found that the a-Si:H growth rate increased with increasing SiH4 flow rate up to a point after which it saturated at a maximum growth rate.  In addition, it was found that higher SiH4 flow rates resulted in improved thickness uniformity along the trenches.  A model based on gas transport and surface reaction of SiH3 in trenches was developed and was used to explain the experimental results and predict conditions that would yield improved thickness uniformity.  \n\tThe knowledge gained in the PECVD deposition studies was then used to prepare HIT radial junction Si pillar array solar cell devices.  Deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) was used to prepare Si pillar arrays on p-type (111) c-Si wafers. A process was developed to prepare n-type a-Si:H films from SiH4 and H2, with PH3 as doping gas.  Indium tin oxide (ITO) deposited by sputter deposition and Al-doped ZnO deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) were evaluated as transparent conductive top contacts to the n-type a-Si:H layer.  By adjusting the SiH4/H2 gas flow ratio, intrinsic a-Si:H was grown on the c-Si surface without epitaxial micro-crystalline growth. Continuous and pulsed deposition modes were investigated for deposition of the intrinsic and n-type a-Si:H layers on the c-Si pillars.  The measurements of device light performance shown that slightly lower short circuit current density (Jsc\uff0c32 mA/cm2 to 35 mA/cm2) but higher open circuit voltage (Voc, 0.56 V to .47 V) were obtained on the pulsed devices.  As the result, higher efficiency (11.6%) was achieved on the pulsed devices (10.6% on the continuous device).  The improved performance of the pulsed deposition devices was explained as arising from a higher SiH3 concentration in the initial plasma which lead to a more uniform layer thickness.\n\tPlanar and radial junction Si wire array HIT solar cell devices were then fabricated and the device performance was compared.  A series of p-type c-Si wafers with varying resistivity/doping density were used for this study in order to evaluate the effect of carrier diffusion length on device performance.  The saturation current densities (J0) of the radial junction devices were consistently larger than that of the planar devices as a result of the larger junction area.  Despite the increased leakage currents, the radial junction HIT cells exhibited similar Voc compared to the planar cells.  In addition, at high doping densities (5\u00d71018 cm-3), the Jsc (16.7mA/cm2) and collection efficiency (6.3%) of the radial junction devices was higher than that of comparable planar cells (Jsc 12.7 mA/cm2 and efficiency 5.2%), demonstrating improved collection of photogenerated carriers in this geometry.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9537], "author_name_tesi": "Shen, Haoting ", "last_name_ssi": "Shen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Haoting", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Jeffrey Brownson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Dissertation Advisor", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Brownson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["solar cell", "amorphous silicon", "PECVD", "photovoltaic", "nanowire", "silicon"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "BLACK HOLE-BULGE RELATIONSHIPS IN\nBROAD-LINE ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI\n", "id": "7978", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3225", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The formation and evolution of galaxies in the universe is still poorly understood.  Possible clues have come recently from studies of the apparent connection between galaxies and the massive black holes (BH) that most galaxies harbor. Historically, it has been difficult to determine both galaxy and central black hole properties for all but a small fraction of galaxies. In this thesis, spectroscopic and imaging decompositon techniques are applied to a large sample of active galaxies to simultaneously determine the host galaxy and central BH properties. The large sample size allows statistical tests to be applied to the host/black hole relationships that have not been possible previously.\n\nUsing an eigenspectrum decomposition technique, we separated the host galaxy from the broad line active galactic nucleus (AGN) in a set of 4666 spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), from redshifts near zero up to about 0.75. A sub-sample of over 900 active galaxies with high quality spectra and host galaxy dominated by an early-type (bulge) component was selected to study the host-BH relatioships. The sub-sample\nBH masses (MBH) (estimated by the decomposed AGN spectra), the host stellar velocity dispersions (sigma_*) and host luminosities (measured by the decomposed host galaxy spectra) are all correlated, similar to the relationships found for low-redshift, bulge-dominated galaxies.\n\nAs a complement to the spectroscopic study, we performed a two-dimensional imaging decomposition analysis that separates the AGN and bulge components. With the host galaxy effective radius R_e and host galaxy photometric luminosity L_H measured from the host galaxy image, we reevaluated the correlations between the AGNs and host galaxies. Our very large sample size allows tight constraints to be placed on the mean\nrelationships. The correlations among M_{BH}, sigma_*, and L_H in the r band are: L_H ~ {sigma_*}^{4.18+-0.27} (a Faber-Jackson relation), M_{BH} ~L_H^{0.78+-0.06} and M_{BH} ~ {sigma_*}^{3.68+-0.35}.\n\nThe study of active galaxy BH and host connection in this thesis suggests some coevolution facts of the BH and the host galaxy. The host galaxies at redshifts up to z ~ 0.3 should be fully formed early-type galaxies, indicated from their following of the standard galaxy Faber-Jackson relationship. The correlations of the active galaxy relationships of M_{BH} with L_H and sigma_* indicate that the BH growth and the galaxy formation are coupled processes, and the lower power-law index indicates that the relative\ngrowth rate of the BHs are faster than that of the bulge.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3212], "author_name_tesi": "Shen, Jiajian ", "last_name_ssi": "Shen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiajian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald P Schneider", "Daniel Vanden Berk", "Pablo Laguna", "Derek Brindley Fox", "Douglas Cowen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald P Schneider, Committee Chair", "Daniel Vanden Berk, Committee Member", "Pablo Laguna, Committee Member", "Derek Brindley Fox, Committee Member", "Douglas Cowen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Host Galaxy", "Active Galactic Nuclei", "Black Hole", "Spectral and Imaging decomposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Molecular Depth Profiling and Chemical Imaging with Cluster ToF-SIMS", "id": "26406", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11696", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The work presented in this dissertation is concentrated on improving the fundamental understanding of molecular depth profiling and chemical imaging associated with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) equipped with cluster ion sources, mainly C60 and argon gas cluster ion beams (Ar-GCIBs).

This unusual mode of viral transcription activation was designated readthrough activation and identified by genetic manipulation of the mouse bmaj-globin gene transcription termination sequence (GGT) inserted into the E1a gene. To further investigate the nature of readthrough activation, the activity of GGT and a composite termination sequence CT were tested in recombinant adenoviruses containing luciferase reporters driven by the E1b promoter. There was a strict correlation between readthrough and substantial downstream gene expression. Substitution of the human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early promoter for the E1b promoter suppressed the requirement for readthrough. These results suggest that readthrough activation is a \u201clocal\u201d effect of a direct interaction between the invading transcription elongation complex and the E1b promoter. To investigate whether readthrough activation depends on the context of the adenovirus genome, two kinds of reporters, containing the luciferase gene (Luc) or the green fluorescence protein gene (GFP), were used to demonstrate E1b promoter activity in the context of transient transfection. The results indicated that insertion of GGT increased the expression of E1b-Luc reporter gene even though readthrough transcription was blocked by the insertion. However, GGT did not affect E1b-GFP expression in context of transiently transfected templates. As a further extension of the work, it was tested whether readthrough affected downstream gene expression in the context of the same reporter constructs integrated into the cellular genome in stably transformed cell lines. It was shown that insertion of GGT reduced E1b-GFP gene expression, and mutating GGT relieved the inhibition. RNA analysis showed that the GGT insertion blocked readthrough transcription from the integrated DNA template. In addition, viruses were re-constructed with E1b-GFP reporter gene to provide a control for experiments that used the GFP reporter in the context of transiently transfected and integrated templates. It was found that GGT reduced readthrough transcription but did not affect E1b-GFP expression in the adenovirus genome. These results suggest that a particular chromatin structure at the E1b promoter of the virus genome, and perhaps in chromosomal copies of the E1 gene, probably is required to mediate the readthrough activation mechanism. We also found that choice of reporter gene could influence the effect of readthrough activation.

This dissertation is devoted to the exploration of two graphene related studies: the influence of an amorphous silica substrate on a graphene field effect transistor (FET) and the properties of chemically modified graphene structures with fluorination.\nThe study of the effect of an amorphous silica substrate on a single graphene layer is interesting since a silicon wafer with thermally grown amorphous silica is commonly used as the substrate for graphene FET devices. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the silica substrate induces a charge transfer to the graphene layer due to surface states of the amorphous silica. The intrinsic n-doping of the graphene is confirmed by the experimental studies of our collaborators. We further propose simple potential profile models to estimate the density of the surface states necessary to explain the magnitude of the observed Dirac Voltages in experiment.\nOpening a band gap in graphene is also important to its electronic applications. One possible gap-opening method is through chemical functionalization with fluorine atoms. Fluorinating certain regions of graphene can transform the carbon atoms in graphene from sp2 to sp3 hybridization, which converts highly conductive graphene into an insulator. We propose the formation of a graphene channel embedded in graphene monofluoride to confine the carriers in graphene. We have studied the electronic structures of two symmetrically orientated graphene channels with armchair or zig-zag boundaries through DFT and tight-binding (TB) calculations. The armchair channel is found to be metallic or semiconducting depending on the width of the channel. The zigzag channel is found to have dispersive edge bands which are due to the lowering of the site energy of edged carbon compared to the non-edged carbon. We further calculate the local density of states (LDOS) of the edged and non-edged carbon atoms and estimate the charge difference between them. Analysis of the LDOS confirms the site energy drop in the edge carbon since it has more electrons than that of the non-edged carbon atom.\nAtomic fluorine plasma is found to be an effective method to fluorinate graphene by experimentalists. In order to achieve a better understanding of the fluorination process of graphene and the stability of the generated fluorinated structures, we further explore the interactions between atomic fluorine atoms and graphene through DFT calculations and find the diffusion barriers for isolated fluorine ad-atoms and fluorine atom pairs on graphene. We find that the diffusion barrier of isolated fluorine ad-atom is about 0.3eV while the diffusion barrier of fluorine atom increases to about 1eV when there is another fluorine atom nearby. This indicates that diffusion becomes more difficult when fluorine atoms start assembling together which suggests the stability of the boundary of graphene and graphene monofluoride structures\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4707], "author_name_tesi": "Shen, Ning ", "last_name_ssi": "Shen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ning", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Jorge O Sofo", "Milton Walter Cole", "Tom Mallouk", "Melik C Demirel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Dissertation Advisor", "Jorge O Sofo, Committee Chair", "Milton Walter Cole, Committee Member", "Tom Mallouk, Committee Member", "Melik C Demirel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["graphene fluoride", "density functional theory", "graphene", "edge states"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Molecular Phylogenetic Analysis of Grifola frondosa (Maitake) and Related Species and the Influence of Selected Nutrient Supplements on Mushroom Yield \n", "id": "5845", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5069", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Grifola frondosa (Dickson: Fr.) S.F.Gray (maitake) is a choice edible mushroom and has been marketed in Asia in recent years for medicinal use.  Production and consumption of this mushroom is increasing rapidly in the world.  There was a 41-fold increase from 1988-97 worldwide and a 38% increase in the United States (1999-2000).  \nWhile this mushroom has enjoyed increased popularity among consumers, scientists know little about the genetics and life history of this species.  I, therefore, sought to quantify genetic diversity among available isolates and to establish a taxonomic position for this mushroom and some of its allies.  To accomplish these goals, the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS-1 and 2) and 5.8S regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcriptional unit and a portion of the b-tubulin gene were PCR-amplified.  Then, rDNA and b-tubulin amplicons from 52 isolates of Grifola frondosa, one isolate of Grifola sordulenta, Polyporus umbellatus and Meripilus giganteus were sequenced.  In both rDNA and b-tubulin sequences, nucleotide variation within isolates of G. frondosa (5.4% in rDNA and 12.2% in b-tubulin) was relatively small compared to that observed between isolates of G. frondosa and G. sordulenta (14.3% in rDNA and 30.2% in b-tubulin).  Molecular phylogenetic analysis of rDNA, b-tubulin and combined sequences revealed two major clades within G. frondosa.  Clade I (U.S. clade) included all the U.S. isolates, while Clade II (Asian clade) consisted only of Asian isolates.  The major commercial isolate (unknown origin) used on most U.S. mushroom farms grouped within the Asian clade and is apparently of Asian decent.  Based on partial b-tubulin sequence, phylogenetic analyses indicated that G. frondosa and its allies (G. sordulenta and P. umbellatus) share a common ancestor.\nTo assist with the demand of commercial growers for isolates with improved yield and quality characteristics, I evaluated 23 genotypes of Grifola frondosa for crop cycle time, biological efficiency (BE; ratio of fresh weight of mushroom harvested to dry weight of substrate x 100) and quality.  Significant differences among lines were found for these parameters when mushrooms were produced on nutrient supplemented sawdust substrates.  Four isolates (WC828, M036, M037 and M040) were found to have the most consistent and highest BEs (38.5%, 39.5%, 35.8% and 38.9%, respectively) and quality (1.2, 1.3, 1.4 and 1.2, respectively).\nIn order to determine the effects of nutrient supplements on mushroom crop cycle, BE and quality, different combinations of wheat bran, rye, millet and corn meal were evaluated.  Combinations of two or three nutrients selected from wheat bran, millet and rye were found to be the most desirable formulations with short crop cycle, high quality and high BE.\nSignificant differences for crop cycle times, BEs and quality also were found when different combinations of wheat bran, rye and millet at different levels (10%, 20% and 30% of total dry substrate wt) were used.  The combination of 10% wheat bran, 10% millet and 10% rye (BE 47.1%, quality 1.8 and crop cycle 12 weeks) and the combination of 10% wheat bran plus 20% rye (BE 44%, quality 1.7 and crop cycle 10 weeks) gave the most consistent yields and basidiome quality over time.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5045], "author_name_tesi": "Shen, Qing ", "last_name_ssi": "Shen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Robert Huff", "Daniel J Royse", "Charles Peter Romaine", "John Ayers", "David Michael Geiser"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Robert Huff, Committee Member", "Daniel J Royse, Committee Chair", "Charles Peter Romaine, Committee Member", "John Ayers, Committee Member", "David Michael Geiser, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["quality", "nutrient", "yield", "genotype", "rDNA", "Grifola", "beta-tubulin", "molecular phylogeny"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATION OF THE BRAIN SUBSTRATES OF\nANXIOUS DEPRESSION\n\n", "id": "12127", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5070", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) exhibits extensive comorbidity with anxiety and poorly predictable responsiveness to different types of antidepressant drugs. In particular, melancholic MDD shows great reductions in GABA, aberrant function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis as well as characteristics of anxious depression. \n\nMice that are heterozygous for the &#947;2 subunit gene of GABAARs (&#947;2+/&#8722;) exhibit a modest functional deficit in GABAARs, yet they have been shown to recapitulate behavioral, pharmacological, and cognitive alterations reminiscent of anxiety disorders. In addition, this phenotype of &#947;2+/&#8722; mice includes increased behavioral passivity under stressful conditions, as expected of an animal model of mood disorders. Conditional knockdown of the &#947;2 subunit in the embryonic telencephalon was shown to result in anxious-depressive behavior similar to that of &#947;2+/- mice that carry the mutation in the germ line. By contrast, a comparable forebrain-specific &#947;2 subunit deficit that was delayed to the fourth postnatal week and limited to mature neurons was without anxiety- or depressive-like consequences. These findings are consistent with evidence that the vulnerability for anxiety and mood disorders is established early in life, and that they represent developmental disorders.\n\nIn this thesis I embarked on further analyzing the brain substrate of anxious depression. In particular, I investigated putative HPA axis deficits and the behavioral and endocrine responsiveness of &#947;2+/&#8722; mice to treatment with serotonin (5-HT)- and norepinephrine (NE)-selective reuptake inhibitors. In addition, I investigated the critical developmental periods responsible for anxious depressive like behavior of &#947;2+/&#8722; mice in adulthood \n\nWe found that the baseline corticosterone concentration of adult &#947;2-deficient mice was elevated independent of whether the genetic lesion was induced during embryogenesis or delayed to adolescence. However, the manifestation of anxious-depressive behavior in different &#947;2-deficient mouse lines was correlated with early onset HPA axis hyperactivity during postnatal development. Chronic but not subchronic treatment of &#947;2+/- mice with fluoxetine or desipramine normalized the anxiety-like phenotype in the novelty suppressed feeding test. Moreover, desipramine had antidepressant-like effects in that it normalized HPA axis function and depression-related behavior of &#947;2+/- mice in the forced swim, tail suspension, and sucrose consumption tests. By contrast, fluoxetine was ineffective as an antidepressant and failed to normalize HPA axis function. Collectively, these data indicate that developmental deficits in GABAergic inhibition may cause behavioral and endocrine abnormalities and selective antidepressant drug responsiveness indicative of anxious-depressive disorders such as melancholic depression, which are frequently characterized by HPA axis hyperactivity and greater efficacy of desipramine versus fluoxetine.\n\nTowards elucidating the developmental substrate of pathological anxiety and depression, we first used a chemically inducible knockout strategy to irreversibly reduce the GABAAR &#947;2 subunit gene dosage at different time points of postnatal brain development. Second, we used potentiation of GABAAR function with diazepam in &#947;2-deficient and WT mice to disturb normal activity-dependent brain development during defined temporal windows (critical developmental periods). Reducing the function of GABAARs by hemizygous inactivation of the &#947;2 gene at postnatal day (P)13/14 but not P27/28 was sufficient to induce anxious-depressive-like behavior in adulthood. Potentiation of GABAARs by treatment of wild-type mice with diazepam from P10-21 and P29-35 had selective anxiogenic- and depressant-like effects, respectively on behavior in adulthood. In addition, diazepam treatment from P10-21 had antidepressant-like effects on behavior in adulthood independent of genotype. Collectively, the data indicate that anxiety- and depression-related behavioral traits of &#947;2+/- mice are independently controlled by distinct postnatal critical periods that are sensitive to both genetic impairment and pharmacological potentiation of GABAergic transmission via &#947;2 subunit-containing GABAARs.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5046], "author_name_tesi": "Shen, Qiuying ", "last_name_ssi": "Shen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qiuying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher", "Bernhard Luscher", "Douglas Cavener", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Debashis Ghosh", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Robert Paulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher, Dissertation Advisor", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Chair", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HPA axis", "GABA", "anxious depression", "critical period"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Dimensional Analysis in Statistics: Theories, Methodologies and Applications", "id": "26768", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11890", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dimensional Analysis (DA) is a well-developed widely-employed methodology in the physical and engineering sciences. It features advantages such as (1) the reduction of the number of factors, (2) the interpretability of the variables, and (3) the scalability of results. However, few researches in statistical literature offer a comprehensive view on incorporating DA in statistical problems. This dissertation is among the first few which aim at a thorough study on both the practical benefits and theoretical development of statistical design and analysis in random and deterministic experiments. We first introduce the physical background and the formal procedure of DA. A literature review of DA applications in various disciplines is provided, including recent literature in statistics. The need for new statistical treatment incorporating DA is established. Next, the main body of the dissertation is divided into two parts: applications and theories. In the applications part, we begin from physical studies with random errors. We examine the benefits of implementing DA in statistical analysis and design of experiment, and conclude with the advantages and potential issues. Then, we move to deterministic experiments and conduct a study on applying DA in computer experiments. Both design and analysis phases are discussed with detailed case studies to show when DA works and when it does not. Through the applications, we clearly observe the merits of combining DA (as physical knowledge) in empirical studies. Meanwhile, the statistical mechanism behind DA transformation has still not been well understood. Therefore, in the theory part, we first present a new statistical perspective on DA through properties in terms of invariance, sufficiency and completeness. Then, in order to solve the potential issues in modeling DA variables, a new type of modeling methodology is proposed along with its corresponding inference procedures. The established solution unifies the physical knowledge from DA and the empirical knowledge from data in a clear and controllable way, providing both practical guidance and theoretical insights in general. Although far from an all-round study on applying DA in statistical problems, this dissertation contributes among the first few to formally treat DA from statistical points of view.

This is a developing consensus view among scholars who have studied play and playfulness over the past several decades. Theoretical development and empirical studies of playfulness, however, have been seriously hampered by the lack of a sound conceptualization and a valid, reliable measure of playfulness. \nThe purpose of this research was to examine playfulness in adults as a personality trait, including its conceptualization, measurement, and relationships to psychological well-being. An integrated interactionist approach was used to inform the entire process of theoretical development, including the conceptualization of trait as internal psychological quality that is strictly distinguished from its overt behavioral manifestations, and the proposition of studying playfulness in context in order to understand its coherent functioning in daily life.  \nA theory-based conceptualization of adult playfulness was first developed, which defined the trait as characterized by three interrelated, relatively stable motivational and cognitive qualities that underlie the tendency to engage in playful behavior: fun-loving motivation, uninhibitedness, and spontaneity. Guided by this conceptualization and following a systematic psychometric approach, a self-report instrument was developed, refined, and validated through multiple studies, including focus groups, expert review, conceptual back-translation, a scale development study, and a known group comparison study. The resultant Adult Playfulness Trait Scale (APTS) is a 19-item uni-dimensional measurement that consists of three sub-scales, each assessing one playfulness dimension. Aside from adequate face validity and content validity established through literature reviews, logical analyses, and conceptual evaluation, supporting empirical evidence was found for the scale\u2019s internal consistency reliability, structure validity, predictive validity, convergent validity, concurrent validity, and differentiation ability. \nAs part of the effort to construct an interactionist theoretical framework for playfulness research, two additional measurements were developed following a similar procedure: the 6-item Psychological Situation for Play Scale (PSPS) and the 17-item Playful State Scale (PSS).

With the conceptual and measurement tools provided by this framework, researchers may start to investigate the trait effects vs. situational effects in predicting playful behavior, how relevant situational factors motivate/demotivate play, the long-term/short term effects of play and playfulness, whether individuals with different levels of playfulness interpret or approach a life situation differently, and if yes, how. Finally, practical implications were discussed in areas of personnel decisions, recreational product design, programming, and therapeutic service. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6684], "author_name_tesi": "Shen, Xiangyou ", "last_name_ssi": "Shen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiangyou", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Garry Chick", "Harry C Zinn", "Garry Chick", "Linda L Caldwell", "Melvin Michael Mark"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Garry Chick, Dissertation Advisor", "Harry C Zinn, Committee Chair", "Garry Chick, Committee Chair", "Linda L Caldwell, Committee Member", "Melvin Michael Mark, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adult playfulness", "play", "personality trait", "measurement", "psychological well-being"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ROLE OF INFORMATION IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET: THE CASE OF THE FRACKING BOOM", "id": "g445cd139", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12830", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When an exogenous force, such as policy change or natural disaster, occurs and changes an economic environment, it also creates an excellent opportunity to study how different market participants react to uncertainties.

Bioinspired artificial water channels combine the high permeability and selectivity of biological aquaporin (AQP) water channels with chemical stability, opening the possibility to develop bioinspired channel-based materials for separations that utilize their unique transport properties. \nThis work first focused on developing methods to characterize the molecular transport of artificial water channels. Peptide-appended pillar[5]arene (PAP) artificial water channels were found to have a single-channel water permeability of 1.0(\u00b10.3)\u00d710\u221214 cm3/s or 3.5(\u00b11.0)\u00d7108 water molecules per second, which is in the range of AQPs (3.4\u223c40.3\u00d7108 water molecules per second) and their current synthetic analogs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs, 9.0\u00d7 108 water molecules per s). PAP channels were also found to self-assemble into 2D arrays in lipid membranes, with a pore density (\u223c2.6\u00d7105 pores per \u03bcm2) two orders of magnitude higher than that of CNT membranes (0.1\u223c2.5\u00d7103 pores per \u03bcm2). \nAnother artificial water channel (imidazole-quartet channel) formed a 2.6 \u00c5 pore encapsulating oriented dipolar water-wires in a confined chiral conduit via self-assembly of imidazole-based molecules in lipid bilayers. They mimic the selective filter of M2 proton channel from Influenza A and transport ~106 water molecules per second and reject all ions except protons. \nPAP artificial water channels could also be incorporated into block copolymer (BCP) membranes and have shown the same high water conductance as observed in native lipid membranes. Despite of the less favorable interaction with poly(butadiene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PB-PEO) BCPs due to chemical hydrophobic mismatch, PAP channels could be densely packed into polymer membranes through a controlled dialysis-based self-assembly when physical hydrophobic mismatch is minimized. The packing density is found to be of the same magnitude as observed in 2D arrays of PAP channels in lipids. This completely artificial material that possesses aquaporin-like permeability and maintains chemical and mechanical stability can be potentially used for the next-generation filtration materials. \nIn order to be more scalable for membrane fabrication, a solvent cast-based method was developed to fabricate a polymer film with PAP artificial water channels incorporated. Using a sacrificial water-soluble layer, the PB-PEO film, with a thickness of 20-30 nm, can be floated on water and transferred to another substrate after crosslinking. The cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy images implied a possible lamellar structure and the presence of PAP channels was confirmed by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. Future work should focused on using these channel-based BCP membranes for gas and liquid separations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12619], "author_name_tesi": "Shen, Yuexiao ", "last_name_ssi": "Shen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuexiao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Manish Kumar", "Manish Kumar", "Andrew Zydney", "Darrell Velegol", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Manish Kumar, Dissertation Advisor", "Manish Kumar, Committee Chair", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Artificial water channels", "Biomimetic membranes", "Desalination"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Spontaneous emission control and nanoscale transport in optoelectronic devices", "id": "13730yzs133", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13730", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation summarizes our work during the past five years at the Pennsylvania State University. \n\n\nThe first two chapters are introductory materials covering the physics behind the field of organic optoelectronics. In Chapter 1, we gave a general introduction of the emergence of organic semiconductors, where the properties of organic materials are compared with its inorganic counterparts. Moreover, some of the basic processing techniques relating to dissertation are also presented. \n\n\nChapter 2 discusses the physics behind organic semiconductors, which is to some extend dramatically distinct from crystalline condensed matter systems. We first introduce molecular quantum mechanics, and the notion of bonding in organic systems. Then, excited state properties, which is essential for chapter 4, is analyzed in great detail. Following that, we present some of the physical properties of excitons, which is the focus for optoelectronic devices. Finally, we discuss charge transport features inside organics, which is significant later in chapter 5. \n\n\nChapter 3 is our work on spatial control of spontaneous emission, and the application in solar concentration. We introduce our design principles in section 3.2, and demonstrating our major results in 3.3, where a solar concentration boost factor of 3.6x is realized. We discuss the CPO array performances and the recycling effect in the following sections in this chapter. \n\n\nChapter 4 introduced our work in the temporal-domain management of spontaneous emission. We enhanced the upper excited state emission ($ S_2\\rightarrow S_0 $) from an organic molecule, ZnTPP, relative to the ground state emission ($ S_1\\rightarrow S_0 $) by a factor of 18, through embedding the molecule inside of a hyperbolic metamaterial (HMM). The HMM greatly increases the photonic density of states experienced by the molecules, and those photons are later on scattered out by a randomly formed top-layer surface roughness. \n\n\nChapter 5 demonstrates our results in extending kinetic Monte Carlo simulations in an operating organic light-emitting diode (OLED). We first present the details of our simulation, and then discuss in detail three types of organic devices: unipolar device (section 5.3), bilayer OLED (5.4) and double heterojunction OLED (5.5). We observe the electric current have filamentary conduction features in all three devices, and we demonstrated this filamentation results in a worse device performances in both efficiency roll-off and device degradation.

Among major battery chemistries, Lead (Pb)-Acid batteries are a low-cost power source for applications ranging from hybrid and electric vehicles (HEVs) to large-scale energy storage. Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion) batteries\nare also widely used in multiple applications such as HEV and EV to supply power to motors because of their high energy and power density and low weight. This research addresses four important problems for e\u000ecient utilization of large-scale battery systems: control-oriented modeling, State-Of-Charge (SOC) estimation, State-Of-Health (SOH) estimation, and parameter estimation. Lead-Acid batteries are investigated in the areas of modeling and model-based SOC/SOH estimation.\nSolid phase di\u000busivity of a Li-Ion cell is measured as a study of battery parameter\nestimation. Efficient simulation, design and management systems require the development\nof low order but accurate models. Previous e\u000borts to manage battery systems are based on equivalent circuit models, which are low-order models using an equivalent circuit to approximate the battery's response. These models do not describe the\nunderlying electrochemical processes taking place in the battery. At the other\nend of the spectrum, it is also found that while full order \frst principles models\nprovide reliable prediction and comprehensive understanding on multiple variables\nof interest (i.e, voltage, ion di\u000busion, potential distributions across cells), they are\noften computationally di\u000ecult and costly to solve, since they involve complicated\ncoupled nonlinear partial di\u000berential equations (PDEs).\nIn this research, we develop a reduced-order Lead-Acid battery model from fi\frst principles using linearization and the Ritz discretization method. The model, even with a low-order discretization, accurately predicts the voltage response to a dynamic pulse current input and outputs spatially distributed variables of interest. As an e\u000ecient \ffirst principles model, the Ritz model makes an excellent candidate\nfor Battery Management System (BMS) model design. Also, a dynamic averaged model is developed from the Ritz model and realized by an equivalent circuit.\nThe circuit resistances and capacitances depend on electrochemical parameters, linking the equivalent circuit model to the underlying electrochemistry of the fi\frst principles model.\nAmong those built-in functionalities of the BMS in a HEV, the State-Of-Charge (SOC) estimation is crucial. SOC is the overall remaining charge in percentage inside a defi\fned unit (cell, battery, module, or battery pack.). For an electric vehicle, the SOC is similar to the remaining fuel for a vehicle powered by internal combustion engine. State-Of-Charge (SOC) estimation for Valve-Regulated Lead-Acid\n(VRLA) batteries is complicated by the switched linear nature of the underlying dynamics. A fi\frst principles nonlinear model is simplifi\fed to provide two switched linear models and linearized to produce charge, discharge, and averaged models.\nLuenberger and switched SOC estimators are developed based on these models and propogated using experimental data. A design methodology based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) is used in the switched SOC estimator design to obtain a switched Luenberger observer with guaranteed exponential stability. The results\nshow that estimation errors are halved by including switching in the observer design.\nTo fully utilize a Lead-Acid cell also requires real-time estimates of its State-Of-Power (SOP) and State-Of-Health (SOH) to e\u000efficiently allocate power and energy amongst the cells in a pack. SOP and SOH are inversely and directly proportional to cell resistance and capacity, respectively. In this research, the Least Squares Method estimates the coe\u000efficients of a second order transfer function using experimental voltage and current data from new, aged, and dead Valve Regulated Lead-Acid batteries. The coe\u000efficients are explicitly related to the cell ohmic resistance, capacity, charge transfer resistance, and double layer time constant using a fundamental model of the cell. The ohmic resistance estimate increases monotonically with age, providing an estimate of SOP. The capacity estimate decreases monotonically with age, matching the actual capacity loss for aged cells. Finally,\nthe voltage estimate error can be used as a SOH/SOP estimator and quantify the\nreliability of the parameter estimates. The fi\frst pulse after a long rest period shows\nthe highest estimation error.\nIn battery systems, the parameters often vary with SOC, SOH, and operating\nconditions. Accurate and fast battery parameter measurement methods are desirable in many applications. Solid phase di\u000busivity Ds is one of the fi\frst parameters to be measured in a new Lithium-Ion cell design because it dominates the\nelectrochemical kinetics. Amongst the Ds measurement methods, the Galvanostatic\nIntermittent Titration Technique (GITT) is easy to implement and universally accepted as the standard for di\u000busivity measurement. The accuracy of GITT, however, has not been reported, because there is no direct measurement method of Ds. In this research, we develop a Least Squares Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration\nTechnique (LS-GITT) that uses all of the voltage data from a GITT test to optimally tune the di\u000busivity in a reduced order solid phase di\u000busion model. The accuracy of the GITT and LS-GITT are evaluated using voltage predication error\nRMS. Based on experimental results from a NCM half cell, LS-GITT is more accurate than GITT, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. LS-GITT gives results accurate to 1 mV RMS from 15% - 100% SOC while GITT provides that level of\naccuracy over less than half that range. Neither technique provides accurate Ds measurements below 10% SOC.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8738], "author_name_tesi": "Shen, Zheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Shen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn", "Asok Ray", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Donghai Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Rahn, Dissertation Advisor", "Asok Ray, Committee Member", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Battery", "Ritz Method", "State-Of-Charge (SOC)", "State-Of-Health (SOH)", "Parameter Estimation", "Solid Phase Diffusivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "PHASE-FIELD SIMULATION OF PHASE TRANSITIONS, DOMAIN STABILITIES AND STRUCTURES IN FERROELECTRIC THIN FILMS\n", "id": "11809", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2145", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this study, we use the phase-field model to study the phase transitions, domain stabilities, domain structures and domain evolutions in a series of representative ferroelectric thin films, including PbTiO3, BaTiO3, SrTiO3, and BiFeO3. The effect of temperature, mechanical and electrostatic boundary conditions as well as the size effect on the above ferroelectric properties were systematically investigated. \nWe modify the previous phase-field model to study the domain stability and evolution in ferroelectric thin films under anisotropic strains.  The effect of anisotropic strains on the phase transitions and domains structures of PbTiO3 and BaTiO3 thin films is studied using both thermodynamic calculations and phase-field simulations. The misfit strain - misfit strain domain stability diagrams, i.e. the graphical representations of stable ferroelectric phases and domain structures as a function of strains, are predicted at several representative temperatures.  The similarity and significant differences between the diagrams from thermodynamic calculations assuming single domains and from phase-field simulations are analyzed. Typical domain structures as a result of anisotropic misfit strains are presented. \nA modified thermodynamic potential for strontium titanate bulk crystal is developed from interpreting experimental data with phase-field simulations. This modified potential is then applied to study the transition temperatures and domain stabilities in SrTiO3 thin films grown on different substrates with different strain states. The results will be compared with experimental measurements on polarizations in SrTiO3 thin films grown on DyScO3 and GdScO3 substrates.\nPhase-field model is also employed to study the domain stabilities and phase transitions in BiFeO3 thin films. It will be shown that the morphotropic phase boundary, or rhombohedral to tetragonal phase boundary predicted by phase-field method has very good agreement with experimental observations in BiFeO3 films deposited on LaAlO3 and YAlO3 substrates. Domain switching near the morphotropic boundary is studied. We also analyze the strain dependence on the coercive field and remnant polarization for BiFeO3 thin films grown on PMN-PT with tensile strains. \nA three dimensional phase-field model is applied to model the thickness effect on the domain stability in ferroelectric thin films, by introducing the strain relaxation mechanism and critical thickness for dislocation formation using both Matthews-Blakeslee (MB) and People- Bean (PB) models.

All positive-strand RNA viruses reorganize host intracellular membranes in order to form replication organelles (ROs), which are platforms where viral genome replication takes place. These ROs protect the viral RNA from degradation by cellular RNases and detection by RNA sensors that trigger antiviral responses. Additionally, ROs can be used to concentrate viral/host factors for efficient replication. \nOne of the most exciting advances has been the discovery of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) as an essential lipid component of ROs. In the cell, PI4P and other phosphoinositides serve many functions, but most importantly they function as docking sites for proteins that contain one or more phosphoinositide-binding domains. This observation inspired the hypothesis that a cellular lipid might be the platform used to recruit viral proteins to the sites of replication.\nIn this dissertation, I showed that poliovirus proteins 3C, 3D, and 3CD proteins, which are intimately involved in the viral genome replication process, have the capacity to interact with phosphoinositides, including PI4P. Using computational and biochemical/biophysical approaches, I showed that poliovirus 3D (viral polymerase) domain interacts with PI4P and other phosphoinositides. The mutational analysis allowed me to identify a 3D derivative with diminished PI4P-binding activity. Because 3CD hijacks the cellular PI4P biogenesis pathway, further analysis of the 3D variant in the context of 3CD suggested that the 3D domain plays a role in a pre-Arf1 activation step. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that 3CD needs to interact with PI4P-containing membranes in order to hijack the PI4P biogenesis pathway.\nResults from computational docking analysis suggested that the 3C domain of 3CD is also capable of interacting with PI4P. Empirical evidence for the docking studies was provided by NMR-HSQC experiments, which further confirmed that the binding site is near the N-terminus of 3C. Fluorescence polarization and supported lipid bilayer-based phosphoinositide-binding experiments both showed that 3C binds to phosphoinositides, with broad specificity.\nMy work allowed us to further characterize the PI4P biogenesis pathway induced by poliovirus 3CD and show evidence that PI4P is used as a zip code for localization to ROs. Additionally, these findings increased the functionality assigned to each viral protein/domain, which is typical for viruses that have a limited coding capacity and evolved to encode multifunctional proteins to keep their genome size small. Finally, this work led to the development of a novel tool to assess phosphoinositide-binding in vitro, which will be instrumental in identifying many more viral phosphoinositide-binding proteins in the near future. Either used for subcellular localization and/or activation upon binding, determining the viral phosphoinositide-interactome will not only help us better understand the viral life cycle but also provide novel tractable targets for the design of antiviral agents.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14780], "author_name_tesi": "Shengjuler, Djoshkun ", "last_name_ssi": "Shengjuler", "first_name_ssi": "Djoshkun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig E.

Visual preference research has revealed much about public preference for forest conditions and those silvicultural treatments that produce them; however, most studies have used western US forest scenes leaving perceptions of eastern forests, particularly those in the rare old-growth condition, relatively unknown.\n\nA sequential mixed-methods approach was utilized to understand how Pennsylvania residents perceive and value old-growth forests as well as to determine the acceptable level of management in the state\u2019s public forest old-growth system.

First, Nietzsche understands his philosophical\nproject as a liberation of the body from a history of asceticism, but he explicitly\nassociates his own thinking with intense physical suffering.

To compute the structural-acoustic response, a modal approach based on finite element / boundary element analysis is used which can easily incorporate fluid loading, added structures and static pre-loads.  Simple deterministic or complex random forcing functions are included in the analysis by transforming their cross-spectral density matrices to modal space.  Particular emphasis is placed in this dissertation on structures excited by the fluctuating pressures due to turbulent boundary layer (TBL) flow.  An efficient frequency-spacing is also used to minimize evaluation time but ensure accuracy.\n\nThe response from the structural-acoustic analysis is coupled to an evolutionary strategy with covariance matrix adaptation (CMA-ES) to find the best design for low noise and weight.  CMA-ES, a stochastic optimizer with robust search properties, samples candidate solutions from a multi-variate normal distribution and adapts the covariance matrix to favor good solutions.  The optimization procedure is validated by minimizing the sound radiated by a point-driven ribbed panel and comparing the optimization results to an exhaustive search of the design space.  \n\nStructural-acoustic optimization is then performed on a curved marine panel with heavy fluid loading excited by slow TBL flow.  A weighted combination of noise radiation and mass are minimized by changing the thickness of strips and patches of elements.  An uncorrelated pressure approximation is used to estimate the modal force due to TBL flow thus reducing the evaluation time required to compute the objective function.  The results show that the best noise reduction is achieved by minimizing the modal acceptance of energy by the panel.  This is equivalent to pushing the structural modes away from the peak frequency range of the forcing function.  Additionally, the Pareto trade-off curve between total sound power and panel mass is estimated to show the best designs which will simultaneously reduce both noise and weight.\n\nAs a final case, the sound power radiated is minimized for a ribbed aircraft panel excited by TBL flow at typical cruise conditions.  A static pressure load is applied to the panel to simulate cabin pressurization during flight and the rib locations and cross-sectional area are used as the design variables during optimization.  Nearly 10 dB of reduction is achieved by pushing the ribs to the edge of the panel, thus lowering the modal amplitudes excited by the forcing function.  The optimal configuration is also found for a higher speed and a larger downstream distance.  The design variables are then separated, and the optimization is repeated to determine the coupling between the design variables.  Finally, a static constraint is included in the procedure using a very low-frequency dynamic calculation to approximate a static response.  The constraint limits the amount of reduction that can be achieved by the optimizer.

Drawing on a project that emerged in my own second grade classroom, I reconsider Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s philosophies in order to think about the ways in which relational and affective pedagogy might honor what it is that children are interested in, what their encounters are capable of, and what they are becoming. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9441], "author_name_tesi": "Sherbine, Kortney Beth", "last_name_ssi": "Sherbine", "middle_name_ssi": "Beth", "first_name_ssi": "Kortney", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gail Louise Boldt", "Gail Louise Boldt", "Christine Thompson", "Kimberly Anne Powell", "Charles Richard Garoian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gail Louise Boldt, Dissertation Advisor", "Gail Louise Boldt, Committee Chair", "Christine Thompson, Committee Member", "Kimberly Anne Powell, Committee Member", "Charles Richard Garoian, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["childhood", "fan culture", "Gilles Deleuze", "F\u00e9lix Guattari", "assemblage", "nomad", "becoming", "desire"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Deposition Coefficient, Habit and Ventilation Influences on Cirriform Cloud Properties\n\n\n", "id": "8556", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3827", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cirriform clouds are atmospheric phenomena of importance, due to their role in global radiative and water vapor budgets.  Despite their importance, many of the important influences that define their structure and evolution are still unknown, due to their limited accessibility.  We examine the evolution of cirriform cloud properties as they respond to variations three such factors:  deposition coefficient, crystal habit, and ventilation.\n\nIn an effort to examine surface--kinetic effects on depositional growth of cirrus particles, a parameterization of the deposition coefficient, varying in response to changes in the growth mechanism (2D nucleation or spiral dislocations) and crystal and ambient properties, is incorporated into a microphysical model for spherical crystals.  Feedbacks between ice surface and larger--scale properties, such as crystal size and ambient supersaturation, are developed and placed in the context of distinct cirriform cloud types.\n\nFollowing the analysis on spherical crystals, the effects of crystal habit are explored for their influences on crystal growth.  Spheroidal approximations to the primary habits of plates and columns are made, and links between crystal shape and depositional growth rates are determined.  An interesting relationship between habit and the evolution of the crystal size distribution is discovered, in which the smallest nucleated crystals are seen to have the most deviation from a spherical shape.  This pronouncement of the aspect ratio is found to enhance the growth rates of the crystals to the point where they actually grow larger than the other crystals, altering the structure of the size distribution.\n\nConcluding the analysis of cirriform cloud properties is a study of the effects of ventilation on crystal sublimation in subsaturated air.  Two methods for computing ventilation effects, one based on experimental work and the other on theoretical analysis, are incorporated into the model and compared.  The fall distances of cirrus particles are analyzed for the two methods of ventilation computation and and the two surface--kinetic growth methods to determine which physical representations lead to the greatest survival of the particles.  Crystals growing under 2D nucleation constraints are found to persist longest, and the applicability of one of the ventilation computations is called into question.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3804], "author_name_tesi": "Sheridan, Lindsay Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Sheridan", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Lindsay", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jerry Y Harrington"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jerry Y Harrington, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cirrus", "ventilation", "crystal", "habit", "deposition coefficient"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Studies on the reaction of wine flavonoids with exogenous acetaldehyde", "id": "28707", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12398", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Red wine quality is known to improve with oxidation, typically as a result of exposure to oxygen. These benefits are based on the reaction of acetaldehyde with flavonoids in red wine. Acetaldehyde forms ethylidene bridges between flavonoids resulting in polymeric pigments and modified tannins, contributing to color stability and improved mouthfeel of red wine. Winemakers often use oxygenation techniques in order to take advantage of the benefits of acetaldehyde. These methods are based on the reduction of oxygen in several metal-catalyzed steps resulting in acetaldehyde; undesirable, reactive intermediates are also formed as side products of this mechanism. As these reactive species can result in deleterious effects, oxygen exposure is a relatively risky technique in order to gain the benefits of acetaldehyde.\nAs a replacement for oxygenation techniques, I investigated the use of exogenous acetaldehyde additions to improve the color stability and mouthfeel of red wine. I first determined the viability of exogenous acetaldehyde treatment of a red wine by examining the effects of the treatment during alcoholic fermentation. Two levels of acetaldehyde (100 mg/L and 1000 mg/L) were added to a red wine over eight days of fermentation. After the completion of fermentation, wines were analyzed for their color stability and protein precipitation. High acetaldehyde treatment significantly increased the concentration of polymeric pigments and decreased the amount of protein precipitated by tannin. These results demonstrate the ability of exogenous acetaldehyde treatment to improve color stability and mouthfeel of a red wine.\nIn order to understand the role of wine components in the reaction of acetaldehyde with wine flavonoids, I assessed the effect of pH, dissolved oxygen, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in model wine solutions. The rate of reaction of acetaldehyde with catechin was significantly increased with lower pH and was not affected by dissolved oxygen. Interestingly, the reaction of acetaldehyde with flavonoids was slowed but not prevented by the addition of SO2 as determined by monitoring the rate of reaction and the formation of polymeric pigments. These results demonstrate that acetaldehyde is reactive, not inert as previously assumed, in its sulfonate form.\nBased on the efficacy of acetaldehyde in a system with an equimolar concentration of bisulfite in the previous study, I then explored the reactivity of aldehydes from bisulfite adducts. I synthesized \u03b1-hydroxyalkylsulfonates from bisulfite and several aldehydes found in wine: formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, and benzaldehyde. The reactivity of aldehydes from their free and bound (sulfonate) forms with catechin was determined. The results demonstrate a clear relationship between reactivity of an aldehyde from its sulfonate and the dissociation constant (Kd) of that sulfonate. The bridged catechin oligomers from these aldehydes were also characterized by MALDI-TOF MS, several for the first time. This work was the first evidence of the reactivity of aldehydes, including acetaldehyde, from their sulfonates.\nIn order to confirm the application of exogenous acetaldehyde in red wine production, I investigated the treatment of red wine with exogenous acetaldehyde, the acetaldehyde-bisulfite adduct, and oxygenation after alcoholic fermentation. A reasonably low concentration of exogenous acetaldehyde (500 \u03bcM, 22 mg/L) significantly improved all measures of color stability evaluated, including color density and polymeric pigments. The sulfonate did not have the same effect as acetaldehyde, but did increase several parameters of color stability. The comparison between exogenous acetaldehyde and oxygenation demonstrated the inefficiency of the formation of acetaldehyde from oxygen. While both treatments consumed monomeric anthocyanins, only exogenous acetaldehyde significantly increased the concentration of polymeric pigments.\nOverall, I demonstrated that exogenous acetaldehyde treatment is a viable alternative to oxygenation for improving the color stability of red wines. At low concentrations (22 mg/L), winemakers could use acetaldehyde to significantly improve color stability and wine quality. Acetaldehyde is also likely to contribute to beneficial reactions of flavonoids in wine when found as a sulfonate, as I showed its reactivity upon the addition of bisulfite and when added as a sulfonate. While further work is needed to optimize its application during red wine production, this work suggests that exogenous acetaldehyde treatment could be an effective method of improving color stability for winemakers.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11766], "author_name_tesi": "Sheridan, Marlena Kenny", "last_name_ssi": "Sheridan", "middle_name_ssi": "Kenny", "first_name_ssi": "Marlena", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias", "Joshua D Lambert", "John Coupland", "Michela Centinari"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias, Dissertation Advisor", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member", "John Coupland, Committee Member", "Michela Centinari, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Acetaldehyde", "Flavonoid", "Anthocyanin", "Tannin", "Color Stability", "Red Wine"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "MODELING MAGNETO-ACTIVE ELASTOMERS USING THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD\n", "id": "22691", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10373", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Magneto-active elastomers (MAE) are a new type of smart materials that consist of hard-magnetic particles such as barium ferrite in an elastomer matrix.  Under the application of a uniform magnetic field, the MAE material undergoes large deformation as the material bends due to magnetic torques acting on the distribution of hard-magnetic particles.  This behavior demonstrates the potential of MAEs to act as remotely-powered actuators.  MAEs are different from magnetorheological elastomers (MRE) which use soft-magnetic iron particles in place of the hard-magnetic particles. Traditional MREs, formed with carbonyl iron,  are primarily  driven by magnetic interactions between particles that cause magnetostriction and associated phenomena.\nIn this work, MAEs were fabricated using 30% v/v 325 mesh M-type barium ferrite (BaM) particles in Dow Corning HS II silicone elastomers.  Prior to curing, the samples were placed in a uniform (~2 Tesla) magnetic field to align the magnetic particles and produce a magnetization oriented in the direction of the applied magnetic field.  For this work, the magnetic particles were physically oriented either in-plane or through-plane.  The geometries studied in this work consisted of a cantilever beam MAE specimen  (where experimental data is collected in [1]), a symmetric two-segment and an asymmetric two-segment accordion structure, and a four-segment accordion structure. In the four-segment and both two-segment geometries, MAE patches were bonded to a magnetically inert polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. The ability of these structures to exert load over a range of prescribed displacements highlights the ability of the MAE actuators to perform useful work.  The structures studied in this work deformed in either a bending or folding mode.  The data collected from the experiments included tip force vs. displacement vs. magnetic field for the cantilever geometry, axial force and bend angle vs. magnetic field for the two-segment geometries, and average bend angle vs. magnetic field for the four-segment geometry.  Results show increases in the measured tip force, axial force, and bend angle versus the applied field for the aforementioned geometries.\nThe experimental results were then compared to results from a finite element analysis (FEA). The FEA methodology, performed in the commercial FEA software package Comsol, employs the Maxwell stress tensor applied as a traction boundary condition at the interface between magnetic and non-magnetic domains.  Results show fair to excellent agreement for all structures studied.  Discrepancies between the experimental results and the simulations may be attributed to the inability to capture the actual distribution of the magnetizations of the particles, which are assumed perfectly aligned, in the finite element model; the assumption that the Maxwell surface stress accurately models the particle-field and particle-particle interactions of the MAE; or the failutre to capture any non-uniformities in the applied magnetic field.

Both the piezoelectric coefficient (d33 > 2000 pC/N)\nand coupling coefficient (k33 > 0.90) are superior to those of conventional piezoelectric\nceramics. Within the context of a high power acoustic projector, its high losses and low temperature stability have limited its development. Second generation single crystals with compositions modified from the base PMNT have been recently developed to decrease the electromechanical losses and mitigate the thermal property dependence.\n\nIn this work, the electromechanical properties were measured using single crystals which have\nbeen modified in various ways. The modified crystals exhibit electromechanically \"hard\" behavior with lower losses (tand = 0.1-0.2% and QM = 230-950) than unmodified PMNT (tand = 0.26%\nand QM = 190). The measured d33 values of modified single crystals (d33 = 760-1490pm/V) are\nalso lower than unmodified PMNT (d33 = 1540pm/V), but the lower piezoelectric response is\ncompensated by the greater stability of the modified single crystals. These modified single crystal properties were also compared to conventional high power piezoelectric ceramics (d33 = 240pm/V and QM = 1050) to show similar losses but significantly greater response in the modified PMNT single crystals.\n\nAlthough most piezoelectric materials are measured under small signal conditions (small\nsignal defined by a completely linear relationship between the input and output signals), the high power nature of SONAR projectors demands that these modified single crystals also be evaluated under high power conditions. A test procedure was developed to measure the electromechanical properties of each material as a function of applied electric \ffield over a frequency range which includes the resonance frequency. Modified single crystals showed twice the dynamic strain of unmodified PMNT as a function of electric \ffield, and in many cases also showed greater maximum strain at failure (0.3% compared to 0.15% for unmodified PMNT). When QM was measured as a function of drive level, it was shown to sharply decrease under high dynamic strain. Modified single crystals with greater small signal QM values than unmodified PMNT maintain higher QM values under high drive, with QM = 50-150 immediately prior to sample failure (QM = 20 for base PMNT immediately prior to failure).\n\nThe temperature dependence of modified PMNT single crystal electromechanical properties was also determined, and it was shown that modified crystals possess greater property stability than unmodified PMNT. While the base composition shows a limiting rhombohedral-tetragonal transition at 95C, modified single crystals using ternary PIN and PZT components show increased transition temperatures of 125C and 144C, respectively. The greater phase stability of the PIN ternary crystal was also examined through the coercive \ffield, which was shown to be much greater than that of unmodified PMNT over the temperature range of interest (Ec = 5 kV/cm and 2 kV/cm, respectively, at room temperature). From the combined set of property measurements, the heat generation of each material was predicted for an arbitrary projector device. As a consequence of the lower losses, modified single crystals showed as little as 25% of the heat generation value for\nunmodified PMNT single crystals. Using this prediction as a performance metric, the crystals\nwith the lowest heat generation were selected for device testing.\n\nTransducers with base PMNT and modified single crystals were designed using a \ffinite element modeling approach. This model predicted approximately two octaves of bandwidth for the transducer geometry under investigation. A 5 dB decrease in acoustic output was observed when moving from base PMNT to highly modified crystals, but that result does not account for\nnonlinear material behavior.\n\nTransducers fabricated using modified PMNT were compared to both base PMNT and conventional PZT4 ceramic. In-water analysis at the resonance frequency showed that heavily modified single crystals showed a maximum source level 5 dB greater than base PMNT and comparable to the conventional PZT4. Off\u000b resonance, the modified crystal showed a 3 dB improvement over base PMNT and a 6 dB improvement over PZT4. Broadband frequency sweeps confirmed the superior bandwidth of single crystal transducers relative to the conventional piezoelectric ceramic. The previous heat generation predictions were confirmed, with modified crystals showing 3-4x reduction in heat generation relative to base PMNT when measured in\nwater under isothermal conditions of 50C.

The difference in freezing process may significantly alter the radiative properties of and particle sedimentation rates from cirriform clouds. The underlying physical processes influencing the competition between heterogeneous and homogeneous nucleation remain poorly understood. One such process that may be of importance is surface kinetic resistance to ice vapor growth and its dependence on particle shape evolution, which is investigated in this thesis using the Kinetically Limited Adaptive Habit (KLAH) growth method in a Lagrangian parcel model framework.\n\tThe KLAH model predicts axis-dependent growth efficiencies that allow for particle shape to evolve in time.

This non-linearly increases the vapor flux to the semi-major axis, increasing the rate at which vapor is depleted from the ambient environment. We show that, in some cases, more surface resistance may in fact accelerate this increase in the growth rate. As a result, fewer heterogeneously-nucleated ice crystals are required to suppress homogeneous nucleation. This may help to explain the relative dominance of heterogeneous nucleation in the upper atmosphere. Furthermore, we show that simpler treatments of surface kinetics are unable to capture this effect, and may lead to both over- and under-predictions of ice concentration while also missing the evolution of ice particle shape that occurs above the cloud-base nucleation zone.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10994], "author_name_tesi": "Sherman, Benjamin Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Sherman", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jerry Y Harrington", "Johannes Verlinde", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jerry Y Harrington, Thesis Advisor", "Johannes Verlinde, Thesis Advisor", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cloud physics", "deposition coefficient", "ice nucleation", "ice crystal growth", "cirrus", "surface kinetic resistance"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Agency, Ideology, and Information/Communication Technology: English Language Instructor use of Instructional Technology at a South Korean College", "id": "13341bjs460", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13341", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this study was to investigate the ways that instructors think about classroom technology and how this might relate to their classroom use of it. This qualitative case study explores the relationship between instructors and classroom information/communication technology (ICT). Specifically, this study followed three native English-speaking English Language instructors at a South Korean vocational college over the course of a semester. Through a variety of data collection methods, many different aspects of the participants\u2019 relationships with instructional ICT were explored. This study focused on participants\u2019 espoused ideas and beliefs about what ICT was, how it was meant to be used, and what it could accomplish in a classroom setting. In addition to interviews, instructors\u2019 actual technology usage was explored through classroom observations.\nThe findings strongly suggest that instructors\u2019 relationships to instructional ICT are differentiated individually by a number of factors, such as an instructor\u2019s history of learning and teaching with ICT, their understanding of what it is, and what it can and cannot do. By exploring these individual instructors\u2019 perspectives and their use of ICTs in their classrooms, this study makes a case that the educational impact and benefit of ICT should be understood as a result of relationships between instructors and technology, or in broader terms, relationships between humans and machines. Furthermore, it was found that instructors\u2019 relationships with instructional technology can be understood in terms of their ability to reshape it and apply it in innovative ways to accomplish their pedagogical goals. To aid in this understanding, the findings are used to posit, develop, and refine two theoretical constructs, technological agency and ideologies of technology. These are offered as conceptual lenses through which to view one particular aspect of a instructor\u2019s relationship to technology, that of reinterpretation of technological artifacts through the discovery of new affordances.

Indeed, research on cognitive decline tends to be dominated by biological psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists. Given the important insights that the sociological and demographic perspective can provide to understanding cognitive aging processes\u2014particularly with regards to the social determinants of cognitive aging and how the patterns of change vary across social locations (e.g. race, gender, socioeconomic status)\u2014it is imperative for a social demographic analysis to be applied when examining cognitive aging. This dissertation aims to describe and explain sociodemographic variations in trajectories of age-related cognitive decline. Using data from the nationally representative longitudinal Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and drawing on the life course perspective, reserve theory, intersectionality theory, and differential exposure/susceptibility perspectives, this study uses an integrated person-centered/variable-centered methodological approach to examine both patterns of cognitive decline across social locations as well as said patterns\u2019 social determinants. Broadly, this study has three main aims. First, this study aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the various trajectories of age-related cognitive decline by estimating and examining distinct classes of cognitive aging trajectories using general growth mixture modeling with latent trajectory classes (GGMM-LTC). Further, this study seeks to ascertain whether the cognitive aging disparities follow an age-as-leveler, persistent inequality, or cumulative (dis)advantage pattern. Additionally, I examine whether active or passive reserve processes underlie changes in cognitive performance with advancing age. Building on the previous identification of distinct classes of cognitive decline, the second aim of this study is to examine patterns of cognitive aging across social locations by applying intersectionality theory. Lastly, the third aim is to employ differential exposure and differential susceptibility hypotheses to explain racial and gender differences in cognitive aging patterns. Findings addressing the first aim indicate that distinct classes for both episodic memory and mental status exist, and that membership in classes is stratified by race, gender, socioeconomic status, health, and early life adversity. Additionally, support for the age-as leveler, persistent inequality, and cumulative (dis)advantage patterns were found depending on the groups compared and the cognitive domain examined. It was also found that the cognitive reserve process plays out in the mental status domain. Findings related to the second aim of this study indicate that gender and levels of education influence cognitive trajectory class membership for blacks and whites in both episodic memory and mental status domains. More specifically, whites and respondents with higher levels of education are more likely to belong in episodic memory and mental status classes with higher levels of initial functioning. Further, I find evidence for the multiplicative effects of gender and education for episodic memory among whites and for mental status among both whites and blacks thus providing support for the intersectionality perspective. Lastly, findings related to the third aim show that race and gender are both significant predictors of episodic memory and mental status trajectory class membership. Blacks and men are more likely to belong in episodic memory trajectory classes characterized by low initial function with more rapid declines than their white and female counterparts. For mental status, blacks and women are more likely to be in lower initial functioning classes, but are advantaged with regards to rate of decline. Additionally, findings provide little evidence for the notion that early life adversity attenuates the relationship between race and/or gender and cognitive decline trajectory class membership, thereby no support for the differential exposure hypothesis was found. Lastly, lack of statistically significant interactions between both race and gender and early life adversity indicates that there is no support for the differential susceptibility hypothesis. Overall, findings herein show that the social patterning and determinants of cognitive decline in the U.S. are complex, varying with the groups being compared as well as the cognitive domain in question. Moreover, this dissertation provides an argument that researchers in the area of cognitive decline would benefit greatly from an intersectionality approach.  This dissertation concludes with the placement of current findings within the existing literature, a detailing of policy implications, a discussion of study limitations, and the outlining of planned future research in the area of cognitive decline and ideas for better cognitive functioning assessment in the population.

In Study 1, the difficulty of the game was manipulated to optimize flow states, and the narrative of the game was manipulated to optimize narrative engagement. Results of Study 1 showed that the narrative alteration to the game was marginally successful at optimizing narrative engagement, but the alteration to difficulty did not optimize flow. Further these manipulations did not explain persuasive gains exemplified by the game players. However, players who experienced flow states were improved their attitudes toward nutrition and intentions of conducting nutritious behaviors. Study 2 replicated Study 1, with modifications. In Study 2, both the difficulty and the narrative manipulations optimized immersion, but these gameplay characteristics still did not predict persuasive outcomes. As in Study 1, data from Study 2 showed that flow predicted persuasive health outcomes. Study 2 also added an orthogonal branding manipulation through the inclusion of brand messaging for some game players. As expected, the game improved attitudes and shopping intentions toward the brand, but this change was not different between branding conditions. Further, as with evaluations of health messaging, flow was positively related to evaluations of the brand. Finally, in both studies, flow, transportation/narrative engagement, and enjoyment were statistically indistinguishable, which suggests that theories differentiating these concepts might need to be revisited.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10591], "author_name_tesi": "Sherrick, Brett Isaac", "last_name_ssi": "Sherrick", "middle_name_ssi": "Isaac", "first_name_ssi": "Brett", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Francis Erin Dardis", "Francis Erin Dardis", "Michael Grant Schmierbach", "Richard Denny Taylor", "James Dillard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Francis Erin Dardis, Dissertation Advisor", "Francis Erin Dardis, Committee Chair", "Michael Grant Schmierbach, Committee Member", "Richard Denny Taylor, Committee Member", "James Dillard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["video games", "persuasion", "flow", "narrative engagement"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "PERFORMANCE AND LIMITATIONS OF \nDISTRIBUTED INFERENCE AND INFORMATION FUSION IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK APPLICATIONS\n", "id": "6737", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5312", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent advances in sensor design and miniaturization have provided the opportunity for the creation of large distributed wireless sensor networks.

The goals were to: (1) identify and characterize a profile of Pakistani WLP practitioners; (2) analyze perceptions of the current and future importance of WLP competencies in Pakistan; (3) measure the relationships between the perceived importance of foundational and technical competencies currently in terms of education levels; and (4) compare the existing competencies of Pakistani practitioners with those recommended by the 2004 American Society of Training and Development (ASTD) model in terms of current expertise and future expertise in terms of importance.\nThe ASTD Competency Study: Mapping the Future (2004) was used as a conceptual framework. The original 2004 ASTD WLP questionnaire was translated, validated, pilot-tested, and distributed in several stages among 700 Pakistani WLP practitioners. A total of 286 questionnaires were returned; 270 were usable (for a response rate of 38%) and 16 were unusable. Data were collected online and also using convenience and snowball sampling techniques. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, paired t-tests and Cohen\u2019s d effect size. \nFindings revealed that Management Development/Leadership Development/Executive Development was the primary discipline (21.5 %) and Training (19.3%) was the secondary discipline in this research. With regard to the professional levels of the practitioners, 17.8% identified \u201cmanager\u201d as their job title. About two-thirds of the respondents had received at least a master\u2019s degree (e.g., Master of Science, Master of Arts, or Master of Business Administration) (163, 60.6%). The majority reported academic degree programs to be the predominant source of education and training for gaining WLP positions. A total of 219 (81.4%) Pakistani practitioners identified academic degree programs as the most effective sources of professional development programs (PDP). \nOn the Business and Management Survey, the mean difference in importance was highest for searches for innovative solution(s), advancing the learning and performance of business agendas, overcoming obstacles and orchestrating efforts achieving results; managing time and developing learning and performance strategies were believed to be important in the future. \nOn the Interpersonal Competency Survey, Pakistani WLP practitioners viewed leading by example, delivering a clear message(s), developing and deploying effective communication strategies, gaining commitment to the solution(s), conveying respect for different perspective(s), and networking with others as being more important in the future as compared to now.\nOn the Personal Survey, participants viewed adapting to handle implementation challenges as being an important future ability demonstrating adaptability. Taking risks in learning was identified as an important future competency in modeling personal development. \nParticipants viewed two items on knowledge Areas\u2014career development theories and approaches and coaching approaches\u2014as important in the future. They also reported facilitating career transition to be an important action Area in the future compared to the current time on the Career Planning and Talent Management (CPTM) Survey. They pointed out that Individual learning styles, e.g., audio, visual, is the most needed knowledge Area relating to Delivering Training. They also rated the evaluating solution(s) action Area as being of future importance relating to Delivering Training in the workplace. With regard to the Designing Learning Knowledge Areas, e.g., cognition and adult learning theory, various instructional methods and various delivery options were viewed as important, while analysis and selection of technologies implied a gap in importance to this action Area in instructional design. Looking at Measuring and Evaluation, the fact that interpretation and reporting of data was selected most often highlighted the gap in importance for this competency, while reporting conclusions and making recommendations based on findings was selected as a future competency.\nA one-way ANOVA test revealed statistically significant differences in perceptions of the current importance of the following items: Recognizes the impact, Understands business operations, Recognizes business priorities, Advances the learning and performance business agenda, and Targets improvement opportunities. This was found across three education levels on the Business and Management Survey. A significant relationship between education and the items Operates with integrity and Establishes common goals was revealed in answers to the Interpersonal Competencies Survey. A significant relationship was found among three education levels and Seeks to understand changes, Adapts to handle implementation challenges, and OVERALL: How important is this competency for effective performance in your current job? for Modeling Personal Development related to personal competency.\nThe Cohen\u2019s d effect size (Cohen, 1988, 1994) measured the degree of difference or association deemed large enough to be of practical significance. Cohen\u2019s d effect size value was large for the majority of the items between the current importance items mean and the future importance items mean. \nThe reasons for the selection of different sets of competencies for performing current and future jobs in Pakistan may be due to:\n\u2022\tTime span of the study (present vs. in five years) \n\u2022\tRandom selection of international practitioners and selection of Pakistani practitioners using convenient and snowball sampling approaches \n\u2022\tEconomic and cultural backgrounds of practitioners \nSince this was the first WLP research study in Pakistan and involved only practitioners accessed through convenience and snowball sampling approaches, further studies of WLP practitioners are recommended using random sampling approaches at a larger scale. Through findings offered here, Pakistani WLP practitioners, HR departments, research organizations, businesses, and educational institutions in Pakistan will become aware of the possible implications of this research for self-assessment, organization development, recruitment, development, promotion, and retention. Trainers, instructional designers, curriculum developers, and academia can use these findings in designing, developing, teaching, and evaluating WLP competencies in Pakistan. According to the reported perceptions of practitioners, they endorse the importance of WLP competencies in closing the performance gap. The actions needed to close this gap include recognizing WLP programs at the university level. Future research is needed on the roles, competencies, and technical Areas of expertise of WLP practitioners in Pakistan because this Area of research has been relatively unexploited to this point. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4688], "author_name_tesi": "Sherwani, Naseem Saeed", "last_name_ssi": "Sherwani", "middle_name_ssi": "Saeed", "first_name_ssi": "Naseem", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William J Rothwell", "William J.

The current work employs particle image velocimetry to present detailed field measurements of the flow velocity throughout the bend, including upstream and downstream sections. Additionally, velocity measurements have been carried out at three different Reynolds numbers to establish the dependence or independence of the bend effects on the flowrate. Associated turbulence quantities have also been calculated and presented in an intuitive, graphical manner.\n\nThe test section is a square cross-sectioned duct, containing a 90 degree bend preceded by an 5Dh upstream section and a 10Dh downstream straight section, where Dh is the hydraulic diameter. Turbulent flow entering the upstream section is fully-developed to allow the isolation of the bend effects. At Re ~ 2.76X10^5, detailed velocity measurements are acquired at 12 streamwise locations in three streamwise-radial planes at different heights (top, middle and bottom). Complementary data are obtained in a more limited set of locations at Re~1.76X10^5 and Re~3.20X10^5 to allow comparison of the bend effects at different flowrates. Turbulence intensities and the Reynolds shear stress components are calculated and presented for all three Reynolds numbers.\n\nOne of the major aims of this work is to provide a benchmark for computational codes developed to study bend effects in a turbulent pipe flow. To allow easy comparison of these codes to the results of the current study, all the measured and calculated quantities are plotted in a curvilinear coordinate system in addition to the native cartesian (global) coordinate system.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4925], "author_name_tesi": "Sheth, Preyank R.", "last_name_ssi": "Sheth", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Preyank", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Kendra Sharp", "Kendra V Sharp"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Kendra Sharp, Thesis Advisor", "Kendra V Sharp, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["square duct", "experimental", "90 degree bend", "turbulent flow", "Particle image velocimetry"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATION OF III-V FERROMAGNETIC SEMICONDUCTORS\n", "id": "7944", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "817", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "III-Mn-V ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMSC) are attractive and promising material candidates for semiconductor spin-electronics, in which the carrier spin and charge are exploited for potential applications.

In the first essay, we ask why developing countries fail to specialize in products in which they (at least potentially) have a comparative advantage? For example, farmers in land-poor developing countries overwhelmingly produce staples rather than  exotic fruits that command high prices. We propose a simple model of trade and intermediation that shows how holdup resulting from poor contracting environment can produce such an outcome. We use the model to examine which polices can help ameliorate the problem, even when its cause cannot be eliminated.\n\nIn the second and the third essays, we study how exporters introduce new products into the export market. In the second essay, using information on the universe of Chinese exporters to the US, we document a number of empirircal facts that discipline economists' undrstanding of dynamic aspects of multiproduct exporters. \nIn the third essay, we estimate a structural dynamic model of multiproduct exporting.\n\t\t\nIn Chapter 1, \"Wheat or Strawberries?

We propose that due to contracting frictions agricultural producers often specialize in staples in which they have a comparative disadvantage, instead of specializing in fruits and vegetables which they can grow efficiently and which command higher prices in the export markets. While farmers can subsits on staples, farmers require services of the intermediaries to deliver cash crops to the export market. When markets are thin intermediaries hold the bulk of the bargaining power and offer a small price to the farmer for his produce. Foreseeing the hold up farmers choose to specialize in the staples.\n\n\nIn the model, farmers can produce two types of goods: wheat and strawberries. Wheat is suitable for subsistence but farmers are inefficient in producing it. Farmers are efficient in making strawberries, but cannot subsist on it, and have to sell them to an intermediary who makes profits by selling it at the world price. In a frictionless world farmers would specialize in strawberries. Central to the model is the inability of farmers and traders to contract ex-ante on a price. The absence of enforceable contracts sets the stage for the classic hold up problem and precludes negotiating the terms of trade prior to entry into production.  We use a two period model with a continuum of traders and farmers. In the first period, farmers decide whether to produce wheat or strawberries and intermediaries decide whether to enter the business of intermediation. In the second period, farmers and traders meet randomly and trade. Since meetings are random and traders do not know the number of local competitors but do know how thick the market is, they can infer the distribution of potential rivals and offer a price based on this information. In other words, traders compete for the output of farmers in the first price auction. As a result, some farmers fetch a high price for their strawberries; others fetch a low price, or even fail to  meet an intermediary. Farmers make the production decision based on the expected price.\n\nWe solve the model and characterize all the possible equilibria as a function of the primitive parameters. Of particular interest is the region in the parameter space that yields multiple equilibria. In the good equilibrium, specialization occurs according to comparative advantage and there is intermediation, while in the bad equilibrium, there is no intermediation and the staple is produced. Our work suggests that there may be some simple measures to ensure intermediation and specialization according to comparative advantage even if the government is not able to resolve the core issue, the underlying lack of enforceable contracts. A temporary production subsidy or a marketing board that ensures a sufficiently high minimum price to the farmer can help an economy remove the bad equilibrium without intermediation. \n\nThis paper is closely related to the work of Antras and Costinot (2011). In their paper they focus on the implications of intermediation for globalization in a model that assumes that contracts between traders and producers are enforceable.  In contrast we study the implications of contractual failure on production choices in a model of trade with intermediation. \n\nIn Chapter 2, \"Multiproduct Exporters: Empirical Regularities,\"  we use information on Chinese exporters to the US to document a number of empirical regularities regarding dynamic multiproduct exporter behaviour. First, we confirm that scope and firm scale are positively associated. This suggests that more productive firms select to produce more products. Furthermore we find empirical regularities that are consistent with firms facing uncertainty in the export market. We explore the conjecture that firms learn about their potential in new export products trough exporting similar products. We find only tentative support for this conjecture.\n\nIn chapter 3, \"Multiproduct Exporters: Learning versus Knowing,\"  we develop and estimate a structural model of multiproduct exporters based on three empirical regularities documented using data on Chinese exporters. These regularities are as follows: (1) multi-product exporters introduce their best-selling products early; (2) more than 40% of the new products introduced by incumbent exporters are dropped due to low sales within the first year; (3) for a firm, the probability of introducing a new product is positively related to the survival and success of the earlier products.\n\nThe first regularity is consistent with unobserved firm-product specific heterogeneity. The second suggests that both incumbents and new exporters face uncertainty when they introduce new products. The third is consistent with firms learning about their potential in an export market, i.e.,  their brand effect, as they introduce new products. We develop a model which incorporates all of these features, and we estimate it structurally using data on Chinese exporters to the U.S. in the plastics industry.\n\nFirst, we find that known demand shocks play an important role in whether producers enter the exporting market or not. Second, we find that it is important to account for large attrition among new exporters including uncertainty about the brand effect. When we let firms know their brand effect precisely, only those with sufficiently high brand effects enter, and then the model cannot replicate disproportionately large attrition of new products among new exporters. Third, we find that while firms act consistently with learning about their brand effect, the uncertainty that firms face in conjunction with introducing new products looms large, and limits the extent to which learning affects incentives of firms to add new products. Our counterfactuals show that the distribution of products among the high brand effect firms only marginally first order stochastically dominates the distribution for low brand effect firms.\n\nUsing our model we revisit the question of trade policy in the multiproduct firm setting. We simulate a decrease in the cost of introducing new products for firms. Our simulations suggest that in the presence of economies of scope and even moderate learning effects, decreasing costs of introducing subsequent products can make a significant contribution to increasing trade flows.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9971], "author_name_tesi": "Sheveleva, Yelena ", "last_name_ssi": "Sheveleva", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yelena", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kala Krishna", "Kala Krishna", "Stephen Ross Yeaple", "Edward C Jaenicke", "James R.

Within music education, confidence is often studied through the lens of Bandura\u2019s social cognitive theory, and for music improvisation, much confidence work has been accomplished through survey design and examined confidence to teach improvisation or gender differences. Though Bandura\u2019s self-efficacy model provides a useful framework to study confidence as part of music (especially in understanding why people\u2019s behavior may differ markedly in improvising), confidence may be important to improvising distinct from self- efficacy theory, and deserves inductive and explorative treatment; I completed three qualitative research studies on confident music improvising (CMI). These three studies are shared in this dissertation, a phenomenological study of CMI from the perspective of improvising performers (Chapter 2), a case study of teachers at the jazz portion of a summer music camp (Chapter 3), and most recently (Chapter 4), I explored CMI within the parameters of improvisation teachers helping students build a personal, subjective sense of confidence, which is needed to improvise musically.\n\nIn the first study, interviews and observations were conducted with three self-described confident music improvisers: a bluegrass fiddler, a jazz bassist, and a baroque violinist. Participants described their learning experiences with CMI. The following essential themes emerged from that analysis \u2013 listening, criticism- free environment, sequential experiences, passion for a style, and openness to learning. The first three of these themes were considered pedagogical and the final two themes dispositional.\n\nIn the second study, case study design was employed to test the essential pedagogical themes\u2014listening, criticism-free environment, and sequential experiences\u2014against situational reality of the jazz portion of a one-week summer music camp. The focus of this second study was on teaching CMI. Interviews, observations, and documents were used to triangulate data. Teaching through questions emerged as a theme of teaching CMI.\n\nIn the third study, an emergent, responsive interviewing research design was used to explore the experiences of expert improvisation teachers\u2019 teaching praxes for improving student confidence to improvise music. The purpose of this qualitative study was to understand praxes of teaching CMI, that is, how expert improvisation teachers conceive the techniques they use to increase student confidence to improvise music. There were two research questions. What teaching praxes do participants use to help unconfident students become confident music improvisers?

To better understand cellular function of polyamines, two transgenic mouse models with either widespread constitutive overexpression of spermidine synthase (SpdS) or regulated expression of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) in the skin were created and characterized.  \nSpdS is a polyamine biosynthetic enzyme, and it transfers an aminopropyl group from decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet) to putrescine to produce spermidine. We generated a transgenic mouse line that overexpresses human spermidine synthase from a composite cytomegalovirus- immediate early gene enhancer/chicken &#946;-actin promoter (CAG) in order to determine the impact of elevated SpdS activity on murine development and physiology, and to enable simultaneous overexpression of SpdS and other polyamine biosynthetic enzymes by combining transgenic models. CAG-SpdS mice were viable and fertile and exhibited a reduced tissue spermine:spermidine ratio that correlated with the level of SpdS activity. We also demonstrated that the combined overexpression of both SpdS and spermine synthase (SpmS) in CAG-SpdS/CAG-SpmS bitransgenic mice did not impair murine viability or lead to overt developmental abnormalities but instead normalizes the elevated tissue spermine:spermidine ratios of CAG-SpmS mice. Finally, upon breeding of CAG-SpdS mice to MHC (&#945;-myosin heavy chain)-AdoMetDC mice with a >100-fold increase in cardiac AdoMetDC activity, CAG-SpdS/MHC-AdoMetDC bitransgenic animals were produced at the expected frequency and exhibited cardiac polyamine levels comparable to MHC-AdoMetDC littermates. Taken together these results indicate that SpdS levels are unlikely to exert significant regulatory effects on cellular polyamine content and function.\nPrevious studies suggest that the increased levels of polyamines, especially putrescine, play a critical role in skin tumor development. AdoMetDC is a rate-limiting enzyme in the polyamine biosynthetic pathway. It catalyzes the decarboxylation of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to generate dcAdoMet that serves as the aminopropyl donor for the production of spermidine and spermine from the precursor putrescine. We utilized the Tet-off system to generate transgenic mice with regulated expression of AdoMetDC in skin basal keratinocytes directed by the Keratin 5 promoter to enhance our understanding of the role played by AdoMetDC in controlling polyamine levels and of polyamine function in epithelial carcinogenesis. We found that untreated transgenic mice displayed a 7 to 8-fold increase in epidermal and dermal AdoMetDC activity at 7 weeks of age, and a corresponding increase in the enzymatic product dcAdoMet levels. These mice also exhibited a thin fur phenotype that could be eliminated by doxycycline treatment. A skin chemical carcinogenesis experiment on these mice demonstrated that AdoMetDC overexpression resulted in a 46% reduction in tumor multiplicity compared to controls after 25 weeks of tumor promotion. A further study of tumor growth upon transgene silencing by doxycyline suggested that the tumor suppressive effect was the result of blocking the growth of initiated cells at a microscopic, dormant but still viable state in the skin. These findings will help with future development of polyamine-targeted therapies to prevent and treat cancer. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1263], "author_name_tesi": "Shi, Chenxu ", "last_name_ssi": "Shi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chenxu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David J Feith, Ph D", "David J Feith", "Anthony Edward Pegg", "Lisa M Shantz", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Scot R Kimball", "Barbara Ann Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David J Feith, Ph D, Dissertation Advisor", "David J Feith, Committee Chair", "Anthony Edward Pegg, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Member", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Barbara Ann Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polyamines", "S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase", "Spermidine synthase", "Transgenic mice", "Nonmelanoma skin cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Study of correlations in fractional quantum Hall effect", "id": "10003", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1189", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bulk two-dimensional electron systems in a strong perpendicular\nmagnetic field exhibit the fascinating phenomenon of fractional\nquantum Hall effect.

This dissertation consists of a brief introduction and two empirical essays. In each essay, I intend to achieve two goals: (1) apply a set of causal econometric modeling techniques to establish the causal relationship between a marketing strategic variable and a crucial outcome variable; and (2) provide an understanding of the drivers of the effect by revealing underlying behavioral mechanisms. \nIn the first essay, I investigate whether a firm\u2019s advertising spending disclosure decision depends on the disclosure decisions of competing peer firms. I exploit a 1994 reporting rule that made advertising spending disclosures voluntary in the United States to distinguish causal peer influences from correlated behaviors. I test and differentiate two underlying behavioral mechanisms: information externality\u2013based herding and financial externality\u2013based herding. Robust evidence shows herding effects among peer firms and the herding effect mainly is driven by the information externality mechanism. While the first essay focused on firms\u2019 decisions related to advertising spending, in the second essay, I focus on another important area in marketing: customer and sales force management. I seek to understand the economic consequences of sales rep departure and assignment of customers of departing sales reps. Using data from a Fortune 500 firm and a difference-in-differences analysis, I quantify the causal effect of a sales rep\u2019s departure on customer sales and the efficacy of customer assignment strategies. I provide empirical evidence that sales rep departures induce a significant drop in sales; and existing sales reps who are similar to the departing ones mitigate sales losses significantly better than existing sales reps who exhibit high past performance.  Each essay contributes to different substantive domains but both provide resolutions to unsolved marketing problems by leveraging observational data and applying causal econometric modeling methods.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11722], "author_name_tesi": "Shi, Huanhuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Shi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huanhuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shrihari Sridhar", "Rajdeep Grewal", "Gary L Lilien", "Steven J Huddart"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shrihari Sridhar, Dissertation Advisor", "Rajdeep Grewal, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary L Lilien, Committee Member", "Steven J Huddart, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["causal analysis", "marketing strategy", "advertising expense", "voluntary disclosure", "sales force departure"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "BIOFUNCTIONALIZED NANO-ELECTRO-MECHANICAL-SYSTEMS (BIO-NEMS):\nACOUSTIC TWEEZERS\u2014APPLYING ACOUSTICS IN MICROFLUIDICS AND ACTIVE PLASMONICS\n", "id": "9911", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3099", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ability to actively manipulate cells and microparticles on-chip is critical for numerous biological studies and applications such as flow cytometry, cell sorting, microarrays, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Researchers have developed a variety of patterning techniques such as microcontact printing, optical tweezers, optoelectronic tweezers, magnetic tweezers, electro-/dielectro-phoresis, evanescent waves/plasmonics, hydrodynamic flows, and bulk acoustic wave-based acoustophoresis. However, none of these techniques simultaneously meet specifications for miniaturization, versatility, throughput, speed, and power consumption. This thesis presents an active manipulating technique named \u201cacoustic tweezers\u201d that utilizes standing surface acoustic wave (SSAW) to build an acoustophoresis platform which can (1) three-dimensionally focus or even line-up micro/nanoparticles in a microchannel to facilitate the flow cytometry/cell sorting; (2) pattern virtually all kinds of cells and microparticles in both one-dimensional and two dimensional manners regardless of their shape, size, charge or polarizability; (3) continuously separate particles with different sizes, densities or compressibility through a continuous flow in a microchannel. Its power intensity, approximately 500,000 times lower than that of optical tweezers, compares favorably with those of other active particle-manipulation methods. Its speed is among the highest reported in literature, and flow cytometry studies have revealed it to be non-invasive. The aforementioned advantages, along with this technique\u2019s simple design and ability to be miniaturized, render the \u201cacoustic tweezers\u201d technique a promising tool for various applications in biology, chemistry, engineering, and materials science. \n\nFurthermore, the \u201cacoustic tweezers\u201d technique was also verified to be effective in active tuning of surface plasmons\u2014electron density waves that can potentially merge the photonics and electronics at nanoscale.

As a complex nonlinear optical phenomenon, SC generated in highly nonlinear photonic crystal fiber (PCF) exhibits broad spectral bandwidth (~1000nm) and laser-like spatial coherence. These novel properties open new opportunities for imaging and spectroscopy applications. More specifically, as fast data acquisition rate has always been desired in three-dimensional optical imaging system, optical imaging part of this thesis discusses new methods of improving imaging scanning speed in both confocal and two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging systems by using wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technique under the illumination of supercontinuum and femto-second laser sources.  In spectroscopy part, we focus on broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy with SC light source. The high spatial coherence of SC enables the capability to optically trap microscopic objects while the broad bandwidth allow us to perform broad-band CARS measurement over a range up to 3000 cm-1. We also developed a technique to suppress non-resonant background, which is the major factor limiting the sensitivity of a CARS measurement. The first chapter gives the overview. Chapter three and four discuss imaging applications including reflection-type confocal microscopy and two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging. Chapter five discusses the topic of CARS and technique to suppress non-resonant background.\nIn chapter two, I include a review of SC generation as well as a brief description on SC generation in PCF. SC generated in imaging fiber taper and spectrally smoothed SC generated by modulated femto-second pulses are also reported in this chapter. Generalized nonlinear Schrodinger equation (GNLS) is numerically solved for theoretical modeling of SC generation in PCF.\nChapter three focuses on the topic of WDM confocal microscopy by using broadband SC light source. Both lateral and axial WDM systems are investigated, which can potentially speed up the data acquisition rate significantly.\nChapter four describes WDM scanning for two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging system. It is experimentally demonstrated that the mechanical scanning along axial direction in two-photon imaging system can be replaced by tuning the incident laser wavelengths. A lateral WDM scanning also is demonstrated. \nIn chapter five, CARS spectroscopy is discussed. Broad band (up to 3000cm-1) CARS spectroscopy in supercontinuum trap is demonstrated. Non-resonant background can be suppressed by applying a polarization discriminated and time-resolved technique. A spectrally smoothed SC source is also investigated to obtain a smoothed-out non-resonant background so that the resonant Raman peaks can be easily observed.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3585], "author_name_tesi": "Shi, Kebin ", "last_name_ssi": "Shi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kebin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhiwen Liu", "Qiming Zhang", "Shizhuo Yin", "Ahmed A Heikal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhiwen Liu, Committee Chair", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "Ahmed A Heikal, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["supercontinuum", "confocal imaging", "optical trapping", "coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering", "two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The role of Sf-Stk in stress erythropoiesis", "id": "11642", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3936", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-01-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Erythropoiesis refers to the differentiation from LT-HSC through CMP, BFU-E and CFU-E to mature erythrocytes.

It relies on high Epo concentration and utilizes unique erythroid progenitors other than homeostatic erythropoiesis. Except for Epo, BMP4, SCF and Shh are also required in stress erythropoiesis. The results in our lab in the past decades suggest that erythroid progenitors in bone marrow migrate to spleen where they respond to several factors including GDF15, Shh and SCF and differentiate into BMP4 responsive cells.

In the second stage, a proviral insertion activates Pu.1 gene which keeps infected erythroid progenitors in undifferentiating stage and leads to erythroleukemia. Only one viral protein \u2013 gp55, is required to induce this Epo independent polyclonal expansion. Recent research suggested that gp55 interact with a truncate form of stem-cell tyrosine kinase (Sf-Stk) on the cell surface to promote the proliferation of infected erythroid progenitors. Since the similarity between Friend virus induced polyclonal expansion of erythroid progenitors and stress erythropoiesis, it has been proposed that Friend virus utilize the stress erythropoiesis pathway to infect target cells. Further experiments from our lab demonstrate that hypoxia and BMP4 can increase Friend virus target cells in spleen which are also stress erythroid progenitors. f/f mutant mice which have a delay recovery from acute anemia are defective in Friend virus targets. Since the important role Sf-Stk in Friend virus induced polyclonal expansion, we hypothesize that Sf-Stk may play an intrinsic role in stress erythropoiesis.\nIn the second chapter, we demonstrated that stress erythropoiesis is induced in adult liver during tissue hypoxia in the absence of spleen. Splenectomized f/f mice exhibit similar defects in stress erythropoiesis as f/f mice. BMP4 is expressed in liver corresponding to the expansion of stress BFU-E. Furthermore the splenectomized f/f mice are defective in liver erythropoiesis as well which correspond to the defect in BMP4 expression which indicates a role of BMP4 pathway in liver stress erythropoiesis as well. We concluded that BMP4 signal pathway plays a role in extramedullary erythropoiesis, which primarily occurs in spleen and fetal liver or adult liver when spleen is absent.\nIn the third chapter, we tested the expansion and differentiation of erythroid progenitors in the Sf-Stk deficient mice. The data reveal that Sf-Stk-/- mice have fewer stress BFU-Es as well as CFU-Es in spleen. The mutant stress BFU-Es have less potential to expand into erythrocytes. We also observed greater mortality rate in Sf-Stk-/- mice during the recovery from bone marrow transplantation which indicate that the expansion of erythroid progenitors in bone marrow is also affected by Sf-Stk deficiency. Further studies on bone marrow cells reveal that the Sf-Stk deficient bone marrow cells have an early expansion of stress BFU-Es during in vitro culturing than control mice which corresponds with the observation that mutant spleen cells have early terminal differentiation during in vitro culturing. A study of the RBC life span indicates that there is an early expansion of RBCs in Sf-Stk-/- mice during the recovery from bone marrow transplantation. Those early emerged RBCs are defective and removed early during the recovery. This disruption of new RBC in Sf-Stk-/- mice during the recovery corresponds with the death of Sf-Stk-/- mice after bone marrow transplantation. Combining all those observations we propose that Sf-Stk may participate in promoting the proliferating and/or suppressing the differentiating of erythroid progenitors. When Sf-Stk expression is abrogated, stress erythroid progenitors fail to amplify and differentiate early which exhaust the pool of erythroid progenitors. The early expansion of erythroid progenitors generate defective new RBCs which were removed early leading to higher mortality rate during the recovery from bone marrow transplantation induced acute anemia.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3909], "author_name_tesi": "Shi, Lei ", "last_name_ssi": "Shi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Paulson", "Robert Paulson", "Pamela Hankey", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Naomi S Altman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Paulson, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Paulson, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stress erythropoiesis", "Sf-Stk", "Friend Virus"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF A NEUTRON COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SYSTEM AT THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY", "id": "8394", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3866", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Neutron tomography has been proved to be a powerful tool in the non-destructive \n\ntesting and many other engineering application fields.

A data analysis framework based on the idea of goal equivalent manifold (GEM) has been previously developed to study inter-trial error correction and to predict both the temporal and geometric structure of variability for skilled motor performance. The GEM framework successfully provides a general model-based approach for characterizing the neuromotor dynamic system from experimental data. However, the first-order autoregressive (AR) models adopted by previous studies have never been shown to be adequate. Furthermore, they are incapable of explaining why there is more variability in the performance of older people, especially given the finding that both young and old people share a similar geometrical structure to their variability. In this thesis, we focus on human gait data introducing higher-order AR model into the GEM framework so that we can look more carefully at the inter-stride dynamics, particularly in regard to the required state space dimension needed to model fluctuations. We use the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC & BIC) to analyze the distribution of preferred model orders of two age groups. We find that the most probable model orders of two groups are no larger than three, especially, the model orders selected by BIC indicate the first-order AR model could describe the dynamic system well by showing that first and second order models are most frequently picked. For geometric structure, a lower order model is preferred for variability in goal-relevant subspace while a higher order model is preferred in null subspace.

The dependence of light output of the polyvinyl toluene (PVT) scintillator EJ-290 on neutron energy is presented. Neutrons are detected with a recently developed heterogeneous composite scintillator based on EJ-290 scintillating PVT and lithium-doped scintillating glass (GS20) rods. Besides the excellent pulse shape discrimination performance resulting from different decay times of the EJ-290 and GS20, the capability of both thermal neutron detection and fast neutron spectroscopy in a single detector makes the composite scintillator design attractive for a variety of applications. In this work, the nonproportional dependence of the scintillation light output of EJ-290 on deposited neutron energy has been measured in the range of 0\u201314.1 MeV through a combination of time-of-flight (TOF) measurement and previously conducted measurements with monoenergetic neutron sources (DD, 2.45 MeV and DT, 14.1 MeV). The TOF measurements were performed by tagging fission events occurring in a Cf-252 spontaneous fission source over a period of 120 hours. The thermalization light output spectrum exhibits a more peak-like shape compared to non-capture-gated scintillation detector because of the nearly full energy deposition prior to neutron capture. The light output nonlinearity of the EJ-290 PVT resulting from energy-dependent quenching is described via the Birks and Chou parametrization, both of which produce good fits to experimental results.

With the globalization of the marketplace, the communication and promotion programs supporting these markets must also globalize. As the manufacture of both consumer goods and industrial products expands into the developing nations and international standards increasingly influence worldwide markets, trade shows are no longer confined to the western world. Exhibitions in emerging economies have gained more attention for marketers worldwide to achieve their marketing objectives. This is particularly true in the furniture supplying industries.  With the rapid growth of the Chinese furniture industry, the supplying industries such as woodworking machinery, wood raw materials and components, and furniture hardware have provided tremendous market opportunities in China for manufacturers and suppliers in the furniture supplying industries around the world.

Generally, homeostasis and diseases are inversely related. Therefore, great efforts have been made in the development of pharmaceutical drug delivery systems targeting homeostasis. Among various drug delivery systems, self-regulated drug delivery systems are able to recognize changes in the concentrations of specific analytes from physiological environment and work to counteract these changes. These systems thus are able to provide a negative feedback loop to sustain physiological homeostasis. However, it is still challenging to adjust the on-off transitions under physiological conditions because of the lack of recognition elements with high specificity. The objective of this thesis was to investigate a sequentially triggered mechanism for self-regulated delivery system to solve this issue.\nA core-shell structured polymeric system was developed to demonstrate this idea. This system could go through sequential reactions in response to a specific metabolite. In the presence of this metabolite, the core of this system would undergo a localized molecular conformational change and would release a second trigger molecule. This second trigger molecule could then trigger the release of the designated drug stored in the shell of this system. \nIn this study, adenosine and human platelet derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) were used as a model for the development of a self-regulated polymeric system. First, three DNA oligonucleotides were designed for adenosine recognition, second trigger molecule interaction, and PDGF-BB loading. Then, adenosine-triggered release behaviors of the second trigger molecule from the core were investigated. Finally, adenosine-triggered PDGF-BB release was characterized in the core-shell structured system.

Although the structure and geodynamics of the region are well studied (e.g., Hayes and Furlong, 2007), how the landscape responds to rapidly evolving patterns of differential rock uplift remains uncertain. It has been suggested that drainage reorganization results from capture of the Russian by the Eel River during northward migration of a wave of rock uplift at ~ 2 Ma (Lock et al., 2006). Whether the drainage reorganization is linked to the pattern of differential rock uplift and subsidence due to the MTJ migration, however, can be tested with analysis of stream profiles throughout the modern Russian and Eel watersheds, as transient fluvial incision associated with drainage reorganization should be encoded in channel profiles.\n\n  Analysis of three hundred and fifty channel profiles in the Russian and Eel River watersheds reveals evidence for a recent increase in incision rate, in the form of knickpoints along main stem and tributary channels that separate headwater reaches of low gradient from downstream segments with steeper profiles. The presence of knickpoints, and associated differences in channel profile steepness appear to reflect a transient, and incomplete, adjustment of channels in this landscape to a relatively recent increase in rock uplift rate. Moreover, spatial variations in knickpoint elevation and channel steepness downstream of knickpoints suggest the presence of spatial variations in rock uplift that appear to be consistent with the wavelength and direction of rock uplift predicted by the Mendocino Crustal Conveyor (MCC) model. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6706], "author_name_tesi": "Shi, Xuhua ", "last_name_ssi": "Shi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xuhua", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Kirby", "Eric Kirby", "Kevin Patrick Furlong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Kirby, Thesis Advisor", "Eric Kirby, Thesis Advisor", "Kevin Patrick Furlong, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["northern California", "Mendocino Triple Junction", "Transient channel incision", "Coast Ranges"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Deformation of lacustrine shorelines in central Tibet: Implications for lake level history, fault kinematics, and crustal rheology", "id": "22402", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10233", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Quantification of the rheology of Tibetan lithosphere is critical to understanding the deformational processes that drive the growth of the Tibetan plateau, but remains poorly understood.

Optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating of numerous shorelines around Siling Co indicate this lake was reached at the highstand at 6 \u2013 4 ka and subsequently fell to present-day levels.
