I first examine how soccer globalized, moving from a local game developed in post-industrial England to its current status as a global sport. Using Appadurai\u2019s scapes, I examine how soccer incorporates the geographic flow of people, money, media, technology, and ideology to create a globalized cultural form. \n\tAfter building the foundation of a global game, I examine the case of the English Premier League (EPL) to detail the ways in which globalization of soccer has resulted in a commercialized sporting form. After establishing the EPL as a global brand, I examine how the clubs were sold and adapted to the American market, particularly through the process of reverse corporate nationalism. The EPL is sold as something authentically British to appeal to American audiences who engage with the game as a global form. \n\tThis theme is also evident in a key analytical component of this dissertation: a participant observation of a popular soccer-oriented sports bar in Washington D.C. I examine the ways in which fans engage with the global through their affiliation with global sport as enacted by their fandom and their reflections on it. I particularly highlight how fans are attempting to act and explain their actions in ways that are consistent with preconceived notions of fan authenticity, by enacting practices that then allow them to see themselves as connected to Europe, the UK and even specific cities and neighborhoods in various ways. Here fans are making connections with the global through acts of consumption, but also make meaning through those acts that situate them as cosmopolitans with hybrid identities. The use of soccer to engage with the global is thus a complex and multifaceted process. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15286], "author_name_tesi": "Cooke, Tanner Ryan", "last_name_ssi": "Cooke", "middle_name_ssi": "Ryan", "first_name_ssi": "Tanner", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Matthew Paul Mcallister", "Charles Elavsky", "Marie Hardin", "Mark Dyreson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Paul Mcallister, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Paul Mcallister, Committee Chair", "Charles Elavsky, Committee Member", "Marie Hardin, Committee Member", "Mark Dyreson, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Globalization", "Sport", "Media Studies", "MediaSport", "Ethnography", "City", "Branding"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Growth, Structure, and Optical Characterization of Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor Nanowires", "id": "11303", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "687", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nanowires combining the usually disparate areas of semiconductors and magnetism are of contemporary relevance within the context of semiconductor spintronics. This is a relatively new field of research that seeks to exploit electron spin within electronic and opto-electronic semiconductor devices. While much of the effort within semiconductor spintronics has been directed toward fundamental studies and applications of 3D, 2D and 0D systems, there has been little work to date on 1D systems. The distinctive change in the electronic density of states with changing dimensionality provides a strong motivation for developing and exploring semiconductor nanowires in which one might be able to probe and control spin-dependent phenomena within a 1D or quasi-1D environment. This thesis explores the crystal growth, structural properties and magneto-optical behavior of quasi-1D semiconductor nanowires in which we incorporate magnetism through two approaches: first, by synthesizing nanowires of the diluted magnetic semiconductor (Zn,Mn)Se, wherein the <i>d</i>-shell electrons of substitutional Mn ions interact with the band states of the ZnSe host lattice via <i>sp&ndash;d</i> exchange; second, by making hybrid core-shell nanostructures wherein a metallic ferromagnetic shell (MnAs) is epitaxially deposited on a semiconductor nanowire (GaAs). After an introductory overview of past work in the field and a description of the experimental techniques relevant to the thesis, we discuss our experimental results.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first set of experiments focuses on ZnSe and (Zn,Mn)Se nanowires grown in a single stage. The nanowires were grown on Si and GaAs substrates with a thin layer of gold evaporated onto them, which were then annealed before growth so that the gold formed nanoscale droplets. The growth yields samples covered in random arrays of nanowires growing out an an angle to the substrate, with an undergrowth of crooked nanowires and other small structures. The long thin nanowires vary in diameter, down to ~ 10 nm, with ~ 15&ndash;20 nm being fairly common. Structural characterization done by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) shows that the long nanowires are largely single crystal, though often with many stacking faults, and tend to form in the wurtzite crystal structure with <i>c</i>-axis growth direction. Elemental analysis performed on individual nanowires using X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy shows that Mn can be incorporated into Zn<sub>1&minus;<i>x</i></sub>Mn<sub><i>x</i></sub>Se nanowires in high concentrations, up to <i>x</i> ~ 0.6. Magneto-photoluminescence (magneto-PL) measurements of as-grown samples reveal substantial Zeeman shifts in the near band edge luminescence, but only partial polarization, indicating the luminescence is originating in a nanostructured environment. Surprisingly, however, nearly all of the PL signal comes from the nanostructured undergrowth rather than the long nanowires, as shown from magneto-PL measurements of samples which were sonicated to remove the long nanowires.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next set of experiments covers ZnSe and (Zn,Mn)Se nanowires grown using a two-stage process. The substrates are prepared in a similar manner as the in the previous samples. The first stage of growth is carried out at lower than normal substrate temperature, which results in highly tapered nanoneedles with narrow tips (~ 10 nm). The second stage of growth is performed under normal nanowire growth conditions, yielding narrow nanowires growing from the tips of the nanoneedles. These nanowires have far fewer defects than nanowires grown in a single stage process. Magneto-PL measurements carried out in a micro-PL system show many localized emitters and near band edge emission that shifts in a magnetic field. Sonicated samples gave similar results, indicating that the undergrowth is still responsible for much of the luminescence, even though there is much less undergrowth than in the single stage nanowires. Measurements of dispersed samples suggests that some of the luminescence may be coming from nanowires, but the sources of emission from dispersed samples could not be conclusively identified.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last set of experiments involves core-shell nanowires created by growing epitaxial shells on GaAs nanowire cores. The GaAs cores are grown using a self-seeded technique, in which a GaAs substrate is coated with SiO<sub>2</sub> and then etched to open nanoscale pinholes in the SiO<sub>2</sub>. During growth, Ga atoms accumulate in the pinholes and form droplets that then serve as seed particles for VLS nanowire growth. To create the shells, the growth conditions are changed to epitaxial growth conditions. Shells of the ferromagnetic metal MnAs have been grown epitaxially on the side faces of the GaAs nanowires. The epitaxial relationship between the MnAs and GaAs depends on whether the GaAs is in the zincblende or wurtzite crystal phase. ZnSe and (Zn,Mn)Se shells have also been grown on the GaAs nanowires, providing a possible alternative method to create quasi-1D systems of (Zn,Mn)Se.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [682], "author_name_tesi": "Cooley, Benjamin Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Cooley", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth", "Nitin Samarth", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Kenneth O Hara", "Jian Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nitin Samarth, Dissertation Advisor", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Chair", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Kenneth O Hara, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["diluted magnetic semiconductor", "nanowire", "semiconductor nanowire", "nanowire growth"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Getting Lost in Affective Landscapes of Listening: Being There with Children Through Art, Adventure Play and Playwork", "id": "25112", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11305", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My thesis research explores a different way of being with children, focusing on ways to support the emergent and ongoing encounters of children. My thesis specifically investigates playwork, a practice whereby adults called playworkers create and foster environments that are playful. Playworkers support children\u2019s play, assess children\u2019s encounters of risk versus hazard, and assist children when needed, without usurping their play experiences. Playwork has historically emerged out of adventure playground contexts. For this reason, in my thesis I give rise to a short history of adventure playgrounds: sites comprised of loose parts that children can move and manipulate to create their own structures for play. Furthermore, adventure playgrounds are sites where playworkers are present, but to the least necessary degree. The idea is that these playgrounds foster a free and permissive environment for children to play, explore, discover, and make stuff, with the ability to take risks, without the absolute absence of an adult.\nWhen I think about my motivations in writing this thesis, I am brought back to my belief that listening to and being with children, as adults/educators/researchers, is an ethical necessity which facilitates an ability to come to know children through letting go of adult presuppositions. I am moved by the way playworkers function in a perpetual state of coming to know children through letting go in their attempts to make themselves as invisible as possible in their work with children. They put the development of the child before their adult discomforts.\nComing to know about playwork has significantly impacted the trajectory of my pedagogy as an art educator. It has caused me to wonder about further ways of knowing the artistic and conceptual work of young children, and how it informs my work as an adult/teacher/researcher. Thus, in this thesis, I take up the question: How does adult curiosity and curation of materials along with children\u2019s expertise and inquiry converge in the constructions of art making through play? Even more, how might theoretical concepts of the playful co-production of space in the form of adventure playgrounds/play installations inform pedagogical practices of art educators?", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10845], "author_name_tesi": "Coombs, Alison Katherine", "last_name_ssi": "Coombs", "middle_name_ssi": "Katherine", "first_name_ssi": "Alison", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Thompson", "Booker Stephen Carpenter Ii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine Thompson, Thesis Advisor", "Booker Stephen Carpenter Ii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Art", "Art Education", "Adventure Playgrounds", "Playwork"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Inquirying about student work in a professional development school context:  A case of cross-role triads", "id": "24768", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10876", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study is a case of cross-role triads - mentor teacher, intern, and supervisor - engaged in looking at student work in elementary mathematics over time in an elementary professional development school (PDS) setting.

By recognizing and understanding these factors, we gain new insights into fostering the development of effective PDS triad relationships.  This qualitative research study used case study methodology as an investigative tool to analyze the talk in a series of PDS triad conversations.  The primary source of data collection was a series of audio-recorded triad meetings.  Other data sources included student learning data (student work) and the researcher\u2019s reflexive journal.  The data suggested that when the understanding of student learning data was foregrounded as the primary task of all three triad members, advances in student learning across the study cycles were more clearly visible in the student work.  The findings also indicated that the quantity and substance of intern participation in the inquiry process varied across the triads.

Visitors included both whitewater rafters and kayakers, recreating privately or with the assistance of a commercial outfitter.  This study also sought to identify the existence of social norms among visitors by examining levels of norm prevalence and norm crystallization (agreement). \n\nThe study took place on the White Salmon River, within the Columbia River National Scenic Area in southern Washington.  Surveys were administered in two waves, during the Summer and Fall seasons of 2008 and 2009.  A total of 1260 completed surveys were collected.  All data were analyzed with quantitative methods, using SPSS version 17.0.  \n\nThe findings of this study suggest that visitor perceptions of crowding have increased on the river since the most recent study was conducted in 1993.  Despite this increase, the level of crowding on the White Salmon remains on the level or below the level of perceived crowding reported at comparable recreation areas in the United States.  In terms of normative standards, findings from this study were consistent with a prior study examining the relationships between encounters, norms and crowding (Vaske & Donnelly, 2002).  Perceived crowding scores were significantly higher for those visitors reporting a norm violation (reporting an encounter higher than the corresponding normative standard).  The findings of this study also indicate significant relationships between encounters, conflict, crowding and satisfaction.  Relationships supported the idea that conflict is a significant predictor of crowding (as proposed by Manning et al, 2000), which was an addition to the traditional crowding \u2013 satisfaction model.  The final model produced by this study expands on the traditional crowding \u2013 satisfaction model by adding the influence of conflict on perceived crowding.  This final model was statistically strong, predicting 52 percent of the variance in perceived crowding and 58 percent of the variance in satisfaction scores.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5167], "author_name_tesi": "Cooper, Robert J", "last_name_ssi": "Cooper", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan R Graefe", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Harry Zinn", "Alan R Graefe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan R Graefe, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Justin Mowen, Thesis Advisor", "Harry Zinn, Thesis Advisor", "Alan R Graefe, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Recreation Crowding Conflict Norms Management"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Outdoor Orientation Programs: Recreation Socialization, Social Support and Identity Development in Emerging Adulthood", "id": "16250", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8156", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Outdoor orientation programs can be found at over 160 universities in the United States.

These programs have been studied in the past, resulting in evidence that suggests that the programs do increase perceived feelings of social support, which eases this transition and translates to improved academic performance in college.

The aims of the study are to examine potential effects of the program upon leisure behavior, social support and identity development. In addition to examining potential outcomes of ORION similar to previous program evaluations, this study also examines the effects of the program as an agent to recreation socialization by exposing students to new outdoor activities and social circles within which to pursue recreation experiences.

An essential shift in trauma literature has recently occurred, however, as researchers have begun exploring the phenomenon of transformative growth as a post-trauma outcome.  Despite this movement, minimal research exists on this positive change, and studies have yet to adequately establish the factors that contribute most to the development of post-traumatic growth.  This quantitative dissertation begins with a broad overview of the extant research on post-trauma outcomes, drawing upon direction from current empirical literature on traumatic stress, interpersonal bonding, and resilience in order to isolate and address the gaps in the research.  Specifically, the purpose of the study was to examine the relation between trauma exposure and various interpersonal bonding experiences within the context parental, romantic, and platonic relationships on the development of post-traumatic growth qualities in a sample of undergraduate college students.  These qualities included Relating to Others, New Possibilities, Personal Strengths, Spiritual Change, and Appreciation for Life.  The final sample included in the study consisted of 202 undergraduate students enrolled at a Mid-Atlantic institution of higher education.  Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed in order to explore each research question.  Major findings indicated that close platonic relationships had moderate, negative effects on the development of each outcome variable (Relating to Others, New Possibilities, Personal Strengths, Spiritual Change, and Appreciation for Life), indicating that close and dependable friendships served as the most significant attachment-oriented predictor of positive change in students with trauma history.

The combination of peptide coupling chemistry and transition metal chemistry to create these mimetic molecules has the potential to construct exceptionally intricate supramolecular structures for applications in molecular wiring, catalysis, and sensing.  This thesis describes synthetic modifications to ligand-substituted oligopeptide sequences for the creation of selective strands that interact with transition metals to form specific duplex structures, and introduces analytical techniques that could be exploited to study the formation and structure of the resulting metallated complexes.  All of the experiments are aimed towards the conception of more elaborate, metal containing constructs in solution.\nThe solution phase synthesis of artificial self-complementary di and tri peptides composed of ligand substituted aminoethylglycine (aeg) was achieved to produce anti-parallel metallated duplexes in the presence of tetracoordinate metals.  Studies of the dipeptides, which consist of a monodentate pyridine (py) and tridentate terpyridine (tpy) or phenyl terpyridine (\u03a6-tpy) ligand in series on the aeg backbone, exhibit a 2:2 Cu:dipeptide binding stoichiometry during spectrophotometric titrations with Cu2+, indicative of the predicted metallated duplex. The single strands and the Cu-linked complexes are characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, HPLC, and absorbance spectroscopy.  An artificial tripeptide has also been synthesized that consists of py, dimethyl bipyridine (bpy), and tpy in series on the aeg backbone.  Characterization and formation of the duplex with three metal centers is investigated by various techniques such as EPR and spectrophotometric titrations.\nAs an additional synthetic modification that could potentially impact the selectivity between strands, self-complementary chiral artificial oligopeptides composed of N-heterocyclic bpy ligands tethered on an aminoethylvaline (aev) backbone have been made.  These strands are also designed to self-assemble in solution upon addition of a tetracoordinate metal, forming metallated duplexes.  Metal complexation between the oligopeptides forms coordinative crosslinks (i.e. Cu(bpy)22+ or Zn(bpy)22+), which is monitored by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.  The chiral single strands and complexes are characterized by NMR, mass spectrometry, CD, elemental analysis, and HPLC.\nThe thermodynamic properties and binding stoichiometries of metal to ligand-substituted oligopeptide interactions can be quantitatively determined using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC).   These data can help in the fabrication of much longer, heterofunctional structures.  High resolution NMR is an analytical tool that can be utilized to gain essential information about the formation and resulting structure of metal crosslinked oligopeptides.   A titration of paramagnetic Cu(II) into a solution of the heterofunctional Fmoc-aeg(py)-aeg(bpy)-aeg(tpy)-OtBu tripeptide has been followed by NMR spectroscopy, affording a qualitative insight into the multidentate ligand saturation dependence on the concentration of added metal ions.  Substitution of a diffusion probe in the spectrometer allows the computation of the diffusion coefficient for isolated metallated duplex structures as a method to confirm successful duplex formation and estimate the size of the molecules.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7396], "author_name_tesi": "Coppock, Matthew Bradford", "last_name_ssi": "Coppock", "middle_name_ssi": "Bradford", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Thomas E Mallouk", "John H Golbeck", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["artificial oligopeptide", "ligandoside", "self-assembly", "PNA"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "STATE FEEDBACK REACTOR CONTROL USING A VANADIUM AND RHODIUM SELF-POWERED NEUTRON DETECTOR", "id": "15309gjc5226", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15309", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The safe and effective control of nuclear reactors is of significant interest to the research reactor community and nuclear power utility industry. Numerous advanced control algorithms have demonstrated superior reactor control over the past several decades \u2013 primarily on simulated reactors. Among these, state feedback control has been applied to virtually every type of dynamic system. This thesis focuses on developing an accurate model of the Penn State TRIGA Reactor simulation and creating a state feedback controller/state observer design using self-powered Vanadium and Rhodium neutron detectors (SPND) as feedback sensors. This work is the first attempt to use these type of sensors in a closed-loop feedback system for reactor control. The foundation of the equations in Simulink has been derived from normalized point kinetics equations and core averaged thermal-hydraulic equations. The self-powered detector dynamics may be developed from basic activation/decay balance differential equations. The MATLAB and Simulink suite of software tools are used to develop the TRIGA nonlinear model, self-powered neutron detector models, state observer and state feedback controller. Results demonstrate that the TRIGA Simulink model developed compares well with the actual TRIGA Reactor data. Self-powered neutron detectors are suited to monitor continuously reactor power. Due to their dependence on radioactive decay after irradiation to produce a current signal, self-powered detectors have significant delay times associated with them, making them not useful for real-time feedback control. A major contribution of this thesis is the development and application of detector inverse models, which null-out delays introduced by the physics of the detector. Results demonstrate that the inverse detector models have no delay which is desirable for the reactor closed-loop control. The long delay associated with the normal detector models can only realistically be used for applications where this delay can be tolerated, such as post-accident power monitoring. SPNDs need no external power to produce current levels consistent with ion chambers and may provide to be a vital component for closed-loop nuclear reactor control in the future. Accurate and fast measurement of the reactor power with SPNDs will support this goal, and will reactors to safely operate closer to their operational limits. The successful application of an advanced control algorithm i.e., state-feedback control with self-powered neutron detectors, demonstrates that this technology may be applied in closed-loop nuclear reactor control and safety systems not only for power plant applications, but for space nuclear reactor applications as well.

Thus, trajectory generation occurs in near-constant time, which allows for fast adaptation as the target state estimate is refined.

Leaders in higher education must address these issues to position their institutions to attract top students, faculty, and administrators. Since the current higher education leadership workforce\u2014mostly White male administrators\u2014is retiring, there is a need to develop the next generation of leaders positioned to face the unique challenges of higher education. Women administrators continue to lag behind in securing senior leadership positions in higher education and preparing the next generation of women leaders to tackle these current industry challenges is an urgent issue. Researchers need to examine why women in higher education are not advancing in larger numbers to senior leadership positions and what sponsors of leadership programs can do to support the advancement of women leaders.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to examine how one university-based leadership development program is enabling women to assume leadership positions and whether that program was meeting its stated objectives. A qualitative case study approach was used to analyze the lived experiences of study participants. Nine administrative fellows who participated in the Administrative Fellows Program at University X from 2004 to 2013 were interviewed and secondary data were reviewed and analyzed as a part of the case study. The results revealed a generally broad overall alignment of main themes between the fellow\u2019s understanding of the goals for the Administrative Fellows Program and organizational goals. However, a few misalignments were noted between the fellows and the program centered primarily on learning activities during the fellowship and experiences and expectations for advancement opportunities after the fellowship year. Recommendations are made regarding two critical components of the Administrative Fellows Program at University X. The first is an examination of the learning activities of the program. The second is an examination of the mentor- mentee roles and the related relationship and expectations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10172], "author_name_tesi": "Corby, Michelle E", "last_name_ssi": "Corby", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William J Rothwell", "Rose Marie Baker", "Wesley Edward Donahue", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William J Rothwell, Dissertation Advisor", "Rose Marie Baker, Committee Member", "Wesley Edward Donahue, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["women's leadership development", "women in higher education", "fellowship programs", "university sponsored leadership development"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Employee Perceptions of Leader-Member Exchange and Usage of Family Leave Policies", "id": "6888", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "716", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many organizations offer family policies to help employees balance their work and family roles. Supervisor support has been found to be an important predictor of employee leave utilization. However, previous researchers have focused on supervisor support for family rather than supervisor support for work, and these studies tend to be atheoretical. Furthermore, no known research investigates reasons why employees decide to use or not use leave policies. Leader-member exchange theory offers a useful model for examining the impact of the employee-supervisor relationship on usage of family policies. Drawing on this theory, the present study proposed that LMX would be related to both past use of and future intentions to use family leave; however, this relationship could be either positive or negative and for different reasons. Three mediators were suggested to explain the proposed relationships: fear of career consequences, informal support, and indebtedness. The effects of gender and occupational status on the hypothesized relationships were also investigated. Data gathered from 368 employees at four manufacturing facilities indicated that LMX did affect employee intentions to use personal leave and this relationship was curvilinear. Employees with both higher and lower quality relationships with their supervisors were less likely to intend to use personal leave than those with medium quality relationships. Results also indicated that indebtedness mediated the relationship between LMX and intentions to use personal leave for those with high levels of LMX. Exploratory analyses found that gender moderated the relationship between LMX and intentions to use parental leave such that high and low LMX females were less likely to intend to use parental leave than those with medium levels of LMX and there was no relationship between LMX and leave intentions for men. In addition, occupational status moderated the relationship between LMX and intentions to use personal leave such that blue-collar workers with high and low LMX relationships were less likely to intend to use personal leave than those with medium LMX relationships, and white-collar workers with high LMX had lower intentions to use personal leave than those with low LMX.

Through the use of immunological reagents designed to specifically detect PKA-phosphorylated NS5A, we have shown this modified form of the protein is a subset of all NS5A present in cells stably replicating HCV RNA.

The most common vestimentiferan tubeworm of the upper Louisiana slope is Lamellibrachia luymesi. This, and other species of tubeworms, form aggregations of hundreds to thousands of individuals which harbor a diverse community. In this study, a total of 40 tubeworm aggregation and mussel bed samples containing at least 171 macrofaunal species were collected at seeps from 520 to 3300 m depth. The upper Louisiana slope communities progress through a predictable sequence of successional stages. The youngest aggregations contain high biomass communities dominated by endemic species, with biomass decreasing over time as the relative abundance of non-endemic fauna in upper trophic levels increases. This process is mainly driven by the abundance of hydrogen sulfide in the epibenthic layer. Models support the hypothesis that L. luymesi alters its environment by releasing the sulfate generated by its internal symbionts into deeper sediment layers. This alters the distribution of sulfide leading to declines in sulfide concentration among the tubeworm tubes. The combination of these lines of evidence support the assertion that L. luymesi is a significant ecosystem engineer at hydrocarbon seeps in the Gulf of Mexico.

Previous research has focused on creating controllers with the ship\u2019s airwake properties included in the synthesis in order to compensate for gusts without affecting pilot commands. These controllers alleviate gusts using either the standard swashplate-based control or using trailing-edge flaps (TEFs) but both methods show similar performance. This study investigates the effects of both controllers on the requirements of the swashplate actuators. A nonlinear inverse kinematic and dynamic model of the swashplate mechanism is developed that relates the blade pitching motions to actuator and pitch link motions and forces. Results from simulations of a UH-60 Blackhawk landing on an LHA class ship in various airwakes are input into the swashplate model to determine the motion and forces required of the actuators. The controllers are compared with regard to their relative impact on component wear and fatigue. Trailing edge flap based gust alleviation is shown to reduce the total actuator cumulative travel by 31% and the number of direction reversals in a single actuator by 38%.\n\nHelicopter vibrations can exacerbate the effects of high workload environments by increasing pilot fatigue and causing back pain during long missions.

Root pitch control and trailing edge flaps show closed loop multi-axis vibration reductions of 84% and 90%, respectively.

In the 15 years since the introduction of the concept, researchers have demonstrated its importance to key variables at the individual, group, and organizational level.  Except for a few conceptual pieces, however, this research has been limited by a conceptualization of organizational identity as relatively stable and, thus, has failed to contribute insights arising from a conception of organizational identity that is more dynamic in nature.  This dissertation represents a focused study of one aspect of those dynamics, how organizational identity change occurs during a corporate spin-off.\n\nI used an inductive approach to conduct an explanatory case study of one organization coping with the changes associated with breaking away from its long-time parent.  These changes, including alterations to the organization\u2019s structure, culture, and business processes, represent perceptual fault-lines along which issues of identity change arise.  Using semi-structured interviews, directed document analysis, and non-participant observation over a 10 month period before, during, and after the spin-off, I tracked these identity issues to capture their impact on the organization\u2019s attempts to maintain its viability in its competitive marketspace.  I then used the emergent data to develop a model of organizational identity change during a spin-off that provides insight into the processes underlying organizational identity change.\n\nKey findings from the emergent model include the critical role played by a state of identity ambiguity that emerged from image discrepancies and changes in the organization\u2019s social referents, this ambiguity\u2019s direct relationship to feelings of change overload experienced by organizational members, and a collective emotional state that arose in response to the identity ambiguity and that helped explain why top management was motivated to actively manage the identity ambiguity once it came to light.  These findings not only represent insights transferable to other organizational change contexts, but also the foundation for an in-depth understanding of how organizational identity change occurs and its implications for the organization and its members. Additionally, my discussion of the findings provides the wherewithal for more focused follow-up research aimed at the further explication of identity ambiguity as a quantitatively operationalized variable and the continued exploration of subtle organizational change processes involving the meanings central to organizational perceptions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3408], "author_name_tesi": "Corley, Kevin G.", "last_name_ssi": "Corley", "middle_name_ssi": "G.", "first_name_ssi": "Kevin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Jansen", "Dennis Stephen Gouran", "Linda K Trevino", "Dennis Arnold Gioia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Jansen, Committee Member", "Dennis Stephen Gouran, Committee Member", "Linda K Trevino, Committee Member", "Dennis Arnold Gioia, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Identity Ambiguity", "Organizational Identity", "Organizational Change"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DESIGN OF A CENTRIFUGE AND AERODYNAMIC TESTING APPARATUS FOR EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF A NOVEL TRAILING-EDGE FLAP ACTUATOR\n\n", "id": "9071", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1108", "abstract_tesi": "Primary helicopter flight control generally involves exposed, high-maintenance equipment such as bearings, linkages, hinges, and swashplates. Though these mechanisms are necessary for helicopter flight performance, they are also a significant source of aerodynamic drag. Even though the status quo for vertical lift rotorcraft was set in the 1930's with the invention of the cyclic pitch controlling swashplate, this design has served admirably well for over 70 years. Unfortunately, swashplate failures have been shown to be a contributing cause of fatal helicopter accidents, prompting investigation into modern replacements for a decades-old technology.\n\nTo date, many proposed swashplate replacement technologies have been studied, including blade camber control, blade twist control, tilting shaft concepts, active servo flaps, and active trailing edge flaps. Performance gains differ in every case, but active trailing-edge flaps have been proved effective in both noise and directional flight control. Additionally, trailing edge flap performance benchmarks have been set by The Boeing Company, using the double X-frame actuator.\n\nA new alternative to the double X-frame actuator, developed by Invercon LLC, promises an improved torque to weight ratio. As opposed to using levers and elastic hinges to amplify the motion of piezoelectric stacks, as with the X-frame system, this next-generation flap actuator utilizes an elastically buckled element to efficiently convert piezoelectric linear displacement into high torque flap rotation. \n\nTo make a fair comparison to the double X-frame actuator, the author has split the performance into two categories: robustness to centrifugal loads, and authority over aerodynamic loads. Boeing recently tested the double X-frame and trailing edge flap system in a MD-900 bearingless helicopter rotor. Using this test as a benchmark, Invercon's actuator must be robust enough to maintain performance at steady-state centrifugal accelerations of 655g. Additionally, the actuator must have authority over aerodynamic and frictional loads on the trailing edge flap, estimated to be as high as +/-25 in-lbs torque at +/-3.5 degrees flap deflection.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1097], "author_name_tesi": "Cormier, Christopher ", "last_name_ssi": "Cormier", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric M Mockensturm", "Eric M Mockensturm"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric M Mockensturm, Thesis Advisor", "Eric M Mockensturm, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["individual blade control", "centrifuge", "smart materials", "rotorcraft"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Real-time Bronchoscopic Guidance System Based on Movement Measurements", "id": "15306", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7441", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lung cancer is the deadliest form of cancer in America. To detect the presence of lung cancer, a physician typically performs a bronchoscopy. During a bronchoscopy, the physician attempts to maneuver a bronchoscope through the patient\u2019s airway tree to a suspicious legion identified on a multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scan. During the procedure, it is difficult to relate the MDCT chest scan to the live bronchoscopic video feed coming from the bronchoscope\u2019s tip. Furthermore, it is difficult for a physician to successfully reach the lesion with the bronchoscope, especially when the lesion is peripherally located.\n\nTo this end, research groups have developed bronchoscopy-guidance systems to assist physicians. However, these systems require an attending technician and fail to continuously track the bronchoscope accurately, robustly and in real time. In this thesis, we propose a real-time technician-free bronchoscopy-guidance system that employs continuous tracking and guidance. The system achieves bronchoscope tracking by measuring and interpreting bronchoscopic movements using an external sensor. For guidance, our system uses the bronchoscope\u2019s tracked pose to generate and display real-time virtual bronchoscopy images that are aligned to the live bronchoscopic video. The virtual bronchoscopy images contain guidance information indicating the correct route leading to a region of interest (ROI). Furthermore, we present a colored airway tree indicating the airway-branch diameter to help anticipate difficult bronchoscope maneuvers.\n\nWe validate the methods and system strategies on laboratory phantoms derived from human MDCT data as well as video from human bronchoscopy procedures.

These repairs are widely used in civil engineering applications such as structural rehabilitation, pavement repair, and concrete overlays. The structural performance of these applications is often governed by the behavior of the concrete-epoxy or concrete-repair interface as found elsewhere (ACI 440 2002, Granju et al. 2004). Therefore, characterizing and predicting the bond behavior of such interfaces is required. This study focuses on the experimental characterization and numerical modeling of concrete-epoxy interfaces typical of concrete members strengthened with FRP laminates. In particular, the fracture properties of two concrete-epoxy interfaces, CEI-1 and CEI-2, are determined. Such interfaces are formed during the installation of two commercially available FRP strengthening systems.\nDuring the experimental program, the cohesive crack method (Hillerborg et al. 1976) is used to determine the softening curve of the concrete-epoxy interfaces CEI-1 and CEI-2. Such curve is defined by three material properties, the tensile strength, ft, the size-effect fracture energy, Gf, and the cohesive fracture energy, GF. The sensitivity of these properties to the type of epoxy, specimen geometry, and condition of the concrete surface is also investigated experimentally. From this sensitivity study, test procedures and specimen geometries are recommended in order to properly determine the softening curve of a concrete-epoxy interface. Furthermore, it was found that the size-effect fracture energy is a suitable parameter to compare the behavior of different concrete-epoxy interfaces.\nThe analytical approach is focused on the introduction and application of the concept of damage band for predicting the debonding failure of concrete-epoxy interfaces. In such an innovative approach, all the processes taking place during the debonding failure of a concrete-epoxy interface are smeared in a band of fixed width (damage band). This makes the band concept attractive from a modeling point of view since softening relations can be used in order to characterize the debonding behavior. Analytical predictions, using the concept of damage band, are validated against experimental results obtained from different bond test. In particular, it is explored the capability of the analytical approach to predicting load-strain curves, strain distributions, failure sequences, and failure mechanisms experimentally observed during pull-off and beam-bond tests. The sensitivity of the numerical results is also studied. In particular, it is evaluated the effect of the geometry and discretization of the damage band on the numerical predictions. From this study, it was found that numerical predictions are not affected by changes of the thickness of the damage band within 0.5 and 2.0 the aggregate size.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [900], "author_name_tesi": "Coronado, Carlos Arturo", "last_name_ssi": "Coronado", "middle_name_ssi": "Arturo", "first_name_ssi": "Carlos", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez De Murphy", "Charles E Bakis", "David John Green", "Theodor Krauthammer", "Andrew Scanlon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez De Murphy, Committee Chair", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member", "David John Green, Committee Member", "Theodor Krauthammer, Committee Member", "Andrew Scanlon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["composites", "debonding", "concrete-epoxy interface", "finite element modeling", "damage mechanics", "bond", "fracture mechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Role of Leptin in the Etiology of\nExercise-Associated Menstrual Disturbances", "id": "10813", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4480", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Background: The exact etiology of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) is still unknown, yet is often associated with a relative energy deficit. Low concentrations of the adipocyte-secreted hormone leptin are thought to be the peripheral signal whereby an energy deficit disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Objectives: To further assess the role of leptin in the regulation of reproductive function, the first study was designed to identify the association between circulating leptin concentration and FHA, hypothesizing that suppression of the HPG axis results from either having low leptin per se or having a lower concentration of leptin than can be solely accounted for by adiposity. The second study assessed the role of leptin in the resumption of menses in exercising women with FHA. We hypothesized that an increase in leptin concentration would be associated with the resumption of menses in women with FHA. Lastly, the third study was designed to test the hypothesis that significant predictors of leptin concentration, after adjusting for adiposity, are different in women with and without FHA. A second aim was to explore whether changes in modulators of leptin production are found in association with changes in leptin concentration observed in women with FHA who resume menses. Design: Menstrual status, body composition, and fasting serum leptin concentration  were assessed in fifty-two exercising, premenopausal women over the course of one baseline menstrual cycle for ovulatory women (OV; n=26) or for one 28-day monitoring period for amenorrheic women (Amen; n=24) (Study 1 and 3). Fourteen volunteers who were categorized as Amen at baseline completed a 6-month monitoring period, during which repeated measures of body composition, leptin concentration, and other metabolic and dietary parameters were assessed. These women were retrospectively categorized into 2 groups: 1) those who resumed menses between months one and six of the study (Amen-R; n=5), and 2) those who remained amenorrheic during the 6-month monitoring period (Amen-NR; n=7). Two women resumed menses within the first month and were thus excluded because the concentration of leptin with the resumption of menses could not be determined (Study 2 and 3). Results: Percentage body fat (21\u00b11% vs. 27\u00b10.7%; P<0.001) and leptin concentration (4.8\u00b10.8ng/ml vs. 9.6\u00b10.9ng/ml; P<0.001) were significantly lower in Amen vs. OV. However, the ranges observed in serum leptin concentration for Amen and for OV were similar (range for Amen: 2.61-7.24ng/ml; range for OV: 2.60-7.25ng/ml), and after adjusting for adiposity the difference in leptin concentration was no longer significant. Percentage body fat (17\u00b12% vs. 24\u00b12%; P =0.033), but not serum leptin concentration (2.3\u00b10.7ng/ml vs. 6.5\u00b12.8ng/ml; P=0.207), was significantly lower in Amen-NR vs. Amen-R at baseline. The increase in fasting serum leptin concentration, but not percentage body fat, from pre- to post-study was significantly greater in Amen-R vs. Amen-NR (Interaction Effect: P=0.002). A significant increase in resting respiratory exchange ratio was also observed in Amen-R vs. Amen-NR from pre- to post-study (Interaction Effect: P=0.006). The model that best predicted baseline serum leptin concentration in the OV women included percentage body fat only (r2=0.522), and in the Amen women included percentage body fat, serum insulin concentration, and serum glycerol concentration (r2=0.775). Conclusions: These date suggest that the reproductive system senses and responds to relative changes in leptin concentration rather than to a critical concentration of leptin. Changes in leptin concentration may not always reflect changes in adiposity and in such cases may be due to the influence of other modulators of leptin synthesis.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4450], "author_name_tesi": "Corr, Maggie  ", "last_name_ssi": "Corr", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Maggie ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy Williams", "Nancy Williams"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy Williams, Thesis Advisor", "Nancy Williams, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["leptin", "amenorrhea", "menstrual status", "resumption of menses", "body fat", "sympathetic nervous activity"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Aspirations, Expectations, and Influences on the Post-secondary Plans of Rural Youth", "id": "27259", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11978", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines the influences that high school seniors considered when making their plans for after graduation.

This is accomplished through the association of DNA with proteins to form chromatin fibers.  At the primary level, DNA is wrapped around an octamer of core histone proteins, forming the nucleosome.  Additional levels of compaction (higher-order structures) result from interactions between core histone tails, linker histone proteins, cations, and architectural proteins. The goal of this thesis was to develop an experimental approach to determine the individual contributions of various chromatin components in the overall formation and regulation of higher order structures.  This approach utilized a high affinity nucleosome binding DNA sequence to construct reconstituted chromatin arrays that position nucleosomes with single nucleotide precision.  Using these reconstituted chromatin arrays, chromatin higher order structures were tested for interactions both within (folding) and between (self-association) arrays, through biochemical assays such as sedimentation velocity experiments using analytical ultracentrifugation and reversible self-association assays. \n\tBy using the reconstituted array system to alter translational and rotational nucleosome settings, we observed a negative correlation between linker DNA length and chromatin folding.  This relationship was not strictly linear, indicating that for short linker DNA lengths (&#8804;177 bp) typical of lower eukaryotes, rotational settings were important for compact chromatin structure.  However, alterations to the rotational setting of chromatin arrays with linker DNA ~200 bp (typical of higher eukaryotes) did not reveal any alterations to chromatin higher order structure, leading to the possibility that long linker DNA can absorb variations in rotational settings. \n\tAdditional studies evaluated chromatin higher order structure in the presence of high mobility group (HMG) architectural proteins.  For HMGA1, which has been implicated in chromatin condensation in vivo, we found that it was not sufficient to alter chromatin structure in vitro.  In contrast, for HMGN5, which has been shown to unfold constitutive heterochromatin in vivo, we observed that it was sufficient to unfold chromatin fibers in vitro and that both its nucleosome binding domain and acidic C-terminal domain were necessary for impairing linker histone dependent chromatin folding.  \n\tWe also examined chromatin folding in a set of experiments where core histone tails were subjected to enzymatic conversion of arginine to citrulline by the PAD4 enzyme.  These experiments revealed that citrullination of several residues of core histones was sufficient to impair linker histone dependent chromatin folding.  In addition, we discovered that linker histone H5 was citrullinated by PAD4 but this citrullination was not required for chromatin unfolding.\nWe argue that understanding the role of individual components of chromatin to the overall structure is important in dissecting the complex interactions relating chromatin structure to genetic and epigenetic regulation.  Specific factors and interactions revealed in our studies may be targeted by DNA- and protein-modifying factors to alter chromatin structure and restore defects in gene expression associated with impaired cell differentiation and cancer. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5606], "author_name_tesi": "Correll, Sarah Jane", "last_name_ssi": "Correll", "middle_name_ssi": "Jane", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sergei A Grigoryev", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Sarah Bronson", "Laura Carrel", "Sergei A Grigoryev", "Jiyue Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sergei A Grigoryev, Dissertation Advisor", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member", "Sergei A Grigoryev, Committee Chair", "Jiyue Zhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["linker histone", "nucleosome", "chromatin structure", "analytical ultracentrifugation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF HYDROGEN ADDITION AND INTAKE-INDUCED SWIRL ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF NATURAL GAS COMBUSTION IN A SINGLE-CYLINDER SPARK-IGNITED ENGINE\n", "id": "10444", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4224", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Compressed natural gas (CNG) is an alternative fuel of interest for internal combustion engines (ICEs) in the mass transit and vocational applications.  Increasingly, due to the abundant supply of shale gas, there is interest in heavy duty and in passenger vehicle applications of natural gas.  CNG combustion yields significant reductions in particulate emissions compared to diesel. However, the inherently low flame speed of CNG decreases thermal efficiency and increases toxic aldehyde emissions in ICEs, requiring optimization of spark timing.  Due to its increased flame speed compared to methane and liquid fuels, hydrogen has been shown to \u201cassist\u201d natural gas combustion in that it decreases combustion duration, reduces minimum spark advance for best torque (MBT timing), enhances combustion efficiency and can reduce emissions of unburned fuel.  \nThe literature contains many studies that demonstrate hydrogen\u2019s ability to burn faster than other fuels and that acknowledge hydrogen\u2019s uniqueness compared to other fuels in terms of its mass diffusivity, wide flammability range, and minimum ignition energy, but these studies rarely attempt to explain such characteristics in a scientific manner.  Most review articles focus on a particular aspect of technical implementation of hydrogen as a combustible fuel in lieu of a holistic view of hydrogen assisted combustion of hydrocarbon fuels in ICEs.  The intention of the present work was to build on the understanding of the role of hydrogen in the spark-ignited combustion of natural gas, by confirming common findings in the literature, namely that the addition of hydrogen to natural gas enables spark retard due to enhanced early flame development, and that retarded spark at MBT for HCNG results in concentrated heat release near TDC, improving the efficiency compared to CNG alone.  The primary objective of the present work is to perform detailed heat release analysis to evaluate the following hypothesis: while swirl can be employed to improve the sluggish early flame development of CNG, using hydrogen to supplant swirl enables improved early flame development without compromising engine efficiency due to convective heat losses caused by enhanced fluid motion.\nThe present work employs a single-cylinder spark-ignited engine to study the effects of intake-induced turbulence and turbulence intensity on hydrogen assisted natural gas (HCNG) combustion.  The effects with hydrogen assisted combustion are examined through comparison with combustion of CNG alone.  Experiments were conducted at 2000 rpm with both fixed spark timing and adjusting spark to maintain MBT, as well as at 2750 rpm with MBT timing alone.  Each study was conducted at 1.5 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP), stoichiometric equivalence ratio and MBT timing for each fuel; fueling rate was fixed as the throttle was opened to achieve leaner conditions (engine load is not fixed).

Drawing, first, on the political economy of culture perspective, the researcher examines SB Nation\u2019s resource allocation\u2014a process that sets broad limits on the range and nature of media production and textual forms. The researcher \u201clistened in\u201d to discussion by and about SB Nation in trade journals and the business press, and \u201cburrowed\u201d into available documentation about the company, including best practices documents. The second line of analysis is an adaptation of newsroom ethnography. Rather than directly observe bloggers at work, a battery of short, daily interviews were conducted with nine bloggers exploring their daily blogwork routines\u2014practices that shape sports blogs\u2019 standard fare. The study argues that SB Nation\u2019s commercial success is predicated on the allocation of resources to developing a platform for bloggers and their communities to engage in chatter about the men\u2019s commercial sphere of sports. In this, SB Nation manufactures a large, \u201cdemogenic\u201d prosumer commodity that it sells to corporate advertisers. The bloggers, most of them minimally compensated, create content on a near daily basis as a means of pursuing and performing their fandom. Some also work under the hope that their blogging could lead to future employment opportunities. In their efforts to produce content as fans, for fans, SB Nation bloggers face pressures and constraints. Since most have to work day jobs to support themselves, blogging competes for time with personal and professional obligations. Bloggers employ work routines that help them negotiate the temporal discontinuities between their production processes (assembly-time), that of the sports world (event-time), and that of their readers (audience-time). Specifically, participants noted strategies for dividing labor, scheduling their blogging, and using news aggregators to monitor the sports world.

The exploration from a transatlantic perspective of such a diverse set of writers and nationalities shows the various similarities that these Hispanic literary authors and works share despite their differences in regard to their national, history, politics or ideals.  At the same time, it confirms the existence of a new profile of postnational authors whose narrative work incorporates original features from globalized pop culture and other artistic media such as film or live performances. \nFollowing recent tendencies in Hispanic literature including metafictional texts written by famous artists and celebrities, my dissertation aims to deploy innovative critical approaches informed by postmodernism, border studies, and gender studies.  While the narrative works examined deal with the fictional representation of some of the most important structural aspects of the transatlantic literary field\u2014including prizes, book fairs, and literary conferences\u2014they also portray the personal attachment of writers to new and powerful contributors to the literary field such as judges, critics, literary agents, and fans.

In other words, once these authors attempt to acquire their literary authority, violence to the Other turns out to be unavoidable; therefore, they are placed in an ethical dilemma.  Paradoxically, in a profoundly ethical act, these writers resolve their dilemma by relinquishing their newly acquired authority, and repudiating the pattern of a tradition that legitimized the use of violence as an instrument of power.

Additionally, the Navy Yard is a non-regulated entity in terms of electricity pricing, while being managed by a non-profit organization.  These features make it a good place for experimentation with the demand for electricity.\nCurrently, there are two electricity-related problems observed at the Navy Yard.  The first is an inefficient pricing structure, since customers pay a fixed monthly rate, based on an average of the marginal cost of producing electricity.  The second problem is insufficient capacity to supply electricity to the demand.  In particular, one of the two substations that deliver electricity to tenants is currently congested several hours of the year.  The congested substation is referred to as SS93 and it has a capacity limit of 15MW, while the other substation is SS664 with a capacity of 19MW.  In addition, new developments are planned to be built and incorporated to the Navy Yard\u2019s electric grid, increasing the risk of system congestion if no investments are made in capacity expansion, since projected peak demand is estimated to triple current levels.  \nBased on the characteristics of the problem presented above, the main goal of this research project is to simulate the application of a real-time pricing program (RTP) for electricity in the Navy Yard, subject to a capacity constraint, based on the PJM Interconnection\u2019s wholesale market locational marginal prices (LMP).  This real-time pricing program will have an added component, which is revenue collection at times when congestion occurs to further invest it in new capacity.  If the revenue collected is enough to build sufficient substation capacity to cope with the increasing demand, this might avoid future congestion problems of the electric system and eliminate reliability issues associated with the electricity supply within the Navy Yard\u2019s electric grid.\nThe simulation of the two-stage real-time pricing program determined that the revenue collected would be plenty to expand the substations\u2019 capacity.  Specifically, in the case of SS664 the simulation of the two-stage RTP program showed that over $12 million in revenues could be collected in 15 years, which would allow to build over 43MW of additional capacity.  This would leave SS664 with an excess capacity for additional demand increments, let it be from existing or new tenants.  Similarly, the simulation of the two-stage RTP program on SS93 data showed that over $3.1 million could be collected in revenues, which could be invested in  over 11.3MW of new capacity, also leaving some room for additional demand growth.  This way the system would be able to cope with the increasing demand, even if the customers do not respond substantially to changes in prices, while leaving room for further demand growth in all cases.  \nFinally, the environmental impact of the program is estimated, as well as the profitability for a customer to invest in a natural gas generator to be used at times of high electricity prices.  Results show that the two-stage RTP program would have a negative impact on the environment, since CO2, SO2 and NOx emissions are increased as a consequence from the program application.  Also, it would not be profitable to invest in an on-site generator, if the average of the natural gas price is below $5.22 per thousand cubic feet.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8115], "author_name_tesi": "Cortes, Mercedes H", "last_name_ssi": "Cortes", "middle_name_ssi": "H", "first_name_ssi": "Mercedes", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Nathan Kleit", "Seth Adam Blumsack", "Anastasia Shcherbakova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Nathan Kleit, Thesis Advisor", "Seth Adam Blumsack, Thesis Advisor", "Anastasia Shcherbakova, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["demand response", "real-time pricing", "electricity", "philadelphia navy yard"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Erosion of Carbon-cloth Phenolic Nozzles in Rocket Motors with Aluminized Solid Propellant", "id": "16187", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8117", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In order to better predict the erosion rates of carbon-cloth phenolic (CCP) nozzle\nmaterial along the surface of solid rocket motor (SRM) nozzles, it is necessary to improve\nthe understanding of the thermochemical and mechanical erosion processes of CCP nozzle\nmaterial under realistic motor operating conditions. To this end a subscale SRM with an\naluminized composite solid propellant has been used to examine nozzles constructed of CCP\nmaterial. A main feature of the subscale SRM is an X-ray translucent test section. This\nallowed a real-time X-ray radiography (X-ray RTR) system to capture a sequence of images\nof the nozzle during the operation of the SRM. Overall, four CCP nozzle test sample\nconfigurations were investigated: 45\u00b0 ply-angle MX-4926N, 45\u00b0 ply-angle LR1406, 70\u00b0 plyangle\nMX-4926N, and 70\u00b0 ply-angle MX-4926. Upon enhancement and analysis of image\nsequences captured with the X-ray RTR system, the recession behavior of the entire nozzle\nsurface, near throat erosion rate, and char/virgin interface location of these nozzles samples\nwas examined. From the time variation of instantaneous nozzle surface location, it was\nobserved that the converging portion of the CCP nozzle regressed at much higher erosion\nrates than the throat region. In addition, examination of the deduced throat height\nvariation with time showed a period of contraction of the nozzle throat. This period was\nfollowed by a nearly constant recession of the nozzle throat. However, in many cases the\nerosion rate did vary over the course of the test firing and, in a few, dramatically.

These ubiquitous, endogenous small RNAs are currently categorized into two groups: microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). They are produced by Dicer-Like (DCL) proteins and utilized by Argonaute (AGO) proteins to guide repressive regulation of target mRNAs and/or chromatin selected on the basis of small RNA-target complementarity at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. 21 nt miRNAs and 24 nt heterochromatic siRNAs are the two major types of small RNAs found in angiosperms (flowering plants). \n\nThe small RNA populations in angiosperms are dominated by 24 nt heterochromatic siRNAs which derive from intergenic, repetitive regions and mediate DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications to targeted loci in angiosperms. However, the existence and extent of heterochromatic siRNAs in other land plant lineages has been less clear. The failure to identify 24 nt heterochromatic siRNA accumulation by initial small RNA-seq attempts from several other species including gymnosperms (Dolgosheina et al. 2008), and the lycophyte Selaginella (Banks et al. 2011) has raised the question whether the heterochromatic siRNA pathway is angiosperm-specific. Previous work in Physcomitrella provides evidence that supports the hypothesis that the heterochromatic siRNA pathway is an ancestral trait that was present in the last common ancestor of bryophytes and all other subsequently diverged lineages of plants (Cho et al. 2008). However, comprehensive annotation of small RNA genes in the basal lineage Physcomitrella is still lacking and an investigation of small RNA populations in this model organism would shed more light on the evolution of regulatory small RNA pathways in land plants.\n\nWith the advent of next-generation sequencing, small RNA-seq has become a good resource for producing enormous volumes of data on plant miRNA and siRNA expression. Therefore, we produced extensive small RNA-seq data (more than 108 mapped reads) to annotate small RNA genes in ten-day-old protonemata from wild-type Physcomitrella. ShortStack is a recently developed tool to analyze small RNA-seq data with respect to a reference genome and to provide a comprehensive annotation of de novo discovered small RNA genes. Utilizing ShortStack, we identified 16,024 distinct DCL-dependent small RNA producing loci and classified them into five different groupings based on the RNA secondary structure evaluation and the predominant small RNA size. These Physcomitrella small RNA producing loci is now available in our developing web server (plantsmallrnagenes.psu.edu).\n\nIn order to investigate the features of heterochromatic siRNAs, we revisited the Physcomitrella genome to find functional orthologs of the heterochromatic siRNA genes. We identified candidate proteins that could potentially be involved in the accumulation of heterochromatic siRNAs and created mutants to perform genetic analysis. With the power of consistent biological replicates, differential expression analysis on small RNA-seq data revealed that the accumulation of siRNAs from 23-24 nt siRNA loci depends upon Physcomitrella homologs of DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3), RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2), and the largest sub-unit of DNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE IV (Pol IV), with the largest sub-unit of a Pol V homolog contributing to expression at a smaller subset of the loci. These data lead us to conclude that Physcomitrella utilizes a heterochromatic siRNA pathway fundamentally similar to that of flowering plants. In contrast to angiosperms, we identified a Physcomitrella-specific MINIMAL DICER-LIKE (mDCL) gene, which lacks the N-terminal helicase domain typical of DCL proteins, but contains the \u2018catalytic core\u2019 (the PAZ domain and the twin RNAseIII domains) of the DCL proteins. We showed that Physcomitrella heterochromatic siRNAs are not solely composed of 24 nt siRNAs as seen in angiosperms, but rather contain equal mixtures of 23 and 24 nt siRNAs. Interestingly, Physcomitrella-specific mDCL is found to be specifically required for 23 nt siRNA accumulation from these loci. Overall, our data lead us to conclude that heterochromatic siRNAs, and their biogenesis pathways, are largely but not completely identical between angiosperms and basal land plants, as represented by the bryophyte, Physcomitrella patens.\n\nSignificant effort has been made in small RNA gene annotation, but this progress has been unevenly distributed, with MIRNA loci in particular receiving a disproportionate share of the attention. We believe that further efforts at comprehensive and consistent reference annotations of all types of small RNA producing genes, and improvements in the dissemination of such annotations, will greatly enhance the future of plant genomics. Our developing web server (plantsmallrnagenes.psu.edu), which currently hosts small RNA gene annotations of just two species, Amborella trichopoda and Physcomitrella patens, is intended to serve this purpose. In particular, we look forward to the day when researchers seeking to study small RNAs will be liberated from the need to \"re-invent the wheel\" by generating their own de novo annotations of small RNA-producing genes with each analysis.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9965], "author_name_tesi": "Coruh, Ceyda ", "last_name_ssi": "Coruh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ceyda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Axtell", "Michael Axtell", "Claude Walker Depamphilis", "Sarah Mary Assmann", "Anton Nekrutenko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Axtell, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Axtell, Committee Chair", "Claude Walker Depamphilis, Committee Member", "Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Member", "Anton Nekrutenko, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heterochromatic siRNA", "microRNA", "small RNA", "small RNA-seq", "dicer", "Physcomitrella patens"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ESSAYS ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE,\nLABOR MARKETS AND HUMAN CAPITAL\n", "id": "10918", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3306", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of three chapters.\nChapter 2 analyzes the reallocation of labor following a trade liberalization. These\nepisodes typically display three features: slow net absorption of labor by export-oriented\nsectors, large reallocation costs for displaced workers, and a disproportionate adjustment\nburden for older workers. To explain these facts and to study alternative policy responses, I\ndevelop a two-sector small open economy model with overlapping generations, labor market\nsearch and matching, and sector-specific human capital accumulated through learning-by-doing.\nThe model is calibrated to Brazilian data in order to study the dynamics of an\neconomy in transition after trade liberalization. The calibrated model shows that human\ncapital plays a much bigger role than search frictions in generating the observed slow adjustment\nto reforms. I then use the model to compare the distributional and efficiency effects of alternative worker-assistance programs in general equilibrium. A targeted employment\nsubsidy that rewards mobility not only improves the distribution of income but also enhances\nefficiency gains from trade by facilitating faster formation of necessary skills during\nthe adjustment period. The market failure corrected by the policy is the disincentives of\nexperienced workers to invest in new skills which is in turn caused by the interaction of\nrent-sharing and intra-sectoral transferability of human capital to future employers. The\npaper contributes to a better understanding of trade-induced transitional dynamics and the\nlabor market policies aimed at compensating the losers from trade.\nChapter 3, a joint work with Nezih Guner and James Tybout, develops a dynamic\ngeneral equilibrium trade model to explore the interaction between openness, \frm dynamics\nand labor markets. The motivation comes from the observation that in many liberalizing countries, job turnover rates have risen, informal sectors have become larger, and wage\ndistributions have become less equal. The model combines standard search frictions in\nlabor markets with heterogeneous \ffirms that experience ongoing productivity shocks. Each\nperiod, firms decide whether to exit or continue producing. Those firms that remain active\nchoose their export volumes and adjust their employment levels through vacancy postings\nor lay-o\u000bs. Openness affects labor markets in our model because it increases rents for\nefficient \ffirms and reduces rents for inefficient \ffirms, as in Melitz (2003). These well-known\neffects interact with idiosyncratic productivity shocks and with scale economies in hiring\ncosts to induce adjustments in the equilibrium job turnover rate, unemployment rate and\nwage distribution as trade barriers are dismantled. After fitting this model to Colombian\nmicro data on establishments and households, we isolate the effects of trade frictions on\nlabor market outcomes using counter-factual simulations. The results suggest that the\nmechanisms highlighted by our model can be important.\nChapter 4 presents a model of development in which skilled labor is an input in technology\nadoption. The model combines Nelson and Phelps (1966) type technology dynamics\nwith a growth model in which intermediate goods are used to produce a final good. The\nintermediate good producers hire skilled labor to increase their productivity by adopting\ntechniques from an exogenously evolving stock of world knowledge. I solve for the stationary\nequilibrium and derive analytic expressions for steady state income level and wage\npremium. In a quantitative exercise, I calibrate the model and compare its predictions with\ndata. The model successfully accounts for cross-country income differences and within country\nwage premia on skilled labor. These results strengthen the idea that different types\nof human capital perform separate tasks and should not be aggregated into a single stock\nof human capital in development accounting exercises. The availability of skilled labor is\npotentially much more important for development than such aggregative exercises have so\nfar suggested.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3293], "author_name_tesi": "Cosar, Ahmet Kerem ", "last_name_ssi": "Cosar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ahmet Kerem", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andres Rodriguez Clare & James R Tybout", "Andres Rodriguez Clare", "James R.

We designed an experiment to investigate this hypothesis, and data collected were analyzed and interpreted in light of the hypothesis and several related research questions.\n   The expansion of the NMR curriculum at Penn State was funded through the NSF\u2019s Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) program, and assessment was required. The goal of this project, as stated in the grant proposal, was to provide NMR content in greater depth by integrating NMR modules throughout the curriculum in physical chemistry, instrumental, and organic chemistry laboratory courses. Hands-on contact with the NMR spectrometer and NMR data and repeated exposure of the analytical technique within different contexts (courses) were unique factors of this curriculum. Therefore, we maintained a focus on these aspects throughout the evaluation process. \n   The most challenging and time-consuming aspect of any assessment is the development of testing instruments and methods to provide useful data. After key variables were defined, testing instruments were designed to measure these variables based on educational literature (Chapter 2). The primary variables measured in this assessment were: depth of understanding of NMR, basic NMR knowledge, problem solving skills (HETCOR problem), confidence for skills used in class (within the hands-on NMR modules), confidence for NMR tasks (not practiced), and confidence for general science tasks. Detailed discussion of the instruments, testing methods and experimental design used in this assessment are provided (Chapter 3).\n   All data were analyzed quantitatively using methods adapted from the educational literature (Chapter 4). Data were analyzed and the descriptive statistics, independent t-tests between the experimental and control groups, and correlation statistics were calculated for each variable. In addition, for those variables included on the pretest, dependent t-tests between pretest and posttest scores were also calculated. \nThe results of study 1 and study 2 were used to draw conclusions based on the hypothesis and research questions proposed in this work (Chapter 4). \n\nData collected in this assessment were used to answer the following research questions: \n\n1. Primary research question: Is depth of understanding of NMR linked to problem solving skills? \n\n2. Are the NMR modules working as intended? Do they promote depth of understanding of NMR?\n  a. Will students who complete NMR modules have a greater depth of understanding of NMR than students who do not complete the modules? \n  b. Is depth of understanding increasing over the course of the experiment? \n\n3. Is confidence an intermediary between depth of understanding and problem solving skills? Is it linked to both variables? \n\n4. What levels of confidence are affected by the NMR modules?\n  a. Will confidence for the NMR class skills used in the modules themselves be greater for those who have completed the modules? \n  b. Will confidence for NMR tasks not practiced in the course be affected?\n  c. Will confidence for general science tasks be affected? \n  d. Are different levels of confidence (class skills, NMR tasks, general science tasks) linked to each other? \n\n   Results from this NMR curriculum assessment could also have implications outside of the courses studied, and so there is potential to impact the chemical education community (section 5.2.1). In addition to providing reliable testing instruments/measures that could be used outside the university, the results of this research contribute to the study of problem solving in chemistry, learner characteristics within the context of chemical education studies, and NMR specific educational evaluations. Valuable information was gathered through the current method of evaluation for the NMR curriculum. However, improvements could be made to the existing assessment, and an alternate assessment that could supplement the information found in this study has been proposed (Chapter 5).\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3510], "author_name_tesi": "Cossey, Kimberly ", "last_name_ssi": "Cossey", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Mark Maroncelli", "Rayne Audrey Sperling"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member", "Rayne Audrey Sperling, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NMR", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance", "chemical education", "assessment", "curriculum"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Design, Fabrication, Test, and Evaluation of Small-scale Tiltrotor Whirl Flutter Wind Tunnel Models", "id": "26236", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11799", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The modern tiltrotor is an aircraft capable of efficient hover as well as high-speed forward flight. The large, flexible rotors needed for good hover performance are susceptible to an aeroelastic phenomenon known as whirl flutter in high-speed flight: high rotor inflow and the flexible nature of the rotors will result in negative aerodynamic damping when the tiltrotor is in airplane mode, causing the coupled wing/rotor/pylon system to become unstable. Traditionally, the tiltrotor whirl flutter margin has been increased through the use of thick wings of low aspect ratio, which maximize the stiffness of the wings at the expense of increased structural weight and reduced aerodynamic efficiency. To increase the top speed of tiltrotors, new methods of analyzing and mitigating the whirl flutter phenomenon must be developed.\n\nThis study focuses on the design and development of a semispan wind tunnel model that permits the testing of whirl flutter stability in a controlled, low-risk environment. The wind tunnel model was dynamically tested in the Penn State Hammond Low-Speed Wind Tunnel. Five configurations were tested for modal damping variations with respect to tunnel speed. Two of these configurations (\"Gen-2\") were modified versions of the first-generation (\"Gen-1\") wind tunnel model designed and tested by S.C. Johnson in the 2012-2013 timeframe. Three configurations of an all-new model (\"Gen-3\") were developed to increase the realism of the test specimen, and included features such as tuned wing modal frequencies, higher-Lock number rotor blades, and blade twist. Most importantly, the Gen-3 models were designed to flutter without the use of an added mass or unconventional center of gravity placement. \n\nGen-3 was developed through the use of an in-house computer code, which generated damping predictions for the wing modes at various tunnel speeds. Model components and support equipment were fabricated in-house by the author, with some components (e.g. those requiring computer-controlled machining) outsourced to local manufacturers. Wind tunnel tests were performed in the Hammond tunnel from October 2014 through January 2015; these tests showed that the experimentally-measured flutter speeds of the Gen-3 models were within 5-7% of the predicted values, with the Gen-3a (untwisted composite blades) fluttering at approximately 101 ft./sec., and the Gen-3b model (twisted composite blades) fluttering at approximately 97 ft./sec.\n\nThe present work has further validated the feasibility of whirl flutter testing at a small scale. The Gen-3 model was able to exhibit whirl flutter without the use of an additional mass, and will permit the testing of devices designed to enhance the whirl flutter margin within the current facility. The techniques used to fabricate the Gen-3 model show potential for introducing features such as blade flexibility and an modular wing root flexure for a wider test regime.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11259], "author_name_tesi": "Costa, Guillermo Jorge", "last_name_ssi": "Costa", "middle_name_ssi": "Jorge", "first_name_ssi": "Guillermo", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Smith, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["tiltrotor", "rotorcraft", "aeroelasticity", "wind tunnel testing", "whirl flutter"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Study on Granular Media:  Packing, Intruding, and Shocking", "id": "9780", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1414", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We studied four different aspects of granular media.

Induction of alternative sigma factors represents an important bacterial strategy to cope with a variety of stresses that compromise cellular homeostasis. Sigma factors are transcription initiation factors and are the subunit of RNA polymerase (RNAP) responsible for binding to promoters allowing RNAP to specifically initiate transcription. In Escherichia coli (E. coli), the alternative sigma factor sigma E is induced upon accumulation of misfolded outer membrane proteins (OMPs), and is responsible for the activation of a stress pathway known as the extracytoplasmic stress response. In the absence of cell envelope stress, sigma E is mostly bound to its main negative regulator, the inner membrane protein RseA. When cell envelope stress is sensed, sigma E is released from RseA and can associate with RNAP. In addition, sigma E is essential for E. coli viability, although its indispensable function is not yet understood. The se regulon includes not only genes that are involved in the stress response, encoding for folding factors and proteases to re-establish a correct folding status of the proteins and to degrade proteins that are irreversibly misfolded, but also a diverse group of genes encoding proteins associated with the cell envelope or required to synthesize components of the cell envelope. These observations suggest that sigma E may be involved in maintaining many aspects of cell envelope integrity, beyond monitoring outer membrane protein folding.\n\n\nIn the present study, I reveal a novel function of sigma E in the cell during nutritional stress.  I showed that sigma E activity increases upon entry into stationary phase and that the effector molecule guanosine 3'-5'-bispyrophosphate, ppGpp, which binds directly to RNAP, is responsible for such regulation. This signaling pathway is distinct from the one activated by the extracytoplasmic stress response controlled via RseA. I also showed that sigma E can respond to alterations in the levels of ppGpp caused by a variety of methods, starvation for carbon or phosphate, and gratuitious induction of ppGpp, indicating sigma E is likely to have a role in the response to nutritional stress.  Once I established the central role of ppGpp in the regulation of sigma E activity, I extended my analysis to determine how ppGpp is modulating such response. ppGpp does not act as a positive regulator of the sigma E synthesis indicating that ppGpp affects the activity of sigma E.\n \n\nppGpp is best characterized for its role in response to starvation for amino acids.  When cells are starved for amino acids, transcription of ribosomal RNA genes decreases and amino acid biosynthetic genes increases. This response reduces ribosome synthesis and boosts amino acid synthesis, allowing cells to adapt and survive when starved for amino acids. ppGpp is required for this response. Mutations that allow cells to bypass the need for ppGpp under starvation conditions have been isolated by other labs in selections based on the observation that a strain lacking ppGpp is unable to grow on a medium lacking amino acids. These suppressor mutations are localized in the rpoB, rpoC and rpoD genes encoding the beta, beta', and sigma 70 subunits of RNAP respectively, suggesting that ppGpp may act directly or indirectly by altering the activity of RNAP, and thus redirecting gene expression. Additional in vitro experiments showed that ppGpp can directly interact with sigma 70-RNAP and, with the help of an accessory protein DksA, directly decrease transcription of rRNA genes and increase transcription of amino acid biosynthetic genes. \n\n\nTo determine how ppGpp might regulate the activity of sigma E, I tested whether these mutations could also suppress the defects in the regulation of sigma E in strains lacking ppGpp. The rpoD mutants used in this study are localized in conserved regions of the sigma 70 subunit, which are known to interact with RNAP, and which confer a lower binding affinity to the sigma 70 subunit for core RNAP. The rpoC mutation does not appear to effect sigma/core interactions but has been shown to decrease the stability of open complex. I demonstrated that even though these mutants were isolated based on their effects on genes transcribed by sigma 70, they restore the growth phase-dependent regulation of sigma E activity. In the case of the sigma 70 variant, sigma E activity is not only restored but is nearly constitutive, indicating that decreasing the affinity of sigma 70 for core RNAP allows sigma E to better compete for core RNAP compensating for the absence of ppGpp. In the case of the beta' variant, there are two possible explanations. The mutations may increase the availability of RNAP in the cell by releasing RNAP from the ribosomal RNA genes through the substantial destabilization of open complexes, or these mutations may directly alter transcription initiation by polymerase containing sigma E.  These variants restore sigma E activity by either mimicking the action of ppGpp or bypassing the need for ppGpp. \n\n\nppGpp is known to activate other alternative sigma factors either during entry into stationary phase or during starvation for specific nutrients. The results obtained from my analysis on how ppGpp regulates sigma E not only shed new insights on the role and regulation of sigma E in the cell, but also lead to the idea that ppGpp is a global regulator of alternative sigma factor activity. ppGpp provides a means to coordinately activate multiple stress responses without having to rely on specific signals to independently activate each stress response mediated by a different alternative sigma factor.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [480], "author_name_tesi": "Costanzo, Alessandra ", "last_name_ssi": "Costanzo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alessandra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Ellen Ades", "Stephen John Knabel", "Katsuhiko Murakami", "B Tracy Nixon", "Allen T Phillips"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Ellen Ades, Committee Chair", "Stephen John Knabel, Committee Member", "Katsuhiko Murakami, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Allen T Phillips, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sigma factor competition", "Extracytoplasmic stress response", "ppGpp"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Lessons of Rome: Architects at the American Academy, 1947-1966\n\n", "id": "9813", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1544", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In 1947, the American Academy in Rome faced a fundamental decision: to either recommit to the Beaux-Arts artistic mission behind its establishment in 1894, or adapt to a drastically changed postwar environment. Although characterized as \u201ca holdout against Modernism,\u201d this does not accurately describe its relationship with American architecture between 1947-1966. During these years, the Academy actively welcomed emerging and established modern architects through fellowships, residencies, and administrative roles. Its altered policies were designed to align it with the discipline\u2019s mid-century embrace of modernism and redefine the Rome Prize in architecture to serve a new set of professional values.\n\nThe Academy\u2019s attempts to transform its institutional culture and maintain relevance to one of its core constituencies would ultimately succeed, despite entrenched internal opposition and lingering doubts.  Forty well-credentialed young graduates from the nation\u2019s top architecture schools would come to Rome during these years to enjoy fellowships of unprecedented flexibility. Some, most notably Robert Venturi and Michael Graves, would later rise to considerable prominence, burnishing the Rome Prize\u2019s reputation among architects in the late twentieth century. But all the Fellows provided collective, crucial momentum to the modernist Grand Tour. They helped keep Rome on the architect\u2019s map, and contributed to ongoing redefinitions of Rome\u2019s relevance to contemporary practice.\n\nA new American architectural establishment also tied itself to the Academy. The inaugural postwar residency of George Howe announced its dramatic shift in allegiance from classicist to modernist design ideology, and Louis Kahn\u2019s career-changing Academy stay would attain mythic status. But a dozen others whose names are seldom associated with Rome\u2014including Max Abramovitz, Edward Larabee Barnes, Pietro Belluschi, Wallace K. Harrison, Eero Saarinen, and Edward Durell Stone\u2014would lend the Academy their time and names in varying capacities, buttressing its claim to professional legitimacy. As architects of the official U.S. presence abroad during the Cold War, their support for an institution struggling to reconcile the rhetoric of cultural power with modernity is utterly appropriate. Ultimately, the Academy\u2019s architectural survival during the postwar period contributed a distant but engaged perspective on the American discipline, and helped architects continue to learn new lessons from Rome.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1528], "author_name_tesi": "Costanzo, Denise Rae", "last_name_ssi": "Costanzo", "middle_name_ssi": "Rae", "first_name_ssi": "Denise", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Robert Zabel", "Craig Robert Zabel", "Brian A Curran", "Sarah K Rich", "Robin Lemuel Thomas Ii", "James Theodore Kalsbeek"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Robert Zabel, Dissertation Advisor", "Craig Robert Zabel, Committee Chair", "Brian A Curran, Committee Member", "Sarah K Rich, Committee Member", "Robin Lemuel Thomas Ii, Committee Member", "James Theodore Kalsbeek, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["George Howe", "Louis Kahn", "American Academy in Rome", "architects and travel", "American architects abroad", "Robert Venturi"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Characterization and Mapping of QTLs Conferring Resistance to Late Blight in Potato\n", "id": "6085", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5937", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Field resistance to Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary, the causal agent of late blight in potatoes, has been genetically characterized by analyzing trait-marker association in a potato diploid segregating family of 230 full-sib progenies derived from a cross between two hybrid Solanum phureja x S. stenotomum clones. Trait data were developed at two locations in Pennsylvania in three replicated field trials between 1999 and 2002. Area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was calculated for individual clones in each environment. The distribution of AUDPC values was consistent with the inheritance of a quantitative trait. Relatively high levels of resistance and transgressive segregations were observed within this family. Broad-sense heritability was estimated to be 0.67 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.65-0.78. Since P. infestans can rapidly overcome major race-specific resistance genes, identifying the basis for quantitative resistance is a crucial element for implementing advanced breeding strategies. For this purpose, a genetic linkage map of this population was constructed using previously mapped restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers on 132 clones from the same family. A total of 114 RFLP markers have been used and 14 linkage groups, covering approximately 855 cM, have been identified. The total number of loci mapped was 126, and the genome coverage by the map is estimated to be at least 70% with an average distance of 6.8 cM between two markers. Two methods were employed to determine trait-marker association: the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test and interval mapping analysis. Analysis of the trait scores combined with the marker segregation data allowed the identification of regions of the genome that were significantly correlated with components of disease resistance. Three major QTLs (quantitative trait loci) were detected on linkage group III, V and XI as a contribution from both parents, explaining 23, 17 and 10%, respectively, of the total phenotypic variation. One additional QTL was detected on linkage group VII with less statistical support.

Specific focus is made on principal border cities of Baja California by three contemporary writers from this region: Gabriel Trujillo Mu\u00f1oz, Luis Humberto Crosthwaite and Rosina Conde. These authors present similar and also distinctive narrative approaches to this border with which they challenge the stereotypical visions of the United States and of Central Mexico. \nMexican border cities such as Mexicali and Tijuana are often equated with sin, corruption, political and social negligence, and lawlessness by American media. These images, deeply imprinted in the social imagination of Mexico\u2019s northern neighbor, have created what is known in the border region as the Black Legend, a term associated with a derogatory border perception that usually encompasses, but is not limited to drug dealing, prostitution, alcoholism and betting. At the same time, a similar negative narration arises in Mexico about its northern frontier: the border has been perceived as a weakened first line of defense against the threatening influence of the United States, an idea born out of the Mexican American war, and later reinforced during the Mexican Revolution, and the Prohibition. Chapter one recounts pertinent theoretical approaches applicable to the Mexican border. Historical events as well as the present day perspectives from both countries will be the central topics of the second chapter. \nChapter three is dedicated to the analysis of Trujillo Munoz\u2019s detective narrative from El fest\u00edn de los cuervos. La saga fronteriza de Miguel \u00c1ngel Morgado. These stories explore the reencounter of a border native to his native land. It is through the process of the main character\u2019s recuperation of his roots that the author questions and presents another version of the Black Legend. \nChapter four concentrates on several short stories written by Luis Humberto Crosthwaite and depicts the complexity of daily life on the border. It is by means of the lives of the fronterizos, the border natives, that this author humanizes the border, thus accepting some of the implications of the Black Legend by simultaneously dispelling border stereotypes.\nChapter five explores several short stories written by Rosina Conde. Her stories have a unique quality; the majority of her protagonists are women who are in constant search of an independent voice, and whose images also work as a metaphoric representation of the border. As a result of their struggles the women challenge the exclusionary border stereotypical stigma of the United States and Central Mexico.\nThis dissertation proposes \u201crevolutionary zonkeism\u201d as a metaphor for understanding how these writers construct their border realities to reiterate the negative representations of the border, and how this functions as a resistance culture to combat the history of violence that leads to the leyenda negra of the US/Mexico border.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1851], "author_name_tesi": "Cota-Torres, Edgar ", "last_name_ssi": "Cota-Torres", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Edgar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Julia Cuervo Hewitt", "A\u00edda Beaupied", "Santiago Vaquera V\u00e1squez", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "William Robert Blue"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Julia Cuervo Hewitt, Committee Chair", "A\u00edda Beaupied, Committee Member", "Santiago Vaquera V\u00e1squez, Committee Member", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member", "William Robert Blue, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mexican-American Culture and Literature", "Mexican Northern Border Authors", "Mexican-american Border region"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Genomic Structure of an E. coli O157:H7 Super-Shedder Isolate with Increased Adherence to Bovine RSE Cells ", "id": "17584", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8622", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), in particular E. coli O157:H7, is recognized as a significant foodborne pathogen and a serious threat to public health worldwide.  The major reservoir of E. coli O157:H7 are asymptomatic cattle which harbor the organism in the terminal recto-anal junction (RAJ) of their intestinal tract.  Recently, isolates of E. coli O157:H7 have been obtained from cattle that are classified as \u201csuper-shedder\u201d; excreting bacteria levels that are greater than 104 CFU/g of feces.  In this study, we examined the genome of a super-shedder isolate (SS17) and conducted comparative analysis with reference strains of E. coli O157:H7.  Analysis of the genome revealed a genome size of 5.5 Mb, 5442 coding DNA sequences (CDS), and a G+C content of 50.5%.  In addition, SS17 has a Shiga toxin gene profile of stx1- stx2+ stx2c+ and contains two plasmids, pO157 and pSS17.  Whole genome comparative analysis revealed a clustering of SS17 with the lineage I/II E. coli O157:H7 spinach outbreak strains, TW14359 and EC4115.  In addition, analysis of phage regions in SS17 shows similar location and composition to the phage regions in TW14359 and EC4115.

A number of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) were identified in virulence and adherence genes including the adhesins wzzB, fimA, and csgG, along with a truncation of cah.

These algorithms often focus on the accomplishment of specific tasks analogous to human vision such as scene awareness, object detection, object recognition, and object tracking. Joining forces with cognitive neuroscientists has steered much of this research towards the development of algorithms that not only accomplish the required tasks, but endeavor to do so in a biologically inspired fashion.  Still, development and evaluation of these so-called neuromorphic algorithms is often done in isolation, with little regard given to the rest of the system necessary to make this human-like system a reality. \nThis dissertation provides a framework for the current and future development of complex and highly integrated multi-algorithm vision systems.  This framework not only enables the composition of such systems, but enables seamless development and integration of improved algorithmic modules.  In addition to this high-level system composition framework, the Cerebrum tool, targeted at development of hardware-accelerated architectures is detailed in this work. This tool enables the creation of such hardware-based accelerators by researchers and engineers without specific or detailed knowledge of the target hardware platform.\nIn addition to the framework and tools, this dissertation also details the analysis, development and evaluation of hardware accelerators for HMAX object recognition and AIM saliency detection. Armed with this intelligent framework and algorithmic accelerators, demonstrations of vision systems that leverage multiple algorithms are constructed and evaluated.\nHierarchical object classification, leveraging the benefits of Exemplar SVM and accelerated HMAX is shown to provide performance superior to either algorithm in isolation. Furthermore, a more complex system, targeting the domain of personal retail assistance is composed and demonstrated for the benefit of visually impaired persons.\nWith an eye towards future systems, this dissertation also serves to evaluate and explore a number of technologies whose time is coming.  New transistors, such as Tunnel FETs, and novel architectures, such as coupled oscillator arrays, are examined to identify benefits and concerns in their use for the development of future visual systems, both at the algorithmic and circuit/component level.

The results obtained are discussed and related to the overall corrosion kinetics and to the oxide microstructure. It is shown that the hydrogen pick-up fraction increases before the weight gain transition for Zircaloy-4 and ZIRLO alloys and thus, appears to not depend on the oxidation kinetics. It is also shown that precipitate size plays a role in hydrogen pick-up whereas precipitate volume fraction does not have a significant effect on hydrogen absorption. Finally, the oxidation state of the alloying element in the oxide layer appears to play a role both on oxidation kinetics and hydrogen pick-up. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [477], "author_name_tesi": "Couet, Adrien ", "last_name_ssi": "Couet", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Adrien", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Arthur Thompson Motta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Thesis Advisor", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["zirconium oxide", "hydrogen pick-up", "corrosion", "zirconium alloy", "cold neutron prompt gamma activation analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Hydrogen Pickup Mechanism of Zirconium Alloys", "id": "22429", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10111", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although the optimization of zirconium based alloys has led to significant improvements in hydrogen pickup and corrosion resistance, the mechanisms by which such alloy improvements occur are still not well understood. In an effort to understand such mechanisms, a systematic study of the alloy effect on hydrogen pickup is conducted, using advanced characterization techniques to rationalize precise measurements of hydrogen pickup. The hydrogen pick-up fraction is accurately measured for a specially designed set of commercial and model alloys to investigate the effects of alloying elements, microstructure and corrosion kinetics on hydrogen uptake. Two different techniques to measure hydrogen concentrations were used: a destructive technique, Vacuum Hot Extraction, and a non-destructive one, Cold Neutron Prompt Gamma Activation Analysis. \nThe results indicate that hydrogen pickup varies not only from alloy to alloy but also during the corrosion process for a given alloy. For instance Zircaloy type alloys show high hydrogen pickup fraction and sub-parabolic oxidation kinetics whereas ZrNb alloys show lower hydrogen pickup fraction and close to parabolic oxidation kinetics. Hypothesis is made that hydrogen pickup result from the need to balance charge during the corrosion reaction, such that the pickup of hydrogen is directly related to (and indivisible of) the corrosion mechanism and decreases when the rate of electron transport or oxide electronic conductivity through the protective oxide increases. According to this hypothesis, alloying elements (either in solid solution or in precipitates) embedded in the oxide as well as space charge variations in the oxide would impact the hydrogen pick-up fraction by modifying electron transport, which drives oxidation and hydriding kinetics. Dedicated experiments and modelling were performed to assess and validate these hypotheses.\nIn-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were performed on Zircaloy-4 tubes to directly measure the evolution of oxide electronic conductivity as function of exposure time. The results show that oxide electronic conductivty decreases as function of exposure time and that its variations are directly correlated to the instantaneous hydrogen pickup fraction variations. The electron transport through the oxide layer is thus altered as the oxide grows, reasons for which are yet to be exactly determined. Preliminary results also show that oxide electronic conductivty of ZrNb alloys would be much higher compared with Zircaloy-4. Thus, it is confirmed that oxide electronic conductivity is a key parameter in the hydrogen and oxidation mechanism.\nBecause the mechanism whereby alloying elements are incorporated into the oxide layer is critical to changing \u03c3_(e^-)^ox, the evolution of the oxidation state of two common alloying elements, Fe and Nb, when incorporated into the growing oxide layers is investigated using X-Ray Absorption Near-Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) using micro-beam synchrotron radiation on cross sectional oxide samples. The results show that the oxidation of both Fe and Nb is delayed in the oxide layer compared to that of Zr, and that this oxidation delay is related to the variations of the instantaneous hydrogen pick-up fraction with exposure time. The evolution of Nb oxidation as function of oxide depth is also compatible with space charge compensation in the oxide and with an increase in oxide electronic conductivity  of ZrNb alloys compared to Zircaloys.\nFinally, various successively complex models from the well-known Wagner oxidation theory to the more complex effect of space charge on oxidation kinetics have been developed. The general purpose of the modeling effort is to provide a rationale for the sub-parabolic oxidation kinetics and demonstrate the correlation with hydrogen pickup fraction. It is directly demonstrated that parabolic oxidation kinetics is associated with high oxide electronic conductivity and low space charges in the oxide whereas sub-parabolic oxidation kinetics is associated with lower oxide electronic conductivity and higher space charge in the oxide.\nAll these observations helped us to propose a general corrosion mechanism of zirconium alloys involving both oxidation and hydrogen pickup mechanism to better understand and predict the effect of alloying additions on the behavior of zirconium alloys.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9805], "author_name_tesi": "Couet, Adrien ", "last_name_ssi": "Couet", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Adrien", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Barbara Shaw", "Susan\ufffdTrolier\ufffdMcKinstry", "Kenan Unlu", "Robert Comstock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Dissertation Advisor", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Chair", "Barbara Shaw, Committee Member", "Susan\ufffdTrolier\ufffdMcKinstry, Committee Member", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Member", "Robert Comstock, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hydrogen pickup", "oxide electronic conductivity", "electrochemical impedance spectroscopy", "zirconium alloys", "oxidation", "corrosion"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Contact Charge Blast Performance of Fiber Reinforced and Polyurea Coated Concrete Vehicle Barriers\n", "id": "8665", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "259", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Among the measures used to protect personnel from terrorist attacks are massive concrete vehicle barriers which form a perimeter around the protected establishment.

Another promising solution is a polymer coating, such as polyurea, which can introduce added ductility and contain fragments of concrete from flying away.  Full scale barriers of traditional concrete, two fiber reinforced concretes, two fiber volumes of high performance fiber reinforced cementitious composite, and polyurea coated concrete were tested under contact charge blast loads to assess their performance against a known threat.

With several commercial entities providing these electronic resources, the result can be silo systems, processes, and measures to manage the access and to evaluate cost and usage of these resources, making it extremely difficult to provide meaningful analytics for a holistic evaluation.  Librarians responsible for collection management spend much of their time manually aggregating data from various sources and have little time to invest in the analysis, which is crucial for effective collection management.\nOur research leverages a web-analytics approach for three objectives 1) the creation of a process to evaluate university electronic resources, 2) the creation of a linear regression model to predict usage among these journals, and 3) the development of a system for evaluation of electronic resources at a large research library.  This web-analytics foundation will enable understanding the value that specific journals provide university libraries.  The first objective is implemented by comparing the impact to the cost, titles, and usage for the set of journals and by assessing the funding area (e.g., social sciences, arts & humanities, physical & mathematical sciences, etc.). Overall, the results highlight the benefit of a web-analytics evaluation framework for university libraries and the impact of classifying titles based on the funding area.  By removing the outliers and maintaining the variance in usage and cost among the funding areas, this analysis illustrates the importance for evaluating journals by funding area.  In the second objective we categorize metrics into two classes, global (e.g., journal impact factor, Eigenfactor, etc.) that are journal focused and local (e.g., local downloads, local citation rate, etc.) that are institution dependent.  Using 275 journals for our training set, our analysis shows that a combination of global and local metrics creates the strongest model for predicting full-text downloads.  These results demonstrate the value in creating local metrics for the evaluation of library content collections in order to better inform purchasing decisions versus relying solely on global metrics.  In the third objective, we create a conceptual model, implement this model (i.e., the system), and validate this implementation using real-world data.  The resulting implementation provides a more sophisticated model of evaluation with a simpler model of implementation than currently employed by many large research libraries. This model and system architecture is proven to scale for evaluation of electronic resources at a large research library.  The system aggregates several data sources providing an authoritative repository of information to evaluate journals based on local metrics (i.e. how often an institution cites a journal, how much an institution pays for a journal, how often a particular journals is downloaded, etc.) and global metrics such as Impact Factor or Eigenfactor.  The combination of these objectives creates a framework for evaluating electronic resources at scale for a large research library.  This framework provides practical methods to classify and evaluate journals, predict usage, and create automated processes and systems to aid in this work.

This discussion has led to research on proposed pedagogical strategies aimed at directing L2 learners' attention to aspects of the L2 grammar that are difficult to learn or acquire. Research on one such strategy, Processing Instruction (Cadierno, 1995; VanPatten and Cadierno, 1993a, 1993b; VanPatten and Wong, 2004), suggests that focusing learners' attention on certain grammatical forms in the input can lead to the learners' improvement in both the comprehension and production of those grammatical forms. However, studies regarding the role of attention in SLA, including those on Processing Instruction, have focused primarily on morphology and syntax, while the relationship between attention and pronunciation learning has been mostly ignored. Other research has focused on the impact that explicit instruction on L2 phonetics and phonology has on L2 learners' improvement in pronunciation (e.g. Elliott, 1995b, 1997; Lord, 2005), but this research has not considered the role that attention may play in pronunciation learning.\nThis dissertation connects research on pronunciation learning with other research in SLA by comparing a more typical type of pronunciation assignment with a pronunciation assignment designed to encourage students to attend to the fine-grained phonetic details of L2 speech sounds. Specifically, native English-speaking learners of Spanish were tested on their learning of the Spanish vowels /e/ and /o/. These sounds were considered specifically because previous research has focused on them less than other Spanish sounds. Moreover, earlier studies have not attempted to quantify diphthongization of these vowels to better analyze learners' improvement on them. Twenty-eight students of Spanish, enrolled in two separate sections of a Spanish conversation class, participated in the study. The two sections were taught identically, except that one section received the more typical pronunciation assignment (production assignment, N = 15), while the other received the pronunciation assignment designed to focus students' attention on L2 speech sounds (perception assignment, N = 13). In addition, all students were recorded reading single words at the beginning (pretest) and end (posttest) of the semester. The impact of each assignment on improvement in pronunciation was assessed by acoustically analyzing each student's pronunciation of the vowels /e/ and /o/ on both the pretest and posttest.\nBoth sections were given explicit instruction on differences in Spanish and English speech sounds that have been identified in past studies as difficult for English learners of Spanish. This included instruction on the sounds /e, o, a, p, t, k, b, d, g, &#638;, l/ in Spanish. The production assignment, administered five times, required students to submit recordings of themselves reading a dialogue, on which they received feedback regarding their pronunciation from the instructor each time. For the perception assignment, also administered five times, students listened to recordings of native English participants speaking Spanish and were asked to evaluate the speaker's pronunciation. All native English speakers were unknown to the students receiving the perception assignment. For all assignments in both sections, focus was given to the aspects of Spanish pronunciation covered in class to that point.\nTo analyze students' improvement of the mid vowels, diphthongization of these vowels was quantified. From participants' productions on the pretest and posttest, the first (F1) and second (F2) formants were measured throughout the production of each critical mid vowel, and the change in F1, as well as the change in F2-F1 (F2 minus F1), was calculated. Diphthongization of the /o/ vowel was measured by the decrease in F1, while diphthongization of the /e/ vowel was measured by the increase in F2-F1. Improvement in production of the mid vowels was indicated by a reduction in these changes in F1 and F2-F1 from the pretest to the posttest. This technique allowed for a more in depth analysis of improvement than would be obtained from labeling each vowel as a diphthong or monophthong.\nResults show a significant improvement in the diphthongization of both /o/ and /e/ for the section receiving the perception assignment, but they show no improvement on either vowel for the section receiving the production assignment. This finding suggests that the perception assignment used here was superior to the production assignment inasmuch as the two assignments are compared in this study. I argue that the perception assignment led to more improvement in pronunciation because it was designed to direct students' attention to L2 pronunciation in a way that is not required of students to complete the production assignment. This implies that attention not only plays a role in the learning of morphology and syntax, but also in the learning of pronunciation. The findings in this dissertation suggest, then, that when teachers design assignments targeting pronunciation in L2 classrooms, they should consider how or whether the assignments direct students' attention to key aspects of the L2 speech sounds.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1609], "author_name_tesi": "Counselman, David ", "last_name_ssi": "Counselman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Henry J Gerfen", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "William Robert Blue"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paola Eulalia Dussias, Dissertation Advisor", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Committee Chair", "Henry J Gerfen, Committee Chair", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member", "William Robert Blue, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["L2 Pronunciation", "Phonology in SLA", "SLA"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Conceptualizations and Determinants of Maternal Adaptation to Infant Sleep:  Birth to Six Months", "id": "14874", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7669", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Of the many decisions that parents make regarding child-rearing practices during the first six months of their infant\u2019s life, some of the most important involve the choices that surround infant sleep, including parent and infant sleep arrangements, bedtime routines, nighttime sleep practices, and the like. The present study investigated how these choices influence maternal adaptation, maternal emotional availability, maternal and infant sleep quality, co-parenting, spousal support, and maternal distress over the first six months of life.  Mothers were asked to complete questionnaires regarding their infant\u2019s sleep behaviors and patterns, as well as their attitudes and feelings surrounding those behaviors.  Additional measures included maternal and infant sleep quality via actigraphy and maternal emotional availability at bedtime.  Data was collected on 120 mothers and infants at one month, 104 mothers and infants at three months, and 97 mothers and infants at six months. Maternal adaptation to infant sleep and maternal emotional availability at bedtime were both stable across the first six months.  Maternal adaptation scores improved significantly across the first six months, but maternal emotional availability at bedtime did not. Maternal adaptation and maternal emotional availability at six months were both predicted by negative co-parenting at one and three months, such that mothers who reported more conflict, competition, and undermining in their relationship with their partners were less well-adapted and less emotionally available to their infant at bedtime.  Mothers of infants who woke up more frequently across the first three months were also less well-adapted at six months. Regarding sleep arrangements, mothers who slept in a separate room from their infant were more likely to be well-adapted to their infant\u2019s sleep patterns and more emotionally available at bedtime than mothers who slept in the same room as their infant, although this result was partially mediated by maternal reports of negative co-parenting.

Results emphasize the importance of taking into account both individual and contextual differences in the quality of mothers\u2019 adaptation to infant sleep behavior, a construct largely ignored in the child sleep literature to date, in understanding linkages between infant sleep patterns and maternal adaptation.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7605], "author_name_tesi": "Countermine, Molly Susan", "last_name_ssi": "Countermine", "middle_name_ssi": "Susan", "first_name_ssi": "Molly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Michael Teti", "Douglas Michael Teti", "Fred W Vondracek", "Michael J Rovine", "Kristin Buss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Michael Teti, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas Michael Teti, Committee Chair", "Fred W Vondracek, Committee Member", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member", "Kristin Buss, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["maternal adaptation", "sleep", "infancy", "spousal support", "coparenting", "sleep arrangements", "actigraphy", "spousal support"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Hydrogen distribution in Zircaloy under a temperature gradient: Modeling, Simulation and Experiments", "id": "19112", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8828", "abstract_tesi": "As a result of corrosion during normal operation in nuclear reactors, hydrogen can enter the zirconium fuel cladding and precipitate as brittle hydride particles, which can severely degrade the cladding ductility. According to previous observations, the distribution of the hydrides in the cladding is not homogeneous and responds to temperature and stress gradients. Due to the heterogeneity of the temperature distribution, hydrides tend to accumulate in the colder areas. This accumulation creates local spots of weak cladding that can favor crack initiation. Therefore, the estimation of the average concentration of the hydrides in the cladding is not sufficient to accurately estimate the risk of cladding failure. An estimation of the local hydride distribution is necessary to help predict future and this is the subject of the current work. \nThe hydride distribution is governed by three competing phenomena. Hydrogen in solid solution diffuses under a concentration gradient due to Fick\u2019s law and under a temperature gradient due to the Soret effect. Finally, precipitation of hydrides occurs once the hydrogen solubility limit is reached. This precipitation has its own kinetics. All of these phenomena are strongly temperature dependent. The complex interplay of these separate phenomena can explain why the hydrogen and hydride distribution depends on temperature.  In the current study, different models describing these phenomena have been developed in order to study the behavior of hydrogen in the cladding. \nDue to the complexity of the modeling, it is usually not possible to find an analytical solution for the hydrogen and hydride distribution for nuclear fuel rod geometries, and so numerical solutions were obtained from the implementation of the model in computer. A 1-D difference code has been created to compute hydrogen distribution in simple geometries. A more detailed model was then implemented in the 3D fuel performance code BISON in order to calculate the hydrogen distribution for more sophisticated geometries, such as a nuclear fuel rod. The results shown by these simulations explain the formation of specific radial distribution of hydrides. The simulations predict that before precipitation occurs, hydrogen tends to accumulate in the colder spots due to the Soret effect. Once the solubility limit is reached, hydrogen precipitates and forms a rim close to the outer edge of the cladding. This is due to the competition between precipitation and diffusion. The simulation also show an axial transfer of hydrogen from the top of the rod, where the oxidation rate is high, to the bottom of the rod, where the hydrogen will precipitate. In the future, the implemented model will be able to provide additional information on the azimuthal hydrogen distribution. \nThe model used to describe hydrogen behavior is semi-empirical. In particular, two empirical constants have to be determined that do not have consistent values in the literature. Therefore, two experiments were designed and performed in order to measure these constants. The first constant is the heat of transport Q*, which determined the Soret effect. This was measured by applying a gradient to a Zircaloy plate that was previously charged with hydrogen. The measured value for Q* was 58.5 kJ/mol and is higher than previous measurement. The results confirm the large variability of the measurement of the heat of transport. The second constant is the rate of precipitation \u03b12 from Marino, which describes the rate at which the supersaturated hydrogen in solid solution precipitates into zirconium hydrides. This rate is measured through an in situ X-Ray diffraction experiment in transmission, at the Advanced Photon Source of the Argonne National Laboratory. The results are between 0.013 s-1/2  and 0.034 s-1/2  and are in the same range of values as found in previous experiments. However, no clear trend of temperature dependence has been identified. \nThe current work involves preliminary approach to calculate an estimation of the thickness of the hydride rim. The simulations directly based on the model predict a very high concentration in the rim that is not seen experimentally. However, once a limit to the concentration of hydrides was set, the simulations provide rim thickness close to 100 microns, which is consistent with experimental observation. The work also proposes suggestions to improve the model governing hydrogen and hydrides distribution in the future. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8675], "author_name_tesi": "Courty, Olivier Fabrice", "last_name_ssi": "Courty", "middle_name_ssi": "Fabrice", "first_name_ssi": "Olivier", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nuclear", "Materials", "Cladding", "Zirconium", "Hydrogen", "Diffusion", "Precipitation", "X-Ray", "Diffraction", "simulation", "finite element"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "EVALUATION OF DRY STEAM PRECONDITIONING ON SWITCHGRASS PELLET QUALITY METRICS", "id": "12635crc5296", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12635", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research investigated the impact of thermal preconditioning with dry steam on the quality of pellets manufactured from ground switchgrass.

Determined ground material properties included particle density, bulk density, and particle size distribution. Determined pellet quality metrics included diametral strength, axial strength, friability, durability, and pellet density.\nParticle density was observed to significantly decrease (p<0.05) when conditioned by the dry steam. This might have been caused by effects by moisture inducing the migration of natural binders to the outside of the ground particles and eventual evaporation. An increase in pellet diametral strength was observed for the 120oC dry steam preconditioning (p>0.05). Axial strength values of single pellets for control and dry steam preconditioned ground switchgrass were not significantly different (p>0.05). Pellet durability analysis in bulk pellets resulted in an average friability around 94% for control and all treatments. The more aggressive box durability tests indicated that dry steam conditioned pellets had a 7-10% lower durability around 78%.

There has been a steady decline in hunting participation over the past decades and it is increasingly important for natural resource managers to develop innovative ways to recruit and retain hunters.  One potential approach is by understanding females who have seen an upward trend in hunting participation.  This study examined female hunters and factors that contribute to hunting participation including constraints, negotiation strategies, motivations, social support, and self-efficacy.  Data for this study were collected using a mail survey of Oregon big game hunters.  The first chapter provides an introduction and conceptual framework for the study.  Results are then presented in three distinct chapters, and summarized in chapter 5. \nChapter 2 examines a typology of female hunters and how they differ across constraint and negotiation strategies.  Four types of hunters emerged and included the less-engaged hunter, family oriented hunter, social-relax hunter, and the all around enthusiast hunter.  Significant differences existed among the types of hunters on both constraints and negotiation strategies.  \nChapter 3 compares male and female hunters across constraints, negotiation strategies, motivations, social support, and self efficacy.  A series of tests were conducted to understand the relationship between key variables and hunting participation.  There were limited differences between females and males.  Results suggest constraints were not a predictor of participation.  Additionally, motivations, social support, and self-efficacy had an indirect influence on hunting participation.  \nChapter 4 focuses on expanding constraint theory by incorporating self-efficacy into the constraint negotiation process.   Findings suggest constraints are fully mitigated by negotiation strategies and are not a predictor of participation.  Results indicate self-efficacy is a predictor of participation along with negotiation strategies and motivations.  \nOverall findings from the study indicate females are not as constrained in hunting as previously thought.  Females have found ways to negotiate through constraints and are motivated to participate.  Additionally, females are confident in their hunting and feel they have the social support from family and friends.  Future research is needed to examine those females who are new to hunting or are thinking about starting the activity.    \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1687], "author_name_tesi": "Covelli, Elizabeth Anna", "last_name_ssi": "Covelli", "middle_name_ssi": "Anna", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan R Graefe", "Alan R Graefe", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "James Craig Finley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan R Graefe, Dissertation Advisor", "Alan R Graefe, Committee Chair", "Andrew Justin Mowen, Committee Member", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Member", "James Craig Finley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hunter Retention", "Hunter Recruitment", "Outdoor Recreation", "Female Hunters"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Analyzing the Benefits of Scratchpad Memories for Scientific Matrix Computations\n\n", "id": "8239", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "612", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Scratchpad memories (SPMs) have been shown to be more energy efficient, have faster access times, and take up less area than traditional hardware-managed caches.

The first study performed is to analyze SPMs for their thermal and area properties on a conventional RISC processor. Six performance optimized variants of architecture are explored that evaluate the impact of having an SPM in the on-chip memory hierarchy. Increasing the performance and energy efficiency of both dense and sparse matrix-vector multiplication on a chip multi-processor are also looked at. The efficient utilization of the SPM is ensured by profiling the application for the data structures which do not perform well in traditional cache.

The total area of a chip can be reduced by nearly 30%. The dense matrix-vector multiplication kernel showed as much as a 60% increase in performance and a decrease in the energy-delay product by as much as 84%.

One application is the folding/unfolding of origami structures by way of external stimuli, such as thermal fields, electrical fields, and/or magnetic fields, for active systems. This research aims to actuate the Miura-ori pattern from an initial flat state using neodymium magnets on an elastomer substrate within a magnetic field to assess performance characteristics versus magnet placement and orientation. Additionally, proof-of-concept devices using magneto-active elastomers (MAEs) patches will be studied. The MAE material consists of magnetic particles embedded and aligned within a silicon elastomer substrate then cured. In the presence of a magnetic field, both the neodymium magnets and MAE material align with the field, causing a magnetic moment and thus, magnetic work.\n\tIn this work, the Miura-ori pattern was fabricated from a silicone elastomer substrate with prescribed, reduced-thickness creases and removed material at crease vertex points. Four magnetization orientation configurations of the Miura-ori pattern were generated and fabricated by attaching neodymium magnets to the Miura-ori substrates. The prototypes were tested within a magnetic field ranging from 0 \u2013 240 mT and selected crease fold angles were measured at each field strength. Theoretical magnetic work for each configuration was calculated based on an origami folding model from the Miura-ori\u2019s initial flat state to its completely folded state. These calculations were applied to a design space visualization program to determine the magnetization orientation for each configuration that resulted in the maximum possible theoretical work achieved. Each configuration was analyzed and compared in relation to its experimentally determined overall actuation, experimentally determined ability to follow the ideal folding behavior of the Miura-ori pattern, and the theoretical normalized work for fixed and varied magnetization orientations.\n\tThe configuration with the highest overall rating of the aforementioned criteria was selected to be tested with the magnetization orientations that resulted in its maximum possible theoretical work. The configuration with the maximum theoretical normalized work was fabricated with attached neodymium magnets. A similar configuration with slightly different magnetization orientations resulting in an offset theoretical normalized work was also tested, and was fabricated using two methods: attached neodymium magnets and embedded MAE patches. The MAE patches were created using a 30% volume fraction of 325 mesh barium hexaferrite particles mixed with Dow Sylgard 184 silicone rubber compound at a 10:1 base to catalyst ratio and cured within a uniform (0.7 T) magnetic field in a prescribed alignment. Both sets of prototypes were tested using the same experimental setup as was used for the original four configurations and were compared using the same criterion. Configuration I*, which had magnetization orientations that maximized the theoretical normalized work, outperformed all other configurations in a weighted sum model that additionally accounted for idealness and actuation.

Due to their dependence on irregularly occurring seepage, vestimentiferan tubeworms (Family: Siboglinidae) have patchy distributions on the seafloor. Tubeworms of the genera Escarpia and Lamellibrachia are important components of seep ecosystems, as they form long-lived aggregations that provide habitat for a variety of other deep-sea fauna.\nThree described species of Escarpia, E. spicata (Gulf of California), E. laminata (Gulf of Mexico) and E. southwardae (West African Cold Seeps), have been identified as one species through the use of mitochondrial markers Cytochrome Oxidase subunit 1 (mtCOI) and large ribosomal subunit rDNA, (mt16S), despite their geographic differences and dissimilar morphologies. Three morphologically distinct groups of Lamellibrachia are present over a bathymetric range of almost 3000m in the Gulf of Mexico; these include L. luymesi (<1000m) and two unnamed groups, L. sp. 1 and L. sp. 2 (>1000m). As with the Escarpia, mtCOI and mt16S identifies L. luymesi and L. sp. 1 as one species despite their differing depth ranges and dissimilar morphologies. \nThis dissertation seeks to define the geographic and bathymetric ranges of Escarpia and Lamellibrachia by determining if geographically differentiated Escarpia and depth differentiated Lamellibrachia are genetically distinct within each respective group. For these investigations, we make use of molecular, morphological and environmental data, all of which are necessary to ascertain population boundaries and evolutionary processes occurring in the deep sea. Here we use Exon Priming Intron Crossing (EPIC) sequencing of a nuclear gene, and develop microsatellite markers with the aid of 454 and Illumina next generation sequencing to 1) determine if the described taxa are genetically differentiated and 2) identify possible population structure at the regional scale within the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, respectively. \nTo identify if the three Escarpia groups are genetically distinct, we have tested the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome B (CYTB) for its utility as a phylogenetically informative marker, as well as developed and analyzed the EPIC marker Hemoglobin subunit B2 intron (HbB2i) and 28 microsatellites in 229 Escarpia individuals collected from 12 seep sites around the world. Nine of the microsatellites were amplified across the three Escarpia taxa, and while CYTB identifies two groups rather than three, both HbB2i and the cross-amplified microsatellites support the occurrence of three genetically distinct groups of Escarpia based on geography. At the regional scale among eight sampling sites of E. laminata (n =129) and among three sampling sites of E. southwardae (n =80), no population structure was detected. \nTo identify if the two Lamellibrachia groups are genetically distinct, we also tested CYTB, HbB2i and eight microsatellites in 76 Lamellibrachia individuals collected from 13 seep sites in the Gulf of Mexico. All eight of the microsatellites were amplified across 45 L. luymesi and L. sp.1, and while both CYTB and HbB2i identify L. luymesi and L. sp. 1 as a single group, the cross-amplified microsatellites support the occurrence of two genetically distinct groups. At the regional scale among eight sampling sites of L.sp.1 (n =24) and among six sampling sites of L. sp.2 (n =31), no population structure was detected. \nFindings in this dissertation illustrate that 1) nuclear markers support original morphological descriptions of Escarpia and Lamellibrachia, suggesting that each group is constrained to their respective geographic or bathymetric region, 2) despite the patchiness and isolation of seep habitats, connectivity is high on regional scales, 3) mitochondrial markers should be used with extreme caution when attempting to detect differentiation in seep vestimentiferan groups, and lastly 4) microsatellites may be another useful tool to determine genetic differentiation between described species when divergence is insufficient or too recent to be detected using gene sequences alone.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8665], "author_name_tesi": "Cowart, Dominique Alexandria", "last_name_ssi": "Cowart", "middle_name_ssi": "Alexandria", "first_name_ssi": "Dominique", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Christopher Howard House"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Dissertation Advisor", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Chair", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vestimentiferan tubeworm", "hydrocarbon seep", "microsatellite", "siboglinid", "population structure", "deep sea"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Life Happens: \nHow Non-College Life-Events Influence Racial Inequality in Four-Year Graduation Rates at Selective Colleges and Universities\n\n\n", "id": "10595", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "667", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Racial inequality is a persistent reality in the United States.

These disturbances and reactions make the underlying processes observable and explicit to an extent not revealed under ordinary circumstances.\nThere are three main audiences for this study: instructional designers, architectural design educators, and those interested in sustainability and its status in a design curriculum. While sustainability for its own sake was not the primary focus here, how sustainability is emerging in this culture\u2019s instruction and curriculum should be of interest to the latter group. Where this study is intended to provide a fundamental contribution is at the intersection of instructional design and design instruction. To date, little in the instructional systems literature discusses the architecture studio and its crucial role in architecture degree programs. When it comes to how learning objectives should or should not be applied to studio courses and curricula, the literature of architectural design education has not dealt comprehensively with systemic institutional pressures for assessment. Again, this is a descriptive study of a single department, and a glimpse into the ways that culture deals with these issues. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1213], "author_name_tesi": "Cox, Charles David", "last_name_ssi": "Cox", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Charles", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher M.

The current study tested whether 46 girls (48-69 months old, mean = 57) participating in an occupational computer game would increase in their interest in traditionally masculine jobs depending on the degree to which the game\u2019s primary character was culturally feminized. Specifically, the game presented masculine, feminine, and novel occupations depicted either by Barbie or by a less feminized Playmobil character. Dependent measures assessed girls\u2019 interest in masculine and feminine activities, interest in masculine and feminine jobs, and interest in game-depicted jobs. The study also examined whether the impact of the game would vary in relation to individual differences in the degree to which gender is personally salient (Liben & Bigler\u2019s gender salience filter, GSF; 2002). Girls were given three GSF measures: (a) gender typicality, (b) own-sex affiliation, and (c) own-sex memory, which combined to create a GSF score. Findings showed that the Playmobil game had little impact on girls\u2019 interests, irrespective of individual differences in GSF. In contrast, the Barbie game had significant effects, in conjunction with GSF differences. For girls with a stronger GSF, playing the Barbie game led to an increased interest in feminine activities. Additionally, girls with a stronger GSF also showed less interest in the game-depicted masculine jobs if they had played the Barbie version. These results have implications for interventions which seek to build on some girls\u2019 feminized interests as a way to foster interests in nontraditional domains. These results also underscore the value of assessing GSF level, since outcomes may vary accordingly.

Gender Schema Theory suggests that early on, girls and boys gravitate toward different experiences, approaching what they perceive as culturally appropriate for their gender and avoiding what they perceive as inappropriate. Gender-differentiated play may thus shape actual skill development and gender attitudes. Marketing toys as \"for girls\" or \"for boys\" may influence children\u2019s willingness to play. Because spatial/mechanical toys are traditionally marketed primarily to boys, and spatial skill has been linked to success in STEM fields, one contributor to the STEM disparity may be boys\u2019 early spatial skill advantage.\n\nAlthough girls play less with construction toys, we know little about how children\u2019s and parents\u2019 gender beliefs influence play, and whether marketing affects toy interest. I examined these factors, focusing on mothers\u2019 and children\u2019s interest in, and play with, a construction toy marketed explicitly to girls versus to boys. GoldieBlox is a new toy with an accompanying story. Children address challenges that arise in the narrative by assembling simple machines (e.g., belt- drives), combining a traditionally feminine mode of play \u2013 reading \u2013 with a traditionally masculine one \u2013 construction.\n\nSixty-one mother-child dyads (age 4-6 years) played together with either GoldieBlox or BobbyBlox (modified to use masculine colors and male character). Mothers were given a few minutes to prepare for play and familiarize themselves with the toy. Dyads then played together for 15 minutes after which children played independently with the toy for 5-7 minutes. Children were assessed for mechanical learning at post-test.\n\nFindings confirmed that toy marketing affected how mothers and children used the toys, what they thought about the toys, and how much children learned from the toys. Mothers engaged in more building during familiarization with BobbyBlox than with GoldieBlox. Mothers used different scaffolding strategies with daughters versus with sons, reading to daughters and demonstrating building to sons, resulting in differential support of mechanical learning. Girls built more overall with GoldieBlox and boys built more overall with BobbyBlox. Ultimately, however, girls learned more from BobbyBlox than from GoldieBlox and boys learned more from GoldieBlox than from BobbyBlox. These effects also interacted with individual differences in children\u2019s gender salience.\n\nThis research tested the role of the gender salience filter in Liben & Bigler\u2019s (2002) Dual Pathways model. Highly salient girls especially benefitted from play with BobbyBlox and did not learn when playing with GoldieBlox. This suggests that for STEM intervention, marketing STEM by gender may not be a successful approach.

A Green\u2019s Function Parabolic Equation (GFPE) method was developed that predicts the sound pressure level a certain distance away from a known source. Literature suggests that the GFPE can include realistic weather profiles and terrain profiles within the GFPE. This purpose of this project was to choose the best option for including theoretical and actual measured terrain profiles. There are a number of considerations in choosing a method of weather input and terrain mapping, which include ease of implementation as well as compu- tational efficiency. In order to test the validity of the model including real terrain and weather data, field measurements were conducted in a valley of the Smoky Mountains, located in western North Carolina called Hogan\u2019s Mountain. This location exhibited a great deal of complex terrain, vegetation and weather conditions. Continuous and impulsive sources were positioned in multiple, reciprocal locations for the experiment. Receiver locations were spread throughout the area with many significant terrain features (downslopes, upslopes and impedance changes). Simultaneous atmospheric measurements were made to measure wind speed and temperature profiles as well as a level of turbulence. Using the measured data and the fully developed and benchmarked general GFPE this project further developed a Hogan\u2019s Mountain specific GFPE to include stair-step terrain mapping capability and linearly interpolated sound speed profiles. This Hogan\u2019s Mountain GFPE can now use matching conditions for comparison to the measured received levels from the field test data. Due to the vast data set acquired, which allows for comparison of the model to measurement in a multitude of propagation situations, a number of comments are made regarding choice of parameters in those particular situations as well as the validity of the basic GFPE and altered Hogan\u2019s Mountain GFPE for different propagation prediction settings.

One of the more important aspects of the instrument that concerns musicians, is the quality of the instrument. There are many aspects of this study of instrument quality that could be subjective. This dissertation takes a step towards an objective acoustical quality marker of the clarinet by focusing on analytical predictions of playing frequencies given certain variable inputs such as blowing pressure and reed opening at rest. This research offers a study of this acoustical property by means of simplified mathematical formulas, numerical simulations, and experimental methods in order to create tuning maps of the clarinet over a normal range of playing parameters. \n\nThe dissertation begins by offering an introduction to the concept of impedance as perhaps the most important and applicable concept in musical instrument acoustics. In this work, the resonance frequencies of the instrument provide a basis for all playing frequency predictions and these resonance frequencies are found by analyzing the measured input impedance. The dissertation then describes the analytical methods for predicting playing frequencies by considering changes from the instrument's resonance frequencies due to a number of fairly complicated effects including: reed induced flow, reed dynamics, instrument inharmonicity, and a player introduced temperature gradient. Numerical prediction methods are also described in order to provide a benchmark for the newly defined analytical formulas. Next, experimental validation methods and preliminary data are detailed in which an artificial mouth and instrumented mouthpiece were used to create tuning maps in order to further test the bounds of the analytical formulas. Finally, tuning maps are created using the simplified analytical formulas. These tuning maps can show, for all combinations of possible blowing pressures and reed openings, the resulting clarinet playing frequencies. These tuning maps could eventually give musicians and instrument makers fast, reliable, and perhaps more importantly, objective information about the quality of their clarinets.

T cells are critical immune effectors that can identify and eliminate cancerous host cells. Adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) is an emerging immunotherapy in which the patient\u2019s own T cells are isolated and optimized to target the tumor, expanded in culture, and re-infused into the cancer patient. To improve the survival and function of the re-infused T cells, patients are pre-conditioned with chemotherapy or whole-body irradiation (WBI) to deplete host immune cells prior to ACT. Use of host-conditioning regimens significantly improves response and cure rates, but the reasons for failure are unknown. Investigation of the underlying mechanisms of ACT therapy and host-conditioning regimens is necessary to improve the success and applicability of this promising immunotherapeutic approach. Here, we focus on the influence of WBI and agonist anti-CD40 antibody (which stimulates antigen-presenting cells to activate T cells) host-conditioning regimens on ACT therapy of established murine brain tumors. SV11 mice develop autochthonous tumors of the choroid plexus of the brain due to transgenic expression of the SV40 large Tumor antigen (T Ag) oncoprotein. Using T Ag-specific transgenic T cells, we investigate the underlying mechanisms of WBI and anti-CD40 that promote the in vivo accumulation and persistence of donor T cells during ACT-mediated tumor regression and protection from tumor recurrence. First, we show that WBI conditioning induces a prolonged window of opportunity during which ACT can be administered to mediate regression of established tumors. However, ACT early after WBI is required to achieve maximum survival benefit. Thus, the mechanisms promoting tumor regression and long-term survival are distinct. We also demonstrate a time-dependent reduction in early donor T cell accumulation when ACT is delayed after WBI that correlates with recovery from host lymphodepletion. Next, we dissect the local and systemic influences of WBI and show that irradiation conditioning can promote successful ACT-mediated tumor regression independently of local irradiation to the brain or tumor. Therefore, the systemic effects of WBI are critical determinants of ACT therapeutic success. Irradiation localized to the body was sufficient to promote long-term survival and donor T cell persistence in the brain. Local irradiation to the tumor site enhanced donor T cell accumulation in the tumor-draining lymph nodes and resulted in modest survival benefit but did not promote tumor regression. Finally, we show that anti-CD40 conditioning can promote ACT-mediated tumor regression in the absence of irradiation, but that only WBI conditioning promotes durable protection from tumor recurrence, demonstrating the differential efficacy of two clinically relevant immunotherapies. Protection from tumor recurrence was associated with the establishment of persistent donor T cells in the brain that were resistant to antibody-mediated depletion. Collectively, these studies illustrate the impact of host-conditioning regimens on ACT therapy and define the requirements relevant to success.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10884], "author_name_tesi": "Cozza, Eugene Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Cozza", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Eugene", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Todd Schell", "Todd Schell", "Aron Eliot Lukacher", "Neil David Christensen", "Jianxun Song", "Edward Joseph Gunther"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Todd Schell, Dissertation Advisor", "Todd Schell, Committee Chair", "Aron Eliot Lukacher, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Jianxun Song, Committee Member", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CD8+ T cell", "Whole-body irradiation", "CD40 agonist", "choroid plexus tumor", "SV40 T antigen transgenic mice"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Structural and geomorphic evolution of the Gonghe basin complex, northeastern Tibet:  Implications for the timing of plateau growth", "id": "11728", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6511", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-01-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reconstructing the kinematic history of the outward expansion of the Tibetan plateau is\ncentral to ongoing debates over the geodynamics of continental plateau growth and the manner in\nwhich the growth of high topography shapes the earth\u2019s climate.

I present four field based studies from the Gonghe\nbasin complex in the regions interior which bear on these issues. First, I document regionally\nextensive contractional deformation across a broad swath of interior northeastern Tibet (the\nAnyemaqen Shan and west Qinling Shan) during the Cretaceous, thereby providing evidence for\npre-Cenozoic crustal thickening of the region. Second, I show that although northeastern Tibet\nmay have experienced contractional tectonism during the early Tertiary, this episode appears to\nbe confined to regions near the plateau edge (e.g. the west Qinling fault and the western Qaidam basin) and is not apparent in the intervening region. Third, I add new evidence from interior northeastern Tibet (the Gonghe basin region) to a growing body of work that points to a rapid change in structural style and depositional patterns across the entire plateau margin during the late Miocene, from slow sedimentation in broad basins, to rapid sedimentation in narrow, structurally bounded basins. Fourth, I show that upper crustal shortening since the late Miocene has been small, on the order of 4%, along a 350 km profile in interior northeastern Tibet. Fifth, I show that fault networks in the region sole into decollements at deep levels (10s of km) in the\ncrust, analogous to other intracontinental mountain ranges such as the Laramide ranges in the\nwestern United States, or the Sierra Pampeanas of Argentina.

I argue that the first three purposes \u2013 academic, democratic, and economic \u2013 have been a part of education since the beginning of America. The fourth purpose, the societal purpose, was not implemented until the Common School Era. My analysis shows that the purposes overlap with one another. Since the 1980s, there has been a debate over excellence versus equality. I find that when education focuses on excellence, the two most prominent purposes are the academic and the economic. When focusing on equality, the two most prominent purposes are the democratic and societal. However, in either case, the two less prominent purposes do not disappear; they become smaller in importance until a policy shift swings them back into focus.

The main argument builds upon the Freedom of Information Act, which makes most documents held by the American government available to citizens; the National Environmental Policy Act, which has unique requirements for the collection and disclosure of environmentally-relevant information; and a variety of specific federal environmental statutes that mandate the collection of pollution- and public health-related reports from business and industry. American environmental jurisprudence is based largely upon the management of information, but due to longstanding patterns of administrative law and a legal system that enforces information-collection procedures rather than the substantive value of the resulting documents, true environmental transparency has not yet been achieved in America. Ultimately, this dissertation brings attention to rather obscure information regulations that can be utilized by citizens to fight for greater transparency of government-held environmental documents, and in turn, greater environmental protection, but many legal and administrative challenges must be overcome.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [824], "author_name_tesi": "Cramer, Benjamin  W.", "last_name_ssi": "Cramer", "middle_name_ssi": "W.", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Milner Frieden", "Martin Halstuk", "Geoffrey Scott", "Matthew Jackson", "Robert Milner Frieden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Milner Frieden, Dissertation Advisor", "Martin Halstuk, Committee Member", "Geoffrey Scott, Committee Member", "Matthew Jackson, Committee Member", "Robert Milner Frieden, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["environmental law", "government transparency"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Strategy Instruction for Writing and Revising Persuasive Quick Writes on Middle School Students with Emotional Behavioral Disorders\n", "id": "12202", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4265", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A multiple baseline alternating treatment (A-B-C-D) design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies for teaching persuasive writing and peer revision.

Because nearly 90% of lung cancer cases are attributed to smoking tobacco and tobacco related lung cancer has a latency period of 20-30 years from time of exposure to invasive disease, intervention before invasive disease with a chemical agent, termed chemoprevention, is a well suited approach for this particular disease. Research suggests that many natural compounds, often found in the human diet, have chemopreventive properties and are actively being explored and/or can make excellent lead compounds.  Our lab, using rational drug design techniques, developed a novel isoselenocyanate compound known as phenylbutyl isoselenocyanate (ISC-4) based on naturally occurring compounds found in cruciferous vegetables. The central hypothesis of this research was that ISC-4, based on its design, would function as a potent and effective anti-cancer agent and could be used as a chemopreventive agent.  \n\nSpecific Aims\nSpecific Aim 1: To determine the effects of replacing the sulfur atom of a panel of phenyl alkyl isothiocyanates with selenium to form a new panel of phenyl alkyl isoselenocyanates (Chapter 2). A structure activity study was performed on the panel of parent isothiocyanate compounds and the resulting panel of isoselenocyanate compounds to determine if mechanistic characteristics were retained and to ascertain a reason for increased activity.\nSpecific Aim 2: Testing the hypothesis that ISC-4 has potential as a chemopreventive agent (Chapter 3). This drug was found to potently target and inhibit carcinogen bioactivation by cytochrome P450 enzymes, including the tobacco specific nitrosamine procarcinogen, N-nitrosyl ketone (NNK). When bioactivated, NNK can lead to mutations in DNA and ultimately result in tumorigenesis. A series of experiments were conducted to assess chemopreventive properties including bioavailability, anti-initiation, and DNA adduct studies, all of which were needed as proof of concept before performing an animal bioassay.\nSpecific Aim 3: Testing ISC-4 as a chemopreventive agent in a lung cancer chemoprevention bioassay (Chapter 4). Using an A/J mouse model, ISC-4 at varying doses and along with its sulfur analog PBITC were tested for the ability to inhibit NNK induced lung tumorigenesis over a 24 week period of time. \n\nOriginal Breakthroughs and Findings\nIsoselenocyanate (ISC) compounds were actually found to have increased activity with cellular thiols compared to their corresponding sulfur analogs leading to the hypothesis that specific protein modifications and redox activity in the cell are responsible for the increased activities seen with the ISC compounds. As Phase I cytochrome P450s were identified early as a significant protein target of ISC-4, the cancer chemopreventive properties of this compound were explored. ISC-4 was found to be orally bioavailable, able to transcriptionally induce Phase II detoxification enzymes, and inhibit DNA adduct formation in lung which showed that ISC-4 had anti-initiation properties that warranted further investigation as a lung cancer chemopreventive agent. In a large scale lung cancer chemoprevention bioassay using A/J mice, ISC-4 was able to inhibit NNK induced lung tumorigenesis by 86% when fed in the diet at 0.38 \u00b5mol per gram. ISC-4 treated mice also had a lower percentage of adenomas compared to hyperplasia in the lung, which suggests ISC-4 may have anti promotion or progression properties as well. However, when compared to its sulfur analog PBITC, ISC-4 is not as well tolerated and therefore may be more suited in anti-progression and chemotherapy, at least for lung cancer.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3932], "author_name_tesi": "Crampsie, Melissa Ashley", "last_name_ssi": "Crampsie", "middle_name_ssi": "Ashley", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shantu G Amin", "Shantu G Amin", "Arun Kumar Sharma", "Kelly J Karpa", "Bogdan Prokopczyk", "Gary H Perdew", "Richard Robert Young"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shantu G Amin, Dissertation Advisor", "Shantu G Amin, Committee Chair", "Arun Kumar Sharma, Committee Chair", "Kelly J Karpa, Committee Member", "Bogdan Prokopczyk, Committee Member", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Richard Robert Young, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ISC-4", "lung cancer", "chemoprevention"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Why Are African American Parents Choosing Charter Schools: New Evidence from North Carolina", "id": "7659", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1965", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This qualitative study examined the choices that African American (AA) parents of students in two charter schools in Durham, North Carolina are making with regard to their children\u2019s education.  Its purpose was to explore how and why they arrived at the decision to remove their children from integrated traditional public schools (TPS) and enroll them in relatively new and unproven charter schools that are almost totally segregated. It sought to analyze the dynamics of AA parent decision-making in an attempt to determine the factors affecting their choices. \nSpecifically the questions the study asked were: 1) Why are AA parents choosing to leave traditional, integrated public schools to attend largely segregated charters? 2) How did they arrive at their decision?  Four propositions were examined during the course of the study in order to answer the how/why questions.  They were based on Carol Weiss\u2019 \u201c4 I\u2019s\u201d framework for public policy decision-making and included the effect of interests, ideologies, information, and institutions on decision makers. Weiss\u2019 \u201c4 I\u2019s\u201d provided a substantive focus for understanding parents\u2019 decision-making.  \nPrimary sources were interviews with 33 AA parents and 3 administrators in 2 charter schools in Durham, North Carolina and pertinent records from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.  The principal findings include:\n\u2022\tParents chose charters because they were smaller; they perceived that their children received more individual attention and thus had a greater chance of succeeding; that the teachers were more caring; and that the school climate was more accepting, positive, safe, and nurturing. \n\u2022\tParents thought that their children\u2019s charter schools were achieving higher End of Grade Test scores than they actually were.\n\u2022\t100% of the parents were accepting of the lack of diversity in their charter schools; some viewed it as positive; 81% said it was insignificant as long as their children were successful academically. \n\u2022\tParents perceived that traditional public schools are too big and violent; that many TPS students were unruly; and that TPS teachers had given up, did not care and/or did not love their students. Parents reported that, in their opinion, AA children and parents did not receive equal treatment in TSP and that they did not feel welcome. Parents believed that AA children were not seen as children with potential in TPS.   \n\u2022\tParents saw themselves as citizen consumers of education empowered by choice, loyal to their children, and on a quest for educational opportunities for them. \n\u2022\tParents felt that they shared the responsibility with the school of their choice to ensure that their children were successful; that neither they nor the school could successfully educate their children unless parents, teachers, and students co-operated; 24% said that schools could not succeed without their support.  \n\u2022\tAdministrators understood why parents had chosen their charter schools; they recognized that charters were \u201cbusinesses\u201d and that the students, along with their parents were \u201ccustomers\u201d who had options; they were focused on parent expectations and on what they needed to do in order to attract and keep students enrolled. \n\nMajor implications for policy and practice:\n\n\u2022\tSchool board members, county commissioners, and voters need to understand that parents want smaller, more inclusive, more personal schools where their children are recognized and known as children of potential.\n\u2022\tSchools of education and teacher development programs within school systems need to provide teachers with new information and strategies to enable them to communicate with parents effectively; to reach more children; and to create more inclusive, compassionate classroom environments sensitive to cultural differences.  \n\u2022\tEducational Leadership/Administration preparation programs need to attend to diversity/sensitivity training and cultural awareness to enable superintendents and principals to communicate and constructively deal with multiracial populations.  \n\u2022\tSchool leaders at all levels need to take responsibility for the equal treatment of all of the students in their schools.   \n\u2022\tSchool leaders need to acknowledge that parents are an invaluable resource; that they are essential to the education process; that they should be respected and welcomed; and that their skills and knowledge should be effectively utilized. \n\nSuggestions for future research: \n\u2022\tA longitudinal study of African American parents who chose charter schools instead of TPS and their satisfaction as compared to AA parents who chose to remain in TPS.  \n\u2022\tAA parent choice of charter schools in a different area of the country.\n\u2022\tAA parent perception of mistreatment of their children in TPS.\n\u2022\tA longitudinal study comparing the success of students following graduation from charter schools and TPS. \n\u2022\tInterview AA parents who could have chosen charters but chose to remain in TPS.   \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1948], "author_name_tesi": "Crary, Foy Matthews", "last_name_ssi": "Crary", "middle_name_ssi": "Matthews", "first_name_ssi": "Foy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Emily Boyd", "Nona Ann Prestine", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich", "George Farkas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Emily Boyd, Committee Chair", "Nona Ann Prestine, Committee Member", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich, Committee Member", "George Farkas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["charter schools", "choice in education", "minority choice", "African American choice in education"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A FUNDAMENTAL STUDY OF THE ANATOMY, AERODYNAMICS, AND TRANSPORT PHENOMENA OF CANINE OLFACTION", "id": "8758", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "611", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Though olfaction has been studied in humans, rodents, amphibians, and other animals for centuries, the sense of smell remains the least understood of the physiological senses.  Traditional measures of olfactory acuity, such as sensory organ size, neuronal density, and the number of functional olfactory receptor genes, overlook odorant transport from the external environment to receptor sites in the olfactory epithelium.  However, the deposition of odorant molecules in the olfactory part of the nose is the first step, albeit a critical one, in chemical trace detection.  Few of the previous studies of olfaction have considered the internal nasal aerodynamics and odorant transport.  Moreover, a proper study of the fluid dynamics and olfactory transport phenomena of nature\u2019s best sniffer, the canine, has never been done. \nThe objective of this study is to acquire a fundamental understanding of the anatomy and physics of canine olfaction.  Due to the lack of detailed anatomical data on the canine nasal airway, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the nasal cavity of a large dog are first acquired.  A complete description of the airway anatomy is given that includes representative cross-sections and morphometric data.  An anatomically-correct three-dimensional surface model of the nasal cavity is reconstructed from the MRI data, yielding a computerized model of the dog\u2019s nose.  \nExperimental data on canine sniffing are acquired for seven dogs, ranging over nearly an order of magnitude in body mass (6.8 \u2013 52.9 kg).  These unique data are used both to characterize canine sniffing and to provide physiologically-realistic computational boundary conditions.  \nA high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed from the reconstructed nasal cavity, and simulation results of the external and internal aerodynamics of canine olfaction are presented.  The physics of olfactory mass transport are finally considered, and for this purpose a reduced-order numerical model is developed and used to characterize multiphase odorant transport in the olfactory region of the canine.\nThe results of this study reveal an impressively-complex canine nasal airway labyrinth, remarkably well-organized for efficient olfaction.  The small size and intricate scrollwork of the ethmoturbinates in the olfactory part of the nose promote low-Reynolds-number (Re ~ 100) laminar airflow and provide a large surface area (210 cm2) for odorant deposition, while the overall location and configuration of the sensory region is shown to be critical to odorant transport.  Specifically, the relegation of olfaction to an \u201colfactory recess,\u201d in the rear of the nasal cavity and off the main respiratory passage, produces a unique olfactory airflow pattern during sniffing.  The CFD model reveals that the internal aerodynamics involves unidirectional flow through the olfactory recess during inspiration, but this flow ceases during the expiratory phase of sniffing.  Further numerical calculations of vapor transport in the mucus-lined olfactory region demonstrate that this novel olfactory airflow pattern provides a crucial residence time for the deposition of moderately-soluble and volatile odorants.  It also promotes spatiotemporal fractionation of odorant mixtures along the olfactory epithelium, leading to a unique, chemically-dependent molecular flux signature at olfactory receptor sites.  \nThus, the aerodynamics and transport phenomena of canine olfaction are shown to be highly optimized for odorant reception and olfactory discrimination.  The olfactory acuity of the dog appears to depend inherently upon this nasal airway architecture and the manner in which odorants are transported within the nasal cavity.\nThe improved understanding of canine olfactory aerodynamics and transport phenomena obtained here conveys several important biomimetic design principles for developers of synthetic olfaction devices meant to sample and sense chemical traces in the air.\n", "semester_ssi": "", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [607], "author_name_tesi": "Craven, Brent Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Craven", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Brent", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Stuart Settles", "Eric G Paterson", "Thomas Charles Baker", "Kendra V Sharp", "Savash Yavuzkurt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Stuart Settles, Committee Chair", "Eric G Paterson, Committee Chair", "Thomas Charles Baker, Committee Member", "Kendra V Sharp, Committee Member", "Savash Yavuzkurt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["olfaction", "canine", "nasal airway", "biofluids", "biomimcry", "artificial nose"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Testing Expression Effects of Language and Inhibition Within a Series of False Belief Tasks", "id": "6569", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4918", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The extent to which theory of mind task success depends on children\u2019s language and executive function skills is tested in this study.

The language component is modified by altering the phrasing of the theory of mind question such that a more simple language version is included in addition to the standard syntactically complex version.

Results from 28 children are reported, and main effects for the manipulation in both language and executive function were observed. Observed differences were in a direction opposite of what was expected, and these differences appeared unrelated to underlying cognitive skills. The results are interpreted in a context in which language plays a strong role in theory of mind success, possibly through working memory, and that subtle differences in theory of mind tasks can yield significantly different performances.

This study examined how educators in different professional roles at one elementary school with undocumented students in Northern California made sense of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity near school property, decided how to respond, and perceived the outcomes of their decisions. Accordingly, this study asked: 1.) How do educators make sense of laws or messages regarding ICE and school policy toward undocumented students?;  2.) How do educators who work with undocumented students perceive in whose best interests they will act when their school has experienced ICE activity; and 3.) How does educators\u2019 sensemaking of ICE activity on school property manifest itself in their decision making and in the outcomes of their decisions?

The conceptual framework used sensemaking theory to investigate educators\u2019 perceptions of ICE activity near school property and how they formulated a response. The framework also integrated the Best Interests of the Student model (Stefkovich, 2006) to reveal how educators made sense of their professional and personal responsibilities to make a decision in ethically complex circumstances.\n     The findings from the study demonstrate that schools can serve as both the physical and political grounds over undocumented immigrants\u2019 right to access social services.

Results indicated that followers reacted more negatively to errors that damaged their view of the leader as a person than errors that affected their ability to execute job tasks. Additionally, subordinate willingness to follow was found to act as a mediator of the relationship between error severity and the number of errors leaders committed over a career, indicating that leaders may alter their behavior in response to follower reactions to error.

The moderating effect of RSA on stress exposure was independent of parenting, highlighting individual differences in vulnerability to contexts of macro-risk factors like stressful life events, but not in contexts of micro-risk factors like the parent-child relationship. The main effect of parenting and lack of interaction with physiology suggests parenting is especially salient in this at-risk context.

Such seasonal and regional variability in PSBT resembles seasonal and regional variability found previously in diffusivities below the mixed layer. In particular, relatively large diffusivities during spring at KEO and Papa coincide with relatively large PSBT, and large diffusivities at KEO year-round relative to those at Papa are reflected in higher PSBT at KEO year-round. PSBT is also found to be enhanced during early to late fall at KEO and Papa, distinct from seasonal variability in diffusivities.

As product complexity increases, product development becomes more costly given the impact of complexity in the development time, manufacturing processes and development environment. The more complex the product, the more information will be needed and generated to develop it, and a longer development time is expected. The demands on manufacturing processes also increase with a greater number of manufacturing steps, components and interactions. The development environment is also impacted, in general, with a higher cost of patents. \nGreater implications of product complexity are observed in the development environment of highly regulated products. This is the case for medical devices that are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the Unites States, and hence medical devices are chosen as the focus. The FDA regulation requirements have a strong influence in the overall landscape of medical device development, with control over the development process, manufacturing and surveillance of medical devices in the market. \nDC issues cannot be addressed without the proper measures to understand and quantify complexity. The literature has paid particular attention to the complexity of products, systems and systems of systems. Complexity metrics have been developed for multiple applications that include the development of products, software, trajectory selection, electrical components and assemblies. Although many of these complexity metrics were developed to reduce product complexity, existing metrics are not necessarily easy to implement or appropriate for any scenario. Therefore, this research takes a step back to perform a comprehensive analysis on the implementation of selected DC metrics for medical devices. \nAssessing selected complexity metrics provides a better appraisal of complexity to reduce the development time and cost. As part of this implementation, existing metrics are first filtered to down-select from a much larger set using the following as criteria: 1) ease of use, 2) data requirements, 3) development stages impacted, and 4) overall applicability to medical devices. Three metrics were selected as per this filtering to assess the complexity of medical devices for a set of FDA cleared hip devices that are currently in the market. The impact of product complexity on the FDA\u2019s decision time of approval is also tested as assessed the three metrics chosen.\nThis research\u2019s findings show that current metrics are focused on different aspects of complexity, such as functions, components and their interactions. Supporting this, the statistical analysis of hip devices show few correlations between the complexity metrics found to be applicable for medical devices. Accordingly, a more standardized and generalized metrics should be developed to integrate all the complexity aspects in one measure. On the other hand, this research shows a relationship between product complexity and the development environment, where a combination of the complexity metrics explain FDA\u2019s decision time for similar devices with the same risk classification. Overall, product complexity metrics can aid medical device development to increase an understanding about the design and its implications in the development time, cost and environment. Furthermore, decreasing design complexity should be considered to make design upgrades easier, and reduce the development time and cost. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2954], "author_name_tesi": "Crespo-Varela, Josue R.", "last_name_ssi": "Crespo-Varela", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Josue", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gul Kremer", "Gul Kremer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gul Kremer, Thesis Advisor", "Gul Kremer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Design", "Medical Devices", "Complexity"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A BIOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF TRANSCRIPTION ELONGATION FACTORS THAT FACILITATE THE PROCESSIVITY OF RNA POLYMERASE II", "id": "3j333224f", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12717", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The processivity of RNA Polymerase II across the body of a gene is a complex and\ndynamic process that involves the contribution of many transcription elongation factors.\nThese elongation factors play a variety of roles including maintenance of RNAPII activity,\nmaintenance of chromatin, and regulation of chromatin structure.

Paleoecological and contemporary ecological and biogeographical investigations have contributed considerably to our understanding of vegetative adaptation to climate change over geologic time and today. Some of these investigations have pointed to intrinsic characteristics of the mountains that helped plant species adapt to change over geologic time scales. In this dissertation, the geography of Appalachian forests is reviewed (Chapter 1) and the role of topography in supporting migratory adaptation is explained, qualitatively and quantitatively (Chapter 2). Geographic factors supporting dispersal, establishment, and regeneration are combined and analyzed using a network approach to identify critical habitat pathways for plant migration (Chapter 3). Forest fire regimes under historical and future climate conditions are analyzed and vegetation and carbon storage effects are evaluated (Chapter 4). The preponderance of the evidence presented here support the conclusion that, at large spatial extents, long temporal scales, and high biotic levels, Appalachian forests are relatively resilient to the scope of stressors anticipated in the coming century, although interactions between stressors can not be ruled out (Chapter 5). The predicted degree of temperature and precipitation in this region will have very noticeable effects on species composition and ecosystem processes, but this research highlights aspects of the Appalachians that support adaptation to climatic change. The complex topography provides a high diversity of microclimates that can support biodiversity through global warming and with small investments in land conservation to improve connectivity natural migratory adaptation may be successful in many places. This research predicts an increase in wildfire frequency and extent, with a consequent decrease in severity. These shifts in fire regimes have the potential to lower carbon storage and change species dominance slowly by selecting more fire-adapted species.

This small flux necessitates the use of detectors with large collecting areas and excludes using satellite and balloon borne experiments which could detect cosmic rays directly. Instead, we must study the extensive air shower (EAS) caused by a primary cosmic ray as it traverses the atmosphere.\nWhen a cosmic ray enters the earth\u2019s atmosphere it interacts to produce pions. The pions continue to interact until the energy per particle falls below a critical threshold, roughly 2000 MeV. While the charged pions produce muons and neutrinos, the neutral pions produce electromagnetic cascades of electrons, positrons, and gamma rays. This collection of particles is known as an EAS.\nThe Pierre Auger Observatory was built to study these rare cosmic rays and answer fundamental questions about them, such as their origin and composition.\nLocated in Argentina, the Pierre Auger Observatory detects the EASs created by primary cosmic rays. Since the development of EASs is affected by the atmosphere,\nit is important to understand these effects so that we can more accurately reconstruct the events. An accurate determination of the primary cosmic ray energy\nleads to the ability to make more sensitive anisotropy studies, for example.\nTo this end, rate variations over annual and diurnal cycles are studied. We look at rate variations in comparison with atmospheric temperature and pressure. Using a modified Rayleigh analysis we show that the rate lags behind the temperature in both cases. A lag of 2 weeks is seen in the annual case; in the diurnal case a lag of 2 hours is visible. Both effects are seen at greater than a 3\u03c3 level using events with\nzenith angles less than 45 degrees. From the modified Rayleigh analysis, we also obtain coefficients which are used to normalize the atmospheric parameters to the\nrate. Since these coefficients measure the strength of the effect on the rate caused by that parameter, they can be used to remove the atmospheric effects. Using these atmospheric correction coefficients and phase lags, we correct the event energies. These corrections remove the spurious sinusoidal variations seen in the raw data. Redoing the analysis with the atmospheric corrected data, we find that the annual\nand diurnal rates are flat within uncertainties.\nThis improves the upper limits on cosmic ray anisotropy in right ascension. No evidence of anisotropy is found in either the first or second harmonic over 5 differential energy bins.

Quantitatively, using multivariate regression models, no statistical difference was found between the clustered and nonclustered students in their first semester grade point average or in their retention rates.  Qualitatively, differences did exist.  Students interviewed in a focus group settings offered varying opinions about their clustered experience.  Overall, clustered students reported being more active learners, gaining more academic skills, developing closer friendships with peers, establishing more meaningful relationships with faculty members, and participating more in campus life than the nonclustered students. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3139], "author_name_tesi": "Crissman, Jennifer Lynne", "last_name_ssi": "Crissman", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynne", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carol L Colbeck", "Robert M Hendrickson", "M Lee Upcraft", "Roger Lewis Geiger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carol L Colbeck, Committee Member", "Robert M Hendrickson, Committee Member", "M Lee Upcraft, Committee Chair", "Roger Lewis Geiger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Academic Achievement", "Retention", "Freshman Seminars", "Clustering"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Inquiry in Conversation: Exploring the Multiple Solution Pathway (MSP) Lesson Structure as a Means to Progressive Discourse in the Science Classroom\n\n", "id": "10086", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "610", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This exploratory, descriptive study examined the way five chemistry teachers from four different schools enacted their visions of an activity labeled as the multiple solution pathway (MSP) lesson structure \u2013 one in which students were given a relevant problem to solve and the opportunity to propose and explore several solutions to the problem.  A theoretical and analytical framework for characterizing what transpired within these enactments was developed mainly out of Bereiter\u2019s principle of progressive discourse and its accompanying commitments, but also by drawing on Peirce\u2019s fallibilist epistemology, Gal\u2019perin\u2019s notion of the orienting basis of an action, and Davydov\u2019s distinction between empirical and theoretical generalizations.  Data from utterance-level discourse analysis of the videotaped lessons, supplemented by pre- and post-lesson interviews with both students and teachers was used to answer the research question: What is the nature of the interactions that occur during Multiple Solution Pathway (MSP) lessons and how are those interactions related to the structure of activity and the way in which ideas are explored within those lessons?  The data showed that there were two general structures of activity utilized by the five teachers and that these different structures impacted the extent to which two of the progressive discourse commitments (expansion and openness) were supported.  It also indicated that the teachers likely operated off a \u2018teacher as evaluator\u2019 metaphor and a discrepant event vision of the way the lesson should unfold, both features of which limited the extent to which progressive discourse was maintained in these lessons.

One way to achieve this is through the use of bistable mechanisms. The goal in this research is to investigate the feasibility and design of a compliant bistable mechanism that is actuated by magneto active elastomer (MAE) material. The MAE material has magnetic particles embedded in the material that are aligned during the curing process. When exposed to an external field, the material deforms to align the embedded particles with the field.\nFirst, the actuation of the MAE material through finite element analysis (FEA) models was investigated. This helps predict the magnetic field required to snap the device from its first stable position to its second for various geometries and field strengths. The FEA model also predicts the displacement of the center of the mechanism as it moves from one position to the other to determine if the device is in fact bistable. These results are validated using experimental models and demonstrate the functionality of active materials to be used as actuators for such devices and applications of origami engineering.\nNext, parametric studies using the FEA model are performed to visualize the tradeoffs between various design parameters. These results help show the relationship between the substrate properties and the bistability of the device. With this information, it is possible to select design parameters based on the desired arch displacement or allowable field strength for a specific task.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9927], "author_name_tesi": "Crivaro, Adrienne Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Crivaro", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Adrienne", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker", "Timothy William Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["origami", "active material", "bistable mechanism"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Fast Skeletonization of Blood Vessels", "id": "16060", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The study of the morphological and rheological behaviors of intramural vessels plays a critical role in various clinical applications such as surgical planning and radiotherapy. To better understand the rheological behavior of vascular structures in relation to the network morphology, we must obtain the concrete measurements of the morphometric parameters of the vascular networks under various conditions. Morphometric parameters of the networks include vessel diameter, branching points, branch end points, branch length, and branching angles. Because of the complexity of blood vessel morphology, however, it is difficult to obtain accurate measurements. In this thesis, we present a novel and efficient method for skeletonization of intramural vessel networks. The proposed method automatically skeletonizes the vascular network in a given image and constructs a graph structure that represents the branching structures of the network. Since the method processes a given image as a whole, the multiple vascular networks present in the image are automatically detected and skeletonized simultaneously. Moreover, since the skeletons are represented as graph structures, various morphometric parameters can be obtained automatically. We present the promising results of the proposed method applied to the complex structure of retinal vessel networks.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3], "author_name_tesi": "Croasmun, Aaron Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Croasmun", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Aaron", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sukmoon Chang", "Thang Nguyen Bui", "Linda Marie Null", "Jeremy Joseph Blum", "Omar A El Ariss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sukmoon Chang, Thesis Advisor", "Thang Nguyen Bui, Thesis Advisor", "Linda Marie Null, Thesis Advisor", "Jeremy Joseph Blum, Thesis Advisor", "Omar A El Ariss, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["skeletonization", "vascular network"]}]
