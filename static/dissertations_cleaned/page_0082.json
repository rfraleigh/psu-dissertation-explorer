Teachers identified five first grade students at-risk for reading failure to participate in the research.  The five students were identified by being in the lowest placement within the reading curriculum.  Four students were provided with FBPC three to five times a week for a total of 30 sessions.  After each session students were given novel decodable reading passages and timed for one minute.  In addition, students were given weekly curriculum-based measures (CBM) grade-level reading probes.  Overall, students demonstrated an increase in oral reading fluency, as measured by one minute passage reading, after the introduction of FBPC with early reading skills, demonstrating an experimental effect for teaching early reading skills to oral reading fluency.  Students on average increased words read correctly per minute by 62-108% and decreased words read incorrectly per minute by 40-66% from baseline measures.  Additionally, students decreased error celertation and made modest gains with correct accel data.

To date predictors of nephrotoxicity remain unclear. Data in regard to long treatment courses are very sparse. \nIn this study we aim to better estimate the incidence and evaluate predictors of vancomycin associated nephrotoxicty in a cohort of patients predominated by long treatment courses.\nWe conducted a retrospective study on patients who were treated with vancomycin by a tertiary center in Mid-Pennsylvania between 01/01/2007 and 07/31/2012. We included adult patients, 18 years of age and older, who are not on dialysis and had a creatinine value below 2 mg/dl both on admission and when vancomycin was started. We identified those who developed nephrotoxicty based on an increase in the serum creatinine level by 0.5 mg/dL or 50% from baseline on at least two consecutive readings while on vancomycin. We then compared the two groups in regards to vancomycin dosing, trough levels, baseline creatinine, underlying infection, residence in critical care unit, co morbid conditions, concurrent nephrotoxic treatments, and baseline characteristics.\nDuring the study period 579 patients were included. Of those 154 (26.6%) met the definition of nephrotoxicity. 64 patients (11.1%) met the definition after 14 days of treatment. Though initial trough level (mg/dl) was significantly associated with nephrotoxicity on the bivariate analysis, this effect wasn\u2019t as strong after adjusting for other variables. We found that residence in the intensive care unit, concurrent use of loop diuretics, and co-morbidity with liver cirrhosis are independent risk factors for vancomycin associated nephrotoxicity. We also found that higher baseline creatinine value has protective effects against the development of nephrotoxicity (using a cutoff point of 0.8mg/dl OR, 0.40; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.66; P = 0.0003). \nVancomycin associated nephrotoxicity is not an uncommon outcome in both short and long treatment courses. Intensive care unit need while on treatment, concurrent treatment with loop diuretic, underlying diagnosis with liver cirrhosis, and the initial trough level seem to be the main risk factors for nephrotoxicity. On the contrary, elevated baseline creatinine seemed to be protective. This observation could be due to the lack of mechanisms responsible for the development of nephrotoxicity in abnormal kidneys. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8513], "author_name_tesi": "Moh'd, Hamzah ", "last_name_ssi": "Moh'd", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hamzah", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lan Kong", "Ping Du", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lan Kong, Thesis Advisor", "Ping Du, Thesis Advisor", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["vancomycin", "nephrotoxicity", "creatinine"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "NEUROBEHAVIORAL SEQUELAE OF \nEARLY IRON DEFICIENCY IN RATS\n\n\n", "id": "12210", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6532", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is no doubt that iron is vital for proper neuronal functioning and development. Nonetheless, the effects of iron deficiency on neurological systems have not yet been thoroughly studied.  A number of investigators have shown that in humans, the most salient deleterious effect of iron deficiency (ID) early in life is persistent cognitive impairment. Others have shown that early ID may cause impairment of dopamine (DA) metabolism including DA clearance, transporter density, and dopamine receptor (D1 and D2) densities. The present studies were conducted to investigate the relationship between iron deficiency early in life and cognitive functions especially attention and to elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms using an animal model. Through the use of the attention set shift paradigm we have demonstrated several novel findings regarding iron deficiency and attention in rats as well as extended our knowledge regarding the possible underlying neurobiological mechanisms and possible therapeutic strategies.\nThe first aim was designed to probe the interaction between early iron deficiency, during the critical window of dopamine system differentiation (PND4-PND21) and the attentional performance and stimulus control in rats. Using Attention Set Shift Testing we found that rats that were iron deficient at postnatal day-4 (PND4) to weaning (PND21) had major attention problems including sustained, selective and divided attention at the age of 45 days. These findings support our hypothesis that in rats, early ID impairs their performance on an attention-related task, an effect that also persists into adolescence and beyond in humans. These results may lead to the development of successful treatment strategies for persistent cognitive dysfunction in children and youths who suffered from ID early in infancy. \nThe second aim focused on the possibility of reversing the above effects induced by early iron deficiency using methylphenidate. We observed that methylphenidate treatment at 50 days old improved the performance of ID animals, especially on the easier tasks and at lower doses compared to control animals. This has potential ramifications in finding a successful treatment of persistent cognitive dysfunction characteristic of children and youths who suffered from ID early in infancy.\nThe third aim was designed to examine the effects of early ID on the catecholaminergic system. Therefore, we examined dopamine and norepinephrine transporter densities within certain brain areas related to attention using radioactive ligand binding technique. Our results revealed a significant age effect on DAT levels in the nucleus accumbens (NA), olfactory tubercle (OT), and substantia nigra (SN) but not in the striatum. Specifically, 21-day-old rats had greater DAT levels compared to 45-day-old rats in the NA, OT, and SN as well as in the OT compared to 75-day-old rats. Additionally, there is a significant age difference on NET levels in the dentate gyrus but not in the frontal cortex or the locus coeruleus. Specifically, NET levels were increased among 45-day-old rats compared to 75-day-old rats. However, there is no main effect for diet and no diet-age interactions on DAT and NET levels.\nOverall, this work led to several novel contributions regarding the impact of iron deficiency on cognitive function. These findings are very important as they elucidate the impact of iron deficiency on catecholaminergic systems in the brain. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6531], "author_name_tesi": "Mohamed, Wael Mohamed Yousef", "last_name_ssi": "Mohamed", "middle_name_ssi": "Mohamed Yousef", "first_name_ssi": "Wael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Byron C Jones", "Byron C Jones", "David John Vandenbergh", "Laura Klein", "Rick Owen Gilmore", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli", "Erica L Unger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Byron C Jones, Dissertation Advisor", "Byron C Jones, Committee Chair", "David John Vandenbergh, Committee Member", "Laura Klein, Committee Member", "Rick Owen Gilmore, Committee Member", "Sonia Angele Cavigelli, Committee Member", "Erica L Unger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Neurobehavioral", "Iron deficiency anemia", "Attention set shift", "Methylphenidate", "Ligand binding", "Rats", "Attention"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Becoming teachers of English-language learners in two multicultural countries: narratives from preservice teachers in the United States and Malaysia\n\n", "id": "15421", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7809", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study explores the experience of becoming English teachers in two multicultural countries through narratives from preservice teachers in the United States and Malaysia.

Most contemporary research on the topic has focused on immigration and hybridity. My dissertation, by contrast, explores exile as experienced by individuals, who voluntarily or involuntarily left their homelands because of political, social, and cultural upheavals and dilemmas. I read exile as a complex and contradictory term: it involves not only feelings of nostalgia and painstaking loss, but moments of enrichment and empowerment as well. \nEach of my chapters depicts the protagonists\u2019 negotiation of exilic experience in the twentieth century, as well as the effects this has on their understanding of time, space, language, culture, and the nation. Furthermore, I analyze how these protagonists\u2019 experiences overlap with or differ from the other fictional characters who experience exile. I argue that the exilic vision of \u00d6ren, \u015eenocak, Al-Mozany, and Soudah instill them with a plurality of vision, which makes them question one-dimensional interpretations of ethnic, religious, and national affiliations. By drawing analogies between the national imagination in Germany and their own countries, these authors and their protagonists form transnational historical connections and enable new imaginary spaces of cosmopolitan existence.  To the best of my knowledge, mine is the first study to bring into dialogue German writers of Turkish and Arab origin, who share the historical heritage of the Ottoman Empire, and who confront similar stereotypes and prejudices related to Islam and the Middle East. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7710], "author_name_tesi": "Mohammad, Yasemin ", "last_name_ssi": "Mohammad", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yasemin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Martina Kolb", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Reiko Tachibana", "Ursula Bettina Brandt", "Jonathan Eugene Brockopp"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Dissertation Advisor", "Martina Kolb, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Chair", "Reiko Tachibana, Committee Member", "Ursula Bettina Brandt, Committee Member", "Jonathan Eugene Brockopp, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Turkish-German Literature", "Arab-German Literature", "Exile Literature", "German Immigration Literature"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Novice Career and Technical Education teachers' participation in professional development in the United States", "id": "gm80hv33v", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12846", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to identify the status (focal areas, intensity, and usefulness) of novice Career and Technical Education (CTE) teacher participation in professional development compared to novice teachers from other subject matter areas.

However, oil and gas production from these types of hydrocarbon resources is not as easy as producing from the conventional resources because of the complex geological features and lack of new technologies. Soft computing techniques such as artificial neural networks provide new approach as that can be used in the characterization of the complex unconventional reservoirs. In this study, artificial expert systems were developed with the purpose of characterizing an unconventional oil reservoir located in West Texas. These expert systems are capable of generating synthetic well logs, completion parameters, production profiles and performing the task of payzone identification. This study focuses on the generation of synthetic well logs and the identification of payzones using artificial expert systems. Synthetic well log prediction module is divided into low-resolution and high-resolution categories where five different well logs are predicted at desired reservoir locations. While low-resolution well logs are predicted using the averaged seismic data, the high-resolution well logs are predicted using detailed 3D seismic data. Training of the networks to predict high-resolution well logs is found to be more successful than that of low-resolution well logs. Predicted synthetic well logs are then used to predict completion data, production profiles and payzone identification.\nThe second module of this research involves payzone identification in which the gross thickness of the reservoir is ranked based on its productivity level. Payzone identification is achieved through the implementation of artificial expert systems developed to predict well performance (i.e. oil, water, and gas production profiles). Using a moving-window approach to sample seismic and well log data along the well depth and by feeding the sampled information to the well performance network, it is possible to predict the productivity of each sampled segment. Another outcome of the payzone identification study is the possibility of scrutinizing the relationship between well log parameters and expected productions. A Fuzzy classification method is used to classify production data in terms of lithology logs. One of the outcomes of this classification is the realization that oil production is expected to be higher in shaly segments of the well than that of carbonate segments.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [518], "author_name_tesi": "Mohammad Nejad Gharehlo, Amir ", "last_name_ssi": "Mohammad Nejad Gharehlo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amir", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Luis Ayala", "Turgay Ertekin", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Antonio Nieto", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Luis Ayala, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Chair", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Member", "Antonio Nieto, Committee Member", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neural networks", "ann", "Reservoir Characterization", "well logs", "seismic", "payzone identification", "payzone", "net pay", "Wolfcamp"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Retrofitting Healthcare Facilities to Enhance Patient Safety and Energy Efficiency", "id": "22851", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10250", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is an increasing focus on measures to enhance patient safety within the environment of care. Unfortunately, many existing facilities are unable to address this and often struggle to cope with increasingly stringent standards for patient safety due to the fact that they are aging buildings. Under the current economic conditions, it is not feasible to contemplate the replacement of the large number of aging healthcare facilities across the country. A more realistic option is to retrofit these facilities in such a way that they meet both current requirements and foreseeable future needs. In doing this, it would be prudent to integrate into the retrofit project measures to improve the energy efficiency of the facility, as this could result in considerable savings. Retrofitting a healthcare facility poses considerable challenges, particularly with regard to maintaining healthcare delivery operations and keeping patients safe. \nThe aim of this study is to investigate mechanisms for retrofitting healthcare facilities such that patient safety and energy efficiency are simultaneously enhanced. In order to achieve this aim and the associated objectives, this research followed a systematic approach to investigate the issues involved in retrofitting healthcare facilities. An extensive literature review was conducted to identify the current state of the related research and the knowledge gaps in achieving the dual objectives of patient safety and energy efficiency in healthcare facilities retrofit projects. Three case studies were conducted and data collected via interviews, shadowing, site visits, and cognitive walk throughs. Direct observation and experience of retrofit projects was also undertaken to acquire first-hand knowledge of the retrofit process, analyze data, and to explore possible solutions to the problems associated with current practices.\nSubsequently, an innovative integrated framework, the Patient Saftey and Energie Efficiency (PATSiE) Framework, was developed to simultaneously enhance patient safety and energy efficiency. The key features of the PATSiE include a step by step procedure for enhancing patient safety and energy efficiency, and the elimination of rework with a better understanding of patient safety and energy efficiency integration. A process model that guides retrofit project teams in adequately considering the critical issues in healthcare facilities retrofit has also been developed using the IDEF 0 modeling method. This provides a structured overview of the different stages involved in retrofitting healthcare facilities and improves understanding of the intricacies associated with integrating patient safety improvements with energy efficiency enhancements. Evaluation of the PATSiE was conducted through focus groups with the key stakeholders in the case study healthcare facilities. The feedback from these stakeholders was generally positive as they considered the PATSiE useful and applicable to retrofit projects in the healthcare industry.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9933], "author_name_tesi": "Mohammadpour, Atefeh ", "last_name_ssi": "Mohammadpour", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Atefeh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba", "John Messner", "James Freihaut", "Dennis G Shea"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba, Dissertation Advisor", "John Messner, Committee Chair", "James Freihaut, Committee Member", "Dennis G Shea, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Healthcare Facilities Retrofit", "Patient Safety", "Energy Efficiency", "PATSiE Framework"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Convex Approximation of Chance Constrained Optimization Problems: Application in System and Control", "id": "13313aim5346", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13313", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation concentrates on chance constrained optimization problems and their application in systems and control area. In \u201cchance optimization\u201d problems, we aim at maximizing the probability of a set defined by polynomial inequalities involving decision and uncertain parameters. These problems are, in general, nonconvex and computationally hard. With the objective of developing systematic numerical procedures to solve such problems, a sequence of convex relaxations based on the theory of measures and moments is provided, whose sequence of optimal values is shown to converge to the optimal value\nof the original problem. Indeed, we provide a sequence of semidefinite programs of increasing dimension\nwhich can arbitrarily approximate the solution of the original problem. In addition, we apply obtained results on chance optimization problems to challenging problems in the area of systems, control and data science.\nWe consider the problem of probabilistic control of uncertain systems to ensure that the probability of defined failure/success is minimized/maximized. In particular, we consider the probabilistic robust control and chance constrained model predictive control problems. We also use the obtained results to analysis of stochastic and deterministic systems. More precisely, we address the problem of uncertainty set propagation and computing invariant robust set for uncertain systems and problem of computing region of attraction set for deterministic systems. In the problem of uncertainty propagation, we propagate the set of initial sets through uncertain dynamical systems and find the uncertainty set of states of the system for given time step. In the problem of region of attraction and invariant robust set, we aim at finding the largest set of all initial states whose trajectories converge to the origin.

The development of a reliable modeling tool entails knowledge of measured thermo-mechanical properties such as viscosity and viscous Poisson\u00a1\u00a6s ratio. To measure the viscosity of densifying materials as a function of both porosity and temperature, isothermal cyclic loading dilatometry (ICLD) is proposed as a convenient technique. We demonstrate its merit relative to constant load techniques in minimizing the stress history effects (changes in shrinkage anisotropy and sample microstructure) that arise due to the application of an external load. A constant load test overestimates the viscosity by an order of magnitude compared to a cyclic load test. To obtain accurate viscosity data, maximum loading rates and longer unloading periods are desirable as they reduce effects of shrinkage anisotropy on viscosity values. \nA novel technique, based on the concept of pressureless constrained sintering and the viscous analogy, for determining the viscous Poisson\u00a1\u00a6s ratio of sintering materials is proposed. The method involves measuring the sintering rate of a free-sintered specimen, and a specimen constrained by two non-sintering layers. The viscous Poisson\u00a1\u00a6s ratio varied from 0.25 at ~ 74% density to about 0.45 at ~ 93%, which agreed well with model predictions. The method applies only during the intermediate stage of densification, because the material is viscous during this period of sintering.  \nThe uniaxial viscosity data of three commercial LTCC systems i.e. DuPont 951Tape (DU), Heraeus CT2000 (CT), and Ferro A6 (FE) were measured by cyclic loading dilatometry. The viscosity initially decreases with temperature, changes little during the intermediate stage and increases towards the end of densification. The viscosity increased sharply beyond the onset of crystallization. At slower heating rates, the viscosity increased at lower temperature, because of densification and crystallization. The isothermal viscosity data range from 0.1 to 100 GPa.s between 73% and 95% density. Ceramic particle-filled glasses, DU and CT systems showed a higher isothermal viscosity compared to pure glass system i.e FE. From master viscosity curves based on isothermal data, the activation energies for viscous flow were ~375 \u201eb 30 kJ/mol, 450 \u201eb 10 kJ/mol for DU and FE, respectively. These energies were comparable to values obtained from the master sintering curve approach. \nPredicting the sintering viscosity accurately is key to developing reliable sintering models. A theoretical understanding for the observed viscosity of LTCC materials, and a framework for predicting the evolution of their viscous behavior during sintering was developed. The complex viscosity of these materials is affected by a host of interdependent factors such as the base glass composition, temperature, porosity, particle size and distribution, contact area, volume fraction of filler particles, phase separation, crystallization and heating rate. A model based on the simplifying assumption that these variables are mutually exclusive is presented. The model predictions were in reasonable agreement with measured data.\nThe concept of constrained sintering has attracted a lot of attention as it offers the advantages of tight dimensional tolerances and minimal distortion. The effect of an external constraint (uniaxial compression and pressure-less constraint) on the microstructure, density and shrinkage anisotropy during the sintering of CT and DU were studied. The difference in the viscous behavior of the two materials led to significantly different microstructures, density and shrinkage anisotropy. The shrinkage anisotropy constant of DU was significantly higher than that of CT and non-linear under uniaxial compression. A combination of higher viscosity, lower viscous Poisson\u00a1\u00a6s ratio, and higher constraining stresses led to lower densities for CT compared to DU. The maximum tensile stress due to a pressure-less constraint, assuming the viscous model, was in the range of  \u0192\u00ee10-100 kPa. The calculated uniaxial compressive stress required for zero radial shrinkage in the perpendicular plane was in the range of \u0192\u00ee10 \u00a1V 180 kPa. \nTo evaluate the shrinkage compatibility of different components and validate the measured thermo-mechanical properties, we used in-situ observations of curvature during co-sintering of bilayers of materials including LTCC, silver and alumina, and the bilayer strip model.  There was good agreement between the measured viscosity data and model predictions. The rate of curvature follows the differential sintering kinetics between the two layers and is modulated by changes in their viscosity. The viscosities were used to calculate viscous stresses in the bilayers. For silver-LTCC bilayer, the maximum tensile stress in the silver and LTCC layers are \u0192\u00ee100 kPa and 25 kPa, respectively. The bilayer strip model provides useful guidelines for designing co-fired systems. For a given differential sintering rate, the model predicts maximum warpage for m2n=1, where m and n are the relative thickness and viscosity, respectively. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [416], "author_name_tesi": "Mohanram, Aravind ", "last_name_ssi": "Mohanram", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aravind", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Lynn Messing", "David John Green", "Carlo G Pantano", "Cliva A Randall", "Mike T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Chair", "David John Green, Committee Chair", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member", "Cliva A Randall, Committee Member", "Mike T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["LTCC", "Cosintering", "Viscosity"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Theoretical and experimental study of inverted annular film boiling and regime transition during reflood transients", "id": "27347", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11901", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) is a design basis accident for light water reactors that usually determines the limits on core power. During a LOCA, film boiling is the dominant mode of heat transfer prior to the quenching of the fuel rods. The study of film boiling is important because this mode of heat transfer determines if the core can be safely cooled. One important film boiling regime is the so-called Inverted Annular Film Boiling (IAFB) regime which is characterized by a liquid core downstream of the quench front enveloped by a vapor film separating it from the fuel rod. Much research have been conducted for IAFB, but these studies have been limited to steady state experiments in single tubes.\nIn the present work, subcooled and saturated IAFB are investigated using high temperature reflood data from the experiments carried out in the Rod Bundle Heat Transfer (RBHT) test facility. Parametric effects of system parameters including the pressure, inlet subcooling, and flooding rate on the heat transfer are investigated.  The heat transfer behavior during transition to Inverted Slug Film Boiling (ISFB) regime is studied and is found to be different than that reported in previous studies. The effects of spacer grids on heat transfer in the IAFB and ISFB regimes are also presented. Currently design basis accidents are evaluated with codes in which heat transfer and wall drag must be calculated with local flow parameters. The existing models for heat transfer are applicable up to a void fraction of 0.6, i.e. in the IAFB regime and there is no heat transfer correlation for ISFB. A new semi-empirical heat transfer model is developed covering the IAFB and ISFB regimes which is valid for a void fraction up to 90% using the local flow variables. The mean absolute percentage error in predicting the RBHT data is 11% and root mean square error is 15%. This new semi-empirical model is found to compare well with the reflood data of FLECHT-SEASET experiments as well as data from single tube experiments. The root mean square error in predicting the FLECHT-SEASET data is 20% whereas for single tube data it is 12%.\nIn previous studies, the transition criterion from the IAFB to the ISFB regime is purely empirical. In this work, a theoretical stability analysis of a liquid jet co-flowing with its vapor in a tube is carried out to seek a better understanding of the underlying physics of the regime transition. The effect of heat and mass transfer at the interface is included in the stability analysis. Also, the effect of viscous force is included in the stability analysis, by employing the viscous potential flow method. The wavelength that is responsible for breakup of the liquid core in IAFB is predicted in the present analysis and is compared with the adiabatic experiments of IAFB from the literature. The effects of various controlling parameters including the relative Weber number, vapor Reynolds number, velocity ratio, density ratio and viscosity ratio of vapor and liquid are studied to understand the physics of transition. Finally a physics-based heat transfer model is proposed for heat transfer in the ISFB regime using the wavelength obtained from the stability analysis.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11354], "author_name_tesi": "Mohanta, Lokanath ", "last_name_ssi": "Mohanta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lokanath", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Cengiz Camci", "Timothy Francis Miller", "Stephen M Bajorek"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung, Dissertation Advisor", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Chair", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Member", "Timothy Francis Miller, Committee Member", "Stephen M Bajorek, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Two-phase heat transfer", "Subcooled flow film boiling", "Regime Transition", "Rod bundle", "Spacer Grid", "Stability of Co-axial jets"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Design of reagents for trace-level chemical detection and signal amplification", "id": "22902", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10501", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Current state-of-the-art diagnostic tests are designed to perform well in laboratory settings, where clean water, continuous electric supply, chemical reagents, highly engineered equipment, and trained personnel are available.

Due to their promising physical and chemical characteristics, these byproducts can be beneficially used as supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) in portland cement concrete, mining applications, structural fills, and soil and waste stabilization. However, the efficiency and environmental impacts of such beneficial uses need to be further evaluated and enhanced. The unburned carbon (UC) content of fly ash impacts the performance (e.g., air entrainment and rheology) of concrete mixtures. The conventional loss on ignition (LOI) test to measure the UC may be overestimating as the weight change upon igniting fly ash could be the result of other physical and chemical reactions (e.g., calcination of carbonates, removal of bound water, and iron and sulfur oxidation) in addition to organic carbon burning. Moreover, reclamation of mine sites using coal ash has been shown to potentially alleviate the negative effects of mining activities such as neutralizing the acid mine drainage. However, during coal combustion process, trace elements are concentrated onto fly ash particles, and the long-term leaching of harmful elements from coal ash to subsurface aquifers is an environmental concern. This research studies focuses on evaluating and enhancing the beneficial uses of fly ash (as the predominant coal combustion byproduct) in two areas: 1- in  portland cement concrete through measuring the UC content, and 2- in mine site reclamation through evaluating the leaching behavior of fly ash deposits to water resources in short and long terms. \nIn the first part of this research study, a two-atmosphere thermogravimetric analysis (2A-TGA) coupled with mass spectrometry was performed to evaluate the chemical reactions that occur upon heating of fly ash and to measure the true UC content. 2A-TGA was performed under two distinct atmospheres: (i) in non-oxidizing helium gas, to measure weight loss due to decomposition of carbonates and loss of bound water, and (ii) in oxidizing air, to measure weight loss due to conversion of UC to CO2. The results were also compared with the total carbon (TC) measured using infrared spectroscopy. It was found that there is no one-to-one relationship between the LOI and the TC or UC contents of fly ash. LOI overestimated TC by up to 2.5\uf0b4 and overestimated UC by up to 6.4\uf0b4. Based on the results of this study, a practical alternative to 2A-TGA could be to heat fly ash in a non-oxidizing atmosphere (e.g., vacuum, He- or N2-purged furnace) up to 750 oC, followed by a conventional LOI test.\n\tIn the second part of this study, leaching behavior of fly ash deposits was evaluated through (i) defining the host phases for environmentally important elements and (ii) developing a reactive transport model to predict the long-term leaching behavior. Determining the host phases was achieved through micro-characterizing the coal ash and flow-through column leaching tests. It was found that amorphous aluminosilicate is the main host phase for Si, Al, Fe, and, Mg. Alkalis such as Na, K, and trace elements including As and Se are also distributed in the bulk Al-Si glass in low concentrations.  The Initially high concentrations of Ca and S in the leachate were mainly due to the dissolution of gypsum. Surface associated salts (e.g., sulfate and borate salts) dissolve Na, K, S, and B ions at early stages of leaching. Iron was found both as ferromagnetic particles containing magnetite and hematite, and also included in the amorphous phase in lower amounts. The host phases were then considered as input data for a quantitative reactive transport 1D model using CrunchFlow code. The calibrated model was used to predict the concentration of major elements (Ca, S, Si, Al, Fe, Na, K, Mg), and trace elements (As, Mo, Se, B) along 10 years of leaching. The leachate composition at early ages of leaching might exceed the environmental limits for S, B, Mo, and Al. However, in long-term the overall composition meets the leaching limits except for aluminum content. The porosity of compacted fly ash starts to increase from the top layers, and in long-term (e.g., 30 years of weathering) it reached from 28% to 45%, which can significantly affect the stability and transport properties.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15075], "author_name_tesi": "Mohebbi, Mina ", "last_name_ssi": "Mohebbi", "first_name_ssi": "Mina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farshad Rajabipour", "Farshad Rajabipour", "Li Li", "Ming Xiao", "Aly Marei Said"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farshad Rajabipour, Dissertation Advisor", "Farshad Rajabipour, Committee Chair", "Li Li, Committee Member", "Ming Xiao, Committee Member", "Aly Marei Said, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fly ash", "mine reclamation", "concrete", "organic carbon", "long-term leaching", "reactive transport modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A homeowner assessment tool supporting home energy audits", "id": "14601", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7258", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The growth in residential energy consumption is an increasing problem in the U.S. from both environmental and economic standpoints.

David Simon\u2019s HBO series The Wire, for example, has been lauded for its similarities to Dickens\u2019s multilayered and realist vision of London.\nUnfortunately, these commentaries usually fail to acknowledge developments in contemporary U.S. urban fiction, perhaps in no small degree because much of this fiction explores the experiences of people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. Ethics and Urban Realities challenges general assumptions about the state of U.S. urban fiction\nimplied in commentaries on The Wire and made more overt in essays such as Tom Wolfe\u2019s \u201cStalking the Billion-Footed Beast: A Literary Manifesto for the New Social Novel\u201d in which Wolfe blames poststructuralism for the supposed death of the urban novel. These faulty assumptions suggest why, despite the renewed \u201cethical turn\u201d in\nliterary studies, literary criticism has not engaged satisfactorily with the ethical\nframeworks of recent U.S. urban fiction. \n\nI argue that contemporary U.S. urban fiction is deeply invested in the ethics of urban life. Novels by Thomas Pynchon, Walter Mosley, David Treuer, John Edgar Wideman, Karen Tei Yamashita, Ernesto Qui\u00f1onez, Don DeLillo, William Gibson, and Octavia Butler, among others, disrupt thinking about U.S. cities in terms of \u201ccrisis\u201d and \u201crenaissance.\u201d These two buzzwords pervade journalistic debates, historical writings, and popular representations of U.S. cities. Crisis discourse tends to frighten people about urban life, while the discourse of urban renaissance tends to make them complacent. Urban fiction puts needed pressure on these terms by showing how genuine crisis conditions affect lived experiences and how renaissance is conceptually and ethically limiting. My project, however, is not merely deconstructive and disruptive. It also assesses the ethical values that permeate U.S. urban fiction since 1984. These most prominently include commitments to what I term \"preemptive care,\" to inter-class and interracial contact, and to genuine creation in opposition to\nmindless consumption.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5735], "author_name_tesi": "Moiles, Sean ", "last_name_ssi": "Moiles", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sean", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathryn Hume", "Kathryn Hume", "Michael Francis Berube", "Aldon Lynn Nielsen", "Tina Chen Goudie", "John Philip Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathryn Hume, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathryn Hume, Committee Chair", "Michael Francis Berube, Committee Member", "Aldon Lynn Nielsen, Committee Member", "Tina Chen Goudie, Committee Member", "John Philip Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["urban renaissance", "urban crisis", "multi-ethnic literature of the United States", "ethics", "urban fiction", "contemporary American fiction"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A comparative genomic investigation of niche adaptation in fungi", "id": "18791", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9185", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Kingdom Fungi has a diverse array of members adapted to very disparate and the most hostile surroundings on earth: such as living plant and/or animal tissues, soil, aquatic environments, other microorganisms, dead animals, and exudates of plants, animals and even nuclear reactors. The ability of fungi to survive in these various niches is supported by the presence of key enzymes/proteins that can metabolize extraneous harmful factors. Characterization of the evolution of these key proteins gives us a glimpse at the molecular mechanisms underpinning adaptations in these organisms. Cytochrome P450 proteins (CYPs) are among the most diversified protein families, they are involved in a number of processed that are critical to fungi. I evaluated the evolution of Cytochrome P450 proteins (CYPs) in order to understand niche adaptation in fungi. Towards this goal, a previously developed database the fungal cytochrome P450 database (FCPD) was improved and several features were added in order to allow for systematic comparative genomic and phylogenomic analysis of CYPs from numerous fungal genomes. Specifically, an in-house platform was developed to standardize and improve the protein sequence clustering procedure, more than 100 fungal and non-fungal genomes were added, putative functional classification of CYPs into three broad categories was added, the CYP clan/family classification was extended to 117 CYP clans and 292 families. With these new features the FCPD 1.2 (http://p450.riceblast.snu.ac.kr/) was published with systematic classification of 22,940 CYPs from 213 species.\n\nUsing the CYP data from the FCPD 1.2 I carried out detailed phylogenomic analysis of 6108 CYPs belonging to 51 species from the subphylum Pezizomycotina. The analysis revealed CYPomes that were specific to the niches occupied by the different fungi. There was preferential presence of CYP families among pathogenic species. I introduced a putative functional diversification ratio to identify divergence of \u201cCYPomes\u201d, the ratio suggests that the non-pathogenic fungi tended to have comparatively more CYP families/clans compared to the pathogenic fungi. I also identified the CYP clans ancestral to Pezizomycotina fungi, the results confirm previously estimated ancestral CYP clans CYP51, CYP61 and add CYP52 and CYP58 to the set of clans present in the last common ancestor of Pezizomycotina fungi. Putative metabolic classification of CYPs in the group suggests increase in CYPs involved in secondary metabolism among fungal plant pathogens. I also carried out gene family evolution analysis with the CYP data, the analyses suggested high number of gains and losses among serious plant pathogens such as Magnaporthe oryzae and Fusarium spp.\n\nCalcium is a ubiquitous ion that plays a major role in myriad processes in \nthe fungal cell. I developed the fungal calcium-signaling database (FCSD: http://fcsd.ifungi.org/) in order to understand the roles of genes interacting directly or indirectly with calcium. The computational pipeline standardized in the FCPD was used to cluster the calcium signaling gene dataset. Comparative genomics analyses of calcium signaling genes indicated varying complexity of the calcium-signaling pathway across fungal phyla. I also carried out detailed gene family analysis of different calcium signaling genes, niche-specific gene gains were observed through this analysis. I believe that the various features built into FCSD encourage community participation and research on understanding calcium signaling in fungi.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9006], "author_name_tesi": "Moktali, Venkatesh Pralhad", "last_name_ssi": "Moktali", "middle_name_ssi": "Pralhad", "first_name_ssi": "Venkatesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seogchan Kang", "Cooduvalli S Shashikant", "David Michael Geiser", "Anton Nekrutenko", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Dr Yu Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seogchan Kang, Dissertation Advisor", "Cooduvalli S Shashikant, Committee Member", "David Michael Geiser, Committee Member", "Anton Nekrutenko, Committee Member", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Member", "Dr Yu Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cytochrome P450", "Fungi", "Evolution", "Calcium Signaling", "Biological Databases", "Adaptation", "Fungal Niches", "Secondary Metabolism"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Enhancing RNA catalysis through compartmentalization\n", "id": "10057", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5131", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Experimental models of cellular conditions are useful because they can be used to study cell processes in a controlled environment and because they can be used to model prebiotic conditions. The influence of macromolecular crowding and compartmentalization on the cleavage rates of bimolecular minimal hammerhead ribozymes was investigated using aqueous two-phase systems (ATPS) as a model of the cell cytoplasm. The ATPS consisted of poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG), dextran, 10 mM MgCl2 and buffer. The PEG-rich and dextran-rich phases of the ATPS segregate to create chemically distinct environments which cause differences in the local concentrations of RNA and provide a macromolecularly crowded environment similar to the cell cytoplasm. It was found that RNA concentrates to the dextran-rich phase of a PEG/dextran ATPS in a length-dependent manner and that long RNA sequences localize almost completely to the dextran-rich phase. It was also found that the local concentration of ribozyme in the dextran-rich phase of an ATPS could be controlled by changing the volume ratio of dextran-rich phase to PEG-rich phase. For most of the hammerhead ribozymes studied, increasing the local concentration of ribozyme also increased the observed rate of cleavage. There was a maximum of a 20-fold enhancement in the observed cleavage rate for 2 nM hammerhead ribozyme in a 250 \u00b5L ATPS with a 1:100 dextran to PEG-rich phase ratio compared to 2 nM hammerhead ribozyme in just dextran-rich phase.

PEG\u2013protein conjugates, so-called PEGylated proteins, can exhibit enhanced stability, half-life, and bioavailability.  One of the challenges in the commercial production of PEGylated proteins is the purification required to remove unreacted polymer, native protein, and in many cases PEGylated proteins with non-optimal degrees of conjugation.  The overall objective of this thesis was to examine the use of ultrafiltration for the purification of PEGylated proteins.  This included: (1) analysis of size-based separation of PEGylated proteins using conventional ultrafiltration membranes, (2) use of electrically-charged membranes to exploit differences in electrostatic interactions, and (3) examination of the effects of PEGylation on protein fouling.  The experimental results were analyzed using appropriate theoretical models, with the underlying physical properties of the PEGylated proteins evaluated using size exclusion chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, dynamic light scattering, and reverse phase chromatography.\n\nPEGylated proteins were produced by covalent attachment of activated PEG to a protein (alpha-lactalbumin, ovalbumin, or bovine serum albumin) via primary amines on the lysine residues. In contrast to the partition coefficient evaluated by size exclusion chromatography, the sieving coefficient of the PEGylated proteins in ultrafiltration depended upon both the number and size of the attached PEG chains due to the elongation or deformation of the PEG associated with the filtrate flux.  Transmission of PEGylated proteins through charged membranes was dramatically reduced at low ionic strength due to strong electrostatic interactions, despite the presence of the neutral PEG.  The results from small-scale ultrafiltration experiments were used to develop a two-stage diafiltration process to purify PEGylated alpha-lactalbumin.  This process provided a purification factor greater than 1000 with respect to the unreacted protein and greater than 20-fold with respect to the PEG with an overall yield of PEGylated alpha-lactalbumin of 78%.  These results provide the first demonstration of the potential of using ultrafiltration for the purification of protein-polymer conjugates.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2971], "author_name_tesi": "Molek, Jessica R.", "last_name_ssi": "Molek", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney", "Wayne Roger Curtis", "Darrell Velegol", "Erwin A Vogler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Wayne Roger Curtis, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["membrane transport", "capillary electrophoresis", "size exclusion chromatography", "PEGylation", "diafiltration", "ultrafiltration", "polyethylene glycol", "alpha-lactalbumin"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Computer Vision and Augmented Reality for Guiding Assembly", "id": "5942", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2875", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-10-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An Augmented Reality (AR) system that can enhance a user's view of the surrounding scene with annotations based on the scene content, has many potential applications.

The second, providing accurate and robust sensing to determine the state of the surrounding environment.\n\nWe utilize concepts from robot assembly planning to develop a systematic framework for presenting augmentation stimuli for the assembly domain. An interactive augmentation design and control engine called is described. The engine can be used for developing and visualizing multi-modal augmentation schemes for assembly, as well as controling information presentation in an Augmented Reality system. Its functionality is demonstrated with the help of specific scenarios where the goal is to create effective multi-modal augmentation displays for evaluating assembly.\n\nFor providing the appropriate augmentation stimulus at the right position and time, an AR system needs some sensor to interpret the surrounding scene. We take an incremental approach using computer vision to address the sensing problem. First, we develop real-time tracking of a marker-based coding scheme. The fiducials are placed on each assembly components to uniquely identify and track them. An experimental prototype system is described, which implements computer vision algorithms for real-time marker-based tracking.\n\nEven though fiducials offer relative simplicity and flexibility, the problems of occlusion by the manipulator as well as other assembly parts make the use of more general computer vision techniques\ndesirable. A domain specific problem is the changing shape and appearance of assembly objects as they are connected together. A combination of concepts from robotics assembly planning, model- based object recognition, and image feature classification is used to develop an object recognition scheme in the context of parts being assembled together by a human. Problems in the assembly domain include changing shape and appearance of objects as they are connected together, as well as high occlusion by the manipulator and other objects.

As it sought to understand adult learning about race among participants for whom religion and spirituality were important concerns, this study employed three theoretical perspectives: transformative learning theory, intergroup contact theory, and faith development theory.\nIn the Spring of 1960, graduate theological students at Union Theological Seminary in New York, with its long history of social activism, formed the Student Interracial Ministry (SIM), as a response to the national phase of the African American lunch counter sit-in movement, which began in February 1960. From a pilot project of four students in the summer of 1960, SIM grew into an ecumenical program, drawing a total of 234 students from some 50 protestant seminaries, lasting from 1960 to1968. This interracial program placed white students to live and work in African American churches/communities in the South, and African American seminarians to live and work in white churches/communities in the North, Midwest, and West, serving as assistant pastors for entire summers or full-year internships. It also sent students to work in direct action civil rights organizations, with the largest site being the Southwest Georgia Project led by Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) leader Charles Sherrod.\nIn-depth oral history interviews were conducted with twelve white participants (10 men, 2 women) who were students at Union Theological Seminary in New York and participated in\niv\nSIM placements in the South from 1960 to 1967. The principal findings were: 1) In-person exposure to the reality and effects of segregation and racism acted as a powerful disorienting dilemma for SIM participants, which in some cases led to the transformation of racial perspectives. 2) Strong affective bonds formed through their experience in the African American community, which provided a supportive context for the transformative process among participants. 3) The religious-spiritual dimension was an important factor in facilitating this transformative process. 4) These learning experiences in SIM are best understood as part of a long-term process. 5) An in-depth immersion experience in a setting that was either racially or culturally different was central to this long-term transformative process. Conclusions and implications were drawn for both theory and practice.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3315], "author_name_tesi": "Moll, Kirk August", "last_name_ssi": "Moll", "middle_name_ssi": "August", "first_name_ssi": "Kirk", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Edward W Taylor", "Kenneth Brian Cunningham", "Charles David Kupfer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Dissertation Advisor", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Chair", "Edward W Taylor, Committee Member", "Kenneth Brian Cunningham, Committee Member", "Charles David Kupfer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adult education", "adult learning", "racial attitudes", "transformative learning", "Transformative Learning Theory", "Intergroup Contact Theory", "Faith Development Theory", "theological education", "Student Interracial Ministry", "African Americans", "seminarians", "Union Theological Seminary in New York", "civil rights movement", "African American Churches", "Southwest Georgia Project", "Delta Ministry"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Seasonal Movement and Habitat Use of Wild Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)\n\n", "id": "12514", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5279", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Eastern brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis populations face a myriad of threats throughout the species\u2019 native range in the eastern United States. Anthropogenic alterations to the landscape, in particular, have the potential to degrade and fragment brook trout habitat. Therefore, understanding wild brook trout movement patterns and habitat requirements is essential for conserving existing populations, and for restoring habitats that no longer support self-sustaining populations. Radio biotelemetry is one approach commonly used to quantify fish movements and habitat use. Until recently, however, telemetry research targeting small stream-dwelling salmonids has been limited by the relatively large size of transmitters and short battery life (i.e., only larger fish were tagged and tracked over relatively short time frames). Recent advances in radio biotelemetry allows for smaller fishes to be tracked for longer time periods (i.e., for months rather than weeks), and thus provides the opportunity to gain additional insight into the ecology of stream-dwelling salmonids. To address uncertainties related to wild eastern brook trout movements and habitat use, I radio-tagged and tracked 36 fish in a headwater stream system in central Pennsylvania during the fall and early winter of 2010 \u2013 2011. I used generalized additive mixed models to identify relationships between brook trout movement and covariates. I also surveyed thalweg profiles of the study area to quantify available stream habitat and used discrete choice models with random effects to evaluate habitat use, a novel modeling approach for fish habitat use studies. \nThere was a large amount of among-fish variability in movement patterns; however, most of the activity was associated with the onset of the spawning season (late September \u2013 early October), including several long-distance (> 1 km) movements. Some of the among-fish variability could be explained by the size of individual fish, because the larger main-stem brook trout were more active, on average. In addition to a positive relationship between fish size and movement, modeling results also indicated that movement was positively correlated with higher stream flow. However, these effects of fish size and stream flow stage varied seasonally. Although movement during the spawning season was variable, little movement was observed across all brook trout once stream temperatures dropped below 7 \u00b0C in early December. Lastly, the larger brook trout that were tagged in the main-stem utilized lower regions of only one of the tributaries during spawning season, despite other tributaries being nearby and accessible. These results suggest that not all tributaries provided equal-quality habitat and individual tributaries may contribute disproportionally to reproduction and sustainability of brook trout in this system. \nAlthough there was a general preference for pool versus non-pool habitats, there was a large amount of among-fish heterogeneity in habitat use. Specifically, there was variability in preference for intermediate (0.26 \u2013 0.44 m deep) and deep (0.44 \u2013 1.06 m deep) residual pools, while all fish showed a similar selection for shallow (0.10 \u2013 0.26 m) residual pools compared to non-pool habitats. In addition, habitat use was nonlinear, both seasonally and in relation to the length of specific habitat types. Seasonally, there was a selection for shallow residual pools during spawning season, followed by a selection for deep residual pools as winter approached. This nonlinear seasonal selection likely reflected brook trout spawning and overwintering behavior. Brook trout were also found to show a threshold-effect for pool use with respect to pool length: habitat use for pools tended to increase as the average length of pools increased up to a point and then use declined rapidly for very long pool habitats. \nThe heterogeneity and nonlinear dynamics of movement and habitat use of the wild brook trout observed in this study underscores two important points: (1) linear models may not provide an accurate description of movement and habitat use, which can have implications for management, and (2) the importance of maintaining stream connectivity when managing self-sustaining populations. These results also demonstrate the importance of diversity, in terms of the physical stream environment, when protecting or restoring instream habitat. A way of preserving stream connectivity and providing quality instream habitat is to use a watershed approach when managing resident brook trout populations.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5256], "author_name_tesi": "Mollenhauer, Robert ", "last_name_ssi": "Mollenhauer", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tyler Wagner", "Tyler Wagner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tyler Wagner, Thesis Advisor", "Tyler Wagner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["discrete choice models", "brook trout", "radio telemetry", "thalweg profiles", "GAMMs"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Type of Social Tie as a Determinant of Peer Influences on Academic Outcomes\n\n", "id": "9142", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3748", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Peers are consistently found to play an important role in children\u2019s and adolescents\u2019 development, including their academic achievement and the motivational processes that lead to achievement.

Yet empirical evidence regarding the role of group process in facilitating participant outcomes remains limited, in large part by the analytic approaches most commonly used to assess it. In this dissertation, I propose and illustrate an innovative analytic paradigm for studying group process that integrates social network analysis (SNA) and methods sensitive to intra-individual change and variability over time (IIV) to overcome past limitations and advance understanding of group process.  Tools from these two methods are applied to the collection of data from two settings: undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in group therapy at a university counseling center, and parents and youth participating in a parent and life skills training preventive intervention.  \n    Paper 1 is a conceptual paper describing the limitations of past approaches and elaborating an integrated SNA and IIV approach to studying group process; illustrative examples provide compelling evidence of the added value of this approach beyond traditional measures.  Paper 2 focuses on data from the 18 therapy groups (121 participating clients); network-based indices of group structure and individual connectedness significantly predicted participants\u2019 weekly reports of progress and perceptions of session value, within and across time.  Additionally, average levels and linear and quadratic growth in individuals\u2019 connectedness (as measured by SNA) significantly related to pre- to post-treatment improvement in mental health.  Finally, Paper 3 focuses on data from 20 groups (106 parents, 86 youth) participating in the Strengthening Families Program (SFP). Results indicated that weekly participant reports of self-efficacy and perceptions of session value were significantly predicted by network-based measures of group structure and individuals\u2019 positions within their groups within and across sessions. Moreover, improvement in mother-youth relationship quality and several indices of youths\u2019 mental health, self-beliefs, and attitudes from pre- to post-intervention were significantly predicted by average levels of group density and individual connectedness across sessions (on both positive and negative relationships), and by linear growth in individuals\u2019 connectedness across sessions, with several relations differing by age group (i.e., mother versus youth).  \n    Taken together, results of this dissertation provide support for the value of an integrated SNA and IIV approach to studying group process in preventive and treatment interventions. Findings of each paper are discussed in terms of the value of this approach for understanding how group process in psycho-educational and therapy groups develops across sessions and facilitates intervention effectiveness.  The analytic approach tested here and resulting substantive findings will allow researchers, program developers, and clinicians to target and capitalize on specific social dynamics in evaluating, improving, and developing preventive and treatment programs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8060], "author_name_tesi": "Molloy, Lauren Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Molloy", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott David Gest", "Nilam Ram", "Scott David Gest", "J Douglas Coatsworth", "D Wayne Osgood", "Rachel Annette Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott David Gest, Dissertation Advisor", "Nilam Ram, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott David Gest, Committee Chair", "J Douglas Coatsworth, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "Rachel Annette Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["social network analysis", "intraindividual variability", "group process", "group therapy", "psychoeducational groups"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "An Empirical Investigation of Investment under Uncertainty with Sunk Costs: Oil Production in Oklahoma\n", "id": "5877", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "741", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We observe a very distinct pattern of entry and exit in the oil industry.  Significant numbers of well openings and closings are only observed during periods of very high oil prices and very low oil prices, respectively.  A band of inaction lies between the high entry and the low exit price.  Recent economic theory finds that the combination of sunk costs and uncertainty of future market conditions leads to this pattern of hysteresis.\n\tThis dissertation develops an empirical model of firm investment that can measure the role of sunk costs and uncertainty on investment and production.  In my dynamic discrete choice model firms make the decision to produce oil, mothball, or shutdown oil wells.  Switching between the states production, mothballing, and shutdown involves non-recoverable cost.  The firm\u2019s decision is affected by current and expected future market conditions, including the price of oil, oil price volatility, and the well\u2019s characteristics.  The model, which allows me to test if sunk costs and price uncertainty are determinants of the investment choice, is used to explain the supply response of oil producers to fluctuations in the market price of oil.\n\tThe model is estimated using a recently developed panel-probit simulation estimator that allows me to control for several sources of correlation in the long well history data, including persistent time-invariant random effects and serial correlation. Using a new micro-level data set on oil production units in Oklahoma it is found that sunk costs are an important determinant of the production status.  Although the probability of being a producer increases in the price of oil, oil producers only slowly respond to price changes because of non-recoverable switching costs. Oil price volatility affects the decision to change the production status, too.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [734], "author_name_tesi": "Molls, Boris ", "last_name_ssi": "Molls", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Boris", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy J Considine", "James R.

A decline in immunocompetence with advancing age, particularly in T cell functions, has been reported, even in healthy older adults.  Nutrition is important for maintaining optimal immune function, as both macronutrients (energy and protein) and micronutrients (Vitamins A, E, B6 and C, iron, and zinc) can influence immune function outcomes.  Nutrient deficiencies can, therefore, contribute further to the age-related decline in immune function in older individuals, and can increase the risk of infections and disease.\nFew studies have comprehensively examined the impact of nutrition on immune function in the healthy older adults.  Most of these studies focus on correlations between levels of certain nutrients and immune response or the effect of nutrient supplements on immune function.  Thus, literature on whether certain nutrients, examined concurrently, can predict immune function in older adults is very limited.  Because several nutrients can influence immune function, and there are interactions between several nutrients, determining the interactive effects of nutrients on immune function is important.  Therefore, we examined the relationship between specific nutrients, known to be involved in maintaining immune response, protein, iron, zinc, vitamin B12, and folate, with tests of acquired immune function in healthy older women (Chapter 2).  Older women (> 60y; n=130) were recruited with assistance of the Agencies on Aging from three counties and from local housing complexes for seniors.  We used discriminant analysis to identify the predictive subset of nutrients, which can correctly classify women as low and high responders on tests of acquired immune response namely, T cells and subsets, lymphocyte proliferation response to phytohemagglutinin A (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A), and production of interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-2 and IL-6.  Protein and iron status variables were identified in the predictive subset for all immune function variables examined; zinc emerged in the final predictive subset for T cells and subsets, and lymphocyte proliferation response to Con A.  Vitamin B12 and folate were identified in the final predictive subset for only cytokine variables.  The probability of correctly classifying women into low or high responders of immune function tests by the predictive subset of nutrition variables was high and ranged from 62.8-83.5% for T cells and subsets, 79.3-89.7% for lymphocyte proliferation response, and 77.8-88.9% for cytokines. Thus, this study shows that several nutrients namely iron, protein and zinc are significant predictors of immune function in an older cohort and maintaining the status of these nutrients may help maintain immunity in older adults.  \nThe associations between the triad of nutrition, immune function and aging are influenced by a variety of factors in study design such as health status of participants, gender, and several methodological issues concerning assessment.  To establish relationships between immune function and variables of interest, it is important to determine these variables accurately and precisely.  Precision relates to the amount of variability in the laboratory test.  The nature and magnitude of variation in immune function tests has not been described extensively.  Therefore, we examined inter- and intra-individual variation in tests of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in generally healthy and well-nourished young (20-40y; n=15) and old (60-80y; n=15) women (Chapter 3).  Subjects provided blood samples on two days within a week to determine leukocyte subsets, T-cell proliferation response to PHA and Con A, and IL-1b, IL-2 and IL-6 production.  Intra-individual variation was partitioned into day-to-day biological and analytical variation.  Inter-individual variation was greater than intra-individual variability for all tests of CMI for both age groups.  Furthermore, in both groups, all CMI tests exhibited large day-to-day intra-individual variation (CV~15% or greater), which was primarily due to biological rather than analytical sources.  In conclusion, both age groups showed large between-person and considerable within-person variation in CMI tests.  Therefore, repeated blood sampling to determine immune function tests can improve precision of these measurements.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5288], "author_name_tesi": "Molls, Roshni Rajendra", "last_name_ssi": "Molls", "middle_name_ssi": "Rajendra", "first_name_ssi": "Roshni", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Namanjeet Ahluwalia", "Gordon C Handte", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Helen Smiciklas Wright"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Namanjeet Ahluwalia, Committee Chair", "Gordon C Handte, Committee Member", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Helen Smiciklas Wright, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nutrition", "immune function", "aging", "variation"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "A TAXOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF THE LATENT STRUCTURE OF THE REPRESSOR PERSONALITY CONSTRUCT\n", "id": "6125", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "972", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-01-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A taxometric analysis of the latent structure of the repressor construct was conducted using original indices derived from both the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSDS: Crowne & Marlowe, 1964) and the trait version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI: Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983). Both Mean Above Minus Below A Cut (MAMBAC: Meehl & Yonce, 1994) and Maximum Slope (MAXSLOPE: Grove & Meehl, 1992) analyses were conducted with data from 1040 undergraduates who completed a battery of self-report questionnaires that included the MCSDS, STAI, and the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) (Costa & McCrae, 1992).

Repressors reported above average levels of both stability and agreeableness, but normal levels of extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness.  Findings from the NEO-FFI suggest that repressors may have difficulties asserting needs in relationships and that the denial of negative emotions may be more central to the repressor construct than the claiming of positive emotions.

A \"visual odometry\" method was selected to estimate the egomotion of an instrumented mapping vehicle from its onboard stereo camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This method analyzes optical flow to estimate the egovehicle's translational and rotational motion. Next, the algorithm classifies features as either static or dynamic to detect dynamic vehicles. Once detected, optical flow analysis then estimates the external vehicle's states using extracted features from the moving egovehicle. This process enables the novel concept of using optical flow to detect an oncoming vehicle's instability.\n\nThe detection of vehicle instability is greatly aided by location context that can be used to warn drivers of imminent risk. To provide context, this thesis considers the use of a map to isolate instabilities that may result in entry of the egovehicle's lane. Specifically, a map provides additional knowledge of an external vehicle's road radius from position measurements and map data. This permits the estimation of a external vehicle's neutral steering yaw rate. If the external vehicle's measured yaw rate is in excess of its estimated neutral steering yaw rate, this then indicates instability and a likelihood that the vehicle will be unable to maintain consistent lane tracking.\n\nThis algorithm was tested offline with data collected from The Pennsylvania State University's mapping vehicle and a precisely controlled test vehicle at The Pennsylvania State University Larson Transportation Institute Test Track. While this concept's validation was limited - and not the direct goal of this thesis - the results show promise for this concept's feasibility and future validation.\n\nThis work is intended to be implemented as part of a more robust and complex real-time architecture. When deployed as an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) on a moving vehicle, it can ensure early detection of an oncoming vehicle's instability, prompting increased caution to mitigate collision risks. Furthermore, when deployed statically at an intersection, it can detect low friction-areas based on common areas of vehicle instability, prompting remedial action to fix the roadway.

Although the regulation of transcriptional initiation is well studied, the regulation of elongation and termination are not well understood. This thesis focuses on understanding the role of NusA on intrinsic termination and the role of NusG on RNA polymerase pausing using genomic, biochemical and computational analyses.\n\n        Tight regulation of transcription termination is required to maintain proper levels of gene expression in bacteria, because termination failure abolishes operon boundaries, leading to misregulation of downstream genes. NusA is a negative transcription elongation factor that was known to cause a slight stimulation of termination at intrinsic terminators in vitro, but its impact on termination and global gene expression in vivo was not known. In this thesis, I describe the mapping of intrinsic terminators genome wide in B subtilis and measure the effect of NusA on the efficiency of these terminators in vivo using a novel high resolution 3\u2019 end-mapping technique coupled with mRNA profiling. Based on these studies, I report the existence of a subclass of previously unidentified pseudo-intrinsic terminators that are dependent on NusA for termination. Sequence comparison of different terminators reveals that weak hairpins and/or distal U-tract interruptions favors NusA-dependent termination, supporting a model in which NusA assists hairpin folding and slows down RNA polymerase near the termination window. These studies also revealed that readthrough of NusA-dependent terminators increases transcription of genes related to replication and DNA metabolism, suggesting a role of NusA in maintaining genome stability. I further show that nusA is autoregulated by a transcription attenuation mechanism that does not rely on antiterminator structures to prevent termination. Instead, NusA-stimulated termination in its 5'UTR dictates the extent of transcription into the operon.\n\n        Another major focus of this thesis is to understand the regulation of transcription elongation by NusG-stimulated pausing of RNA polymerase. NusG is a positive elongation factor in E. coli that accelerates transcription by reducing the dwell time of RNA polymerase at pause sites. In B. subtilis, NusG stimulates pausing at positions U107 and U144 in the trp-leader transcript. NusG-stimulated pausing at U144 requires a short sequence in the non-template DNA strand and participates in the TRAP-dependent translation repression mechanism. In this thesis, I report the characterization of the NusG-stimulated U107 pause signal and show that disruption of the NusG recognition motif dramatically reduces pausing. These results suggest a mechanism in which RNA polymerase pausing at this site participates in the transcription attenuation mechanism by increasing additional time for TRAP binding to the nascent transcript.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11749], "author_name_tesi": "Mondal, Smarajit ", "last_name_ssi": "Mondal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Smarajit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Lee Babitzke", "Paul Lee Babitzke", "Katsuhiko Murakami", "David Scott Gilmour", "Joseph C.

The change in stretching direction, measured from strain histories, is used to evaluate the kinematics of the orogenic system. The subduction zone beneath the island of Taiwan is influenced by two types of obliquity. First, plate motion vector of the Philippine Sea plate is slightly oblique to the regional strike of the mountain range. There is also a component of obliquity between the Luzon volcanic arc, on the Philippine Sea Plate, and the edge of the Eurasian continental margin. The strain histories quantified from the Slate Belt record the changes in strain along the advection path of the material through the orogenic system. The Taiwan orogenic system is at topographic steady-state, so the particle path of material through the system is determined by the point of accretion of material into the system and the location of the maximum erosive flux of material out of the system. Two different models attempt to explain the advection of material as either a doubly-vergent wedge with shallow lateral advection from the point of accretion, or as a deep-seated corner flow with primarily vertical advection from the point of accretion. A vertical advection path would show no systematic change in strain through the deformation history while a lateral advection path would record changes in strain direction that correspond to strain regimes across the mountain range. Incremental strain histories in cleavage parallel samples show a systematic change from downdip to along strike stretch, corresponding with lineation trends and indicating shallow lateral advection. Incremental strain histories in cleavage perpendicular samples show both clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation of strain, indicating probable influence from both types of obliquity within the deformation system.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8136], "author_name_tesi": "Mondro, Claire A", "last_name_ssi": "Mondro", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Claire", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Myron Fisher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Myron Fisher, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["taiwan", "tectonics", "pressure shadows", "strain history"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "MOLECULAR-SCALE PROPERTIES OF FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS AND MOLECULES\n", "id": "6552", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2626", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-02-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Advanced materials have led to new and improved technologies.

Cynthia Dillard\u2019s (2006) notion of an Endarkened Feminist Epistemology guided this qualitative study that was informed by both narrative inquiry and autoethnography. This theoretical framework of Endarkened Feminist Epistemology assumes: (a) a responsibility to cultural and social community; (b) research is a spiritual and intellectual process; (c) encourages dialogue within community as a means of assessing knowledge; (d) the application of knowledge to an everyday context leads to meaning making; (e) knowing and research are historical; and, (f) power relations impacts research. This theoretical framework provided the lens through which the teaching practices of African American professors and the concerns of African American learners were viewed. The primary means of data collection in this study was in-depth narrative interviews with five professors who draw on arts-based ways of knowing and learning to determine their purposes in doing so and with nine of their students to determine what engages their learning when they have been exposed to arts-based ways of knowing. In addition, there was some classroom observation in order to understand both how the professors themselves draw on these forms of inquiry and to understand what the students are exposed to; documents such as field notes served as ancillary forms of data.\n\n     As a qualitative study informed by both narrative inquiry and autoethnography, findings of the study are first presented in the form of narratives with some autoethnographic reflections of both the professors and the students. Then, a cross case analysis of common themes in the narratives of the professors and the students are presented. Themes within the professor narratives indicate that they include arts-based ways of knowing because they serve as a means of: (a) engaging their students and themselves; (b) drawing on multiple ways of knowing and learning; and, (c) connecting with culture. Themes about the students indicate what they value in higher education classrooms are instructors and/or teaching activities that: (a) attend to cultural identity; (b) connect to others or the content through interaction and engagement; (c) create a classroom community; and, (d) deal effectively with classroom organizational issues. This study contributes to the field of adult education in three primary ways. First, it identifies the importance of engagement and culturally responsive education. African American learners need to perceive that classroom activities affirm their history and experiences. Second, it highlights the importance of varying teaching practices, and drawing of multiple ways of knowing, which increases the possibility of engaging the learner in a way that is seen as relevant to his or her life. Finally, it underscores the benefit of creating an interactive teaching/learning community in the higher education classroom that engages African American students and their peers and helps them learn from each other.

While its exact etiology remains unknown, factors contributing to its development are suggested to include, but are not limited to, dysfunction of the gluteus medius, abnormal trochlear morphology, and altered sagittal plane kinematics. These factors are generally agreed to result in the patellar maltracking that is proposed to cause the pathology\u2019s trademark symptoms. In most patients, PFP is chronic or recurrent, which has negative effects on their ability to be physically active. The lack of understanding regarding the development of PFP makes it difficult for clinicians to treat successfully. In addition to physical rehabilitation, therapeutic taping techniques are a part of the standard of care of PFP. Traditionally, McConnell taping techniques have been used to correct the position of the patella. Recently, the use of kinesiology tape (KT), a cotton/elastic therapeutic tape, has grown in popularity among athletes and clinicians alike. This therapeutic tape is believed to reduce pain and improve performance via cutaneous stimulation, though neither its efficacy nor its mechanism of action are well understood. The first chapter of this dissertation focused on reviewing existing literature that investigated the effects of KT on pain and quadriceps performance in physically active PFP patients. Due to the lack of literature specifically utilizing PFP patients, the second chapter of this dissertation focused on reviewing and quantifying the effects of KT on pain in individuals with musculoskeletal injury. Results from these reviews indicated that further research was necessary. Therefore, for the third chapter, an experiment was performed to further investigate the effects of KT on pain and functional measures in physically active PFP patients. Since KT manufacturers recommend prolonged applications, this experiment was designed to investigate the effects of both acute and prolonged applications. Results of the research indicate that, overall, KT application resulted in greater pain reduction and greater improvements in performance than placebo both acutely and over time as demonstrated by effect sizes.

It is the fifth leading cause of cancer related death among women, after lung, breast, colon, and pancreatic cancer. Ovarian tumors are difficult to diagnose early due to their location deep within the pelvis and a lack of sensitive, specific diagnostic biochemical tests. Currently, there are no established animal models of spontaneously occurring OC. The laying hen model of ovarian carcinoma is gaining acceptance as a model of OC, due to spontaneous generation of ovarian tumors as well as the similarity to human OC progression. Gene mutations are known to be concurrent with human cancers, including OC. The TP53 gene is a tumor suppressing gene known to be mutated in over 60% of human cancers. Mutations in TP53 have been associated with OC in humans. Point mutations of the TP53 mRNA transcript have been detected in chicken OC. The objective of this study was to compare chicken TP53 mRNA transcript in chicken OC with that of age-matched and young controls, ascites-derived chicken ovarian cancer cell lines, liver, and adipose tissue. Total RNA was extracted from ovarian tissue, ascites-derived ovarian cancer cell lines, liver and adipose tissue. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA and the TP53 gene amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using gene-specific primers. The resultant PCR products were gel-purified and sequenced. Point mutations were discovered within the mRNA transcript. Interestingly, a deletion of 216 nucleotides spanning part of the transactivation domain and the entire proline-rich region was detected in all ovarian tumor, as well as age-matched and young healthy controls, ascites-derived chicken ovarian cancer cell lines, liver and adipose tissue. The deletion may be the result of yet unknown alternative splicing events during the biosynthesis of TP53 mRNA. The deletions characterized in this study share similarity to isoforms of TP53 overexpressed in human cancer.

Successful gust response alleviation could improve safety and potentially expand operational envelopes.  The results of a feasibility study of using active trailing edge flaps as gust alleviation mechanisms are presented.  Previous researchers have used the primary flight control effectors, including the swashplate and the tail rotor, to successfully improve the vehicle response and reduce the pilot workload.  Other researchers have analyzed trailing edge flaps for the purposes of vibration control, noise reduction, and blade loads control.  Until now, time-domain, non-harmonic controllers have seen little use in automated on-blade actuation studies.  Additionally, using on-blade actuation is a novel method for gust alleviation.  The benefits of on-blade actuation and previous gust alleviation control methods are combined in this study, yielding a system that uses trailing edge flaps for gust disturbance rejection while the swashplate provides primary flight control.  \n\nThe control architecture used in this analysis is comprised of two distinct controllers with separate actuators.  The primary flight control system is a standard model-following controller (MFC) architecture that uses the swashplate and pedals to ensure that the vehicle follows a desired response to pilot inputs, based on handling qualities specifications. Separately, the airwake compensator rejects airwake disturbances with trailing edge flaps and a robust H2 controller.  In this way, command tracking is decoupled from disturbance rejection. The controller is implemented in the GENHEL flight simulation code of the UH-60A Black Hawk with a CFD airwake solution for an LHA-class ship.  Simulations are performed in hover.  The size of the trailing edge flaps used in this study (fifteen percent blade span and twenty percent blade chord) is on the low range of the size of flaps studied for vibration control.  \n\nResults indicate that trailing edge flaps are capable of alleviating the magnitude of the vehicle angular gust response in the roll and pitch axes.  Roll response is significantly impacted in all cases, including a roll rate reduction of as much as ninety percent in specific wind-over-deck conditions.  Pitch response sees a modest improvement in all conditions.  Specifically, in a hover maneuver above a Landing Helicopter Assault-class ship with a thirty knot wind from thirty degrees from the bow of the ship, the maximum roll rate response of the vehicle is reduced by ninety-one percent.  The maximum pitch rate response is reduced by thirty-two percent using a trailing edge flap controller designed for that flight condition.  Varying performance and actuation parameters within the control synthesis has a strong impact on the magnitude and frequency of the required trailing edge flap deflections.  Deflection requirements can be kept below current actuation technology stroke and rate limits while achieving the performance of a similar swashplate-based controller.  The results of this study suggest that trailing edge flaps can be effective for shipboard gust alleviation. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4898], "author_name_tesi": "Montanye, Pamela L.", "last_name_ssi": "Montanye", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Pamela", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Smith", "Christopher Rahn", "Stephen Clarke Conlon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Thesis Advisor", "Stephen Clarke Conlon, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["helicopter", "rotorcraft", "trailing edge flap", "active rotor", "flight dynamics", "gust", "gust response", "shipboard", "dynamic interface"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Predicting Demographics of High-Resolution Geographies", "id": "13882ovm5033", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13882", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, we consider the problem of predicting demographics of geographic units given geotagged Tweets that are composed within these units. Traditional survey methods that offer demographics estimates are usually limited in terms of geographic resolution, geographic boundaries, and time intervals. Thus, it would be highly useful to develop computational methods that can complement traditional survey methods by offering demographics estimates at finer geographic resolutions, with flexible geographic boundaries (i.e. not confined to administrative boundaries), and at different time intervals. While prior work has focused on predicting demographics and health statistics at relatively coarse geographic resolutions such as the county-level or state-level, we introduce an approach to predict demographics at finer geographic resolutions such as the blockgroup-level. For the task of predicting gender and race/ethnicity counts at the blockgroup-level, an approach adapted from prior work to our problem achieves an average correlation of 0.389 (gender) and 0.569 (race) on a held-out test dataset. Our approach outperforms this prior approach with an average correlation of 0.671 (gender) and 0.692 (race). We also explore correcting the temporal bias introduced in predictions as years go by. Many reasons lead to such an outcome, but mainly, the mapping between tweet characteristics  and demographics characteristics change. For example, certain tweet characteristics that predict gender demographics will change over time as language usage changes. Also, population demographics might change more heavily than demographics of Twitter users. So, the population bias fix needs to be updated as well. Thus, it would be useful to develop approaches to fix this temporal bias where knowledge learned by model $f$ is still utilized but adjusted accordingly. We introduce an approach to correct the temporal bias in predictions. In addition, we show how our method can complement traditional survey methods. In particular, given access to survey demographics data at a coarse geographic resolution (e.g. tract-level), we show that our method is able to accurately predict demographics of finer geographic resolutions (e.g. blockgroup-level) without needing any demographics data at the finer resolution.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14354], "author_name_tesi": "Montasser, Omar Tayeb", "last_name_ssi": "Montasser", "middle_name_ssi": "Tayeb", "first_name_ssi": "Omar", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Kifer", "C.

The first essay investigates the choice between public and private schools in Brazil. I use cross-sectional survey data to show that families with higher income and schooling are less likely to enroll their children in public school. But if their race is black or brown, they are more likely to choose public schools, even when controlling for income, education and location. I do not find any evidence that this result comes from scarcity of private schools, race preferences, or residential segregation. But it is likely caused by the lower returns to education that black and brown individuals have. This essay shows that not only income and education matter for school choice in Brazil, but also race. The second essay explores the theory behind parental educational investments in the presence of heterogeneous returns. I build on the overlapping generations literature to study the investment that parents make on the education of their children, in a setting with private and public schools and different returns by group. This assumption is motivated by the findings in the first essay, and it results in different school choices based on income and returns. This difference in the educational investment leads to school segregation in equilibrium and may result in poverty traps. The third essay uses a quantitative approach to study the effects of implementing a voucher program in Brazil. I use simulated method of moments to estimate some parameters in a parental choice model, while calibrating others to the Brazilian economy. The estimation is used to evaluate how implementing private education vouchers compares with the non-voucher case. I find that vouchers increase the average human capital of the economy and reduce inequality measured by the Gini coefficient and coefficient of variation. In some cases it improves the welfare of the first generation affected by the voucher, while in others it will  impose a welfare cost. For future generations there are large welfare gains of continuing this policy.

Exposure to highly-corrosive salt ions, namely chloride, that are abundant in these environments is nearly unavoidable during vehicle transport, and the resulting corrosion is often initiated on these vehicles before they are used in their intended application.  Corrosion Preventative Compounds, referred to as CPCs, are a strategy used commonly as a temporary and outermost line of defense against corrosion during transportation and active use in the field.  The protection that a CPC provides to the uncoated steel components is of interest because bare metal exposure is the most vulnerable path for the onset of corrosion in this corrosion system.  Should the uncoated steel become subjected to seawater environments, the formation of corrosion product is quite rapid.\nThis study focused on using surface-based characterization techniques to examine the role that three commercially-available oil-based CPC types played in protecting 1018 steel surfaces from corrosion initiation in artificial seawater environments.  The CPCs used in this research were water-displacing oil-based liquids that cured to form nearly-dry films on the steel surfaces.  Surface chemistry techniques, FT-IR and XPS, were used to examine the as-applied CPC films prior to and after exposure to the corrosive environment.  Electrochemical and corrosion methods were used to monitor the stability and eventual degradation of the CPC films and the substrate as a function of time of exposure to the corrosive environment.   \nThis study resolved some uncertainties that surround the mechanisms of oil-based corrosion preventative compounds on low carbon steel.  In general after initial immersion, the oil-based CPC films, hydrophobic by nature, acted as a temporary barrier to protect the substrate from the aqueous-based corrosion environment.  After longer immersion times, the CPC films appeared to intermix with the initially-forming corrosion products to form an intermediate type of protective film that prevented the underlying substrate from further corrosion.  Eventually, the CPC films degraded such that they no longer inhibited further corrosion.  While similar in composition and general behavior, the three different CPC types provided varying degrees of protection from corrosion to the 1018 steel substrate in the artificial seawater environment.

Semistructured interviews, lasting on average 82.5 minutes, were conducted using an interview protocol adapted from Seymour and Hewitt (1997). The six emergent themes that had the most impact on their ability to persistence in emerging are: (1) Cultural Issues; (2) Engineering Identity; (3) Family Influence; (4) Peer relationships; (5) Academic Issues; and (6) Personal Issues. Five of the six were perceived as both contextual supports and barriers to their experience in their major. Cultural issues (e.g. participation in the Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP), involvement in National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), and other culture-related activities) figured most prominently in providing the necessary support and obviating the effects of any barriers they encountered. Implications for various stake holders and theory were provided.

This corresponds to 38 million disability-adjusted lost years in addition to needless pain and suffering from increased eye and respiratory illnesses.  Worldwide, black carbon particulate matter (soot) is second only to carbon dioxide as an anthropogenic contributor to global warming in the atmosphere (direct radiative forcing) and also accelerates glacial and snowpack loss due to the melting caused by reduced albedo.   In South-East Asia, soot can make a more significant contribution to global warming than carbon dioxide.  With 2.53 billion humans using biomass as their primary cooking fuel, biomass-fired cook stoves account for 75% of that soot.  1.6 billion of these cook stove users live in villages that have no electricity.  \nAn improved cook stove addresses both of these problems, but because the atmospheric lifetimes of black carbon particles is only a week or two, instead of 100 years for carbon dioxide (CO2), 114 years for nitrous oxide (NO2), and 12 years for methane (CH4), atmospheric soot reduction is the only remediation activity that can produce immediate benefits.\nRecent research has shown that fan-enhanced convection in the biomass combustion chamber makes the most significant reduction in the products of incomplete combustion that degrades indoor air quality and also is most successful in reduction of soot production.  This prototype will utilize a thermoacoustic engine to extract a small amount of heat, generate a standing sound wave thermoacoustically, and use that sound wave to drive a loudspeaker-like linear alternator to generate electricity.  Since the fan typically consumes only one watt and a simple thermoacoustic generator could produce 5-10 watts of electrical power, the excess electrical power can be used to provide lighting using a high-efficiency LED lamp, charge a mobile phone or other small electronic device, or run a small appliance.\nThermoacoustics seems like a potential candidate for low-cost electrical power generation because it is so simple and requires no moving parts other than the loudspeaker which must reciprocate to generate electrical power.  The design and fabrication of a low-cost thermoacoustic power generator presented many challenges.\nThe prototype described herein used air at atmospheric pressure as the thermodynamic working gas.  This choice allowed the hot-duct of the resonator to be constructed from folded sheet steel producing a rectangular cross-section instead of the circular cross-section typical of vessels designed to contain gases at higher pressures.  The rectangular cross-section meant that the ceramic \u201cstack\u201d could also have a large-aspect rectangular cross-section (i.e., very wide, but not too tall) so that the heat leaving the engine would not have to travel very far to reach the ambient temperature reservoir.  This made the ambient heat exchanger simple but efficient.  Cooling fins sold to cool computer chips were used to remove heat from the stack.  The exhaust heat collected by the fins was measured by determining the rate at which ice melted in the \u201cpool\u201d above the ambient temperature portion of the resonator. By coating the hot-end of the ceramic stack with carbon black from a candle, about 20 watts of heat was deposited on the stack directly by electromagnetic radiation making a hot heat exchanger unnecessary.\nExperiments demonstrated that under similar conditions, the amplitude of the thermoacoustically-generated pressure increased for shorter stacks with larger ratios of pore size to thermal penetration depth in a resonator with smaller volume corresponding to larger gas stiffness.\nA loudspeaker was sealed to the ambient end of the resonator and utilized its moving mass, in conjunction with the gas stiffness in the duct, to create a Helmholtz-like resonator that was more compact than a standing-wave resonator operating at the same frequency.  Although the overall efficiency of thermal to electrical power conversion was fairly poor in this prototype, and only 18-26 mW of useful electrical power was extracted.  This low output level was due, in part, to the fairly large mechanical resistance of the commercial loudspeakers.  \nThis effort has proven that several of our innovations were workable and provides guidance for design of a second-generation device.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4878], "author_name_tesi": "Montgomery, Paul James", "last_name_ssi": "Montgomery", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Lurie Garrett", "Steven Lurie Garrett", "Horacio Perez Blanco"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Lurie Garrett, Thesis Advisor", "Steven Lurie Garrett, Thesis Advisor", "Horacio Perez Blanco, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermoacoustics", "cook stoves", "acoustics", "soot", "global warming"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "SYNTHESIS OF NON-POLAR/HYDROGEN BONDING\nBLOCK COPOLYMERS\n", "id": "6185", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5626", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Methods for the synthesis of novel block copolymers consisting of a non-polar segment and a hydrogen bonding segment were developed using a combination of living polymerization techniques.

Most nucleic acids exist as a combination of simple secondary structures that assemble into much larger, complex structures.  In this thesis, DNA and RNA hairpin loops are used as a model system to investigate expandability of loops, cooperativity of interactions, and proton binding.  In vitro, combinatorial selection approaches were used to isolate 4 stable DNA tetraloop motifs: d(cGNNAg), d(cGNABg), d(cCNNGg) and d(gCNNGc), where N = A, C, G, or T and B = C, G or T.  These motifs were characterized by thermal melting, circular dichroism, and nucleotide analogue substitution.  Analysis of the d(cGNABg) and d(cGNAg) loops using C3 spacers indicates that these loops can be expanded at any position expect 5' of the first loop nucleotide.  Insertion of C3 spacers at this position appeared to disrupt a loop-closing base pair interaction, which was found to be common in certain stable DNA and RNA hairpin loops.  Cooperativity among three interactions (2 loop-loop hydrogen bonds and the loop-closing basepair interaction) in the stable d(cGNAg) triloop was investigated by single, double and triple mutant analysis.  These three interactions were found to be highly non-additive with indirect coupling, meaning that all three interactions were necessary to retain the integrity of the loop.  The d(cGNABg) tetraloop was also characterized and through NMR analysis and functional group mutations, it was categorized as an expanded d(cGNAg) triloop, with similar cooperativity.  A related RNA tetraloop, r(cGAAAg), whose structure has been solved, also contains a sheared GA basepair and loop-closing basepair interaction, along with 5 additional interactions.  Single, double and triple mutant analyses revealed that the RNA was showed greater additivity than its DNA counterpart and direct coupling.  A thermodynamic framework for proton binding to nucleic acids was developed and tested with experiments and data simulation.  Oligonucleotides were designed that contained possible A+\u0081\u0153 C basepairs with optimal nearest-neighbor partners and the pKa of N1 of A was found to be shifted to neutrality.  This pKa was measured by 31P NMR on a phosphorothioate labeled sample, which allowed for the monitoring of a single phosphorus resonance.\n\t\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1807], "author_name_tesi": "Moody, Ellen Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Moody", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Ellen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

Issue Avoidance theory posits that candidates emphasize their own strengths, even going so far as to avoid their opponents' favored issues entirely. Issue Convergence theory argues the opposite; suggesting candidates will direct attention to their opponents' key issues in an effort to erode their support. Both theories, however, neglect that issue attention is a finite commodity for both the candidates and the public, a reality that holds serious implications both for how candidates divvy their attention across issues over the course of the campaign and the susceptibility of candidates to agenda-setting efforts from their opponents, the media, and other outside forces. In my dissertation I propose a Double-Bottleneck theory of candidate attention under which candidates choose to stress a small subset of \"key\" issues that emphasize their strengths while sending a campaign message in a way the public can follow. As a result, candidates are protective of their primary issues and are largely insulated from outside influence; however, the remaining lower importance issues are largely unaddressed and are open to agenda-setting actions or other outside influence.\n\nI test this theory through the use of several unique datasets from the 2004 and 2008 presidential campaigns, and offer an in-depth picture of which issues are chosen to serve as the \"key\" issues of the campaigns and the dynamics of how candidate attention to those issues change over the course of the race. My theory suggests candidates will be largely unaffected by shifts in attention from other actors for their most important issues, with the largest exception coming from the debate they engage in with their opponents over those policy areas. Further, as the salience of an issue declines candidates will be more likely to be influenced by outside sources as the candidates both possess less expertise in these areas and also do not wish to complicate the message they send to the voters. Empirical results offer support for my Double-Bottleneck theory, indicating candidates' patterns of attention to the top issues in 2004 and 2008 are largely unaffected by outside forces, with the exception of major external events like the financial crisis of 2008 that define the entire campaign. Lower importance issues are open to influence by the media and other actors; yet, these effects do not appear in a pattern consistent enough to suggest any overt acts of agenda-setting. To this end, despite the characterizations of campaigns as battlegrounds where the candidates and media fight to set the agenda, for the most part, significant acts of agenda-setting in presidential campaigns is much less frequent than we might believe.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9003], "author_name_tesi": "Moody, Jonathan William", "last_name_ssi": "Moody", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Jon Zorn", "Christopher Jon Zorn", "Eric Plutzer", "Luke John Keele", "John W Gastil", "Frank Baumgartner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Jon Zorn, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Jon Zorn, Committee Chair", "Eric Plutzer, Committee Member", "Luke John Keele, Committee Member", "John W Gastil, Committee Member", "Frank Baumgartner, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["agenda-setting", "presidential campaign", "elections", "campaigns"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Three Body Dynamics in Dense Gravitational Systems", "id": "10214", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3378", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Three body dynamics are of particular interest in clusters where the density of stars provides many opportunities for interactions.  Globular clusters, which have had densities of tens to hundreds of thousands of stars per cubic parsec for billions of years, are the ideal laboratory for studying dynamics in systems which at best have solutions in only the mathematical sense of the word.  Modelling these systems in a realistic way which includes all stars individually represented, with their evolution and inclusion into a comparable number of binaries as is seen in observed clusters, has driven computer hardware and software for decades (Heggie & Hut 2003).  In this thesis, I have used several techniques to answer the following questions:  How many black hole binaries will a cluster produce, and will they have the required properties to be seen by our gravitational wave detectors?  How often does the crowded environment of star forming cluster allow the exchange of a planet between stars?  To answer these questions, I have studied three scenarios:  the interaction of black holes in clusters, the effect of the Kozai mechanism on pulsars in clusters, and the effect of an exchanged planetary body on a planetary system.  \n\n\n\nI have examined the interactions of a system of black holes in a globular cluster in which the black holes have different masses with a more realistic distribution.  This is an advance over previous studies which assumed that all black holes have the same mass, and as such when interacting tended to eject all but one or two from the cluster.  The previous paradigm for black holes was that all black holes were 10 solar masses.  In my thesis, black hole masses are derived from population synthesis models and span a range of a few up to 50 or 80 M$_{odot}$ depending on metallicity.  My new calculations have reduced the efficiency of three-body interactions in ejecting the binary due to their non-equal masses.  I also use timescales derived from earlier simulations of clusters (Sigurdsson 1995) to determine the end state of individual binaries interacting with single black holes.  While N-body simulations of black hole systems such as in O'Leary et al. (2006) are less model dependent, my method can easily adapt to advances in the understanding of the processes that make black holes and rapidly produce results on rates of binary black hole mergers for gravitational wave observations and the possibilities of intermediate mass black hole seeds.\n\n\n\nNumerous black hole binaries are produced by clusters, they are hardened in the potential of the cluster, and the most massive black holes survive the interactions.  Interactions with the other black holes preferentially produce binaries with higher eccentricities.  I found that as many as one in seven binaries will coalesce within a Hubble time, and with the strength of signal that their higher mass gives they would rival galactic black hole binaries as a background source.  Compare this to the more pessimistic forecast in Kulkarni et al. (1993) that they would not be a significant background source.  I also found that the binaries are ejected from the cluster with, for the most part, a velocity just above the escape speed of the cluster which is a few tens of km/sec.  These gravitational wave sources are thus constrained in their host galaxies as the galactic escape velocity is some hundreds of km/sec which only a very few binaries achieve in special cases (i.e. originally forming as a tight binary, their first three-body interaction liberates a large amount of kinetic energy).  It is therefore fitting to perhaps take a census of galaxies and their clusters within the radius the binaries would be visible to LIGO to estimate the how many sources could be seen, especially considering the first extra-galactic black hole in a globular cluster being recently discovered (Maccarone et al. 07).  \n\n\n\nI studied the effect of the Kozai mechanism on two pulsars, one in the globular cluster M4, and the other J1903+0327.  The M4 pulsar pulsar was found to have an unusually large orbital eccentricity, given that it is in a binary with a period of nearly 200 days.  This unusual behavior led to the conclusion that a planet-like third body of much less than a solar mass was orbiting the binary.  Dynamical exchanges can deposit the planet in a highly inclined orbit, which can lead to eccentricity pumping by the Kozai effect.  The Kozai effect requires a minimum inclination of the two orbits of about 40 degrees.  I used my own code to integrate the secular evolution equations with a broad set of initial conditions to determine the first detailed properties of the third body; namely that the mass of the planet is about that of Jupiter.  The second pulsar J1903+0327 consists of a 2.15ms pulsar and a near solar mass companion in an $e=0.44$ orbit. A preliminary study of this pulsar showed that the high eccentricity can be reproduced by my models, and there are three candidate clusters from which this pulsar could have originated.  \n\n\n\nMy third project was a study of the effect of a planet at 50 AU on the inner solar system.  The origin of this planet is assumed to be from an exchange with another solar system in the early stages of the sun's life while it was still in the dense star forming region where it was born.  Similar studies have been done with the exchange of stars among binaries by Malmberg et al. (2007b).  The exchange once again allows the Kozai effect to bring about drastic change in the inner system.  A planet is chosen as the outer object as, unlike a stellar companion, it would remain unseen by current radial velocity and direct observation methods, although it could be detected by upcoming astrometric missions.  My study uses an outer body from the size of a super Earth to a brown dwarf, in various inclinations, and exerting its influence on an inner object modelled on the Earth or Jupiter.  The 50 AU size of the outer orbit corresponds with the sharp drop off in Kuiper Belt objects.  This result represents the first step in a much larger project to fully explore the parameter space.  I found that the size of the outer orbit drastically affects the eccentricity obtained by the inner object due to the beating of the Kozai and general relativistic precessions.  I also found that four-body calculation are needed for a full understanding of how the change in the outer native object's eccentricity is propagated to the inner native object, native planets being those which are formed along with their host star.  Simulations of young dense star forming clusters should illustrate how planetary sized objects are exchanged between stars.\n\n\n\nI explored the dynamics of exchanges between objects and the workings of the Kozai mechanism in my first two projects.  These tools prepared me for work on a crucial issue in planet formation, that of how a peculiar subset of observed planets were formed.  I have shown that exchanges and the Kozai mechanism can work together to produce the observed eccentricities of exoplanets.  This is a new approach to the study of the dynamics of planet formation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3366], "author_name_tesi": "Moody, Kenneth ", "last_name_ssi": "Moody", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steinn Sigurdsson", "Steinn Sigurdsson", "Donald P Schneider", "Eric D Feigelson", "Mercedes Richards", "James Kasting"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steinn Sigurdsson, Dissertation Advisor", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Committee Chair", "Donald P Schneider, Committee Member", "Eric D Feigelson, Committee Member", "Mercedes Richards, Committee Member", "James Kasting, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["computer simulations", "dynamics", "compact objects", "extrasolar planets"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF PROPULSOR CAVITATION BREAKDOWN USING\nOVERSET GRID TECHNOLOGY\n", "id": "8853", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6527", "abstract_tesi": "The capabilities of a Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes method to predict\ncavitation performance breakdown of unducted propellers are investigated.

This allows TFET to achieve much higher ION-IOFF ratio over a specified gate\nvoltage swing compared to MOSFETs, thus enabling aggressive supply voltage scaling for low power logic operation without impacting its ON-OFF current ratio.\n\nThis dissertation presents the operating principle of TFET, the material selection strategy\nand device design for TFET fabrication. This is followed by a novel 6T SRAM design which\ncircumvents the issue of unidirectional conduction in TFET. The switching behavior of TFET is studied through mixed-mode numerical simulations. The significance of correct benchmarking methodology to estimate the effective drive current and capacitance in TFET is highlighted and compared with MOSFET. This is followed by the fabrication details of homo-junction TFET. Analysis of the electrical characteristics of homo-junction TFET gives key insight into its device operation and identifies the critical factors that impact its performance. In order to boost the ON current, the design and fabrication of hetero-junction TFET is also presented.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5483], "author_name_tesi": "Mookerjea, Saurabh Amitabha", "last_name_ssi": "Mookerjea", "middle_name_ssi": "Amitabha", "first_name_ssi": "Saurabh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suman Datta", "Suman Datta", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Nitin Samarth", "Kingsuk Maitra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suman Datta, Dissertation Advisor", "Suman Datta, Committee Chair", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Kingsuk Maitra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MILLER CAPACITANCE", "HETERO-JUNCTION", "HOMO-JUNCTION", "TFET", "6T SRAM"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "A Computable Theory of Dynamic Games and Its Applications\n\n\n", "id": "7330", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5404", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recently dynamic competitive service sector problems such as revenue management, dynamic pricing, supply chain management, combined energy generation and distribution, and transportation network flow prediction and control have been the focus of much research activity. In this thesis we describe a general computable theory of dynamic games that relaxes most of the restrictive assumptions of classical nonzero-sum differential game theory, thought to be mandatory in the study of service and utility network problems. We have shown that differential variational inequalities (DVIs), which are infinite dimensional variational inequalities that include state dynamics, controls as well as control constraints, have the same notions of minimum principle, adjoint equations and transversality conditions familiar from the theory of optimal control when relatively mild regularity conditions are imposed. We also show that DVIs may conveniently be used to compute Cournot-Nash-Bertrand equilibria of broad classes of dynamic games where the game-theoretic agents have a forward-looking or anticipatory perspective. We have also shown that when state-dependent time shifts - such as those encountered in some applied problems namely modeling vehicular traffic and supply chain flows are present, the resulting problems remain surprisingly tractable. A simple fixed point algorithm combined with descent in Hilbert space for which sub-problem solutions are expressed as pure functions of time allowed us to compute solutions efficiently. Our numerical examples suggest the fixed-point-descent-in-Hilbert-space algorithm may be practical for intermediate size problems without special structure. We have also showed that the fixed-point-descent-in-Hilbert-space algorithm is convergent when suitable small step sizes are employed. We have applied this framework to study a wide class of applied problems. In particular we have studied (a) dynamic revenue management competition, (b) city logistics and supply chain competition, (c) electric power generation-distribution game, and (d) the transportation network flow prediction and congestion option games. In each case we present some structural properties of the games as well as numerical examples that further characterize respective Nash equilibria.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5397], "author_name_tesi": "Mookherjee, Reetabrata ", "last_name_ssi": "Mookherjee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Reetabrata", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Terry Lee Friesz", "David Arthur Nembhard", "Tao Yao", "Venkataraman Shankar", "Georgia Perakis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Terry Lee Friesz, Committee Chair", "David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "Venkataraman Shankar, Committee Member", "Georgia Perakis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Differential variational inequalities", "Optimal control", "Nash equilibrium", "State dependent time shifts"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Edaphic properties, their heterogeneity, and associated microbial communities in headwater wetland complexes of the Ridge and Valley Region, Pennsylvania", "id": "14486", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7228", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Small in area, headwater wetland complexes provide a disproportionate share of valuable ecosystem functions to the larger landscape. Through microbial biochemical cycling of large portions of the global carbon and nitrogen pools, they act as sinks for and transformers of inorganic nutrients and as sources of organic material to aquatic systems. Our current understanding of these systems suggests that anthropogenic activities have altered their hydrologic disturbance regimes with subsequent material fluxes and changed the structure of their biologic components (e.g., vegetation, macroinvertebrates, and birds). These changes can ultimately affect microbial biochemical cycling. In this dissertation I evaluated the condition of headwater wetland complexes, in terms of their edaphic properties, edaphic heterogeneity, and microbial communities in two landscape contexts, forested (> 80% forested) and mixed (< 50 % forested), with mixed complexes also having a range of land use legacies. Edaphic properties and heterogeneity did vary between forested and mixed complexes. Edaphic heterogeneity measurements were higher in forested complexes compared to mixed complexes. The most homogenized complexes were those in mixed landscapes with past residential, cropland, and fill activities. In forested complexes the spatial heterogeneity of edaphic properties, most notably of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil moisture, were associated with a range of microbial habitats that varied in microbial biomass and composition. This range in microbial habitats was absent from complexes within mixed landscapes. In fact, these complexes, although left to reestablish after legacy land uses, were not necessary developing microbial communities similar to those in forested landscapes. This was evident through the differences between microbial community composition, pH, and soil texture classes of mineral soils across the landscape classes. The large difference in SOM accumulation between landscape contexts was further assessed by developing a method to characterize a portion of the labile SOM pool. This fraction was quantitatively and compositionally more sensitive to landscape context than SOM levels. The overall lack of SOM accumulation in mixed complexes was attributed to differences in vegetative community composition and structure (via temperature shifts), and hydrological regime shifts thought to affect litter quality inputs, decomposition rates, and/or the amount of scouring.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7215], "author_name_tesi": "Moon, Jessica Beth", "last_name_ssi": "Moon", "middle_name_ssi": "Beth", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Denice Heller Wardrop", "Robert P Brooks", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Jennifer Macalady", "Douglas Archibald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Denice Heller Wardrop, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert P Brooks, Committee Chair", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member", "Douglas Archibald, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wetlands", "soils", "microbial communities", "heterogeneity"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Franchising and top management team (TMT) decisions in the US restaurant industry", "id": "24915", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10995", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to investigate how upper theory accounts for risk-averse strategic decisions. This study chose top management team (TMT) as a proxy for upper echelon. The main attributes of TMT in this research were age, tenure, education, equity ownership, and stock options. The study selected franchising as a representation of a risk-averse strategy, based on the arguments of the resource scarcity theory, agency theory, and risk-sharing theory, and it examined the moderating effect of internationalization between the attributes of the TMT and franchising decisions. Since restaurant industry has the largest contribution of franchising revenues to the US economy more than any other industry, it was chosen as the context of this research. The sample was derived from the Execucomp, Compustat, Annual 10-K database, and other publicly accessible resources (e.g., Linkedin and Business week). The study period was 2000-2013 and 29 restaurant companies were used for data collection. The panel feasible generalized square (FGLS) was used to analyze the data in order to minimize the biases of heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation that could occur due to the use of panel data. The results of this study suggest that age, education, and share ownership were influential attributes to explain overall franchising decision of TMTs. In addition, this study found that there was a significant moderating effect between the attributes of the upper echelon theory (e.g., tenure, education, and share ownership) and the degree of internationalization to explain franchising decisions.

Patients with cirrhosis and chronic liver disease developed approximately 70-90% of all detected hepatocellular carcinoma incidence. Patients with hereditary hemochromatosis have an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma.  Dietary iron overload in individuals in Africa has also been associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.  These findings indicate that hepatic iron may play a role in development of liver cancer.  Iron has been proposed as a promoter leading to cancer indirectly or directly.  The mechanisms by which excess hepatic iron may contribute to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma are not fully understood.  However, iron is known to generate reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals, which can attack macromolecules nonselectively.  Moreover, iron may impair the tumoricidal activity of macrophages.\n\tThe aim of this dissertation was to investigate the role of hepatic iron on acute and chronic liver toxicity.  Four systems were utilized to achieve three specific aims; 1) to investigate the role of iron on acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity in vitro, 2) to determine the effects of iron overload on APAP toxicity in vivo in a mouse model, 3) to establish an appropriate human cell culture model system to study the interaction between iron overload and hepatitis C virus (HCV).  \n\tTo induce acute liver toxicity, APAP was used because it has been used as a representative toxicant to study drug-induced liver toxicity.  Long-term cultured primary mouse hepatocytes were established in dimethyl sulfoxide and iron overloaded by 3,5,5-trimethyl-hexanoyl ferrocene (TMHF) treatment.  APAP toxicity, when evaluated in long-term cultured primary mouse hepatocytes by using a cell viability assay, induced cytotoxicity in a dose- and time-dependent manner.  The reduction of glutathione upon APAP treatment indicates that APAP is metabolized in this cell culture system and glutathione is reduced by APAP metabolites.  Special emphasis was placed on oxidative stress produced by APAP toxicity in Aim 1 of this dissertation project.  When cells were exposed to APAP, the production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial permeability transition occurred and progressed with time.  Furthermore, when cells were treated with either TMHF or desferoxamine to regulate intracellular iron levels along with APAP treatment, the generation of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial permeability transition was accelerated in the presence of excess iron, and delayed when iron was depleted.  These results indicated that iron plays a role in APAP toxicity and in APAP induced reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction.   \n\tThe effects of excess hepatic iron on acute liver toxicity were also studied in mouse hepatocytes in vivo in the intact liver.  An iron overload mouse model generated by feeding a TMHF diet was used.  Iron deposits were present in TMHF-treated mice.  Upon APAP treatment, control mice showed liver damage as expected.  In contrast, no liver damage was observed in TMHF-treated mice.  No significant increase in alanine amino transferase levels, histological changes, or APAP/nitrotyrosine protein adducts were detected in TMHF-treated mice.  Glutathione peroxidase 1 protein levels as well as liver selenium levels were reduced dramatically in TMHF-treated mice.  Decreased glutathione peroxidase 1 and/or reduced selenium levels may be associated with protection against APAP in the iron overload mouse model.  Further studies are needed to evaluate how elevated hepatic iron protects against APAP toxicity in vivo.  \n\tTo assess the role of hepatic iron in HCV pathogenesis, human hepatic cell lines were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide to induce growth arrest.  These cells were then exposed to TMHF containing medium.  Huh7.5 and C3A cells were successfully growth arrested as well as iron-loaded.  Subgenomic HCV baculoviruses were used to introduce the HCV genome.  C3A cells were found to be the most appropriate cell line for dimethyl sulfoxide growth arrest, response to TMHF treatment, baculovirus transduction, and HCV protein expression, suggesting that C3A cells can be used in future studies with the goal of examining the effect of hepatic iron on HCV gene expression.  The replicon assay was performed with the goal of generating HCV replicons from C3A cells but no colonies were formed using C3A cells.  Since microRNA (miR122) is known as a cellular factor for HCV RNA replication, a miR122 containing construct was generated and transfected into C3A cells to generate C3A miR122-stable cell lines.  MiR122 cell lines were successfully generated and the expression level of miR122 varied in individual cell lines.  However, miR122 cell lines did not form geneticin-resistant colonies, indicating that expression of miR122 was not sufficient to overcome the unfavorable environment C3A cells for HCV RNA replication at least at the level of the replicon assay and replicon construct used in this project.  Adding cellular adaptive mutations to the HCV replicon constructs used as well as carrying out other assays to detect HCV replication need to be pursued to reach conclusions regarding the ability of HCV to replicate in C3A miR122 cell lines.\nIn this dissertation, the role of hepatic iron has been evaluated in different systems.  All results indicate that hepatic iron has an important role particularly in acute liver toxicity.  Future studies needed to investigate the relationship between iron and HCV will be carried out using systems generated from this dissertation work. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4493], "author_name_tesi": "Moon, Mi Sun ", "last_name_ssi": "Moon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mi Sun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet C Isom", "Harriet C Isom", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Jianming Hu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harriet C Isom, Dissertation Advisor", "Harriet C Isom, Committee Chair", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mitochondrial Dysfunction", "Oxidative Stress", "Liver", "Acetaminophen", "Hepatic iron", "Hepatitis C virus", "Iron-overload"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A Strategic Module-Based Platform Design Method for Developing Customized Families of Products and Services", "id": "8295", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5846", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For mass customization environments, many companies are increasing their efforts to reduce cost and time for developing new products and services while satisfying individual customer needs. Most products these days include bundles of services to help satisfy customers\u00a1\u00af needs and remain competitive in the market. Product family design facilitates mass customization by allowing highly differentiated products to be developed around a platform while targeting products to distinct market segments. Therefore, effective platforming of products and services is a cost-effective way to achieve mass customization. The objective in this research is to develop a Strategic Module-based Platform Design Method (SMPDM) to determine a platform design strategy to support product and service family design in a dynamic and uncertain environment. The proposed method extends concepts from product family and product platform design into service design, emphasizing a bottom-up approach and module-based design. Ontologies and object-oriented concepts are used to represent products and services and enable sharing and reuse of design information. Data mining techniques are used to identify a platform and modules by utilizing design information stored in a large database or repository. To determine a platform for family design in a dynamic and uncertain market environment, the SMPDM uses agent-based decision-making, involving a market-based negotiation mechanism and a game theoretic approach based on module-based platform concepts and a mathematical model. To demonstrate and validate the usefulness of the proposed method, it is applied to two industrial examples (a family of power tools and a family of checking account services) and tested in multiple scenario-based experiments. The SMPDM provides an optimal platform design strategy that can be adapted to various dynamic and uncertain market environments.

A composite analysis is performed for the years\n1980 through 2004. Individual life cycles are\nidentified by local maxima in synoptic-scale eddy energy. Two types of baroclinic\nlife cycles are examined, each defined by the strength of the barotropic energy\nconversion two days prior to the maximum baroclinic growth. For one life cycle,\nthe barotropic conversion is anomalously weak before the maximum baroclinic\ngrowth, and for the other life cycle, the barotropic conversion is anomalously\nstrong. These two life cycles are refered to as the weak barotropic (WB) and\nstrong barotropic (SB) life cycles, respectively.\n\nThe analyses for the WB (SB) life cycle finds that a strengthening\n(weakening) of the poleward wave activity flux relative to that of the climatology\ntake place before the initial growth of the synoptic scale eddies. For the WB (SB)\nlife cycles, this change in the wave activity flux is shown to induce a mean meridional\ncirculation which weakens and broadens (strengthens and narrows) the midlatitude zonal\nmean jet, and reduces (increases) the baroclinicity in the midlatitude lower troposphere.\nSince the eddy growth rate is found to be greater in the WB case, these results\nsuggest that the influences of the barotropic governor mechanism (a reduction in\nhorizontal shear coinciding with more rapidly growing baroclinic eddies) and\nthe midlatitude baroclinicity oppose each other at the beginning of the life cycle,\nwith the former being dominant.\n\nBoth the WB and SB life cycles coincide with an active Madden-Julian Oscillation\n(MJO). For the WB (SB) life cycle, the MJO convection corresponds to a strengthening\n(weakening) of the convection in the western tropical Pacific.

In addition, very few clinical have focused on asthmatics who are smokers.\n\nObjective: The objective of the research is to evaluate whether or not the FEV1 measurements taken at home are comparable to the spirometry performed in a clinical setting.\n\nMethods: The SMOG study data from all 44 nonsmokers and 39 light smokers will be obtained for evaluation. Of the original sample population, 34 non-smokers and 33 light smokers will be obtained for analysis. Linear mixed models will be conducted using the dependent variable, spirometry FEV1 measurements in a clinical setting. The independent variables will be the following: diary FEV1 measurements, age, height, weight, gender, race, and smoking history. Descriptive statistics were used to provide summary statistics of both dependent and independent variables. Concordance agreement and Pearson\u2019s correlation will be used to evaluate diary card FEV1 measurements and spirometry FEV1 measurements in a clinical setting.\n\nResults: The Asthma Clinical Research Network conducted a study in asthmatics who smoke, called \u201cSmoking Modulates Outcomes of Glucocortoid Therapy (SMOG).\u201d The SMOG study had a mean age of 29.4 years (6.9). There were 34 females and 33 males. The overall average height was 67.3 inches (3.8). Overall, there were 15\n \n\n(22.4%) Black (non-Hispanic Origin); 6 (9.0%) Hispanic; 6 (9.0%) Other; and 40 (59.7%) White (non-Hispanic Origin). The smoking status of the study population consisted of 33 (49.3%) smokers and 34 (50.7%) non-smokers. The average weight was 179 pounds (47.1). The linear mixed-effects model showed a statistically significance effect between the clinical spirometry FEV1 measurement and each of the following variables: the morning FEV1 diary measurement (p<0.0001); height (p<0.0001); gender (p=0.0116);  Black (non-Hispanic Origin) race (p<0.0001); Hispanic race(p<0.0001); and the intercept (p=0.0378).  The linear mixed-effects model without morning FEV1 diary measurement as a prognostic factor, showed a statistically significance effect between the clinical spirometry FEV1 measurement and the evening FEV1 diary measurement (p<0.0001). The linear mixed-effects model, without evening FEV1 diary as a prognostic factor, showed a statistically significance effect between the clinical spirometry FEV1 measurement and the morning FEV1 diary measurement (p<0.0001). The weighted and un-weighted Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient between the morning diary FEV1 and Clinical Spirometry FEV1 has a value of\n0.81 (0.69, 0.89) and 0.81 (0.69, 0.89) respectively.

The Pearson\u2019s Correlation has shown a strong positive relationship between spirometry in a clinical setting and morning diary FEV1. . The Pearson\u2019s Correlation also has shown a strong positive relationship between spirometry in a clinical setting and evening diary FEV1. The Concordance Agreement suggests a positive agreement with both the peak flowmeter measurements (morning or evening) and the spirometry in a clinical setting. We conclude that there is an agreement between the diary card measurements and clinical spirometry but further testing is required due to the weak to moderate relationship.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10393], "author_name_tesi": "Moore, Amy Frances", "last_name_ssi": "Moore", "middle_name_ssi": "Frances", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vernon Michael Chinchilli", "Lan Kong", "Kristen H Kjerulff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Thesis Advisor", "Lan Kong, Thesis Advisor", "Kristen H Kjerulff, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["FEV-1", "Smoking Asthmatics", "Longitudinal Analysis", "Spirometery", "Home-Monitoring of FEV-1"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Latino/as with Disabilities: Do gender and race influence vocational rehabilitation?", "id": "11190", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "18", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this paper is to examine the differences of VR acceptance rates when comparing race and gender within the Latino ethnicity.

These changes result predominantly from alterations in the structure and function of the heart and blood vessels.  However, much of our current understanding about the aging cardiovascular system comes largely from studies performed using men.  This dissertation consists of four studies that used secondary analyses to examine the influence of aging on cardiovascular function using women.  The first two studies investigated the effects of age and the menopause transition on arterial baroreflex control of cardiac activity.  The second two studies examined the effects of age and menopause on skeletal muscle vascular tone at rest and during acute exercise.\nThe purpose of the first study (Chapter 2) was to determine whether cardiovagal baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) is lower across stages of the menopause transition in healthy middle-aged women.  Women (41 \u2013 59 yrs) were categorized into early perimenopausal, late perimenopausal, and early postmenopausal groups using the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop criteria.  BRS was determined by averaging the regression coefficients of spontaneous corresponding sequences of increasing and decreasing systolic blood pressure and R-R interval (i.e., the sequence method). There was an overall influence of menopause stage on BRS (p = 0.018).  Specifically, BRS values declined across menopause stage groups with a statistically significant difference observed between the early perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women (p = 0.017).  In the combined sample of women, BRS was best explained by a model containing systolic blood pressure and follicle-stimulating hormone (r2= 0.57, p < 0.001).  These findings suggest that the menopause transition may contribute to the decline in cardiovagal BRS with age in women.  \nHaving a higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) appears to partially preserve cardiovagal BRS in older men.  To what extent BRS can be modulated by CRF in older women remains unknown.  Thus, the purpose of the second study (Chapter 3) was to determine the association between CRF and BRS in healthy older women, and to compare this association to that observed in older men.  Healthy, older (60 \u2013 80 yrs.) women and men were recruited from the local community and underwent CRF (graded treadmill exercise) testing.  BRS was assessed using the sequence method. There was no association between peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) normalized to either total body mass (r2 = 0.0063, p = 0.71) or lean body mass (r2 = 0.0092, p = 0.64) and BRS in older women.  In older men, BRS was similarly not associated with total body mass- (r2 = 0.0085, p = 0.70) or lean body mass- (r2 = 0.029, p = 0.48) normalized VO2peak.  These findings suggest that spontaneous cardiovagal BRS is not influenced by CRF in healthy older women and men.  \nThe purpose of the third study (Chapter 4) was to examine the influence of age on basal sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone in the leg muscle vasculature of women.  While muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) is elevated with advancing age, correlational evidence suggests that, in contrast to men, basal MSNA is not related to resting lower-limb hemodynamics in women.  To address this issue, changes in femoral artery vascular conductance (FVC) during an acute sympatho-inhibitory stimulus (-60 mm Hg neck suction, NS) were measured in groups of healthy younger (23 + 1 yrs.) and older (66 + 1 yrs) women.  The percent change in FVC in response to NS was significantly augmented in the older (p = 0.006 versus young) women.  Whereas NS caused no significant change (3 + 3 %, p = 0.33) in FVC in the young women, there was a robust increase in FVC (21 + 5 %, p = 0.003) in the old women.  These findings provide evidence that leg sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone emerges with age in women.  \n\tThe purpose of the fourth study (Chapter 5) was to investigate the influence of the menopause transition on skeletal muscle vascular responses to acute exercise.  Leg exercise hemodynamics during single-leg knee extensions were compared among healthy groups of early perimenopausal, late perimenopausal, and early postmenopausal women.  Femoral blood flow (FBF) and vascular conductance (FVC) at rest and during very light work rates (0 and 5 Watts) were similar among all three menopause stage groups.  Vascular responses at 10 Watts (FBF) and 20 Watts (FBF and FVC) were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in early perimenopausal compared with late perimenopausal women.  At 15 and 25 Watts FBF and FVC were similar between late perimenopausal and early postmenopausal groups, but higher (P < 0.05) in early perimenopausal women as compared with the other two menopausal groups.  In the combined sample of all three menopause stage groups, follicle-stimulating hormone was significantly correlated with vascular conductance during submaximal (15 Watts) exercise (R = -0.56, P < 0.001), even after adjustment for age, fitness, LDL cholesterol and abdominal fat (R = -0.46, P = 0.005).  These findings suggest that leg vascular responsiveness during exercise may become altered as a result of the menopause transition.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10166], "author_name_tesi": "Moore, David ", "last_name_ssi": "Moore", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Mary Jane De Souza", "Urs Andreas Leuenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor, Committee Chair", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Jane De Souza, Committee Member", "Urs Andreas Leuenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Aging", "Exercise", "Women", "Autonomic", "Heart Rate", "Blood Flow", "Menopause", "Baroreflex"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A case study of rural elementary principals' conceptualization of the least restrictive environment for students with disabilities", "id": "15506", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7931", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Elementary principals are expected to create a nurturing environment where all students, including students with disabilities, can experience successful academic and social developmental gains.

Within this class of polymers, ion-containing block copolymers hold promise in advancing our understanding of the structure-property relationships of water-absorbing, ion-containing membranes through their unique ability to form tunable ionic domain morphologies.\n\tNon-ionic block copolymers have been studied extensively and the theory of how their nanophase structure is formed and the experimental methods for probing their phase behavior are well-documented in the literature.  However, the addition of ions to these systems may change the traditional descriptors of phase formation in block copolymers by introducing strong electrostatic or hydrogen bonding interactions into one of the blocks.  Therefore, much attention has recently been given to the study of how the chemical composition and ion content of ion-containing block polymers affect their morphology.  These studies of phase formation, combined with work on how the microphase separated morphology affects transport properties, e.g. ion conductivity, will help to advance the design of next-generation, ion-containing block copolymer membranes for ion and water transport applications.  \nThe focus of this thesis is to elucidate the phase behavior and ion transport properties of sulfonated and quaternary ammonium-containing triblock copolymers.  The polymers studied in this work are sulfonated poly(hexyl methacrylate)-b\u00ac-poly(styrene)-b-poly(hexyl methacrylate) [PHMA-SPS-PHMA], sulfonated poly(perfluorooctyl methacrylate)-b\u00ac-poly(styrene)-b-poly(perfluorooctyl methacrylate) [PFMA-SPS-PFMA], and quaternary ammonium functionalized poly(styrene)-b\u00ac-poly(ethylene/butylene)-b-poly(styrene) [QA-SEBS].  In particular, the work presented here describes the investigation of the effect of functionalizing the midblock of the sulfonated triblock copolymers with the idea that the hydrophobic endblocks will help to increase mechanical stability of the film when the polymer is introduced to humidity.  This study also investigated how the morphology of end-block functionalized quaternary-ammonium containing triblock copolymers change when introduced to varying levels of humidity. Small angle x-ray scattering and transmission electron micrography were used to quantitatively probe the morphology of the samples.  Water uptake and impedance spectroscopy provided information on the transport properties of these samples.  Comparisons are drawn between samples with different levels of functionalization and some comments are made on the basic mechanisms of phase formation in sulfonated and quaternary-ammonium containing block copolymers.\nIn the study of midblock functionalization, two different endblocks, poly(hexyl methacrylate) and poly(perfluorooctyl methacrylate), were chosen to observe how the hydrophobic portion of the polymer affected the morphology and conductivity of the membranes.  Fluorinated PFMA endblocks produced materials with less order that materials with PHMA triblocks in unannealed solvent cast films, likely due to solubility and kinetic trapping issues, and these less-ordered samples showed lower proton conductivity.  Better ordering of the non-fluorous PHMA-containing block copolymers was due to their low Tg and good solubility during membrane casting.  Poly(hexyl methacrylate)-b\u00ac-sulfonated poly(styrene)-b-poly(hexyl methacrylate) transitioned from lamellar to disordered to hexagonally packed cylindrical morphologies with increasing functionalization while poly(perfluorooctyl methacrylate)-b\u00ac-sulfonated poly(styrene)-b-poly(perfluorooctyl methacrylate) remained disordered throughout all tested levels of functionalization.  \nQuaternary ammonium functionalized SEBS block copolymers showed no change in morphological order with increased functionalization or increased humidity.  The ionic domains swelled during water uptake, and the change in interdomain spacing with relative humidity depended on the percent functionalization of the styrene domain.  High conductivity with low water uptake was obtained for a QA-SEBS sample with high unfunctionalized styrene content which had very low swelling upon humidification. \nThese results demonstrate that different trends may be observed for sulfonated and quaternary ammonium triblock copolymers as dictated by the ion clustering in each system and the chemical details of the backbone. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2164], "author_name_tesi": "Moore, Hunter David", "last_name_ssi": "Moore", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Hunter", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Anthony Hickner, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ion-containing polymers", "block copolymers"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Flame-spreading phenomena in a head-end fin-slot segment of a subscale motor simulating the space shuttle boosters\n\n", "id": "8114", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2627", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fin-slot solid propellant grains have been used in a variety of solid rocket propulsion systems, most notably in the Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) Boosters.  Advantages that can arise from using fin-slot grains compared to conventional end-burning or center-perforated grains include a relatively constant burning surface area and thrust level, large free volume, and greater exposed surface area for reliable ignition.  The influence of the igniter jet can have a profound effect on recirculating flow patterns, due to impingement angle, degree of under-expansion, and strength of the induced vortex.  In order to accurately predict the overall RSRM ignition transient, it is necessary to have knowledge of the igniter induced flow, heat-transfer, and flame-spreading rates inside the fin region.  This research was aimed at obtaining a better understanding of the effect of flame spreading in the fin-slot section of the rocket motor.\nExperimentally, a subscale (roughly 1:10) pie-shaped fin-slot motor was designed to simulate two fin-slot regions.  The test rig consisted of a head-end igniter, a fin-slot propellant section, a downstream cylindrical propellant grain section, and an interchangeable external exit nozzle.  Diagnostically, the motor was equipped with pressure transducers, a set of sacrificial and main viewing windows for real-time imaging, and a diagnostic holder capable of mounting an array of flush-mounted heat-flux gauges, near-IR fast-response photodetectors, acoustic emission sensors, or fine-wire thermocouples in a perpendicular orientation.\nThe first part of this study dealt with the design and assembly of the rocket motor along with the testing and analysis of the igniter induced flow field and heat-transfer to the propellant surface.  Experiments were conducted using heated air flow as well as the direct discharge of a live igniter onto an inert fin-slot propellant sample.  Results were used to develop a heat-transfer correlation within the fin-slot region.  Deduced heat-transfer rates from this correlation were in good agreement with the measured data within experimental error.\nThe second part of this study was the observation and characterization of the flame-spreading phenomena across the fin-slot surface using a combination of a high-speed digital camera and non-intrusive photodetector optical methods.

In this dissertation, aspects of mineral dissolution and weathering were studied in granitic chronosequences. A chronosequence is a set of soils where four of the five soil-forming factors\u2013climate, lithology (or similar parent material), organisms, and relief are similar. Chronosequence soils are differentiated by their age, or by time, and are useful natural laboratories for studying shifts in geochemistry and ecology through time.\n\tTwo granitic chronosequences were studied as part of this dissertation: Santa Cruz and Merced. The Santa Cruz chronosequence is located on the coast of California near the city of Santa Cruz. The Merced chronosequence is located along the Merced River in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada, Ca. \n\tTo provide kinetic data for modeling chronosequence weathering, dissolution rate data for gibbsite, &#948;-Al2O3, and the sheet silicate minerals (SSM) chlorite, kaolinite, vermiculite, illite, and smectite were compiled and synthesized (chapter 2). The synthesized data sets were used to propose dissolution rate versus pH rate laws for each of the minerals. Rate laws produced from several data sets are more reliable than data sets from any single investigator, and comparison of kinetic data sets from multiple minerals may point to similar dissolution processes. For example, the differences among the dissolution rates of the common soil minerals illite, smectite, and kaolinite were <0.5 log units. Some of the rate laws proposed were used as model input for the reactive transport modeling conducted in chapter 4.\n\tTo understand how subsurface biota varies across chronosequences, the size and composition of soil microbial communities were investigated at Santa Cruz (chapter 2). Soil microbial community size and composition changed as a function of soil age with more significant changes in the subsurface. The shifts in size and composition were primarily correlated to C within a soil (with C decreasing as a function of depth) and with chemical changes (driven by mineral dissolution) between soils. In the subsurface communities, the proportion of fungi increased with soil age, consistent with the fungal proportion increasing as nutrient concentrations decreased. Microbial community activity may feedback into weathering processes by promoting kaolinite and Fe oxide precipitation. Precipitation is promoted as microorganisms consume organic ligands complexed with Al and Fe, releasing the Al and Fe back into solution where precipitation into the solid phase is likely.  \n\tA reactive transport code, FLOTRAN, was successfully used to model mineral dissolution in granitic soil and saprolite as old as 3000 ka. FLOTRAN was used to explore a number of factors proposed to be responsible for the three to five order of magnitude difference in laboratory and field rates. The most important factors controlling the depth and thickness of plagioclase reaction fronts were the pore fluid flow rate, the reactive surface area, and to a lesser extent the form of the rate law (i.e., transition-state theory or sigmoidal). Successful model predictions were achieved by adjusting the pore fluid flow rate to match the depth of plagioclase reaction fronts and by adjusting the reactive surface area to match the thickness of plagioclase reaction fronts. The best models, which included a sigmoidal rate law, predicted the difference between laboratory and field rates to be less than one order of magnitude for the Davis Run, Virginia (USA) saprolite (800 ka) and approximately two orders of magnitude for the Merced, California (USA) chronosequence (40 - 3000 ka). The smaller difference for Davis Run where >3 times as much precipitation falls as Merced indicated that heterogeneous hydrology, such as dead end pores, may slow rates by at least an order of magnitude in dry soils. A model that successfully predicted soil mineralogy after 250 ka of weathering also predicted aqueous Na+ concentrations and pH reasonably well.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3192], "author_name_tesi": "Moore, Joel ", "last_name_ssi": "Moore", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Joel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley", "Jennifer Macalady", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Lee Kump"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Chair", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Lee Kump, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["granite", "chronosequence", "mineral", "weathering", "soil"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "School Readiness and Academic Achievement in Second Grade\n", "id": "10071", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2660", "abstract_tesi": "Children raised in low-income families experience delays in cognitive and academic performance as of school entry.

Based on studies assessing the relation between school readiness and academic achievement, specific aspects of children\u2019s academic readiness, including vocabulary, reading, and math abilities and components of cognitive readiness, such as attention, are consistent predictors of later academic success.

The sample consisted of 306 children who attended an enhanced preschool program and were followed from preschool to 5th grade.  Children experienced a considerable amount of growth in reading and math skills relative to national norms from Kindergarten to 5th grade.  Results revealed that predictors of children\u2019s vocabulary skills in Kindergarten and 5th grade included preschool vocabulary and reading abilities, and emotion knowledge; emotion knowledge also predicted growth in elementary vocabulary skills.  Preschool reading and math were significantly related to Kindergarten and 5th grade reading; emotion recognition was related to 5th grade reading ability.  Preschool pre-reading skills were associated with growth in elementary reading, with a narrowing of the gap by 5th grade between those with lower and higher abilities in preschool.  Kindergarten and 5th grade math skills were predicted by preschool math and reading; sustained attention predicted Kindergarten math.  Preschool pre-math abilities predicted growth in math, with the gap between lower and higher achieving students narrowing during elementary school. Even within a disadvantaged population, variations in maternal education predicted Kindergarten academic abilities.  After accounting for preschool academic abilities, demographic factors did not predict growth in academic achievement during elementary school.\nDespite previous studies which have not found a relation between the social, emotional, and behavioral aspects of school readiness on children\u2019s later academic achievement, the current study found that children\u2019s with higher emotion knowledge in preschool had higher scores in vocabulary and math in elementary school.

These properties are the basis for a variety of topics\nin chemistry, such as single molecule spectroscopy and organic photovoltaic systems. In fact,\nthe most recent Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded for work in the \feld of single molecule\n\nuorescence. While single-molecule \nuorescence is now widely used within both the chemical and\nbiochemical communities, its spectroscopic signal gives very little information about the structure\nand identity of the \nuorophore. Surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), on the other\nhand, can be used to uniquely identify a molecule as well detect the presence of a known scatterer.\nRaman di\u000bers from \nuorescence, as its the result of the inelastic scattering of photons by a\nmolecule rather than an absorption process. These scattered photons contain information about\nthe vibrational and rotational states within the molecule, similar to IR spectroscopic techniques.\nHowever, the Raman signal from a single molecule is very weak. The mechanisms behind SERS\nprovide su\u000ecient enhancement to enable single molecule detection and identi\fcation. Modeling\nSERS and other surface-enhanced properties is di\u000ecult due to the complex interactions between\nthe molecule and the metal surface. In order to accurately describe how these interactions impact\nthe electronic structure, we require \frst-principles based methods. Density functional theory\n(DFT) remains the go-to method for simulations of large systems thanks to its balance between\naccuracy and computational complexity. However, one encounters certain failures within DFT\nthat limit its application to accurately describing the interactions between molecules and metal\nsurfaces. In principle, DFT is an exact method if one knows the correct exchange-correlation\n(XC) potential. In practice, this potential is only an approximation determined by an XC\nfunctional. Many XC functionals exist and the accuracy of a DFT calculation is highly dependent\non the choice of XC. Recently, a new class of XC functionals called long-range corrected (LC)\nfunctionals have been developed that show signi\fcant improvement to the traditional failures of\nDFT. Of particular interest is their ability to be `tuned' in order to enforce properties that the\nexact XC functional would have. In this dissertation, we present the importance of using LC\nfunctionals when describing the electronic structure of molecules on metal surfaces using DFT.\nWe \frst demonstrate how LC functionals improve the description of the energy gap between\nthe frontier orbitals for a set of substituted pyridines on a small silver cluster. This allows\nfor a better prediction to the magnitude of the SERS enhancement. While DFT is capable of\ndescribing `large' systems on the order of hundreds of atoms, realistically sized nanoparticles with\ndimensions on the order of 1 to 100 nm can contain between 300 and 10,000,000 atoms, making\nthem computationally intractable even for DFT. In order to go beyond small metal clusters, we have developed a hybrid model that combines a quantum mechanical description of a molecules\nusing density functional theory (DFT) with a classical atomistic electrodynamics model of the\nmetal system. We present here a new implementation of the discrete interaction model/quantum\nmechanical (DIM/QM) method within the NWChem computational package. We demonstrate\nthat by combining DIM/QM with the tuning of LC functionals, we can accurately describe the\nchanges in electronic structure seen when molecules approach a metal surface at a signi\fcantly\nreduced computational cost compared to other methods. These changes are important to capture\nin a metal-molecule system, as they signi\fcantly alter the molecule's optical properties. In\naddition, we have made several improvements to the underlying DIM/QM algorithm which\ndecrease the computational cost of DIM/QM by \u0019 30%. Furthermore, we extend DIM to\naccount for experimentally observed changes in the optical properties of metal nanoparticles with\ndimensions less than < 10 nm. Finally, we introduce a novel stand-alone program used to rapidly\ngenerate roughened sphere and spheroidal geometries. In collaboration with an experimental\ngroup, we demonstrate that these roughened nanoparticles provide a more accurate description\nto the optical properties of irregularly shaped aerosol particles. The tools and methods presented\nhere will further our understanding of metal-molecule interactions of large systems, such as those\nin the \felds of single molecule electronics, plexitonics, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering.\niv", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11358], "author_name_tesi": "Moore, Justin Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Moore", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lasse Jensen", "Lasse Jensen", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Benjamin James Lear", "Gerald Knizia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lasse Jensen, Dissertation Advisor", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Chair", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Gerald Knizia, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electronic Structure", "DFT", "SERS", "LC Functionals", "Orbital Renormalization", "QMR"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Scrutiny on the Bounty: From Crisis Communication to Crisis Conversation", "id": "22721", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10437", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Few crisis communication theories have been studied in the last decade with as much rigor as Situational Crisis Communication Theory. With its assertion as a predictive, prescriptive, and evidence-based approach to aid crisis communication managers and professionals, numerous studies have tested facets of this theory with varying degrees of success. However, as crisis communication activity increasingly involves online communication, and social media in particular, new avenues of exploration are opened to examine this theory further as new questions come to light. Such as: what impact does the technology of social media have on the practice of crisis communication? How does the prescriptive format of this theory fit the realities of small business and organizations? As social media invites internal stakeholders and fans into open conversation with organizations, and as fans take it upon themselves to speak in defense of organizations during a crisis event, what is the impetus for this behavior and is there a way to capture and quantify this behavior as it manifests online? Do the older theories of crisis communication have utility when involved stakeholders are increasingly more conversant?\n The sinking of the tallship the HMS Bounty and the use of the organization\u2019s Facebook fan page for the purposes of crisis communication sets the context for this research. As the singular point of communication from the organization to the public, the case is examined from the perspectives of the parties of interest using Situated Crisis Communication Theory and Halo Effect as a guide. A mixed method was used for discovery, triangulation, and cross-validation of analysis. Data was collected from the organization\u2019s Facebook status updates and corresponding comments before, during, and after the sinking and assessed each quantitatively and qualitatively. Further, online conversations regarding the event in various forums and community pages were analyzed as well. Lastly, interviews were performed with persons from various stakeholder groups involved on the online conversations and were reviewed for clarification of events and more in-depth analysis. \nKey findings of this research identified a disparity between the applicability of SCCT and the realities of small businesses especially fan-based organizations, that technology has the potential to exacerbate secondary crises, and that there may be a predictive quality of fans exhibiting halo effect behavior. Implications of this research include a more in-depth understanding of technology mediated crisis communication and organizational practices by which to reconsider existing theories as well as design implications for Facebook.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10096], "author_name_tesi": "Moore, Kathleen Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Moore", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrea H Tapia", "Christopher H Griffin", "Carleen Frances Maitland", "Michel M Haigh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrea H Tapia, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher H Griffin, Committee Member", "Carleen Frances Maitland, Committee Member", "Michel M Haigh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Crisis Communication", "social media", "Facebook", "Situational Crisis Communication Theory", "Halo Effect"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Relationship of Personal Characteristics of Educational Leaders On Their Interpretation of Policy And Decision Making Regarding Zero Tolerance Weapons Violations In K-12 Environments\n", "id": "7646", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3777", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Litigation, educational literature and the popular press indicate that implementers of zero tolerance school policies have varied policy interpretations during their decision-making.

First, I examine the nature of global problems and explain why they challenge traditional understandings of moral responsibility. While attributions of responsibility typically hold in cases where the causes and effects of an act are immediate and intentionally committed, the causes of many global problems are both spatially and temporally diffuse and include contributions from agents ranging from states (e.g., through public policy) to individuals (e.g., through everyday life practices, such as filling up a gas tank or buying inexpensive clothing). Second, I examine the limitations of existing attempts in global and environmental ethics to ground claims of individual responsibility for global problems. Third, I argue that the ethics of care, which has been underutilized in philosophical debates in environmental and global ethics, can illuminate the nature of individual responsibility in these contexts in a way that avoids problems with existing accounts of global responsibility. To do so, I first respond to critiques that care ethics is overly focused on immediate and particular relations and cannot be applied to global settings. To overcome these criticisms, I examine the nature of care and develop an account of the duty to take care, i.e., the kind of obligation that agents have to care for general others. I then show how the duty to take care can be extended to global relations and argue that it requires agents to be attentive and responsive to the distant effects of their actions. Last, I apply this care-based understanding of individual responsibility to the issue of climate change. In doing so, my dissertation calls upon feminist moral theory to intervene in debates in global and environmental ethics on the difficult problem of explaining the kind of responsibility individuals have to respond to complex global problems.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11603], "author_name_tesi": "Moosa, Christina Shaheen", "last_name_ssi": "Moosa", "middle_name_ssi": "Shaheen", "first_name_ssi": "Christina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Philip Christman", "Nancy A Tuana", "Sarah Clark Miller", "Jonathan Harold Marks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Philip Christman, Dissertation Advisor", "Nancy A Tuana, Committee Member", "Sarah Clark Miller, Committee Member", "Jonathan Harold Marks, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["care ethics", "global responsibility", "climate change"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "ONE SIZE FITS ALL?: PROFILES OF DIFFERENTIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAJECTORIES IN OLD AGE\n", "id": "12314", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2705", "abstract_tesi": "Lifespan research has long been interested in intra-individual changes within and structural relations between domains of functioning.

The first project in this thesis explored the\nquestion of whether the carboxyl-terminus of hsc70 interacting-protein (CHIP) was\ninvolved in the regulation of the ligand-mediated degradation of the AhR in an ubiquitin\nand proteasome-dependent process. CHIP associates with chaperones such as hsp90 and\nhsc70 and negatively regulates their ability to function as protein folding complexes,\ncausing client proteins (e.g., estrogen receptor) to be degraded through the proteasome.\nImmunoprecipitates of the AhR revealed that CHIP could also associate with the AhR\nprotein complex at cellular levels and the transient expression of CHIP in cell cultures\nresulted in AhR protein turnover. Through the use of in vitro reconstitution assays,\niv\nsucrose gradient fractionation, and RNA silencing methods we established that the E3\nubiquitin ligase CHIP can mediate ubiquitination of the AhR and hsp90. However, CHIP\ndid not seem to regulate the steady-state protein levels of the AhR nor the ligandmediated\ndegradation of the AhR.

In these pages I have adopted an alternative ethnography, drawing concepts and methods from the arts and social sciences.  The two questions propelling this dissertation are:  (1)  How did the methodology of the exhibition development process of the R\u00e9gence Room affect its intended interpretation? and (2) How do visitors respond to their R\u00e9gence Room experience?  This is an arts-based autoethnography, which uses ethnographic drama to express research findings.  Evocative narratives communicate introspection, emotion, and subjectivity, and a reflexive dialectic of childhood memories to reflect my attempt to understand what the R\u00e9gence Room is and what it means, and to locate a place for myself in the world of art education.  \n\nI review the literature on period rooms, tracing the changes wrought through time and space from their inception to recent re-examinations/installations in museums across America.  I proffer a historical sketch of one paneled room's history from its original location in Paris to its acquisition, installation, and interpretation at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, California.  I connect data gathered through standard academic research conducted in special collections archives, participant interviews and observations with fictionalized accounts of period interiors in literature and film.  I  engage in non-traditional ways of thinking about and looking at a period room.  I point out some issues that have restrained a richer interpretation of the R\u00e9gence Room, including aversion to change and risk-taking, intolerance for ideological differences, poor inter-departmental communication, and a lack of period room programming for visitors' edification\u2014general and informed public alike.  Evocative narratives offer a pedagogical approach to this type of museum display that can communicate the transformational aspects of museum period rooms by questioning those who construct them and those who experience them.  Engaging in non-traditional ways of thinking about and looking at period rooms can bring the varied experiences of the room to life, and this is enhanced by the ethnographic drama in Chapter Four.  Scenes, based on unique participant conversations and observations of visitors, create a fictional virtual reality (incorporating some fiction) in which readers can imagine themselves and make their own interpretations.  Data gathered from archival research, interviews, and observations are viewed as a complex group of performances found in and carried through sounds, words, images, gesture/movement, costume, and setting.  \n\nFinally, I speculate about the implications for developing and interpreting period rooms in ways that incorporate a strategy for an ethic of care and consideration for multiple perspectives and principles from the visual arts, performing arts (culinary, music, dance, and theatre), and literary arts.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6170], "author_name_tesi": "Morales, Teresa I.", "last_name_ssi": "Morales", "middle_name_ssi": "I.", "first_name_ssi": "Teresa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Ann Stankiewicz", "Charles Richard Garoian", "David M Ebitz", "Joyce Henri Robinson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Ann Stankiewicz, Committee Chair", "Charles Richard Garoian, Committee Member", "David M Ebitz, Committee Member", "Joyce Henri Robinson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["museum exhibits", "museum education", "decorative arts", "furniture", "art history"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Longitudinal Associations between Temperament and Socioemotional Outcomes in Young Children: The Moderating Role of Rsa Reactivity\n\n", "id": "19608", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9324", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Temperament is an important predictor of socioemotional adjustment, such as externalizing and internalizing disorders (Kagan & Fox, 2006; Rothbart & Bates, 2006; P\u00e9rez-Edgar & Fox, 2005).  However, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between temperamental predispositions and these outcomes, implying that other factors also contribute to the development of internalizing and externalizing problems.  Self-regulation is believed to interact with temperament, and hence, has also been studied as an important predictor for later socio-emotional outcomes (Rothbart, 2011).  Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is a psychophysiological measure of self-regulation (Beauchaine, 2001; Porges, 2007) that has been found to moderate the relation between other types of risk (e.g., parental drinking, marital conflict, domestic violence) and socioemotional disorders (El-Sheikh, 2001; El-Sheikh et al., 2001; Katz, 2007).  The primary aim of the present study was to test RSA reactivity as a moderator of the relation between temperament in infancy and externalizing and internalizing problems at kindergarten entry.  Results showed that RSA moderated the relation between exuberant and fearful temperament and externalizing behaviors.  However, these results were different for boys and girls.  The fearful temperament predicted later internalizing problems, but no moderation was present in predicting internalizing problems.  These results are discussed in light of recent evidence regarding gender differences in the role of RSA as a protective factor for risk.  Finally, this study explores RSA trajectories as moderators of the relations between early temperament and socioemotional problems.

Attention bias towards threat is the tendency to systematically attend to threatening cues in the environment and it may play a crucial role in the emergence and maintenance of anxiety. A growing number of studies suggest that individuals with high trait or clinical anxiety show a heightened attention bias to threat, making it an important marker of anxiety. Moreover, experimental interventions have found that manipulating the levels of attention bias consequently reduced levels of anxiety and sensitivity to stress, suggesting that such interventions could be used for preventive or therapeutic purposes. However, recent studies have reported mixed findings. This inconsistency complicates the interpretation of attention bias to threat as a marker of anxiety, as well as its potential as an effective intervention. Importantly, this variability in the findings is not considered to represent \u201cnoise,\u201d but meaningful individual differences in how anxiety and attention bias manifest. The goal of the current dissertation was to better characterize these individual differences. This goal was accomplished by performing three separate studies that together addressed two outstanding issues of the current attention bias literature. \nThe first was to study attention bias and its relation to anxiety from a developmental approach as most empirical investigations and theoretical models of attention bias lack a developmental perspective. The other major outstanding issue in the current attention bias literature is that the mechanisms behind attention bias are not well understood. The present dissertation investigated the mechanisms of attention bias by using several methods. Specifically, these studies employed multiple attention bias tasks, measured eye movement, assesed neural correlates, and evaluated the impact of a theoretically relevant congnitive process (i.e., effortful control).\nThe results from the current dissertation suggest that: 1) it is important to consider cross-task attention bias convergence as this may index important individual characteristics such as fearful temperament and/or anxiety; 2) Attention bias can be captured during infancy and that meaningful individual differences in attention bias exist from early in development such as relations with known risk factors for anxiety; 3) other cognitive functions like effortful control likely play an important role in the relations between attention bias, fearful temperament, and anxiety. More specifically, that in early childhood, effortful control likely serves as a protective factor rather than a risk factor.

It consumes large amounts of methane and is a significant component of the global carbon and methane cycles. I employed an interdisciplinary approach to help enlighten AOM by looking at both the activity of related processes and incubations of AOM-containing sediments.  \n\nTrace methane oxidation (TMO) is a process, potentially related to AOM, by which archaeal methane producers (methanogens) oxidize small amounts of methane.  I used a stable isotope tracer to examine this process in multiple archaeal sulfate reducer and methanogen cultures (with emphasis on Methanosarcina acetivorans cultures).  I provide new evidence that co-enzyme M reductase, a key enzyme of methanogenesis, is likely involved in AOM.  I also observed that a suite of oxidizing agents included in the incubations did not enhance TMO rates. Finally, I demonstrated that, under specific culture conditions, the rate of TMO to methyl sulfide products in M. acetivorans is nearly seven times greater than to any product ever previously reported for TMO.  I used incubations of active AOM sediment to demonstrate that hydrogen does not play a metabolic role in AOM consortia.  These experiments, combined with thermodynamic and geochemical considerations, suggest that methyl sulfides may be the long-sought intermediate metabolite and crucial to the AOM metabolism. \n\nThe potential role of methyl sulfides in AOM increases the need for understanding their formation in related pathways.  I demonstrate the first instance of energy conservation through methyl sulfide production by a methanogen, M. acetivorans, and the first documented instance of methyl sulfide production from a carbon monoxide substrate. \n\nI also developed a new approach for isolating taxon-specific RNA sequences in preparation for stable isotope analysis.  I used a DNAzyme containing a catalytic motif with variable recognition domains.  I used M. acetivorans RNA to develop and test the approach in preparation for potential application in AOM investigations.  \n\nFinally, in testing the potential influence of oxidizing agents on TMO I discovered that M. acetivorans was capable of growth under a microaerophilic atmosphere.

TKR is increasingly being performed on patients 55 years of age and younger, and these patients are more likely to have post-operative complications than older patients.  It has been speculated that younger patients place greater functional demand on their replaced joint sometimes exceeding the capabilities of the implants.  The impetus behind this dissertation was the creation of novel methodologies, both computational and experimental, that could be used to systematically investigate the dynamic relationship between implant design and function.  Four studies investigated the relationship between implant design or surgical technique and joint stability and function.\n\nThe first study involved the development of a dynamic computer simulation of a TKR implant range of constraint test.  A rigid-body-spring model was utilized to compute implant contact forces and experimental measurements were used to validate the model.  Model outputs compared favorably to experimental constraint values only when artifacts in the laxity testing simulator were represented.\n\nThe second study augmented the range of constraint test simulation by modeling the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL).  The addition of the PCL made it possible to assess laxity in TKR designs that retain this ligament.  A tight PCL can limit joint laxity and impair function following TKR.  Two surgical treatment options, increased posterior tibial sloping and partial PCL release, were simulated to assess their individual and combined effectiveness at reducing PCL tension and improving laxity.  Although both treatments were effective at increasing anterior laxity, only partial PCL release was effective at increasing overall anterior-posterior laxity.\n\nThe third study employed a novel dynamic mechanical TKR simulator to assess functional differences between two variations of a reduced patellar height.  Reduced patellar height is likely to disrupt the extensor mechanism following TKR.  The mechanical knee simulator applied physiological loads across both the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral joints.  Both forms of reduced patellar height substantially increased the quadriceps force required to extend the knee.  With a reduced patellar height, a symmetric patellar implant was more resistant to abnormal tracking than an anatomic patellar implant.\n\nThe final study investigated the micromotion of two cementless femoral components with different designs during squat, gait and chair rise simulations.  The presence of micromotion above a certain threshold can prevent bony ingrowth and potentially lead to implant loosening.  A novel method was developed to measure the pattern of micromotion between the femoral component and an underlying bone substitute.  No statistical differences in micromotion were noted between the TKR designs for gait or chair rise simulations, but significant differences were found for squatting simulations.  The micromotion of the femoral component was found to occur in three dimensions, contrary to previous reports.\n\nIn conclusion, this dissertation outlined novel methodologies used to investigate the role of TKR motion.  Through these research methodologies new TKR designs can be evaluated and improved prior to implantation.  Although TKR is an attractive and effective approach for thousands of patients afflicted with arthritis, future work should be directed at optimizing TKR design and surgical technique to further improve post-operative function. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4095], "author_name_tesi": "Moran, Matthew Francis", "last_name_ssi": "Moran", "middle_name_ssi": "Francis", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Neil Sharkey", "John Henry Challis", "Andris Freivalds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Chair", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Member", "John Henry Challis, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["total knee replacement", "biomechanics", "orthopedics", "joint arthroplasty"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Evolution of the Legal Relationship between Penn State and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania", "id": "14898plm150", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14898", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Public higher education faces a crisis in the twenty-first century. While a college education has never been more vital to individual and societal success, state governments have increasingly withdrawn their support for public colleges and universities. National trends suggest that reductions in state funding for public higher education will not subside anytime soon. Public institutions of higher education have compensated for weakening state support by increasing tuition and implementing market-responsive strategies aimed at reducing costs, diversifying revenue streams, and increasing operational efficiencies. The growing privatization of American public higher education has myriad implications for college access, affordability, and quality, and also raises questions about the future relationships between public universities and state governments. \nAs the pressures to privatize continue to mount, public colleges and universities have been exploring policy options to provide them with the autonomy necessary to nimbly respond to market forces and pursue new sources of revenue. An understanding of the historical evolution of institution-state relationships provides the context for evaluating potential policy options. The purpose of this dissertation is to advance our understanding of the origins and subsequent development of the legal relationship between one state, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and one public institution of higher education, the Pennsylvania State University. \nThrough a historical legal analysis, this study traces the evolution of the legal relationship between Penn State and Pennsylvania. This study reveals that the ambiguous legal relationship between Penn State and Pennsylvania developed in a haphazard manner. This ambiguity emerged from the contested land-grant origins of the University and has been reinforced by several legal authorities throughout the years. In addition, the failure to establish a statewide strategy for the development of public higher education in Pennsylvania engendered the haphazard evolution of Penn State\u2019s legal relationship with the Commonwealth. As a result, the University exhibits traits of both public and private universities. However, this study argues that the haphazard development of the legal relationship between Penn State and Pennsylvania has provided the University with the governance structure and flexibility to thrive in the current economic and policy context of American public higher education.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16145], "author_name_tesi": "Moran, Peter L", "last_name_ssi": "Moran", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neal Hutchens", "Dorothy Evensen", "Fred Loomis", "David S Guthrie", "Peter Hopsicker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neal Hutchens, Special Member", "Dorothy Evensen, Committee Chair", "Fred Loomis, Committee Member", "David S Guthrie, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter Hopsicker, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["higher education", "governance", "legal"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Body Politic: Government and Physique in Twentieth Century America\n", "id": "18782", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "9064", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although often believed to be a recent phenomenon, there is a long history of federal projects designed to shape American weight and physique.

However, very limited research has been done to understand the processing-microscructure-property relationships that govern the optical properties of \u03b1\u2019-SiAlON ceramics.  In order to understand these relationships, this thesis explores the factors that control the formation of AlN-polytypoids and the dominant sources of visible light transmission loss in \u03b1\u2019-SiAlON ceramics.\nA preliminary study was performed to produce transparent \u03b1\u2019-SiAlON with equivalent or superior forward light transmission of \u03b1\u2019-SiAlONs reported in the published literature.  The resulting samples were analyzed using backscatter electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy.  Residual AlN-polytypoid and amorphous glass were observed as secondary phases.  \nDue to the lack of knowledge about the refractive indices for AlN-polytypoids, the effects of the AlN-polytypoids on visible light transmission in \u03b1\u2019-SiAlON were explored by attempting to remove the phase from the microstructure.  Based on a review of the literature, it is proposed that AlN-polytypoid formation occurs via heterogeneous nucleation on large AlN-particles.  Various compositions were made to reduce the AlN-polytypoid concentration based on the \u03b1\u2019-SiAlON formation reaction sequence and the heterogeneous nucleation hypothesis.  Utilizing backscatter electron microscopy, the amount of AlN-polytypoids was determined for each composition.  The results show that large AlN particles nucleate AlN-polytypoid phases.  When utilizing excess liquid phase, the AlN-polytypoid concentration is dependent on the relative composition of the liquid phase.  When the samples are AlN deficient,  there is a significant decrease in the AlN-polytypoid concentration due to the increased driving force for AlN particle dissolution and the presence of fewer AlN particles. \n\nThe optical properties of the compositionally shifted \u03b1\u2019-SiAlON ceramics were compared utilizing a backlit background and viewing the textual contrast with the sample 10 cm above the background.  UV-visbile spectroscopy was utilized to quantify the optical properties on the ceramics.  A correlation was not found between the visible light transmission of the various compositions and the AlN-polytypoid concentration.  Stronger absorptions and other potential scattering sources were observed in samples with excessive residual amorphous glass phase.  A trend was found between the residual amorphous glass phase concentration and the light transmission, but only at high (>2-3 vol%) concentrations.  It was concluded that neither the amorphous glassy grain boundary phase nor AlN-polytypoids were acting as the dominant light scattering source in this study\u2019s \u03b1\u2019-SiAlON ceramics.  Absorption by free Si is believed to account for some of the transmission losses based on the absorbance peaks around 300 nm to 320 nm in all samples.\n\nThe effects of birefringent scattering on the light transmission were explored by analyzing the grain size of the various \u03b1\u2019-SiAlON ceramics.  A general trend among all samples could not be found due to either the small differences in grain size or the presence of other scattering/absorption sites.  The aluminum nitride deficient samples showed the largest changes in grain size and improvement in the transmission.  Based on these samples, an attempt was made to reduce the grain size further by seeding the microstructure of \u03b1\u2019-SiAlON with excess \u03b1-Si3N4 -from the commercial powder.  The minimum \u03b1-Si3N4 nuclei size in the samples was determined to be \u2248400 nm.  The addition of 17.13 wt% excess \u03b1-Si3N4 powder with respect to the sample weight was predicted to reduce the grain size to 0.7 \u03bcm.  The resulting seeded sample had a grain size of 0.77 \u03bcm.  It was concluded that the larger particles in the initial \u03b1-Si3N4 powder limited the reduction of the average grain size.  Additionally, x-ray diffraction found that J\u2019 phase formed as an intermediate phase during sintering which may have further reduced the potential number of excess \u03b1-Si3N4 nuclei.  Qualitatively, the excess Si3N4 sample shows better textual contrast than the AlN deficient samples when looking at backlit text, but the UV-visible spectroscopy analysis shows less total transmission in the seeded sample with respect to the AlN deficient samples, which was attributed to greater absorption processes from free Si.  The improvement in the total transmission in the aluminum nitride deficient and seeded samples with respect to the other samples was attributed to a reduction in the grain size.  It was concluded that birefringence and absoprtion processes by free Si were the dominant sources of visible light transmission loss in the samples.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9830], "author_name_tesi": "Morandi, Carl Sebastian", "last_name_ssi": "Morandi", "middle_name_ssi": "Sebastian", "first_name_ssi": "Carl", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Lynn Messing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Lynn Messing, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["\u03b1\u2019-SiAlON", "Ceramics", "Light Transmission", "Transparent \u03b1\u2019-SiAlON", "Translucent \u03b1\u2019-SiAlON", "AlN-Polytypoid", "Microstructure Control"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Effects of a Fraction Equivalence Intervention Combining CRA-I and Number Line Representations", "id": "14163smm636", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14163", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines the effects of an instructional intervention focused on fraction equivalence content using explicit instruction and concrete-representational-abstract-integrated (CRA-I) format lessons.

Attracting and retaining effective teachers has historically presented a considerable challenge for schools across many nations.  Experts have predicted significant teacher shortages in the near future along with a growing demand for qualified teachers due to increased student enrollment, retirement, and high levels of attrition (Tillman & Tillman, 2008).\nAs teacher shortages continue to increase, the importance of retaining existing qualified teachers will also increase.  Thus, it is essential that policy makers and school administrators develop new and better ways for recruiting and retaining new teachers.  The goal of this study was to provide school leaders with information related to beginning (first-year) Career and Technical Education (CTE) teacher retention and to offer strategies and recommendations focused on improving teacher retention and quality within the CTE profession.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between retention and professional mentoring of beginning CTE teachers in the United States.  The specific focus was on the characteristics (demographic data) and opinions of individuals who remained in the teaching profession after completing their first year as a CTE teacher, and comparing these characteristics and opinions with those held by individuals who left the teaching profession after their first year as a CTE teacher.\nSpecifically, this study was designed to analyze secondary data collected through the Teacher Follow-up Survey (TFS) and the Beginning Teacher Longitudinal Study (BTLS).  The TFS and BTLS are interrelated and were concurrently conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on behalf of the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES), which is affiliated with the U.S. Department of Education.  The secondary data used in this research included a modified sample of 110 beginning CTE teachers who taught students in grades 9\u201312, within public schools, during the 2007\u201308 school year.  These findings are based on the data collected through the 2008\u201309 BTLS Questionnaires (TFS-2L and TFS-3L), which were examined during this study.\nIt was determined that of the 110 beginning CTE teachers in this modified BTLS sample (CTE teachers only), 16.1% left the teaching profession after their first year, while only 10.3% of the original BTLS sample left teaching after their first year.  Based on these findings it can be suggested that, for this sample, beginning CTE teachers are more likely to leave teaching after their first year than are other beginning teachers.\nThe results presented here also strongly suggest that several relationships exist between retention and professional mentoring among the beginning CTE teachers in this modified sample.  These findings indicate that effective professional mentoring does benefit beginning CTE teachers while also increasing their rate of retention.  Specifically, beginning CTE teachers who indicated having been assigned a mentor were 6.64 times more likely to remain in teaching than beginning CTE teachers who had not been assigned a mentor.\nBased on these results, it can also be concluded that the retention of beginning CTE teacher can be significantly improved by identifying mentoring components that teachers believe will improve their teaching, and then attempt to increase the frequencies of teacher-mentor interactions in these areas.  To identify the significant components of mentoring programs, this study specifically sought to ascertain the impact of selected professional mentoring components on the retention of beginning CTE teachers.  Data from this study revealed that teacher retention is positively impacted by increasing the frequency and effectiveness of beginning teachers\u2019 and their assigned mentors\u2019 interactions in the following areas: subject matter and grade level taught by beginning CTE teacher; classroom management and student discipline; incorporating a variety of instruction methods; assessing students and interpreting assessment data; adapting curriculum, instructional materials, and/or writing lesson plans; interacting with parents; and reflecting on teaching practice.\nThese findings provide greater insights into existing relationships between retention and professional mentoring for beginning CTE teachers and inspire recommendations for future policy and decision making in this area.  It is presumed that increasing teacher retention can significantly improve learning opportunities, student achievement, and utilization of school funding.  Further, findings can contribute to improving the quality of education provided to CTE students and offer information that may be used by school administrators to increase the efficiency of school funding allocations. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7966], "author_name_tesi": "Mordan, Benjamin Ray", "last_name_ssi": "Mordan", "middle_name_ssi": "Ray", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert W Clark", "Robert W Clark", "Cynthia Pellock", "Richard Allen Walter", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert W Clark, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert W Clark, Committee Chair", "Cynthia Pellock, Committee Member", "Richard Allen Walter, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["professional mentoring", "retention", "career and technical education", "beginning teachers"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Passive Detection of Unintended Radio Emissions", "id": "24903", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11360", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There are many methods on the market for detection of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED's).
