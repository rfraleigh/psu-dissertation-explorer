For this purpose, optimization of the material was studied, as was the incorporation of piezoelectric films into low frequency mechanical harvesters.\nA systematic analysis of the energy harvesting figure of merit was made. As a figure of merit (e31,f)2/\u03b5r (transverse piezoelectric coefficient squared over relative permittivity) was utilized. PZT films of several tetragonal compositions were grown on CaF2, MgO, SrTiO3, and Si substrates, thereby separating the dependence of composition on domain orientation. To minimize artifacts associated with composition gradients, and to extend the temperature growth window, PZT films were grown by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Using this method, epitaxial {001} films achieved c-domain textures above 90% on single crystal MgO and CaF2 substrates. This could be tailored via the thermal stresses established by the differences in thermal expansion coefficients of the film and the substrate.  The <001> single-domain e31,f for PZT thin films was determined to exceed \u221212 C/m2 in the tetragonal phase field for x \u2265 0.19, nearly twice the phenomenologically modeled value. The utilization of c-domain PZT films is motivated by a figure of merit above 0.8 C2/m4 for (001) PZT thin films. Increases to the FoM via doping and hot poling were also quantified; a 1% Mn doping reduced \u03b5r by 20% without decreasing the piezoelectric coefficient. Hot poling a device for one hour above 120 \u00b0C also resulted in a 20% reduction in \u03b5r; furthermore, 1% Mn doping reduced \u03b5r by another 12% upon hot poling.\nTwo methods for fabricating thin film mechanical energy harvesting devices were investigated. It was found that phosphoric acid solutions could be used to pattern MgO crystals, but this was typically accompanied by damage to the PZT film. An energy harvester was fabricated by etching the MgO substrate down to 10-20 \u03bcm under a circular diaphragm device; this structure had a natural frequency of 2.7 kHz and was estimated to provide a maximum RMS power of 8.8 \u03bcW/cm2\u2219g2. Due to the lack of selectivity in the patterning, MgO was not as versatile as silicon substrates, which can be etched rapidly by wet and dry methods.\nTo successfully release a PZT film onto a polymer passive elastic layer, dry (gas) etch methods were preferable. This protected the interfacial bonding between PZT films and Parylene. A 2 cm2 thin film membrane (15 \u03bcm Parylene/ 3 \u03bcm Cyclotene 4022/ 0.1 \u03bcm Pt-Ti/ 1.4 \u03bcm PZT (52/48)/ 0.14 \u03bcm Pt-Ti/ 1 \u03bcm SiO2) was released from a silicon substrate and operated with a 5 Hz natural frequency, the lowest reported for a thin film energy harvester operating in resonant excitation. Though problems existed with buckling of the beam due to tension in the Cyclotene 4022 (a benzocyclobutene, BCB, resin) from curing on a silicon substrate, the cantilevered device was calculated to output up to RMS 0.53 \u03bcW/cm2 when swept through an arc >30\u00b0. Silicon substrates facilitated scaling in size and quantity of devices compared to MgO substrates, which motivated an investigation into the reduction of 90\u00b0 domain walls for thin films released from substrate clamping conditions. \nCircular test structures were designed to produce systematic changes in the clamping condition of {001} PZT thin films. The stiffness of the substrate interface was modified either by using a PZT buffer layer on the substrate or by removing the substrate completely. Films allowed to stress relax upon release, via curling, had reduced domain wall restoring force compared to fully clamped structures, leading to a 72% increase in irreversible domain wall contributions for free-standing 300 \u03bcm features. The irreversible dielectric Raleigh coefficient, \u03b1, for a 1.64 \u03bcm {001} PZT film measured at 20 Hz increased from 40 cm/kV to 71 cm/kV in this way. \nGriggio et al., Phys. Rev. Let. 108, no. 15 (2012) 157604 reported \u03b1 of 148 cm/kV at 100 Hz for broken sections of 70 \u03bcm diaphragms. To understand the relationship between \u03b1 reported in those experiments and the results of this thesis, the size dependence of \u03b1 was investigated by partitioning 300 \u03bcm diaphragms into wedges. Both \u03b1 and the frequency dispersion of \u03b1 increased as the membrane was sectioned.  This was attributed to a decrease in the elastic restoring force for domain walls. Interface (local) stresses were found to have a smaller impact on domain wall mobility, even after the domain structure was annealed above the Curie temperature post release.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10512], "author_name_tesi": "Yeager, Charles B", "last_name_ssi": "Yeager", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Charles", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Qiming Zhang", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ferroelectric domain", "e31f", "energy harvesting figure of merit"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Novel Ohmic Contact Schemes for Iii-v Semiconductors", "id": "19122", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9198", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis addresses a number of techniques to reduce the speci\ufb01c contact resistance of Ohmic contacts to lightly doped n-In0.53Ga0.47As epilayers and nanostructures. It also explores metal reactions to and electrical measurements of nanostructured n-In0.53Ga0.47As. Solid phase regrowth (SPR) contacts were used to introduce excess Si dopant to heavily dope the near-surface region of InGaAs. By optimizing the Pd/Si atomic ratio of a Pd/Si/Pd/Ti/Au contact, speci\ufb01c contact resistances of 9\u00d710^\u22128 \u00b1 2\u00d710^\u22128 \u03a9-cm^2 and 1.8\u00d710^\u22128 \u03a9-cm^2 were achieved for lightly (ND = 1\u00d710^17 cm^\u22123) and heavily doped (ND = 3\u00d710^19 cm\u22123) epilayer samples, respectively. These values are record lows compared to SPR contacts previously reported in literature. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) and current-voltage temperature (I-V-T) measurements supported the SPR mechanism as the predominant cause of the reduced speci\ufb01c contact resistance in these contacts.\nTo further lower the speci\ufb01c contact resistance to lightly doped n-In0.53Ga0.47As epilayers, an ammonium sul\ufb01de surface treatment was used in conjunction with the SPR contact. This surface treatment signi\ufb01cantly reduced the speci\ufb01c contact resistance to a minimum of \u03c1c = 2.6\u00d710^\u22128 \u00b1 1.7\u00d710^\u22128 \u03a9-cm^2. This value is only slightly higher than the lowest reported values on n-In0.53Ga0.47As reported in the literature, but is achieved on an epilayer with much lower dopant concentration (ND = 5\u00d710^17 cm^\u22123) compared to the epilayers used in the literature (n > 3.5\u00d710^19 cm^\u22123). The ammonium sul\ufb01de surface treatment did not reduce the speci\ufb01c contact resistance of a Pd/Ti/Au contact, suggesting that SPR is essential for enabling the surface treatment. XTEM showed that the morphology of this sulfur-treated SPR (S-SPR) contact did not differ from that of the SPR contact. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) suggested but did not con\ufb01rm that S from the surface treatment diffused into the InGaAs layer as a co-dopant.\nA Fin-TLM (transmission line method) structure was designed and fabricated to investigate the electrical properties of lightly (ND = 5\u00d710^17 cm^\u22123) and heavily doped (ND = 3\u00d710^19 cm^\u22123) etched n-In0.53Ga0.47As nano\ufb01ns with diameters as low as 50 nm. The results of these measurements showed that the SPR contact could yield a low speci\ufb01c contact resistance on the heavily doped nano\ufb01ns (\u03c1c = 1.07\u00d710\u22127 \u00b1 5\u00d710\u22128 \u03a9-cm^2) fairly close to the measured value of that contact on the respective planar layer. However, the measured speci\ufb01c contact resistances of SPR contacts to the lightly doped nano\ufb01ns were between 1\u00d710^\u22123 \u03a9-cm^2 and 1\u00d710^\u22126 \u03a9-cm^2, much higher than those achieved on planar contacts to lightly doped (ND = 1.0\u00d710^17 cm^\u22123) InGaAs. The extracted sheet resistances of these lightly doped samples were also much higher than those of the planar samples, suggesting that surface depletion of the nano\ufb01ns a\ufb00ected the electrical measurements. Although depositing a thin layer of Al2O3 reduced the extracted sheet resistance and its deviation, it did not signi\ufb01cantly reduce the measured speci\ufb01c contact resistance. Beyond the possibility of surface depletion, the higher contact resistance may have been caused by di\ufb00erent reactions of the deposited metals with the di\ufb00erent faces of the nanofin geometry. Etched n-InGaAs nano\ufb01ns of different orientations with deposited Pd and Ni were annealed at 200\u25e6C and 400\u25e6C for 2 min to study the reaction of these metals with the nano\ufb01ns. At both 200 and 400\u25e6C, nano\ufb01ns partially covered with Pd decomposed significantly, while nano\ufb01ns partially covered with Ni did not. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) maps showed no Pd diffusion down the length of the fins, suggesting a vapor- phase reaction mechanism. Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) maps of the Pd contact surface supported this hypothesis. Nano\ufb01ns completely covered with Pd annealed at 200\u25e6C did not show this decomposition behavior, but did show orientation-dependent reaction behavior.\n\nThis thesis provides valuable information for hardware engineers and designers as aggressively scaled transistors continue to transition towards non-planar structures and require even lower speci\ufb01c contact resistances to perform at ultra-high frequencies.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9018], "author_name_tesi": "Yearsley, Joshua David", "last_name_ssi": "Yearsley", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney", "Roman Engel Herbert", "Joan Marie Redwing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney, Thesis Advisor", "Roman Engel Herbert, Thesis Advisor", "Joan Marie Redwing, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ohmic contacts", "metal/semiconductor contacts", "doping", "materials science"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Modeling The Effects Of Salt Precipitation And Kinetic Mineral Reaction On Well Injectivity Due To Carbon Dioxide Injection In Deep Saline Aquifers", "id": "22717", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10206", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Little is known about the complex processes taking place between CO2, the host formation, and in-situ brine at the conditions found within deep saline aquifers during CO2 injection for the purposes of long term sequestration.

A commercial reservoir simulator was used to develop several studies in order to observe the scale and extent of host mineral dissolution and precipitation as well as halite mineral precipitation following CO2 injection into a siliciclastic deep saline formation. Dissolution was observed to be the predominant mineral reaction however limited scale resulted in minimal impact on well injectivity. Halite precipitation in the near well region was found to provide limited impacts on well injectivity.

PEMFC efficiencies are limited by the slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode, which uses active but high cost Pt catalysts. The ORR and possible adsorption of electrolyte anions occur at the electrolyte/cathode interface, and are controlled by the complex interactions between molecules and ions with the solvated electrode under applied electrode potentials. The dielectric and transport properties of water near the electrode are different from those in bulk water, and water facilitates proton transfer to the cathode. However, interfacial water structure and dynamics are not well defined, and the influence of interfacial water on electrochemical reactions is poorly understood at the molecular level.  The electrode potential provides a driving force for electrochemical processes by changing the electron chemical potential, and affects interfacial water structure, dynamics, and the binding strengths of reaction intermediates. The presence of water and electrode potential creates substantial challenges in atomistic modeling of the ORR and ion adsorption at the electrolyte/cathode interface.\nThis dissertation develops and applies a series of atomistic modeling approaches to link macroscopic electrochemical measurements with atomistic-level processes at the electrolyte/electrode interface. Various density functional theory (DFT) based electrochemical models were utilized to investigate the influence of water structure and electrode potential on the ORR and ion adsorption reactions at Pt(111) electrodes. We performed a detailed study of aqueous sulfuric acid electrochemistry on the Pt(111) surface, and assign three characteristic voltammetric peaks to different bisulfate/sulfate adsorption processes. This modeling work resolves the adlayer composition and structure, a longstanding goal of previous experimental studies. DFT models are also applied to investigate the elementary reaction kinetics of the ORR over Pt(11) electrodes. For this PEMFC cathode reaction, we observed that the ORR reaction path and the rate-limiting step depend on the electrode potential. This result is consistent with potential dependent ORR reactivity in experiments and provides possible ORR mechanisms.\nThe use of a static water structure in DFT models limits the robustness of a pure DFT analysis. The length and time scales associated with the dynamic interface are beyond DFT methods.  The influence of model choices on reaction energetics and reaction path determinations is demonstrated in this dissertation. The water structure dependence of ORR reaction energetics motivated us to develop a molecular dynamics (MD) model to probe water structure fluctuation and dynamics at the electrified water/Pt interface. This is the first MD model that combines a potential controlled electrode with a reactive water force field, and thus allows us to study proton transfer dynamics at the water/Pt interface. Our simulations suggest a connection between electrolyte dynamics and surface reactions, where the slower charge transfer of OH- compared to H3O+ may account for less efficient hydrogen oxidation in an alkaline electrolyte compared to an acid electrolyte.     \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7951], "author_name_tesi": "Yeh, Kuan-yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Yeh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kuan-yu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael John Janik", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Darrell Velegol", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael John Janik, Dissertation Advisor", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fuel cells", "oxygen reduction reaction", "electrochemical interface", "DFT models", "MD simulations"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Toward understanding the cognitive processes of software design in novice programmers\n\n", "id": "9775", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3536", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study provides insights with regard to the types of cognitive processes that are \ninvolved in the formation of mental models and the way those models change over the course of a \nsemester in novice programmers doing a design task.

By leaving the original rigid pavement in place, the underlying structure is undisturbed; the existing rigid pavement structure can thus be considered in overlay design, typically resulting in a thinner overlay.  In addition, the application of an interlayer between the overlay and the original rigid pavement may reduce pre-overlay repairs.  Current procedures for airfield unbonded concrete overlay design are documented in advisory circular AC 150/5320-6E, published in 2009, accompanied by the design software \u201cFAARFIELD.\u201d  Due to the lack of comprehensive unbonded concrete overlay experimental data, unbonded concrete overlay design has been considered in the same way as new rigid pavement design, despite the differences in conditions.  \nThis thesis utilizes full-scale accelerated testing data from the National Airport Pavement Test Facility to verify both the mechanistic model (stress computation) and empirical model (fatigue relationship) used in the current unbonded overlay design procedure.  It is proposed that the mechanistic model be refined by including crack density, in addition to the current Structural Condition Index (SCI).  Backcalculation theory is found to affect E-Ratio determination; the E-Ratio from one theory should not directly be used in a model based on another theory.  In addition, E-Ratio predicted from a model developed using data for unbonded concrete overlays is larger than E-Ratio predicted from a model developed based on slab test data, especially at low values of SCI.  It is suggested that the cracked slab model, developed on the basis of WES data (slab data), should not be used for unbonded concrete overlay E-Ratio prediction in FAARFIELD.  \nFor the empirical model, it is concluded that the design factor of an unbonded concrete overlay should consider the interactions between design factors of the overlay and underlying slabs, along with the conditions of the underlying slabs.  The method of determination of SCI for a test item has significant effect on prediction of allowable coverages.  The difference between predicted and observed coverages for the same SCI is much larger when SCI is determined based on partial slabs within a test item, as compared to when SCI is determined based on all slabs within a test item.  Test item SCI, which includes all slabs within a test item for SCI calculation, should be used for failure model development when data from full-scale experiments is used.

The process of tegument assembly and final envelopment has been unfoldeding over the past few decades. It is thought that a few tegument proteins are added to the capsid in the nucleus, whereas most of them are acquired after entering the cytoplasm or traveling to the site of final envelopment at the trans-Golgi network. Overall, the research presented in this dissertation provides insights into the molecular mechanism of protein-protein interactions that may be involved in (or contribute to) assembly and maturation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1).   \n            The UL11 (membrane-bound) and UL16 (capsid-associated) tegument proteins are conserved among all herpesviruses, and interaction between the two has been implicated in linking the viral capsid, tegument, and membrane during final envelopment process. Both in transfected and virus-infected cells, a subpopulation of the UL11 protein was found associated with detergent-resistant membranes via modifications with two fatty- acid chains (myristate and palmitate). UL11 can directly interact with UL16 in a manner dependent on the acidic cluster and leucine-isoleucine motifs of UL11. And, N-ethylmaleimide-modified UL16 was found to be incapable of binding UL11, suggesting that free cysteines in UL16 somehow play a role in the interaction.\n            UL16 is stably associated with cytoplasmic capsids isolated from infected cells. In response to initial attachment of virus to the cell surface, an \u2018outside-in\u2019 signal is transmitted across the virion membrane, and as a result, UL16 is dissociated from the capsid. The mechanism by which the signal is sent to UL16 remains unclear but seems likely to be mediated by the glycoproteins on the virion envelope. A GST chimera bearing the cytoplasmic tail of glycoprotein E (gE.CT) was found to be capable of binding UL16 expressed in mammalian or insect cells. To better understand the molecular mechanism of this signaling process, the interaction network emanating from UL16 was investigated. In addition, previously using a GST pull-down assay, it was observed that UL16 interacts with virus-specific proteins from HSV- and PRV-infected cell lysates, providing evidence that UL16 is present in protein complexes. \n            To characterize native complexes that contain UL16, a recombinant virus was constructed expressing a tagged derivative. Using the combination of tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis, we identified gE to be present in the complexes isolated from infected cells. The UL16-gE interaction was confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation assays with infected cell lysates. Moreover, mutational analyses of gE.CT have suggested that in infected cells UL16 may interact with gE.CT in both UL11-dependent and -independent manners. Based on all available data, we hypothesize that UL11, UL16, and gE may form a tripartite complex which plays a role in multiple aspects of the virus life cycle, including signaling events during virus attachment, virion maturation, or cell-to-cell spread.\n            Collectively, our research focused on the protein-protein network has built a foundation for future studies, and also advanced our current knowledge of herpesvirus replication.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5009], "author_name_tesi": "Yeh, Pei-Chun ", "last_name_ssi": "Yeh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pei-Chun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Warren Wills", "John Warren Wills", "Richard James Courtney", "Rebecca C Craven", "Sarah Bronson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Warren Wills, Dissertation Advisor", "John Warren Wills, Committee Chair", "Richard James Courtney, Committee Member", "Rebecca C Craven, Committee Member", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Herpes simplex virus", "tegument proteins"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Microdevice For Virus Capture And detection", "id": "26273", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11617", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We have witnessed the traumatic impact of viral infectious diseases in the 1918 influenza (H1N1), the emerged HIV/AIDS since the 1970s, the ongoing high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), the recent emerging H7N9 in 2013 and Ebola in 2014, and the most recent H5N2 and H5N8 HPAI in 2015. A highly mutated virus may cause unpredictable outbreaks. As a virus mutates, it has the potential to evolve into a contagious disease that can infect hosts across species and also challenge the isolation and the detection of such an emerging virus. For example, in 2013 a reassortant avian influenza virus strain (H7N9) was found to infect humans, leading to fatal respiratory diseases within 14~26 days. Therefore, rapid isolation, identification, and characterization of viruses from field samples are critical in the prevention of epidemics. \nThis work develops a carbon-nanotube size-tunable-enrichment-microdevice (\u201cCNT-STEM\u201d), a handheld microfluidic device constructed by porous sidewalls made of aligned CNT with a tunable gap size of 25-280 nm to capture virus by physical size exclusion through a size-tunable micro/ultrafiltration. CNT-STEM is portable and capable of handling field samples such as swab and tissue samples. After the virus capture, the device platform can be directly integrated with current state-of-art viral detection methods, such as reverse transcriptase real-time polymer chain reaction (RT-qPCR), immunofluorescent antibody (IF) staining, and next generation sequencing (NGS). The CNT synthesis process was carefully studied and characterized. The CNT forest was integrated into microfluidic devices and its filtration properties, namely porosity and gap size, were optimized. The avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N2 subtype was used as a virus model to validate device performances. The device successfully captured H5N2 from a mimic swab sample. Under extremely low virus titration, the device enriched H5N2 and improved the detection limit of RT-qPCR and virus isolation rate by two orders of magnitude. Identification of \u201cunknown\u201d viruses or emerging new virus strains can be extremely challenging due to the scanty virus amount and unavailability of specific antibodies or genomic sequence information. The CNT-STEM technology can solve this problem by directly enriching viruses from a field sample without any other sample preparation and subsequently analyzing by NGS for whole genome sequences and de novo assembly. As a validation of the CNT-STEM, two different unknown/emerging viruses, infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) and H11N9 AIV, were directly captured and enriched from two types of field samples, tissue samples and swabs, respectively. After enrichment, CNT-STEM enables rapid NGS complete genomic analysis of viruses from field samples. High coverage of complete genomic sequences of the viruses was obtained. This revolutionary technology paves the way to a new point-of-care platform by efficiently capturing and identifying an unknown/emerging virus that could be life threatening. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11121], "author_name_tesi": "Yeh, Yin-ting ", "last_name_ssi": "Yeh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yin-ting", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Siyang Zheng", "Siyang Zheng", "William O Hancock", "Jian Yang", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado", "Huaguang Lu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Siyang Zheng, Dissertation Advisor", "Siyang Zheng, Committee Chair", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Jian Yang, Committee Member", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado, Committee Member", "Huaguang Lu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["virus detection", "point of care", "microfabrication", "carbon nanotube", "microdevice"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF MORE RESOLVED VERSUS LESS RESOLVED COUNTERTRANSFERENCE SELF-DISCLOSURES ON RATINGS OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPIST AND SESSION\n", "id": "10213", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6802", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study sought to examine the content of therapist self-disclosure by focusing on investigating the differential effects of therapist disclosure of resolved versus unresolved countertransference issues on perceptions of therapists and therapy process.

A 2.5L, 4-cylinder, turbocharged, common rail, direct injection light-duty diesel engine was used in generating soot samples. The impacts of engine operating modes and the start of combustion on soot reactivity were investigated first. Based on preliminary investigations, a test condition of 2400 rpm and 64 Nm, with single and split injection strategies, was chosen for studying the impacts of fuel formulation on the characteristics of diesel soot. Three test fuels were used: an ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (BP15), a pure soybean methyl-ester (B100), and a synthetic Fischer-Tropsch fuel (FT) produced in a gas-to-liquid process. The start of injection (SOI) and fuel rail pressures were adjusted such that the three test fuels have similar combustion phasing, thereby facilitating comparisons between soots from the different fuels.\n\nSoot reactivity was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). According to TGA, B100 soot exhibits the fastest oxidation on a mass basis followed by BP15 and FT derived soots in order of apparent rate constant. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates no relation between the surface oxygen content and the soot reactivity. Crystalline information for the soot samples was obtained using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The basal plane diameter obtained from XRD was inversely related to the apparent rate constants for soot oxidation.  For comparison, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) provided images of the graphene layers.  Quantitative image analysis proceeded by a custom algorithm. B100 derived soot possessed the shortest mean fringe length and greatest mean fringe tortuosity.  This suggests soot (nano)structural disorder correlates with a faster oxidation rate. Such results are in agreement with the X-ray analysis, as the observed fringe length is a measure of basal plane diameter. Moreover the relation between soot reactivity and structural disorder is consistent with past work by Vander Wal and co-workers, but stands in contrast to past work by Boehman and co-workers which identified surface oxygen content as the primary explanation for increased oxidative reactivity. The characterization results of this study indicate that changing fuel formulation is a potential method to enhance soot reactivity, and thus diesel particulate filter (DPF) regeneration, through decreasing the degree of order in soot nanostructure.\n\nAll soot samples were partially oxidized to investigate the structural and elemental surface changes during the oxidation process. The HRTEM image analysis of the B100 and BP15 soot at 50% burn-off shows the highly ordered soot nanostructure, coinciding with significant decreases in the apparent rate constants for soot oxidation. In contrast, for FT soot, no significant changes in the soot nanostructure is observed, coinciding with only a slight decrease in apparent rate constant for soot oxidation. The result of HRTEM image analysis and apparent rate constants for soot oxidation show a relationship between the lattice fringe parameters (the median fringe length and mean fringe tortuosity) and the apparent rate constant, coinciding with the trend observed among the initial soot samples generated by different fuels.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3591], "author_name_tesi": "Yehliu, Kuen ", "last_name_ssi": "Yehliu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kuen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Randy Lee Vander Wal", "Angela Lueking", "Thomas Litzinger", "Octavio Armas Vergel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Dissertation Advisor", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Chair", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Committee Member", "Angela Lueking, Committee Member", "Thomas Litzinger, Committee Member", "Octavio Armas Vergel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["diesel combustion", "biodiesel", "Fischer-Tropsch fuel", "soot properties", "soot reactivity", "HRTEM image analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Hyperelliptic Jacobians and their associated $\\ell$-adic Galois representations", "id": "25868", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11474", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Let $k$ be a field of characteristic different from $2$, and let $K$ be the extension of $k$ obtained by adjoining the symmetric functions of the independent transcendental elements $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, ... , \\alpha_{d}$ for some $d \\geq 3$.

Results of structural equation modeling showed that among four kinds of expected tourism impacts, only socio-environmental benefits and economic benefits were positively related to attitudes toward future tourism development. Similarly, many, but not all of the expected tourism impacts contributed to the prediction of behavioral intentions; and, three significant paths were in an unexpected direction. \n\nIn the second article, political trust/distrust and justice were added into the resident participation model to incorporate the utilitarian and normative conformity perspectives. This was done due to the fact that residents may be utilitarian driven and influenced by social norms and principles as well. Results suggested that the relationships between attitude toward current tourism development and intentions were fully mediated by attitude toward future tourism development. The same finding applied to the relationships between expected tourism benefits and intentions. In addition, the relationships between political trust/distrust and intentions were partially mediated by attitude toward future tourism development. Further, four paths were in an unexpected direction. \n\nThe third article focused on expanding understanding of predictable community subgroup differences in attitudes toward local tourism development. Three clusters of residents were identified based on cluster analysis of seven attitude items. The results showed that relationships between antecedents (i.e., expected net tourism impacts, political trust, justice and affect), attitude and intention and composite means of constructs differ to some degree across groups. \n\nTaken together, these results suggest that utilitarian and value based processes both contribute to the understanding of the formation of tourism attitudes and behavioral intentions. Further research is needed to explore the effects of affects in the whole model.  Other related issues recommended for future research are to explore the selective information process and dissonance effect in the community participation model.

Flexible metal foil substrates with high fracture strength are useful in some microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) applications, including wearable piezoelectric sensors or energy harvesters based on Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) thin films. Full utilization of the potential of PZT film on metal foils requires control of the film crystallographic texture to achieve a high figure of merit (FoM) for energy harvesting application. A high level of {001} film orientation enables an increase in the energy harvesting FoM due to the coupling of strong piezoelectricity and low dielectric permittivity.\nIn this study, {001} oriented PZT thin films were grown by chemical solution deposition (CSD) and rf-magnetron sputtering on Ni foil. To overcome the issue with thermodynamic incompatability between the metal substrate and the oxide film during subsequent thermal treatment, pretreated Ni foils were passivated using HfO2 grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Highly {001} oriented PZT films were successfully deposited on Ni foils with (100) oriented LaNiO3 seed layers on HfO2 buffer layers using either chemical solution deposition or rf sputtering. The (001) oriented PZT thin films achieve an e31,f piezoelectric coefficient of -10 ~ -12 C/m2 (which is comparable with (100) textured PZT films on silicon substrate) coupled with a low dielectric constant (330 ~ 530 at 1kHz) after hot poling.\nPiezoelectric energy harvesters with cantilever type structures consisting of PZT films on Ni foil revealed a strong correlation between the FoM and the harvester output. Both increasing the volume of the piezoelectric element (e.g. the film thickness in the 31 mode) as well as inducing a high FoM via hot poling improve the performance of PZT cantilevers.  As a result, it is possible to achieve a power density of 1036 W/cm2G2 with 3 m thick sputtered PZT film on Ni below 100 Hz.\nExtracting energy from low vibration frequencies (<10Hz) is essential for wearable harvesters. Two main types of mechanical energy harvesting devices (e.g. resonant and non-resonant harvesters) were investigated. The Piezoelectric Compliant Mechanism (PCM) design proposed by Ma and Rahn was targeted for high efficiency operation at 5 Hz by fostering a uniform strain for its 1st mode shape. In particular, a PCM energy harvester utilizing {001} textured bimorph PZT films on Ni foil provided a large power level of 3.9 mW/cm2\u00b7G2 and 65% mode shape efficiencies at ~ 6 Hz.\nFrequency-up conversion for non-resonant piezoelectric energy harvesters is an excellent strategy to extract electrical energy from human motion for self-powering portable electronics. Three different designs related to magnetic plucking suggested by Xue and Roundy were explored using bimorph PZT films on flexible nickel foils for wrist-worn harvesters (for which the desired device size is less than 16 cm2). Thick PZT films on Ni foil deposited by high temperature sputtering enable the production of multiple piezoelectric beams with complex designs (e.g., star shaped cantilever beams). Based on analysis of the plucked beam dynamics (simulated by Xue, and Roundy), PZT beams and permanent magnet configuration were selected and demonstrated. The resulting devices successfully convert low frequency vibration sources (i.e. from walking. rotating the wrist, and jogging) to higher frequency vibrations of the PZT beams (100 ~ 200 Hz). Additionally, the devices are able to generate 40~50 W power during mild activities.\nIn summary, strongly {001} oriented bimorph PZT films on flexible metal foils are promising for implementation of high efficiency harvesters with a variety of shapes and dimensions from mm2 to cm2.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15481], "author_name_tesi": "Yeo, Hong Goo", "last_name_ssi": "Yeo", "middle_name_ssi": "Goo", "first_name_ssi": "Hong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Trolier-McKinstry", "Susan Trolier-McKinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Roman Engel-Herbert", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Trolier-McKinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Trolier-McKinstry, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Roman Engel-Herbert, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Piezoelectric material", "PZT film", "Piezoelectric energy harvesting", "Flexible metal substrates"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "NUMERICALLY EFFICIENT TECHNIQUES FOR THE ANALYSIS OF MICROWAVE ANTENNAS, CIRCUITS AND SCATTERING PROBLEMS\n", "id": "6087", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3238", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, three approaches to alleviating the problem of large computation times arising in the Method of Moments (MoM) analysis of electromagnetic (EM) problems are presented. First, a new impedance matrix interpolation algorithm is proposed to speed up the time for matrix generation over a wide frequency range for planar microstrip structures. We extend the free space impedance matrix interpolation method to planar microstrip structures by using the properties of the associated Green\u00a1\u00afs function over the frequency range of interest. We do this by first computing and storing the impedance matrix elements at three selected frequencies, and then generating them at intermediate frequencies within the band via interpolation. The present interpolation scheme differs from those employed previously in a rather significant way, because it uses \u00a1\u00b0different\u00a1\u00b1 interpolating functions in three different regions, viz., near, intermediate and far, defined on the basis of the distance between the source and the testing functions. We also investigate the problem of deriving an optimum interpolation step size for microstrip structures that depends on the largest distance between the source and testing functions, and the upper limit of the frequency band.\nSecond, a novel method for efficient MoM analysis of large and/or complex planar array antennas using Characteristic Basis Functions (CBFs) is proposed to reduce the matrix solution time. The CBFs are special types of high-level basis functions, defined over domains that encompass a relatively large number of conventional subdomain bases, e.g., triangular patches or rooftops. For instance, for a microstrip array, the original antenna geometry is divided into N blocks, where each block contains an individual array element, and the primary and secondary CBFs are constructed for each block. The primary CBF for a particular block is associated with the solution for the isolated block, while the secondary ones account for the mutual coupling effects between it and the other blocks. This technique differs from other similar approaches, developed previously, in several aspects. First, it includes mutual coupling effects directly by using primary and secondary CBFs, which are then used to represent the unknown induced currents on the blocks, and solved for via the Galerkin method rather than by using iterative refinements. Second, the Characteristic Basis Function Method (CBFM) is more general, and can be applied to a wide class of electromagnetic problems.\nFinally, we present an efficient method for computing the matrix elements directly for distances greater than 0.15\u00a5\u00eb that bypasses the Green\u00a1\u00afs function calculation and the evaluation of the double integrals needed to generate the matrix elements for scattering problems of perfectly conducting objects. In the conventional MoM using the sub-sectional basis functions, and a l/10 or l/20 discretization, the computation of the MoM impedance matrix elements consumes a considerable portion of the total solution time as the problem dimensions become large in terms of the wavelength, because the matrix generation requires O(N2) operations, where N is the number of unknowns. In the proposed method, we investigate the number of Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) of the MoM matrix elements, and show that they can be represented in terms of a very small number of Characteristic Functions. The coefficients of the Characteristic Functions are pre-determined by interpolating several directly-calculated impedance matrix elements along two principal directions. Thus, we can generate the MoM matrix elements without having to perform the usual integration involving the basis, testing and Green\u00a1\u00afs functions, except for a few entries that are computed directly.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3225], "author_name_tesi": "Yeo, Junho ", "last_name_ssi": "Yeo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Junho", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raj Mittra", "Kultegin Aydin", "Douglas Henry Werner", "Vijay Krishna Varadan", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raj Mittra, Committee Chair", "Kultegin Aydin, Committee Member", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Member", "Vijay Krishna Varadan, Committee Member", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Impedance Matrix Interpolation", "Method of Moments (MoM)", "Characteristic Basis Function (CBF)", "Microwave antennas and Circuits", "Scattering Problems"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Towards a Research Project of a Sustainable Knowledge Economy\n\n\n", "id": "7464", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2578", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the current world economy, the most technologically advanced economies are knowledge-based.

Information and knowledge are directly productive forces in the knowledge economy, and information becomes the critical raw material of processes and organizations. As governments initiate efforts to develop knowledge production processes in a knowledge economy, the means to develop a sustainable knowledge economy becomes relevant.\n\nThree broad veins categorize existing research on the knowledge economy at the macro level. The first looks at theoretical conceptualizations of a secondary information sector that leverages output from the primary information sector for production. The second focuses on specific industries. The third uses innovation as a proxy to study the knowledge economy empirically. \n\nThe concept of knowledge work is abstract. However, using innovation as a proxy for the knowledge economy, knowledge work can be defined as work involving creation from internalized information. Sustaining innovation then, is partially based on the concept of continuous learning. Therefore, a sustainable knowledge economy can be empirically studied by its base for continuous learning. Using these concepts, this research has two guiding research questions, (1) What contextual factors facilitate continuous learning for a sustainable knowledge economy? and (2) How do these contextual factors affect the sustainability of a knowledge economy?\n\nIn this research, three interpretive case studies were executed to study empirically the contextual factors that implicate continuous learning in three regions \u2013 San Joaquin Valley, in California, U.S.A., Ennis, in Ireland, and Singapore.

This research employs a theoretical elaboration of this Model to study the development of a sustainable knowledge economy in three regions. \n\nIn these case studies, three data collection methods \u2013 in-depth interviews, document reviews, and participant observation, were triangulated. The results were comprised of 12 common themes across these three regions. These themes were further abstracted for discussion under the four contextual factors to show their inter-relations with one another. In the discussion, three broad implications involving knowledge work, structure of the economy, and social challenges, constitute layers upon which future researchers can build on for different perspectives and empirical investigations.\n\nIn conclusion, this study makes three theoretical contributions. First, it shows the validity of applying the Influence-Impact Model to study the knowledge economy and varied economic contexts. Second, it shows the inter-relations among the four factors of the Influence-Impact Model, thus, justifying an integrated approach in studying the sustainable knowledge economy. Finally, in using this model, this study developed an in-depth understanding of the knowledge economy that captures the abstract and dynamic characteristics of knowledge work. This level of understanding forms an impetus for further empirical approaches to study a knowledge economy. In addition, the findings constitute a guiding framework for policymakers to focus their investigations on various local conditions to develop locally sensitive policies.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2558], "author_name_tesi": "Yeo, Jwee Kiat Benjamin ", "last_name_ssi": "Yeo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jwee Kiat Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eileen M Trauth", "Steven Sawyer", "Andrea H Tapia", "Chris Benner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eileen M Trauth, Committee Chair", "Steven Sawyer, Committee Member", "Andrea H Tapia, Committee Member", "Chris Benner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["interpretive case study", "knowledge economy", "information economy"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "RETENTION OF FLAVOR COMPOUNDS BY DISPERSED HIGH\u0081-AMYLOSE\nMAIZE STARCH (HAMS) IN AN AQEUOUS MODEL SYSTEM\n\n\n\n", "id": "10114", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3914", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Flavor is one of the most important attributes considered when determining the acceptability and popularity of food products. The main objective of this study was to examine how hydrophobicity and solubility of flavor compounds relate to retention of these flavor compounds by dispersed native HAMS in an aqueous model system, for both single\u0081-flavor and binary\u0081-flavor systems. The effects of time and native lipids on flavor retention by dispersed HAMS and on precipitated starch yield were also examined. Ten cyclic compounds with similar molecular weights, but varying in water solubility and hydrophobicity, were studied. HAMS (Hylon VII)(0.7% w/w, db) was dispersed at 160oC for 10 minutes in a high pressure vessel. After cooling to 80oC, each flavor compound was added at a concentration 20% below its predetermined solubility. The starch\u0081-flavor mixtures were cooled and held for one day, one week, or one month at room temperature. Flavor compounds in the headspace were subsequently analyzed by static headspace GC. Flavor retention (%) by aqueous starch was calculated relative to water alone. Flavor retention for menthol (58%), menthone (57%) and thymol (29%) was significantly higher than for the other seven compounds (<5%). A plausible explanation for this behavior is that a combination of sufficient hydrophobicity and sufficient solubility, leading to sufficient concentration, is necessary to generate high flavor retention. In binary\u0081]flavor systems, when limonene was added with menthone or thymol, an approximately 40\u0081]70% increase in limonene retention was observed. The enhanced retention of limonene in the presence of\neither menthone or thymol might simply be due to the presence of pre\u0081]formed single helices that are able to accommodate a limonene molecule when these molecules are otherwise in insufficient concentration to generate stable single helices. No difference in flavor retention was observed for native and lipid\u0081]free starch dispersions. By X\u0081]ray diffractometry of the dried precipitates at one week, B patterns were obtained for the flavor compounds (limonene,cymene, anethole, carvone) with low flavor retention (%) and low amount of flavor bound. V patterns were observed for menthol, menthone, thymol, pulegone and terpinen\u0081]4\u0081]ol. Since the flavor compounds were added into the starch dispersions in varied concentrations, a V pattern precipitate would also be obtained if the amount of flavor bound was high, despite low flavor retention (%). The generation of V pattern would depend on whether the single helices would associate to form a precipitate and the packing of the helices. Single helical starch\u0081]flavor complexes reduced the formation of starch double helices over time. Overall, this work suggests an improved basis for understanding the association of flavor compounds with starch, and the results may be applicable to starch\u0081]containing foods.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3887], "author_name_tesi": "Yeo, Lihe ", "last_name_ssi": "Yeo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lihe", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Donald Thompson", "Donald B Thompson", "Devin G Peterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Donald Thompson, Thesis Advisor", "Donald B Thompson, Thesis Advisor", "Devin G Peterson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["starch", "retention", "high amylose maize starch", "flavor"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Development of a ReaxFF reactive force field for silicon/oxygen/hydrogen/fluorine interactions and applications to hydroxylation and friction.

The ReaxFF-MD simulations showed a significant amount of mass transfer across the interface occurs during the sliding. In the absence of water molecules, the interfacial mixing was initiated by dehydroxylation followed by the Si-O-Si bond formation bridging two solid surfaces. In the presence of sub-monolayer thick water, the dissociation of water molecules can provide additional reaction pathways to form the Si-O-Si bridge bonds and mass transfers across the interface. However, when the amount of interfacial water molecules was large enough to form full monolayer, the degree of mass transfer was substantially reduced since the silicon atoms at the sliding interface were terminated with hydroxyl groups rather than forming interfacial Si-O-Si bridge bonds. The ReaxFF-MD simulations clearly showed the role of water molecules in atomic scale mechano-chemical processes during the sliding and provided physical insights into tribochemical wear processes of silicon oxide surfaces observed experimentally.\nIn addition to this, we performed reactive force field molecular dynamics simulation to observe the hydrolysis reactions between water molecules and locally strained SiO2 geometries. We improved the Si/O/H force field from Fogarty et al.1, to more accurately describe the hydroxylation reaction barrier for strained and non-strained Si-O structures, which are about 20 kcal/mol and 30 kcal/mol, respectively. After optimization, energy barrier for the hydroxylation shows a good agreement with DFT data. The observation of silanol formation at the high-strain region of a silica nano-rod also supports the concept that the adsorption of water molecule: hydroxyl formation favors the geometry with higher strain energy. In addition, we found three distinct hydroxylation paths \u2013 H3O+ formation reaction from the adsorbed water, proton donation from H3O+, and the direct dissociation of the adsorbed water molecule. Because water molecules and their hydrogen bond network behave differently with respect to temperature ranges, silanol formation is also affected by temperature. The formation of surface hydroxyl in an amorphous silica double slit displays a similar tendency: SiOH formation prefers high-strain sites. Silanol formation related with H3O+ formation and dissociation is observed in hydroxylation of amorphous SiO2, similar with the results from silica nano wire simulation. These results are particularly relevant to the tribological characteristics of surfaces, enabling the prediction of the attachment site of the lubrication film on silica surfaces with a locally strained geometry.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11666], "author_name_tesi": "Yeon, Jejoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Yeon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jejoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Md Amanul Haque", "Liming Chang", "Seong Han Kim", "James David Kubicki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adrianus C Van Duin, Dissertation Advisor", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Chair", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Member", "Liming Chang, Committee Member", "Seong Han Kim, Committee Member", "James David Kubicki, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["friction", "tribology", "tribochemistry", "computational chemistry", "reactive molecular dynamics", "ReaxFF", "MD"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Chemical and Physical Weathering in Regolith: An Investigation of Three Different Fe-rich Sites of Varying Climate and Lithology", "id": "21557", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10045", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this thesis is to understand chemical weathering in regolith at three very different sites that vary\nwith respect to climate and lithology. The first study involves an analysis of chemical weathering and Fe isotope\nfractionation in soils from a shale-derived catchment in central Pennsylvania. Our investigation of this site is unique\nin the sense that we sampled regolith not only as a function of depth, but also from along a transect from the ridge to\nthe valley floor of the watershed. The oxidation of Fe(II) occurs in a gradual manner in the augerable soil at this site,\nwith no abrupt oxidation fronts with depth noted across the soil profile. Ultimately, we observed that both bulk and\namorphous Fe become isotopically lighter in moving from the younger, shallow ridge top regolith into the older,\ndeeper valley floor. One explanation for this trend involves dissolution processes (i.e., ligand-promoted dissolution\nand dissimilatory Fe reduction) that preferentially release isotopically light Fe during weathering. As weathering\nproceeds, we suggest that this isotopically light Fe travels along preferential zones of flow and is then partially\nprecipitated, accumulating in the older valley floor. A second explanation for these trends involves the inference that\nthe accumulation preferentially retains isotopically light Fe oxides. Although dissolved Fe in most streams is\nthought to be isotopically light, this second mechanism requires the loss of heavy Fe from the Shale Hills watershed.\nIn addition to the shale-derived watershed, we also investigated regolith weathering in two very different\nprofiles developed on basaltic material. The first of these profiles is located at the Sverrefjell volcano, a Mars analog\nsite in the Arctic Circle characterized by a cold, dry climate (described in Chapter 3). Despite the limited amount of\ntime for weathering, very high concentrations of amorphous Al, Fe and Si were observed. Analysis of the clay-sized\nfraction from this site documents allophane as the predominant secondary phase, while abundant silica coatings of\nup to 100 \u03bcm on rock surfaces may help to explain anomalously low extracted amorphous Al/Si ratios. Based on\nbatch experiments designed to study colloidal dispersion, elements such as Na, Mg and Ca are lost from the regolith\nin the dissolved form, while Al, Fe and Ti are mobilized as colloids in the 260-415 nm size range. In contrast, Si is\nmobilized simultaneously both in the dissolved and colloidal fractions. Findings from these colloidal dispersion\nexperiments help to explain the relative loss of specific elements from regolith (Na, K >Ca, Mg >Si >Fe, Al, Ti) as\nwell as the presence of silica coatings on weathered rocks.\nIn the final regolith profile studied (Chapter 4), analysis of pore-water samples in weathering diabase\nregolith allows for a further understanding of how various constituents (pH, DOC, anion and cation concentrations)\nchange as a function of depth and season. In contrast to the other two sites, Fe(II) has been oxidized in close\nproximity to the bedrock/regolith interface of the Pennsylvania diabase profile. Elevated amorphous Fe\nconcentrations near the bedrock/regolith interface are attributed to the release of Fe(II) and precipitation of\namorphous Fe in a zone inferred to have originally been a set of rindlets created during spheroidal weathering.\nWhile bulk Fe isotope signatures within the diabase regolith did not vary significantly with depth, amorphous Fe\nvalues are isotopically lighter near the bedrock/regolith interface. Isotopically light Fe at depth is explained as\nresulting from kinetic effects during the rapid precipitation of Fe oxides from Fe(III) in solution. Similar\nobservations at sites in Virginia and Puerto Rico suggest that spheroidal weathering results in unique chemical and\nFe isotopic trends.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9744], "author_name_tesi": "Yesavage, Tiffany Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Yesavage", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Tiffany", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Matthew Scott Fantle", "Peter J Heaney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Chair", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Dissertation Advisor", "Matthew Scott Fantle, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter J Heaney, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["chemical weathering", "regolith", "soils", "Fe isotopes", "geochemistry", "Fe cycling"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "BHLF1, a Lytic-Cycle Gene Encoding a Long Non-Coding RNA Contributes to Epstein-Barr Virus Latency", "id": "13732kdy5005", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13732", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a lymphotropic, gammaherpesvirus which efficiently establishes a persistent, lifelong infection in humans. As is common with other herpesviruses, EBV has both replicative (lytic) and latent cycles of infection. EBV latency, in which there is no virus production, can be subdivided into several distinct latency programs which are characterized by differential expression patterns of the viral latency-associated proteins: EBNA1, -2, -3A, -3B, -3C, -LP and LMP1, -2A, -2B. The major long-term reservoir of EBV is the memory B cell, and as latently-infected B cells progress from an initial state of EBV-driven cell proliferation to a state of long-term viral latency within the memory B-cell pool, there is a restriction in the expression of the viral latency proteins, due to the epigenetic silencing of the EBNA promoters Wp and Cp. This restriction in latency is essential for the persistence of EBV infection as cytotoxic T lymphocytes can remove infected B cells that continue to express several of the latency-associated proteins.\nHistorically, it has been thought that latency-associated EBV gene products only contribute to the latent cycle, and lytic-cycle genes only function during lytic infection. However, it has recently been found that there is a subset of \u201clytic\u201d genes that are expressed upon the initiation of latency, one of which is BHLF1. This, along with several other lines of evidence, suggests that BHLF1 may have a latency-associated function. Thus, the goal of the work presented in this dissertation was to elucidate whether BHLF1 has a role in the establishment or maintenance of EBV latency. Using recombinant EBV (rEBV), we observed that infection of an EBV-negative cell line, BL2, with a wild-type (WT) rEBV is capable of sustaining latency III, whereas infection with mutant rEBVs, in which BHLF1 has been deleted, results in a transition from latency III to latency I within 3 months post-infection at both the protein and mRNA levels. Disruption of BHLF1 did not significantly influence the expression of other genes near the locus; thus, the phenotype observed is likely a direct consequence of the loss of BHLF1 function. In addition to the mutant phenotype in BL2 cells, we also observed a decrease in the efficiency of immortalization upon infection of primary B cells with the mutant rEBVs.\nAlthough BHLF1 contains a predicted translational open reading frame (ORF), attempts to transiently express a protein from this ORF failed unless we co-expressed the EBV SM protein, whose expression is normally restricted to the lytic cycle. We therefore hypothesize that during latent infection, BHLF1 functions as a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). The likelihood that BHLF1 primarily functions as an lncRNA is further supported by our recent observation and that of others that the ORF is not conserved among all EBV isolates. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis of the 5' ends of the EBNA cDNAs indicated a higher frequency of intron retention, possibly resulting in nonsense-mediated decay. Overall, these data suggest that BHLF1 may play a role in the maintenance of latency III, possibly through the regulation of splicing at the 5' ends of the EBNA RNAs.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14487], "author_name_tesi": "Yetming, Kristen Dominique", "last_name_ssi": "Yetming", "middle_name_ssi": "Dominique", "first_name_ssi": "Kristen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffery T.

To examine this, I analyze data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 13,994) collected in 1994-1995. Using hierarchical multinomial logistic regression models, I find that the proportion of White students in schools moderates the relationship between underestimation of weight for boys and overestimation of weight for both boys and girls.

Strong interaction between SWNT and nanoporous carbon derived from PFA (PFA-NPC) was obtained with this strategy and the integrity of SWNTs was maintained after heat treatment.\nUsually, it is challenging to separate SWNT bundles and disperse them in preparation of composites. 50 wt% SWNT/NPC composites prepared with solution blending showed mass transfer rate of ~140% higher than the original NPC. The improvement was not significant due to poor dispersion and the bundle structure of SWNTs. Functionalization of SWNTs successfully separated the SWNT bundles and solved the problems of dispersion.

The development of such LIBs requires development of low cost, high-energy-density cathode and anode materials. Conventional anode materials in commercial LIBs are primarily synthetic graphite-based materials with a capacity of ~370 mAh/g. Improvements in anode performance, particularly in anode capacity, are essential to achieving high energy densities in LIBs for EV and HEV applications.\n   This dissertation focuses on development of micro-sized silicon-carbon (Si-C) composites as anode materials for high energy and power densities LIBs. First, a new, low-cost, large-scale approach was developed to prepare a micro-sized Si-C composite with excellent performance as an anode material for LIBs. The composite shows a reversible capacity of 1459 mAh/g after 200 cycles at 1 A/g (97.8% capacity retention) and excellent high rate performance of 700 mAh/g at 12.8 A/g, and also has a high tap density of 0.78 g/cm3. The structure of the composite, micro-sized as a whole, features the interconnected nanoscale size of the Si building blocks and the uniform carbon filling, which enables the maximum utilization of silicon even when the micro-sized particles break into small pieces upon cycling.\n   To understand the effects of key parameters in designing the micro-sized Si-C composites on their electrochemical performance and explore how to optimize them, the influence of Si nanoscale building block size and carbon coating on the electrochemical performance of the micro-sized Si-C composites were investigated. It has been found that the critical Si building block size is 15 nm, which enables a high capacity without compromising the cycling stability, and that carbon coating at higher temperature improves the 1st cycle coulombic efficiency (CE) and the rate capability. Corresponding reasons underneath electrochemical performance have been revealed by various characterizations. Combining both optimized Si building block size and carbon coating temperature, the resultant composite can sustain 600 cycles at 1.2 A/g with a fixed lithiation capacity of 1200 mAh/g, the best cycling performance with such a high capacity for micro-sized Si-based anodes.\nTo further improve the the rate capability of Si-based anode materials, an effecitive method of facile boron doping was demonstrated. Boron-doped Si-C composite can deliver a high capacity of 575 mAh/g at 6.4 A/g without addition of any conductive additives, 80% higher than that of undoped composite. Compared to the obvious capacity fading of undoped Si-C composite, boron-doped Si-C composite maintains its capacity well upon long cycling at a high current density. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement shows boron-doped Si-C composite has lower charge transfer resistance, which helps improve its rate capability.\nA novel micro-sized graphene/Si-C composite (G/Si-C) was then developed to translate the performance of such micro-sized Si-C composites from the material level to the electrode level aiming to achieve high areal capacities (mAh/cm2) besides gravimetric capacities (mAh/g). Owing to dual conductive networks both within single particles formed by carbon and between different particles formed by graphene, low electrical resistance can be maintained at high mass loading, which enables a high degree of material utilization. Areal capacity thus increases almost linearly with mass loading. As a result, G/Si-C exhibits a high areal capacity of 3.2 mAh/cm2 after 100 cycles with high coulombic efficiency (average 99.51% from 2nd to 100th cycle), comparable to that of commercial anodes.\nFinally, a micro-sized Si-based material (B-Si/SiO2/C) featuring high rate performance was developed via a facile route without use of toxic hydrofluoric acid. A Li-ion hybrid battery constructed of such a Si-based anode and a porous carbon cathode was demonstrated with both high power and energy densities. Boron-doping is employed to improve the rate capability of B-Si/SiO2/C. At a high current density of 6.4 A/g, B-Si/SiO2/C delivers a capacity of 685 mAh/g, 2.4 times that of the undoped Si/SiO2/C. Benefiting from the high rate performance along with low working voltage, high capacity and good cycling stability of B-Si/SiO2/C, the hybrid battery exhibits a high energy density of 128 Wh/kg at 1229 W/kg. Even when power density increases to the level of a conventional supercapacitor (9704 W/kg), 89 Wh/kg can be obtained, the highest values of any hybrid battery to date. Long cycling life (capacity retention of 70% after 6000 cycles) and low self-discharge rate (voltage retention of 82% after 50 hours) are also achieved.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10553], "author_name_tesi": "Yi, Ran ", "last_name_ssi": "Yi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ran", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donghai Wang", "Christopher Rahn", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Sulin Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donghai Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lithium-ion batteries", "anodes", "silicon", "composite", "hybrid capacitors"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "MESSAGE FRAMING AND PERSUASION: THE ROLE OF CONSUMERS\u2019 MOTIVATIONS IN PROCESSING FRAMED MESSAGES ", "id": "6235", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6035", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this dissertation is to investigate the effect of message framing on persuasion, focusing on the role of consumers\u2019 motivations in processing framed messages.  Previous research on message framing has studied whether two factually equivalent messages that differ only in overall valence can be differentially persuasive.  The terms \u201cpositive frame\u201d and \u201cnegative frame\u201d are used to refer to emphasizing favorable consequences that may happen due to complying with a target behavior, or emphasizing unfavorable consequences that may happen due to non-compliance, respectively.  A review of the literature shows that previous findings on the effect of message framing on persuasion have been often inconsistent.  In addition, no previous study has provided a comprehensive theoretical framework that can incorporate the majority of extant findings.  The main thrust of this dissertation is that it is essential to investigate consumers\u2019 motivations during the processing of framed messages in order to understand the effect of message framing. \nThis dissertation consists of two essays.  In Essay # 1, I propose a theoretical framework in an attempt to explain conflicting previous research findings on persuasive message framing and test the framework with a meta-analysis.  My framework differs from previous research in that it explores different types of motivation that are salient while consumers process framed messages.  I propose that the effect of positive vs. negative framing on persuasion is significantly moderated by two variables: degree of personal relevance of the issue and the end-state used as the anchor.  Furthermore, I propose that the rationale for this prediction is provided by relative salience of accuracy-seeking motivation versus defense motivation.  This theoretical framework was generally supported by a meta-analysis of previous studies.  \nEssay # 2 considers another facet of consumers\u2019 motivation during message processing: regulatory focus.  Based on regulatory focus theory, I propose that type of consumers\u2019 regulatory focus, either chronically salient or situationally evoked, has important implications for message processing.  I propose that persuasion is enhanced when there is regulatory fit, namely, a fit between consumers\u2019 regulatory focus and the end-state (i.e., outcome focus) of the message, given that the overall valence of the message is positive.  I investigate the regulatory fit effect on persuasion in the context of two factually equivalent positively-valenced frames: the presence of gain frame and the absence of loss frame.  Furthermore, I hypothesize that the intensity of anticipatory positive feelings mediates this effect of regulatory fit on persuasion.  These hypotheses were supported by two experiments. \nTaken together, two essays in this thesis provide important theoretical contributions and managerial implications.  Both researchers and marketers are encouraged to consider consumers\u2019 motivations in examining the effect of employing factually equivalent messages on persuasion. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6027], "author_name_tesi": "Yi, Sunghwan ", "last_name_ssi": "Yi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sunghwan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Johann Baumgartner", "William T Ross", "Margaret Grace Meloy", "Karen Gasper"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Johann Baumgartner, Committee Chair", "William T Ross, Committee Member", "Margaret Grace Meloy, Committee Member", "Karen Gasper, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["message framing", "motivation", "persuasion", "information processing"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "QUALITY OF SERVICE (QoS) PROVISIONING\nIN THE INTERNET USING FLOW ESTIMATION", "id": "6767", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6036", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-09-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning in the Internet in the presence of unpredictable\ntraffic dynamics is an important, but admittedly complex problem. The main goal of this thesis is to investigate flow estimation based techniques for better QoS support in the Internet. In this context, we discuss five related topics in this thesis. First, we propose a flow estimation scheme, called Hash-based Two-level Caching (HaTCh), to accurately estimate the number of active connections, which can be used for better congestion control. It is shown that the HaTCh scheme provides more accurate flow estimation than the exising (SRED)scheme under various workloads. Second, we investigate the design issues of drop functions in an AQM scheme and propose a new AQM scheme, called HaTCh based RED (HRED), based on the new flow estimation technique. Third, we propose a HaTCh-based Dynamic Quarantine (HaDQ) scheme, an extension of the HaTCh scheme, to detect and penalize unresponsive TCP flows, which pose a serious \nthreat to conforming TCP users through Cenial of Service (DoS) attacks. Then, the HaDQ scheme is further extended to dynamically detect and block worm propagation. It is shown through extensive simulation that the HADQ mechanism is an effective and feasible solution for controlling  bandwidth attack of unresponsive TCP flows and worms. Finally, we extend our AQM framework to wireless networks, and present a new AQM scheme, called Proxy-RED, for Wireless Local Area  Networks (WLANs).

Successful petrophysical evaluation and stimulation treatments with horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing enable economic shale gas production. Shale gas development has contributed about 35 % of natural gas supply in US in 2013.\nDetailed evaluation of gas shales before and after stimulation treatments is a prerequisite to optimize gas production. Complex pore network in gas shales may result in inaccurate evaluation of petrophysical properties with traditional petrophysical models. Therefore, in this research we proposed a new methodology comprising a new understanding of evaluation of porosity, maturity analysis, geomechanical properties and initial gas in place calculations of gas shale via well logs and core analysis based on a new petrophysical model. We applied the methodology in a case study to investigate a Marcellus shale well in evaluating maturity, porosity and geomechanical properties to calculate initial gas in place and reserves and optimize stimulation designs. In the second part of this study, we conducted acoustic travel time measurements of Green River shale samples parallel and perpendicular to bedding plane before and after interaction with water to observe how shale interacts with water at different interaction times and bedding planes by analyzing change in acoustic velocity and mechanical properties before and after treatment to optimize stimulation designs. X-Ray diffraction analysis, scanning electron microscope imaging and horizontal and vertical permeability measurements of Green River shale samples using helium are conducted to characterize the samples by observing mineralogy, pore network and how permeability changes at different in-situ conditions. Therefore, the first and second parts of this research relate with utilization of well logs and core analysis to evaluate petrophysical properties of different gas shale formations.\nMaturity analysis, porosity evaluation and initial gas in place results of field case study of Marcellus shale show that total organic carbon content directly relates with porosity and adsorbed gas in place occupied in organic matter. Comparison of young\u2019s modulus and minimum in-situ stress values between Marcellus shale zone and adjacent boundaries are used for determination of stimulation interval in Marcellus Formation. An effective hydraulic fracturing treatment can be applied within the upper Marcellus Formation because of relatively higher minimum in-situ stress contrast between Stafford Limestone and upper Marcellus Formation. Closer porosity results of Marcellus shale when compared to that in literature and sufficient reserves suggest that density/resistivity separation method is more reliable than sonic/resistivity separation method. X-Ray diffraction and SEM images suggest that Green River Formation samples are dominantly comprised of carbonate minerals. Permeability measurements indicate that Green River Formation samples having very low permeability at various confining stresses needs to be stimulated effectively. Acoustic travel time measurements of Green River shale before and after interaction with water show that compressional and shear velocities increase as confining stress increases. Shear, young\u2019s and bulk modulus of Green River shale increase resulting in more rigid samples having more fracture conductivity as confining stress increases. Compressional and shear velocities decrease as Green River shale is exposed to water since minerals are dissolved by water solution and salinity of the samples decrease so that shear, young\u2019s and bulk modulus of the samples slightly decrease resulting in less rigid samples having lower fracture conductivity.\nThe new methodology of petrophysical evaluation of gas shale based on the new petrophysical model serves a new understanding of evaluation of maturity analysis, porosity and mechanical properties and initial gas in place calculations of gas shale by utilizing well logs in field and core analysis in laboratory.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10190], "author_name_tesi": "Yildirim, Levent ", "last_name_ssi": "Yildirim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Levent", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yilin Wang", "Derek Elsworth", "Zuleima T Karpyn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yilin Wang, Thesis Advisor", "Derek Elsworth, Thesis Advisor", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gas shale", "petrophysics", "methodology", "well logs", "core analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "MULTI LEVEL OPTIMIZATION OF BURNABLE POISON UTILIZATION \nFOR ADVANCED PWR FUEL MANAGEMENT\n", "id": "6671", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6037", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this study was to develop a unique methodology and a practical tool for designing burnable poison (BP) pattern for a given PWR core. Two techniques were studied in developing this tool. First, the deterministic technique called Modified Power Shape Forced Diffusion (MPSFD) method followed by a fine tuning algorithm, based on some heuristic rules, was developed to achieve this goal. Second, an efficient and a practical genetic algorithm (GA) tool was developed and applied successfully to Burnable Poisons (BPs) placement optimization problem for a reference Three Mile Island-1 (TMI-1) core. This thesis presents the step by step progress in developing such a tool.\n\nThe developed deterministic method appeared to perform as expected. The GA technique produced excellent BP designs. It was discovered that the Beginning of Cycle (BOC) Kinf of a BP fuel assembly (FA) design is a good filter to eliminate invalid BP designs created during the optimization process. By eliminating all BP designs having BOC Kinf above a set limit, the computational time was greatly reduced since the evaluation process with reactor physics calculations for an invalid solution is canceled. \n\nMoreover, the GA  was applied to develop the BP loading pattern to minimize the total Gadolinium (Gd) amount in the core together with the residual binding at End-of-Cycle (EOC) and to keep the maximum peak pin power during core depletion and Soluble boron concentration at BOC both less than their limit values. The number of UO2/Gd2O3 pins and Gd2O3 concentrations for each fresh fuel location in the core are the decision variables and the total amount of the Gd in the core and maximum peak pin power during core depletion are in the fitness functions. The use of different fitness function definition and forcing the solution movement towards to desired region in the solution space accelerated the GA runs. Special emphasize is given to minimizing the residual binding to increase core lifetime as well as minimizing the total Gd amount in the core.\n\n\nThe GA code developed many good solutions that satisfy all of the design constraints. For these solutions, the EOC soluble boron concentration changes from 68.9 to 97.2 ppm. It is important to note that the difference of 28.3 ppm between the best and the worst solution in the good solutions region represent the potential of 12.5 Effective-Full-Power-Day (EPFD) savings in cycle length. As a comparison, the best BP loading design has 97.2 ppm soluble boron concentration at EOC while the BP loading with available vendor\u2019s U/Gd FA designs has 94.4 ppm SOB at EOC. It was estimated that the difference of 2.8 ppm reflected the potential savings of 1.25 EFPD in cycle length. Moreover, the total Gd amount was reduced by 6.89 % in mass that provided extra savings in fuel cost compared to the BP loading pattern with available vendor\u2019s U/Gd FA designs. \n\nIn addition, enriched Gd-155 and Gd-157 optimized BP designs were developed to further reduce residual binding of natural high (7-8 w/o) Gd2O3 concentrated U/Gd FAs. The optimized enriched Gd-155 designs successfully replaced the natural high (7-8 w/o) Gd2O3 concentrated U/Gd FAs in the reference BP loading. The residual Gd reactivity effect was analyzed for these optimized designs. Cost analysis comparison was performed to evaluate the potential economical benefits of the optimized BP designs as compared to the conventional BP designs and to determine break-even point for unit Gd enrichment cost. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6029], "author_name_tesi": "Yilmaz, Serkan ", "last_name_ssi": "Yilmaz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Serkan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Yousry Azmy", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Samuel H Levine", "Soundar Kumara", "Moussa Mahgerefteh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Chair", "Yousry Azmy, Committee Chair", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Member", "Samuel H Levine, Committee Member", "Soundar Kumara, Committee Member", "Moussa Mahgerefteh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Burnable Poison", "Genetic Algorithm", "Gadolinium", "Nuclear", "Optimization", "Fuel Management"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Risk Assessment of Highway Bridges under Multi-hazard Effect of Flood-induced Scour and Earthquake", "id": "25415", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11109", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Natural disasters may have significant impact on the functionality of highway transportation systems resulting in unacceptable socio-economic losses. Flood and earthquake hazards can be considered as two most significant natural threats to safety of bridges. The overarching need for safety and serviceability of critical transportation infrastructure system requires highway bridges to be analyzed and designed not only for discrete hazard events, but also for possible multiple-hazard (or multi-hazard) conditions. For a highway network spanning over a seismically-active flood-prone region, the occurrence of earthquakes in the presence of flood-induced scour is a possible multi-hazard scenario for bridges in the network. The varied dynamic characteristics of a bridge due to the occurrence of scour may affect the response of the bridge under earthquake loading, and eventually may increase the risk of bridge failure.\nDespite the rising concern of research communities on this topic, the issues related to the multi-hazard effect of flood-induced scour and earthquake on highway bridges have not been satisfactorily answered. In addition, no guideline is currently available in design codes to ensure seismic safety of bridges with potentially scoured foundations. This dissertation aims to improve a comprehensive knowledge-base on risk and reliability analyses of highway bridges subjected to this multi-hazard by developing a multi-hazard risk assessment framework for bridges and quantifying variability in multi-hazard fragility and risk of bridges through a thorough uncertainty analysis. Outcome of this research provides research communities and government agencies a better understanding of the multi-hazard effect of flood-induced scour and earthquake on the risk and reliability of highway bridges. It also serves as a foundation for future researches on developing strategic plans for repair or retrofit prioritization for highway bridges under similar multi-hazard conditions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10677], "author_name_tesi": "Yilmaz, Taner ", "last_name_ssi": "Yilmaz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Taner", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Swagata Banerjee Basu", "Gordon Patrick Warn", "Prasenjit Basu", "M Jeya Chandra", "Peggy Ann Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Swagata Banerjee Basu, Dissertation Advisor", "Gordon Patrick Warn, Committee Member", "Prasenjit Basu, Committee Member", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["risk", "uncertainty", "fragility", "multihazard", "highway bridges"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "A STUDY OF STEEL MOMENT CONNECTIONS FOR STRUCTURES UNDER BLAST AND PROGRESSIVE COLLAPSE LOADING RATES\n", "id": "7438", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2420", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-01-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Connections are one of the most significant contributors to decide the ductility and robustness of a steel framed structure.

Therefore, it is essential to understand and determine the steel connection behaviors in order to offer the necessary structural capabilities in design for resisting blast and progressive collapse. In present study the welded-unreinforced flange-bolted-web connections (WUF-B), one of the commonly used moment connections, were characterized with respect to the quasi-static and blast-rate pressure loads.  The characterization process was carried out by finite element analyses of a full three-dimensional connection assembly. Moment-rotation curves, moment-tip displacement relationships, rotation dynamic increase factors, and moment-impulse diagrams were utilized as static and dynamic connection properties.

This study examines the influence of co-op and internships on engineering problem-solving skills by answering the following research questions: 1) Does experience in cooperative education or internship programs influence students' self-perceptions of their engineering problem-solving skills? 2) How do students with cooperative education or internship experience differ in their perception and understanding of their engineering problem-solving skills as compared to students with no experience?\n\n  The design of this study included a quantitative and a qualitative component.  I conducted a quantitative analysis to answer the first research question utilizing multivariate regression and multi-nominal logit models to examine whether significant differences existed between students with engineering work experience and students with no engineering work experience with regard to assessments of their 1) basic skills, 2) design and problem-solving skills, and 3) engineering thinking skills. The key variables came from a set of three scales and their respective items from the nationally representative Engineering Change (EC2000) dataset, which contains survey responses from 4,461 senior engineering students from the class of 2004 in seven engineering disciplines (aerospace, chemical, computer, electrical, industrial, and mechanical) from 39 accredited institutions.\n\n  The second research question was addressed through qualitative data collection and analysis. I interviewed three groups of senior electrical engineering students at a single research I university: 1) students who completed three rotations in the co-op program, 2) students who completed at least one internship, and 3) students who completed neither co-op nor internship. In total, I interviewed 17 undergraduate engineering students, including 1) four students who completed at least three cooperative education rotations, 2) eight students who completed at least one internship, and 3) five students who completed neither cooperative education nor internship.\nThe quantitative analysis indicates that students who spent more time in a cooperative education or internship program rate their understanding of engineering problem-solving more highly than those who have not participated in such programs. The more time spent in these work-related experiences, the more highly students rated their understanding of essential aspects of the engineering design process, and their abilities to apply systematic design procedure to open-ended problem; design solutions to meet desired needs; ensure that a process or product meets a variety of technical and practical criteria; and compare and judge alternative outcomes.\n \n  The qualitative analysis suggested that students' classroom and work (co-op and internship) experiences differentially influenced three types of knowledge: theoretical, practical, and procedural knowledge. \u201cTheoretical knowledge\u201d refers to the theories, laws and principles of the field. The majority of the students reported that classroom experiences in solving textbook problems helped them develop this type of knowledge. Students with work experience described how their work assignments often required them to consider contextual factors as well as technical ones when solving problems on the job. This kind of \u201cpractical knowledge\u201d encouraged students to address a variety of relevant factors when solving problems. They contended that these contextual factors were not always prominent in classroom assignments or homework problems. Finally, \u201cprocedural knowledge\u201d can be defined as knowledge of how to solve problems.  When comparing the groups, students with co-op and internship experiences were more likely to understand the importance of problem-solving processes (such as defining the problem or applying systematic procedures) than students without work experience.\n \n  The findings from both the qualitative and quantitative components of the study are consistent. The quantitative analysis showed that time spent in a co-op or internship was significant for the majority of survey items related to procedural knowledge but not significant for items related to theoretical knowledge. This aligns with the findings from the interviews. Co-op and internship students reported that their work experience taught them that in order to succeed on the job, they needed to develop both procedural knowledge and theoretical knowledge. Procedural knowledge gained through engagement in engineering practice at a co-op or internship increased students\u2019 confidence in their problem-solving ability.\n\n  Understanding how cooperative education and internship program influences students' perception of their engineering problem-solving skills has practical implications. For curricular designers, knowing how individuals perceive their different types of knowledge necessary to solve problems allows for a more intentional design of curricular and co-curricular activities to develop students\u2019 competency within an academic domain. I recommend curricular designers focus on strengthening and enhancing students\u2019 theoretical knowledge, practical knowledge, procedural knowledge through classroom activities such as writing assignments that ask students to explain their problem-solving process. Program-level recommendations include incorporating more project-based or lab-like courses into the curriculum, so students have more opportunities to actively engage in solving real-world problems. Future research should examine the long-term effects of co-op and internship programs on students' perception of engineering problem-solving skills once they have graduated and worked in the profession.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [60], "author_name_tesi": "Yin, Alexander Chih-Jen", "last_name_ssi": "Yin", "middle_name_ssi": "Chih-Jen", "first_name_ssi": "Alexander", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa R Lattuca", "Lisa R Lattuca", "James Fredericks Volkwein", "Peggy Noel Van Meter", "Aleksandra B Slavkovic"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa R Lattuca, Dissertation Advisor", "Lisa R Lattuca, Committee Chair", "James Fredericks Volkwein, Committee Member", "Peggy Noel Van Meter, Committee Member", "Aleksandra B Slavkovic, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cooperative education", "engineering education", "internships", "problem-solving skills", "Experiential Learning Cycle", "Model of Domain Learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "INTEGRATING INSTRUMENTATION DATA IN PROBABILISTIC PERFORMANCE PREDICTION OF FLEXIBLE PAVEMENTS\n\n", "id": "8001", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2380", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this research was to develop a methodology integrating instrumentation data with existing mechanistic-empirical performance models for flexible pavements. The methodology is further enhanced with probabilistic features that take into account the uncertainties associated with design parameters. Two types of pavement structures are considered: 1) full-depth structures, including subbase, base, and Superpave-designed HMA layers constructed over subgrade and 2) structural overlays including only Superpave-designed HMA layers. One pavement section per structure type was selected from the instrumented sections of a comprehensive research project called the Superpave In-Situ Stress/Strain Investigation (SISSI), sponsored by Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. The first task of this project was to simulate pavement response using 3-D viscoelastic-based finite element models. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted to identify site-specific parameters that are required by empirical performance models. The variabilities associated with these parameters were quantified and further considered in a Monte Carlo simulation-based probabilistic approach. The predicted performance measures included the overall pavement functional performance (IRI) and structural performance in terms of individual distresses over a specified analysis period.\nThe main contribution of this research is not toward the development of new performance prediction models but, rather, the demonstration of the use of instrumentation data for performance predictions. The developed methodology is enhanced with an analytical method to predict pavement responses over time and thus will be ideally suited for situations where sophisticated instrumentation data are not available. In addition, the probabilistic nature of the developed methodology proposes a unique way of assessing the effects of variabilities of design parameters on pavement performance.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2364], "author_name_tesi": "Yin, Hao ", "last_name_ssi": "Yin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shelley Marie Stoffels", "Mansour Solaimanian", "Ghassan Chehab", "Charles Edward Antle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shelley Marie Stoffels, Committee Chair", "Mansour Solaimanian, Committee Member", "Ghassan Chehab, Committee Member", "Charles Edward Antle, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MEPDG", "Monte Carlo simulation", "flexible pavement", "instrumentation", "performance prediction", "probabilistic", "finite element analysis", "viscoelastic", "variability analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Rule-based Lens Model\n", "id": "9387", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3240", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The thesis study presents the effort of using the Lens Model framework, originally conceived by Brunswik, to investigate judgment behaviors so that contingent decisions can be incorporated.

The rule induction algorithm RLM-RI employs multiobjective Genetic Algorithm as its central search mechanism to enhance the induction and classification process. The quality of the induced rule set is measured by two criteria, fidelity (the degree to which the rule set reflects the judgment data they have been extracted from) and compactness (the simplicity of the rule set). An experimental study is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of RLM-RI as a supervised machine learning algorithm on a number of benchmark datasets. In RLM, the direct use of rule-based modeling within the Lens Model framework is explored and a new computational scheme based on match frequency is developed to define the Lens Model parameters.\nIn order to evaluate the fit of RLM on actual human data, a laboratory study is designed and conducted using an aircraft identification task. The performance of the participants is evaluated by the Lens Model approach to determine the degree to which the judgments adapt to the situated task environment.

These two technologies are making ubiquitous\ncomputing possible. We can envision the scenario of the near future where\nwireless data access will be readily available to the public anywhere and\nanytime. Before this vision becomes a reality, however, some issues still\nneed to be resolved. Because of the physical limitations of the wireless\nnetwork and devices, such as limited bandwidth, battery power, and computation\npower, it is much more important to design efficient data access schemes\nin wireless environments than in wired environments. This thesis addresses\nthese issues by designing data access schemes in different wireless\nenvironments to improve their performance.\n                                                                                                  \nWe first address the data access issue in single-hop based mobile environments,\nwhere mobile nodes access data through a base station that is one hop away.\nIn this environment, the base station usually adopts the broadcast technique\nto disseminate data to mobile nodes. As data are available on the broadcast\nchannel, mobile nodes may prefetch them to reduce query latency. However,\nprefetch consumes valuable battery power and hence should be performed\ncarefully. Therefore, we propose a value-based prefetch scheme to determine\nwhich data to prefetch. Then adaptive prefetch schemes are designed so that\nthe prefetch can be done while adapting to mobile nodes' power levels to\nachieve a balance between query latency and power consumption.\nWhen there is no pre-installed base station, mobile nodes may form a multi-hop\nbased wireless network and forward packets for each other. As long as one\nmobile node maintains a database or connects to the Internet, other mobile nodes can still\naccess data through multi-hop links. In this environment, we propose to use\ntwo techniques to improve data access efficiency: cooperative caching and\ndata replication.\n                                                                                                  \nCooperative caching fully exploits the potential of caching by serving\nrequests for other mobile nodes besides the cache owner. In mobile environments, a\ncooperative caching scheme should adapt to the mobile network where mobile\nnodes have limited computation and communication power, and where the network\ntopology changes frequently. We propose several schemes that are suitable for\nmobile environments. These schemes are able to reduce query latency and power\nconsumption without incurring high overhead.\n                                                                                                  \nMulti-hop based mobile environments have a high link/node failure rate,\nand thus the data access may be affected when the requested data item is not\naccessible because of network partitions. Data replication schemes are studied\nin this thesis to address this issue. Existing schemes usually focus on either\nreducing the query delay or improving data accessibility, but fail to consider\nthe tradeoffs between the two performance metrics. The data replication\nschemes proposed in this thesis show that these two metrics are closely\nrelated and balance the tradeoffs between them.\n                                                                                                  \nAlthough this thesis studies different mobile environments, the focus is on\nefficient data access to reduce power and other resource consumption. We show\nthat through intelligent use of the local cache, either by prefetching,\ncooperative caching, or data replication, mobile nodes are able to access data\nmore efficiently. We hope that these research results can help build a better\nwireless environment for future mobile users. We also hope that other\nresearchers find our analytical and simulation methods helpful so that new and\nmore exciting results can be generated.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3894], "author_name_tesi": "Yin, Liangzhong ", "last_name_ssi": "Yin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Liangzhong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Chitaranjan Das", "Wang Chien Lee", "Aylin Yener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Committee Chair", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Member", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member", "Aylin Yener, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Data Access", "Mobile Environments"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Genetic-based, Differential Susceptibility To Paraquat Neurotoxicity In Mice", "id": "16226", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7237", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The etiology of sporadic Parkinson\u2019s disease (sPD) is currently unclear and the most plausible hypothesis states sPD is the result of environmental risk factors acting on genetically susceptible individuals. Those risk factors include metals, diet and pesticides. One of the latter, paraquat (PQ) is an herbicide used world-wide in agriculture. Paraquat has been shown in experimental animals and in vitro to destroy dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.  Dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra is a major pathological hallmark of sPD. There are epidemiological data that implicate PQ to be an environmental risk factor for sPD; however the data are inconsistent. One possible reason for the inconsistency is that there is likely, genetic-based, individual variability in susceptibility to PQ neurotoxicity related PD. In this thesis, we report differential sensitivity to PQ neurotoxicity in inbred strains of mice. This differential sensitivity was shown by experimental results on the effects of PQ on dopaminergic neuron loss in the substantia nigra and by differential gene expression in response to PQ in the ventral midbrain, the area that contains the substantia nigra. Somewhat surprisingly, gene expression results implicated iron-related protein genes as associated to high susceptibility to PQ neurotoxicity and we also found that in the susceptible strains of mice, PQ increased iron content in the ventral midbrain.

They serve as a platform where users can interact with each other by sharing content as well as providing feedbacks, e.g., ``like'' and ``dislike'' to others' shared contents. The large quantity of user behavior log offers a potential good source to study and model user behaviors. And the research results can help the development of multiple applications such as popular item highlighting, personalized recommendation. These applications not only improve user experience but also increase engagement. However, there are several issues in converting raw logs into useful applications. We summarize them as i) timeliness requirement, ii) silent user, iii) item conflict and iv) non-textual content.\n\nThe first one is related to some applications characterized by timeliness, i.e., the earlier the better. Services providers usually highlight in the homepage the popular shared contents, i.e., those receiving a large quantity of ``like''. We propose the predict the popularity of the shared content at an early time based on its early vote situation. Specifically, we model two personalities of voters, defined as \\emph{conformer} and \\emph{maverick}. The former one represents the probability that the voter's opinion conforms with the majority while the latter one stands for the inconsistence with the majority. By learning the two personalities of each person via her voting history, we may quickly predict the potential popularity of each item based on the early votes.\n\nThe second issue concerns the user's behavior of silent viewing. Many applications, especially personalized recommendation, needs the explicit opinion of people on items to model user preference. However, if a user only views an item without clicking ``like'' or ``dislike'', the current technique can not exploit it. We argue that the reason of silent viewing is that the quality of the item is not good enough to motivate the person to vote. However, the time she spends on that item suggests her opinion. We propose a viewing-voting model to capture the user's dwell time and voting behavior. We demonstrate an improved performance for conventional recommendation techniques when combined with VV model.\n\nThe third issue represents the blind spots of current personalized recommendation techniques. Conventional recommended items such as books, music, movie have no conflict among them, i.e., current consumption of one time has no impact on future ones. Other items may have. For example, if a user buys a TV, it is unlikely that she may buy another one in near future. We thus propose a actual-tempting model to capture such conflict relationship between items. Experiments running on a dataset of mobile app installation demonstrate that the AT model outperforms conventional recommendation techniques.

Cattle are the major reservoir. Both O157:H7 and the big-six are under strict regulation in beef; the regulations are known as the zero tolerance policy. The diseases caused by STECs vary in severity, ranging from mild diarrhea, bloody diarrhea, to a life threatening condition called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Although the susceptibility of the human host plays a large role in determining severity, genetic differences between STEC can greatly influence the virulence as well. The genomic diversity of STECs is mainly driven by horizontally acquired genomic regions, within which most virulence factors are encoded. Studying the diversity of the virulence-associated horizontally acquired regions can enhance our understanding of STEC pathogenesis. In addition, depending on the level of diversity, certain genomic regions may be used as detection and subtyping markers for pathogen prevention, outbreak control and epidemiological investigation. Therefore, the overall goal of the present research was to characterize the diversity of two genomic regions in STECs and study their implications on pathogenesis, strain evolution and utility for subtyping.\nOne virulence factor, Shiga toxin (Stx), is encoded within a temperate prophage region on the E. coli O157:H7 genome. The production of Stx is crucial for HUS development. More than 200 O157:H7 strains were sequenced in a project assessing O157:H7 genomic diversity. However, the important stx-converting prophage regions were not well assembled due to the presence of other prophages with high sequence similarity. In Chapter 3, we explored the stx-converting phage diversity within a subset of this O157:H7 collection by isolating and sequencing total phage DNA.  The complete genomes of 22 stx2a-converting phages were recovered. Sequence comparison identified 9 phage sequence types (PSTs), and genome and proteome analysis grouped them into 3 clusters (i.e. PST1, PST2 and PST3). Phage genome diversity was driven by both copies of IS629 and sequence variations within the phage early regulatory gene regions. The PST2 cluster phages were phylogenetically related to phages identified in strains previously associated with high HUS rate. Meanwhile, we also demonstrated, by using 5 strains carrying identical stx2a-converting prophage, that the host genome impacts Stx2 production. Overlaying the phage genome sequence data and the whole bacteria genome phylogeny suggested that stx2a-converting phage of PST2 may have been acquired multiple times independently during the stepwise evolution model from O55:H7 to O157:H7.\nClustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is an adaptive immune system in prokaryotes that consists of short DNA repeats separated by sequences called spacers that derive from viruses and other foreign DNA. While CRISPR sequences in E. coli are diverse, the acquisition of new spacers has only been observed in engineered strains, implying the relatively slow evolution of CRISRPs in E. coli and making them potential subtyping markers for phylogenetically related strains. In fact, a CRISPR-based qPCR assay has been previously developed for the big-six and O157 STECs. In Chapter 4, by examining the CRISPR loci in over 500 isolates, we provided more insights into CRISPR diversity in STECs. The general spacer content and order conservation within each serogroup confirmed the specificity of the primers used in the qPCR assay. Spacer deletion, the presence of an insertion sequence, and distinct alleles within a serogroup provided an explanation for the observed false-negative reactions in the qPCR results.

These isolates serve as a source of false-positives for the qPCR assay. Using a collection of strains belonging to a well-defined stepwise evolutionary path, we provided the evidence that CRISPR evolution in E. coli proceeds via spacer deletion rather than acquisition.\nIn summary, the present research characterized the genomic diversity of stx2a-converting phage and CRISPRs in STECs, providing insights into the evolution and pathogenesis of this pathogen group, and generated genome data for further mechanistic studies. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9824], "author_name_tesi": "Yin, Shuang ", "last_name_ssi": "Yin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shuang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward G Dudley", "Edward G Dudley", "Robert F Roberts", "Stephen John Knabel", "Dr Rodolphe Barrangou", "Chitrita Debroy", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward G Dudley, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Chair", "Robert F Roberts, Committee Member", "Stephen John Knabel, Committee Member", "Dr Rodolphe Barrangou, Committee Member", "Chitrita Debroy, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Escherichia coli", "Shiga toxin", "Phage", "CRISPR"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Quantum Phase Amplification for Temporal Pulse Shaping and Super-resolution in Remote Sensing", "id": "21091", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9860", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of nonlinear optical interactions to perform nonclassical transformations of electromagnetic field is an area of considerable interest.\nQuantum phase amplification (QPA) has been previously proposed as a method to perform nonclassical manipulation of coherent light, which can be experimentally realized by use of nonlinear optical mixing processes, of which phase-sensitive three-wave mixing (PSTWM) is one convenient choice. QPA occurs when PSTWM is operated in the photon number deamplification mode, i.e., when the energy is coherently transferred among the low-frequency signal and idler waves and the high-frequency pump wave. The final state is nonclassical, with the field amplitude squeezed and the phase anti-squeezed. \n\nIn the temporal domain, the use of QPA has been studied to facilitate nonlinear pulse shaping. This novel method directly shapes the temporal electric field amplitude and phase using the PSTWM in a degenerate and collinear configuration, which has been analyzed using a numerical model. Several representative pulse shaping capabilities of this technique have been identified, which can augment the performance of common passive pulse shaping methods operating in the Fourier domain. The analysis indicates that a simple quadratic variation of temporal phase facilitates pulse compression and self-steepening, with features significantly shorter than the original transform-limited pulse. Thus, PSTWM can act as a direct pulse compressor based on the combined effects of phase amplification and group velocity mismatch, even without the subsequent linear phase compensation. Furthermore, it is shown numerically that pulse doublets and pulse trains can be produced at the pump frequency by utilizing the residual linear phase of the signal. Such pulse shaping capabilities are found to be within reach of this technique in common nonlinear optical crystals pumped by pulses available from compact femtosecond chirped-pulse amplification laser systems.\n\nThe use of QPA in the spatial domain has also been studied as a method to enhance the spatial resolution of imaging systems. A detailed model has been developed for achieving both super-resolution and detection of phase-amplified light. The imaging resolution problem considered here is treated as a binary hypotheses testing problem. Resolution enhancement is achieved by magnification of the angular separation of two targets in the sub-Rayleigh regime. The detection model includes optimization of detector segmentation, detector noise, and detection in both the spatial and the spatial frequency domain, which provide strategies for the optimization of the signal-to-noise ratio that take advantage of both the change of the field distribution and the change of energy of the signal in the QPA process. \n\nProof-of-principle experiments have been conducted in the spatial domain. For the first time, beam angular amplification has been demonstrated, and the experimental result is in good agreement with simulations. The experimental demonstration has been achieved by observing the correlation of amplitude and angular phase in the phase-sensitive three-wave mixing process using ultrashort laser pulses and utilizing a type I three-wave mixing process. Several diagnostics have been developed and employed in the experimental measurements, including the near-field diagnostic, the far-field diagnostic, and the interferometry diagnostic. They have all been used to confirm the existence and study the properties of the QPA process on a shot-to-shot basis. Specifically, amplitude was measured in the near-field diagnostic, while the angular phase was indirectly measured in the far-field diagnostic by determining the position of the beam centroid. Interferometric measurements have been found to be of insufficient accuracy for this measurement in the way they were implemented.\n\nThe demonstration of beam angular amplification by use of QPA lays the foundation for future integrated demonstration of imaging resolution enhancement, while the results of the modeling in the time domain open opportunities for development of flexible pulse shaping benefitting a variety of ultrafast applications.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9595], "author_name_tesi": "Yin, Yanchun ", "last_name_ssi": "Yin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yanchun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Igor Jovanovic", "Igor Jovanovic", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Kenan Unlu", "Zhiwen Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Igor Jovanovic, Dissertation Advisor", "Igor Jovanovic, Committee Chair", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["temporal pulse shaping", "super-resolution", "quantum phase amplification", "phase-sensitive three-wave mixing"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Persistent Object Tracking by Figure-Ground Segmentation\n\n\n", "id": "9876", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6986", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To persistently track objects through changes in appearance and environment, a tracker's object appearance model must be adapted over time.

The Sr2RuO4-Ru interface was found to be atomically smooth. Surprisingly, even such a clean interface appears not to allow the proximity effect of spin-triplet superconducting gap to enter the Ru islands. The previously observed 3 K-phase superconductivity in this eutectic phase seems to occur away from the interface where dislocations are present.\n\nTo pinpoint the enhanced superconductivity to dislocations, micrometer sized flakes of Sr2RuO4 were studied, in which the effect of dislocations on Tc can be studied without the influence of Ru islands. The origin of the 3 K-phase was shown to be the presence of dislocations, near which the crystalline symmetry is lowered. The reduced symmetry leads naturally to an enhanced Tc, as revealed by a phenomenologically theory.\n\nAfter that, a different experiment is presented. Unconventional Josephson coupling was shown to occur in ramp-type junctions on Sr2RuO4 flakes. The chiral edge current was measured using Josephson interferometry. An upper limit of the edge current was obtained to be as small as 0.1 percent of the theoretically predicted value.

On the large-scale end of the spectrum, the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is found to be the dominant mode. Atmospheric wave motion due to Earth\u2019s rotation and gravity fills the spectrum from weeks to hours and from tens of thousands of kilometers to a few tens of kilometers. The thermally driven convective processes at smaller scales are chaotic in nature, which poses an intrinsic limit on the long-term predictability of tropical weather through coupling and scale interaction. This dissertation seeks to identify the predictability limits for tropical atmosphere, establishing an upper bound in expected prediction skill of these weather systems. Other scientific questions this dissertation answered are how much future satellite observations can improve the prediction skill, and how to design adaptive multiscale data assimilation methods that make better use of the available observations.\n\tUsing a convection-permitting numerical model, Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF), an MJO active phase during October 2011 is simulated. The practical predictability limit is estimated from an ensemble forecast with realistic initial and boundary condition uncertainties sampled from the operational global model forecasts. Predictability limit is reached when the ensemble spread is indistinguishable from random climatological draws. Results indicate predictability is scale dependent. There is a sharp transition from slow to fast error growth at the intermediate scales (~500 km), separating the more predictable large-scale components (~2 weeks) from the less predictable small-scale components (<1 day). The intrinsic predictability limits, estimated by reducing the uncertainties to 1%, are >2 weeks for larger scales and <3 days for small scales. An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) is conducted using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to evaluate the potential improvements in the prediction skill through assimilating current and future satellite observations. Results show that the currently available temperature, humidity profiles and wind vectors retrieved from infrared and microwave satellite sounder data can extend the skillful forecast lead time by as much as 4 days for the larger scales. With prospective improvement in resolution and complementary sampling strategies, the prediction skill can be further improved, especially for the smaller scales. These results shed lights on the need, design and cost-benefit analysis of future observing systems for better tropical weather prediction.\nFor ensemble filtering, covariance localization and inflation methods are required to account for sampling errors due to limited ensemble size and unrepresented model errors. Tuning the localization and inflation to achieve optimal filter performance is a laborious process, thus adaptive algorithms are much favored. In this dissertation, an adaptive covariance relaxation (ACR) method is proposed and tested in the Lorenz 40-variable system. The method is able to account for observations that are irregular in spatial and temporal distribution, which is typical for the tropics. In pursuit for an optimal localization method, the sensitivity of localization distance to ensemble size, model resolution, and observing network are comprehensively tested in a multiscale quasi-geostrophic (QG) model. The best localization distance is found dependent to the dominant scale of a system, which motivates the implementation of a multiscale localization for tropical weather.

Interaction of UV laser light with material can induce vibrational excitation or/and photochemical decomposition of molecules.  These two processes are interrelated with each other in UV ablation, therefore, their relative contribution has been a subject of numerous studies.  Despite numerous studies, the mechanistic understanding of the role of the photochemical processes and their coupling with the photothermal processes in UV laser ablation is still far from being complete.  In this thesis, a comprehensive study of the effect of the photochemical processes on laser ablation mechanisms has been conducted using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.\n\tIn order to provide an adequate description of the diverse processes induced by laser irradiation, a computational model has been developed.  In particular, we developed a new concept for modeling photochemical processes in laser ablation of organic films using a mesoscopic coarse-grain breathing sphere model for MD simulations.  The main advantage of our model is the ability to study the dynamics of the system at the mesoscopic length scale, a regime that is not accessible either with atomistic or continuum computational methods.  The photodecomposition of the excited molecules and the chemical reaction patterns in our simulations are based on the photochemistry of chlorobenzene due to ease of its fragmentation and available experimental data.

Among the characteristics that can be related to the experimental results, we observed that the presence of photochemical decomposition processes and subsequent chemical reactions lowers the ablation threshold, intensifies the pressure wave propagation and temperature in the absorbing region, causes the ejection of massive molecular clusters and thus escalates the molecular yield, and increases the density of the plume over pure photothermal ablation.

Health care providers typically offer only brief advice to smokers, partly because they feel ill-equipped (lack of time and training) to provide counseling.

This study proposes testing a new brief solution focused written intervention that could easily be used by health care providers to increase patient willingness to make a quit attempt.\n\nMethods: Participants were 63 current everyday smokers recruited from the Penn State Hershey Medical Center Surgical Waiting Room. \n\nMeasures: Participants completed a survey regarding basic demographic information, tobacco use history, importance and confidence to quit smoking, and stage of change. \n\nIntervention: Participants were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group.

This project was inspired by a set mother-infant interaction dataset. One hundred fifty pairs of mothers' behaviors and infants' reactivity over time were recorded and coded into a categorical multivariate time series database. Common analytical methodologies used in this area include statistical analyses such as ANOVA, MANOVA, regression model, state space grids, Yule's Q, and time series analyses. However, these methods either fail to address the temporal characteristics in the data or the dynamics of multiple subjects as a group. Our project aims to mine these databases in three approaches in attempt to address these limitations: 1. Association Rule Mining, 2. MWASP (Multiple-Width Approximate Sequential Pattern), and 3. TRRMTSD (Temporal Relation Rules for Multivariate Times Series Databases).  \n     Association rule mining was motivated by market basket analysis and has shown to be useful methods in extracting information and uncovering hidden correlations in data. However, the approach is new to the field of developmental psychology. Moreover, conventional association rule mining does not consider the temporal nature that exists in some data. Each data point taken across time is usually treated as an individual record in the data set, where each record in the data set is assumed independent. A goal of association rule mining is to find association between different attributes in the data set among these records. Hence, the correlation of the data with respect to time is collapsed. In this project, we augment the dataset with additional time-related variables in order to address the temporal characteristics in the data with conventional association rule mining methods.\n     Sequential pattern mining involves finding the relationships among occurrences of sequential events, to discover whether there exist any specific ordered items, and/or sequential patterns across different items. The sequential pattern models can be found include frequent patterns, periodic patterns, statistically significant patterns, and approximated patterns. However, most commonly collected data are afflicted with noise. Conventional sequential pattern mining methods that use exact matching may meet difficulties in mining databases with long sequences and noise. Two general approaches used in previous studies to mine sequential patterns in data with noises are distance-based clustering and Hidden Markov model. While these approaches are useful in mining frequent sequential patterns in noisy data, we further propose a framework (MWASP: Multiple-Width Approximate Sequential Pattern) that uncovers frequent approximate sequential patterns with multiple widths. A mined pattern in this framework is a representative of a group of sequences (with various widths) that follow the pattern\u2019s event flow order. This gives insight into the occurrence of the pattern longitudinally as well as across the population. The pattern can be recognized as a common pattern across the multiple time series, time, or both. \n     Multivariate processes arise when several related time series processes are observed simultaneously over time instead of observing just a single series. The two approaches above, association rule mining and sequential rule mining, collapse the temporal nature and the interactions between different processes within a series. In the study of multivariate process, a framework is needed for describing not only the properties of the individual series, but also the possible cross-relationship among the series. For most existing methods, the purposes for analyzing and modeling the series jointly are to understand the dynamic relationships over time among the series and to improve the accuracy of forecasts for individual series by utilizing the additional information available from the related series in forecasts for each series. Motivated by the mother-infant interaction dataset, we are particularly interested in discovering frequent behavior patterns, as well as the interaction and temporal features. A multivariate time series can be comprised of numeric values, symbolic (or categorical) values, or mixed data type.  For numeric multivariate time series, such tasks are often studied using methods such as Hidden Markov Model (HMM), ARMA, and regression. For symbolic (or categorical) multivariate time series, methodologies in sequential pattern mining can be extended to address the tasks. Such extension is highly driven by the data model and users\u2019 specifications.  In this project, we extend the MWASP framework and develop a novice approach, TRR-MTSD (Temporal Relation Rules for Multivariate Times Series Databases) to tackle this kind of databases. The purpose of TRR-MTSD is to locate common cross-relationships between identified sequential patterns in a multivariate categorical time series database.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3650], "author_name_tesi": "Yip, Kelly ", "last_name_ssi": "Yip", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kelly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Arthur Nembhard", "David Arthur Nembhard", "Ling Rothrock", "Timothy William Simpson", "Michael J Rovine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Arthur Nembhard, Dissertation Advisor", "David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Chair", "Ling Rothrock, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["data mining", "multivariate time series", "categorical data", "association rule", "sequential pattern", "interactive data", "approximated pattern"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "The Incremental Cash Flow Predictive Ability of Accrual Models", "id": "7134", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6277", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Prior studies on the incremental predictive ability of accrual models over cash flow models with respect to future cash flows led to conflicting results.

The Barth, Cram, and Nelson model is further modified to allow the incorporation of accrual-based prediction of future sales.  This paper also presents an accrual-based cash flow prediction model based on a random walk in cash flows adjusted for the reversal of current payables and receivables.  Initial results indicate that this simple model based on the complete reversal of current payables and receivables predicts future cash flows better than models based on current cash flows alone.  No initial evidence is found that the more sophisticated accrual-based prediction model developed in this paper and estimated via WLS has incremental predictive power beyond that of the accrual reversal model or the cash flow-based models.  However, supplementary analysis using a more powerful estimation procedure where the prior three years of observations are pooled does find that the accrual-based WLS model dominates both the cash flow-based models and the accrual reversal model.  Consistent with accruals incorporating predictions of future sales, the paper finds that the accrual-based WLS model (when estimated while pooling the prior three years data) is superior to the cash flow-based model in capturing the effect of future sales on future cash flows.

However, reaching this goal continues to be a challenge.  Research reveals that influences on environmental behavior are vastly complex and correlate to the diversity of individual learners as well as the unique social, cultural, and contextual character of environmental issues.  To improve the influence of environmental education on environmental behavior, there is a need to recognize learners as individuals and account for the personal elements that influence engagement.  Based within a constructivist framework, learners form personal constructs that give unique meaning to environmental topics and convey a level of environmental sensitivity or interest in learning about the environment, feeling concern for it, and desiring to protect it.  However, the development of such unique constructs is typically not taken into account in environmental education.  To understand how to support the emergence and development of personal environmental constructs and what effect this may have on environmental sensitivity, an education pilot program was developed.  This program was implemented in two 9th grade ecology classes and focused on developing an awareness of personal views, perspectives, and understandings students use to engage environmental issues.  \nOver a 14 week period, students were presented with diverse environmental perspectives and ideologies and encouraged to reflect on and express unique perspectives and understandings within different discussion formats.  Focus group and written response data were collected and assessed for whether students developed an awareness of personal understandings and what affect if any this had on environmental sensitivity in comparison to a control class.  Results suggest that student\u2019s became more aware of personal understandings and perspectives, but outcomes were mixed as to how such awareness influenced levels of environmental sensitivity.  This study further suggests that supporting the emergence and development of personal environmental constructs must be done in ways that allow social context but that are sensitive to social pressure and to the specific maturity level and unique context of learners.  Furthermore, supporting such awareness must be done in ways that recognize students as continuously defining and redefining their relationship with nature and in turn, in ways that emphasize the process of critical thinking as opposed to the development of specific views and values that develop individually with time.       \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2825], "author_name_tesi": "Yonkovich, Jesse Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Yonkovich", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Jesse", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Pollution Control", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kai Shaft", "Kai Arthur Schafft"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kai Shaft, Thesis Advisor", "Kai Arthur Schafft, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["constructs", "Environmental Education", "environmental behavior"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The impact of Madden-Julian Oscillation on polar surface air temperature\n\n\n\n", "id": "12635", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1306", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates the impact of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) on the extratropical surface air temperature (SAT). The underlying idea of this study is that tropical convective heating is linked to the extratropical circulation and SAT through poleward propagating Rossby waves. Given this perspective, two questions are addressed. One is the extent to which the MJO contribute to interdecadal time scale polar amplification of SAT (Chapters 2 and 3) and the other is the mechanism by which the MJO alters the intraseasonal time scale extratropical SAT change (Chapters 4 and 5).\nPolar amplification, i.e., interdecadal time-scale SAT increase being greatest at high latitudes, is one of prominent features of current climate change. Numerous observational and modeling studies have documented this phenomenon. However, its cause remains uncertain. The surface albedo feedback, which is associated with retreats in snow and ice cover and hence increases in surface albedo with a warmer climate, is the most prominent explanation. However, one of important characteristics of polar amplification is that its maximum amplitude is retained during the winter season when incoming solar radiation is minimal. In Chapters 2 and 3, we show that polar amplification during the 1979-2008 winters is tropically excited. More specifically, we show evidence that polar amplification is linked to interdecadal time scale change in the MJO phase frequency of occurrence. \nWe present both the extended boreal winter (November to March) and austral winter (May to September), with our focus being on winter Hemisphere, where the MJO has strong influence. First, during the 30-year boreal winter, MJO phases 4-6 have occurred with an increased frequency of occurrence while phases 1 and 2 have showed a moderate decrease in their frequency of occurrence. Using lagged composites of the SAT, we show that Arctic warming takes place 1-2 weeks after MJO passes its phases 4-6. Similarly, MJO phases 1 and 2 are 1-2 weeks later followed by Arctic cooling. By incorporating both the trend in MJO phase and the intraseasonal SAT anomaly associated with the MJO, it was found that the MJO-induced SAT trend accounts for 10-20% of the observed Arctic amplification over the Arctic Ocean. It is also presented that the Arctic SAT change is closely related to the spatial structure of the tropical heating associated with the MJO. Phases 4-6 (1-2) are associated with more zonally localized (uniform) tropical convection. The relationship between the Arctic SAT and the spatial structure of the tropical heating is consistent with Lee et al. (2011a; 2011b), who suggest that more localized (uniform) convection enhances (reduces) excitation of poleward propagating Rossby waves that transport heat poleward.\nA similar relationship between the MJO and polar amplification is found in the Southern Hemisphere. During the 30-year austral winter, MJO phases 7-1, which is associated with high latitude warming, exhibited a large increase in their frequency of occurrence, while phase 5, which is followed by high latitude cooling, showed a decrease. The interdecadal SAT trend induced by the MJO, which is obtained using the trend in MJO phase and the intraseasonal SAT anomaly associated with the MJO, explains 10-20% of the interdecadal warming over the Antarctica. It is also shown that the spatial structure of the tropical heating associated with MJO phases 7-1 (phase 5) is more zonally localized (uniform).\n\tTo investigate the physical mechanism that accounts for the linkage between tropical convection, Rossby wave propagation, and polar amplification, we use lagged composites and projections with the thermodynamic energy equation. We show that the Arctic SAT increase (decrease) associated with MJO phase 5 (phase 1) takes place through following a three-step processes; adiabatic warming (cooling) is followed by eddy heat flux convergence (divergence) and then by enhanced  (reduced) downward infrared radiation (IR). \n\tThese three above steps are closely related to the enhanced (reduced) poleward Rossby wave activity associated with more zonally localized (uniform) tropical heating. For instance, the enhanced poleward Rossby wave propagation associated with MJO phase 5 leads to an increased eddy momentum flux convergence at the equator and divergence over the Arctic. At high latitudes, this eddy momentum flux divergence results in a deceleration of the zonal-mean zonal wind. Through thermal wind adjustment, these zonal wind changes further cause inducement of a thermally direct mean meridional circulation that warms the Arctic. It is the opposite for MJO phase 1. Then, an increased (decreased) poleward heat flux associated with the enhanced (reduced) poleward activity propagation contributes to Arctic warming (cooling). The eddy heat flux is dominated by zonal wavenumbers 1-3. The Arctic SAT change is further amplified by changes in downward IR.\n\tTo further ascertain whether the above processes are driven by the tropical convective heating anomalies associated with a particular MJO phase, we employ an initial value approach with an idealized atmospheric general circulation model. It is shown that initial value calculations with observed background flows and MJO-based tropical heating successfully reproduce the above processes. Analogous to the observation, the more zonally localized (uniform) tropical heating associated with MJO phase 5 (phase 1) strengthens (weakens) the excitation of poleward propagating Rossby waves. It is shown that the poleward propagating Rossby waves contribute to alteration of extratropical circulation and, hence, SAT, through adiabatic warming/cooling and planetary-scale eddy heat flux. In addition, it is presented that poleward (equatorward) passive tracer transport takes place in the upper polar troposphere, in response to more zonally local (uniform) tropical heating, which contributes to the observed changes in downward IR associated with MJO phase 5 (phase 1). We lastly present sensitivity test to the initial background flow, which further verifies the causal relationship between tropical heating and planetary-scale response, and also indicates considerable variability due to interaction with pre-existing transient eddies.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1295], "author_name_tesi": "Yoo, Changhyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Yoo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Changhyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sukyoung Lee", "Sukyoung Lee", "Steven B Feldstein", "Peter R Bannon", "Diane Marie Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sukyoung Lee, Dissertation Advisor", "Sukyoung Lee, Committee Chair", "Steven B Feldstein, Committee Member", "Peter R Bannon, Committee Member", "Diane Marie Henderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polar amplification", "Rossby wave", "MJO"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Tasting Cultures: Food, Culture, Media and Tourism", "id": "21424", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "9692", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Drawing on framing as a conceptual framework, this dissertation investigates the ways in which less economically developed countries (LEDCs) in Asia are represented as tourism destinations in travel blogs with particular attention to how its culture, people and/or their food and culinary culture are mediated.

Principle component analysis identified 3 independent attitude components that affect the variation of preference, a desire for renewable energy and environmental quality and concern over cost. The results show that urban residents have a higher desire for environmental quality and concern less about cost than rural residents and consequently have a higher willingness to pay to increase renewable energy production. The results of sub-sample analysis show that a representative respondent in rural (urban) Pennsylvania is willing to pay $3.8(5.9) and $4.1(5.7)/month for increasing the share of Pennsylvania electricity generated from wind power and other renewable energy by 1 percent point, respectively. Mean WTP for solar and biomass electricity was not significantly different from zero.\nIn my second essay, heterogeneity of individual WTP for various renewable energy technologies is investigated using several different variants of the multinomial logit model: a simple MNL with interaction terms, a latent class choice model, a random parameter mixed logit choice model, and a random parameter-latent class choice model. The results of all models consistently show that respondents&#8223; preference for individual renewable technology is heterogeneous, but the degree of heterogeneity differs for different renewable technologies. In general, the random parameter logit model with interactions and a hybrid random parameter logit-latent class model fit better than other models and better capture respondents&#8223; heterogeneity of preference for renewable energy.\nThe impact of the land under agricultural conservation easement (ACE) contract on the values of nearby residential properties is investigated using housing sales data in two Pennsylvania Counties. The spatial-lag (SLM), the spatial error (SEM) and the spatial error component (SEC) models were compared. A geographically weighted regression (GWR) model is estimated to study the spatial heterogeneity of the marginal implicit prices of ACE impact within each county. New hybrid spatial hedonic models, the GWR-SEC and a modified GWR-SEM, are estimated such that both spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity are accounted. The results show that the coefficient of land under easement contract varies spatially within one county, but not within the other county studied. Also, ACE&#8223;s are found to have both positive and negative impacts on the values of nearby residential properties. Among global spatial models, the SEM fit better than the SLM and the SEC. Statistical goodness of fit measures showed that the GWR-SEC model fit better than the GWR or the GWR-SEC model.

Web services are a state-of-the-art, leading technology based on Service Oriented Architecture in the World Wide Web environment. Each Web service is described in a standard language, such as WSDL (Web Service Definition Language), and is published in a global registry called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration). Individual users or software agents invoke Web services based on the Web service descriptions registered with UDDI. A simple information or service request can be fulfilled by a single Web service, but complicated requests cannot be satisfied by a single Web service. Consequently, a composition of multiple Web services in an appropriate sequence is required. \nAs the number of Web services increases in dynamic business environments, the automation of Web service composition becomes an essential feature for commercial Web services. Automatic Web service composition software should be able to consider not only functional requirements, but also quality of service (QoS) aspects. Functional requirements force the composition software to generate feasible solutions, while QoS aspects make the composition software satisfy user objectives, such as cost, time, or reliability. \nWeb service composition problems can be classified in two ways: (1) syntactically and (2) semantically. Semantic issues have recently presented challenges to Web service composition. Due to insufficient understanding of semantics, Web service composition solutions can be inferior, or even impossible to generate. \nIn this research, a mathematical solution framework that guarantees the optimal solution to semantic Web service composition is introduced. The Integer Programming (IP) based mathematical framework considers not only functional requirements but also QoS aspects of Web service composition. Furthermore, the framework can incorporate semantics-processing mechanisms into its IP formulation. The proposed approach guarantees the optimality of the solutions from both syntactic and semantic perspectives.\nFinally, a k-best solution method for Web service composition is presented. Using k-best solutions provides a holistic view of the Web service composition solution space rather than a myopic view that is focused only on the optimal solution. Knowing k-best solutions and the summary statistics among them (such as the range of objective values) provides a broader view when composing Web services.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3107], "author_name_tesi": "Yoo, Jung-Woon ", "last_name_ssi": "Yoo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jung-Woon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Soundar Kumara", "Soundar Kumara", "Dongwon Lee", "Timothy William Simpson", "Jose Antonio Ventura"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Soundar Kumara, Dissertation Advisor", "Soundar Kumara, Committee Chair", "Dongwon Lee, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["k-best solution approach", "Web service composition", "Semantic Web", "Integer Programming", "quality of service"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "MODELING AND SIMULATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC BAND GAP STRUCTURES AND METAMATERIALS", "id": "11333", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3690", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) structures, engineered to achieve desired transmission and reflection characteristics in specific frequency bands, have recently attracted considerable attention due to growing interest in improving antenna performance. Almost simultaneously, metamaterials (MTMs) became popular because they have unusual features, not readily available in nature, promised to make possible new applications for microwave circuits and antenna composites. EBGs and MTMs are typically created by using periodic inclusions of metallic or dielectric material embedded in a homogeneous background medium. Due to their unique bandgap features, EBG structures can be regarded as a special type of MTM. In fact, these two terms, EBG and MTM, are sometimes used interchangeably. Typical examples of their applications for enhancing antenna performance include high-directivity antennas, low-profile antennas, high impedance surfaces, and dichroic surfaces.\n\tIn this dissertation, we focus primarily on three aspects. First, we develop a novel and systematic approach to enhancing the directivity of an antenna covered by an EBG and MTM and show that high directivity is achieved at the resonant frequency of the structure. We also illustrate the application of the above procedure by designing directivity-enhanced planar antennas, for instance, dipole and microstrip patch antenna arrays used as exciters for a Fabry\u2013Perot cavity with a dielectric slab as the superstrate.\n\tSecond, we describe two novel techniques involving a combination of the Dipole Moment (DM) method and the Characteristic Basis Function Method (CBFM) to model periodic structures of EBGs and MTMs. We show that combining the above two methods leads to a relatively small matrix, often only 2\u00d72 or 3\u00d73 in size, without running into ill-conditioning problems for many typical elements.\n\tThird, we develop guidelines for using the Equivalent Medium Approach (EMA) to the study of metamaterial structures. We examine the concept of effective material parameters by completing the retrieval process of these parameters according to the inversion approach and identify some fundamental problem areas encountered when applying the algorithm to a slab of artificial dielectrics. We then use a Gaussian beam to excite this structure in order to examine the direction of the beam\u2019s wave propagation in such a medium. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3670], "author_name_tesi": "Yoo, Kyungho  ", "last_name_ssi": "Yoo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kyungho ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raj Mittra", "Raj Mittra", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Anthony J Ferraro", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raj Mittra, Dissertation Advisor", "Raj Mittra, Committee Chair", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member", "Anthony J Ferraro, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electromagnetic Band Gap", "metamaterials", "superstrates", "dipole moment", "characteristic basis function", "equivalent medium"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Comparison of interlaminar fracture toughness of filament wound glass/epoxy composites by using MWCNTs or flexible resin", "id": "10055", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4446", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this investigation is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of two approaches for improving the interlaminar fracture toughness (IFT) of wet-filament-wound glass/epoxy composites incorporating multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into a conventional epoxy matrix material and utilizing flexiblized epoxy resins in selective layers in otherwise rigid-matrix laminates, generally referred to as the layer-wise hybrid (LWH) approach.

Assessment of the measurement agreement encompasses a variety of applications. A number of indices for measuring agreement have been developed. However, these measures make a major assumption: that the mean and variation are stable over time. With recent developments in data collection methods and statistical models, intensive longitudinal studies and the analysis of intensive longitudinal data are gaining popularity across many areas. Intensive longitudinal data enable researchers to examine more detailed features of how pro- cesses change over time.\n   Due to its high intensity of assessments within subjects, it has different characteristics from traditional longitudinal data, which often involve a small number of repeated observations across many individuals. The overall mean of intensive longitudinal data is typically a smooth curve of time and variance of the error process may be time-varying over study duration. Moreover, heterogeneity of intra subject processes such as autocorrelation and instability exists. To overcome these challenges and provide accuracy estimates, we first propose a novel estimation procedure for functional mixed models and partially linear mixed models and study the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimation procedure. Then, we develop a new index of the agreement for intensive longitudinal data, the functional type of concordance correlation coefficient based on proposed models. The functional concordance correlation coefficient is robust with respect to model specification, compared with the popular index, the unified approach of concordance correlation coefficient. The proposed index improves the accuracy of measurement agreement by separating the time trend of measurements from the degree of agreement. All the proposed procedures are assessed by intensive finite sample simulation studies and most are illustrated with real data examples.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4527], "author_name_tesi": "Yoo, Mina ", "last_name_ssi": "Yoo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Runze Li", "Runze Li", "Mosuk Chow", "Naomi S Altman", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Runze Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Runze Li, Committee Chair", "Mosuk Chow, Committee Chair", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["concordance correlation coefficient", "varying coefficient models", "partially linear models", "mixed effects models", "measurement agreement", "intensive longitudinal data"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "NUMERICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS OF ANTI-RAM BARRIERS UNDER VEHICULAR IMPACT", "id": "15057tzy109", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15057", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-01-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As terrorist attacks have frequently occurred in recent years, security measures to stop or mitigate the damage they cause have been increasingly discussed and researched.  Vehicle anti-ram systems have been widely used for protecting sensitive buildings and facilities against vehicular impacts.  Numerous researchers have investigated vehicle anti-ram systems under vehicular impact using the LS-DYNA research/commercial code and field-scale crash tests.  However, comparisons between different formulations in LS-DYNA for the interaction between soil and embedded anti-ram systems involving large soil deformation are remarkably sparse in the literature, particularly when the comparison is validated using instrumented, field-scale crash tests.  The aim of this study is to numerically investigate several vehicle anti-ram systems with comparisons to experimental results to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the simulation models and the impact performance of the systems.  \nIn the first part of the dissertation, two field-scale crash tests of Streetscape Vehicle Anti-Ram (SVAR) barrier systems and LS-DYNA simulations to predict the global response of each system under vehicular impact were conducted.  Tests 1 and 2 consisted of a five-post welded bus stop and a welded bollard, respectively.  Test 1 resulted in a P1 rating, where minimal foundation uplift and rotation were observed; however, test 2 failed to result in a P1 rating, where significant foundation uplift, rotation, concrete cracking, and large deformation of surrounding soil were observed.  For each test, two LS-DYNA models, namely an FEM-only model and a hybrid FEM-SPH model, were created to predict the global response of the system.  The hybrid FEM-SPH model did a much better job in matching the crash test than the FEM model did.  This research suggests that the hybrid FEM-SPH approach is more appropriate in simulating the field performance of embedded structures under impact loading when large deformation of the surrounding soil is expected.\nIn the second part of the dissertation, a series of experimental testing and numerical modeling studies to optimize the parameters of a constitutive material model were conducted to accurately simulate the behavior of polystyrene crushable concrete during impact loading using LS-DYNA.  Quasi-static compression tests and confined drop impact tests were performed.  To model the quasi-static compression tests, the response surface methodology was used to optimize the Poisson\u2019s ratio and friction angle in the pseudo-tensor model in LS-DYNA.  Using the optimized model parameters, the simulated compression stress vs. strain relationship showed an excellent agreement with those from the compression tests.  To model the confined drop impact tests, the strain rate sensitivity parameter in LS-DYNA was optimized by comparing the drop impact simulations at different strain-rate sensitivity values with the drop impact tests.  This study suggests that the pseudo-tensor material model is suitable for modeling crushable concrete.  Although the optimized constitutive model parameters are specific for the polystyrene concrete mix used in this study, a similar approach can be used to optimize model parameters for other polystyrene concrete mixes.  \nIn the third part of the dissertation, a series of tests were designed and conducted to determine the angle of a boulder face at which the impact of a vehicle changes from preventing override to allowing override.  Medium-scale pendulum tests were performed for the vehicular override research of a boulder with the impact face angled at 55\u00b0, 60\u00b0, and 65\u00b0 from the horizontal plane.  A dimensionless analysis was conducted to properly relate the pendulum test results to full-scale field situation.  LS-DYNA simulations were conducted to yield the input parameters needed for the dimensionless analysis.  Vehicle override is predicted to occur for the 55\u00b0 override angle under both M30 and M50 scenarios, but not to occur for the 65\u00b0 override angle under both scenarios.  This prediction is consistent with the results of high-fidelity LS-DYNA simulations of the full-scale crash tests.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16765], "author_name_tesi": "Yoo, Tae Kwang", "last_name_ssi": "Yoo", "middle_name_ssi": "Kwang", "first_name_ssi": "Tae", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tong Qiu", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "Daniel Allen Russell", "Robert Lee Campbell", "Sean N Brennan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tong Qiu, Dissertation Advisor", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Chair", "Daniel Allen Russell, Committee Member", "Robert Lee Campbell, Committee Member", "Sean N Brennan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Anti-Ram Barriers", "Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics", "Soil-Structure Interaction", "LS-DYNA", "Crushable Concrete", "Response Surface Methodology", "Dimensionless Analyses", "Pendulum Test"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Argonne National Laboratory and the Emergence of Computer and Computational Science, 1946-1992", "id": "6740", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1104", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nArgonne National Laboratory and the Emergence of Computer and Computational Science, 1946-1992 uses the activities of the Applied Mathematics Division (AMD) of Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) as a window to explore the emergence of computer and computational science as independent scientific disciplines.  I argue that computers are a unique scientific technology in that they have spurred the creation of entirely new scientific disciplines and new methodologies for scientific investigation computers.  Moreover, the evolution of the computing activities at Argonne over five decades reflects broader issues concerning technology, identity, professionalization, and the social organization of science.\n While the advancement of digital computer technology is a significant part of this story, possibly more important was the AMD\u2019s efforts to integrate computers \u2013 and their attendant personnel \u2013 into the scientific process.  Early on, the directors of the AMD envisioned a new role for applied mathematicians vis-\u00e0-vis scientists and engineers in the development of mathematical models suitable for digital computers.  In particular, the pursuit of \"computational science\" required that applied mathematicians be incorporated more directly in all stages of science and engineering practice -- from problem formulation to the definition of what constituted a solution.  Arguments in favor of such a collaborative structure drew on Cold War rhetoric, debates within the mathematical profession, and issues surrounding the increasing quantification of the sciences.  While computers (and the need for sophisticated, yet efficient mathematical models) allowed applied mathematicians to contend for such a position, it was also necessary for applied mathematicians to stake out a new research agenda that balanced their service requirement to scientists and engineers with the necessity to conduct research in the foundations of mathematics.\nDespite the intentions of AMD directors, the interdisciplinary collaboration that computers were supposed to foster failed to materialize as envisioned.  Issues concerning professional identities, technological innovation in computers and software, and the development of computer expertise by other scientists effectively limited the extent to which applied mathematicians and computer scientists were needed to assist in compute-intensive projects.  During the mid-1970s, though, the development of supercomputers, together with a new federal emphasis on the development of high-speed computer networking created new linkages between mathematicians, computer scientists, and scientists who used computers extensively in their research.  Impetus for collaboration was fueled by a number of different national concerns such as the Japanese Fifth Generation program, the need to support the domestic supercomputing industry, and pressures to make supercomputers readily accessible to scientists.  The federal government responded to these issues by creating the High Performance Computing program in the late 1980s and the Grand Challenge Program of the 1990s in an effort to support the growth of computational science.  Funded at almost $5 billon over five years, these federal programs enabled computational scientists to tackle problems having significant implications for science, economics, and national security.  One result of the HPC initiative, however, was the reorientation of computer science research in order to meet these programmatic goals. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1093], "author_name_tesi": "Yood, Charles Nelson", "last_name_ssi": "Yood", "middle_name_ssi": "Nelson", "first_name_ssi": "Charles", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Proctor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Proctor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["computational science", "computer science", "history of computing", "Argonne National Laboratory", "History of Computers", "Applied Mathematics", "High Performance Computing and Communications"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "NANOSCALE CROSSED-WIRE DEVICE FOR IN-SITU ELECTRICAL AND SPECTROSCOPIC CHARACTERIZATION OF MOLECULAR JUNCTIONS\n", "id": "7897", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2378", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Considerable attention has been devoted to developing molecular-scale devices for applications in future electronic and sensing circuits. Several recent theoretical and experimental results have shown that small variations in the structure of the molecular junction (e.g., molecular conformation, contact geometry, bonding, single molecule vs. monolayer, etc.) can cause significant changes in the electrical properties of the device. Thus, the relationship between the electronic properties and the detailed structure of the junction must be understood before it is possible to use molecules in these applications.\n\nIn order to develop an improved understanding of the structure-property relationship, this thesis developed a new nanoscale crossed-wire molecular device that is comprised of a well-ordered monolayer of several hundred molecules sandwiched between a lithographically-defined bottom Ti/Au metal bottom contact and a single Au metal nanowire top contact. This molecular device structure has several attractive features. First, the single metal nanowire top contact reduces deleterious junction artifacts that can arise during the fabrication process (e.g., metal nanofilaments). Second, many devices can be integrated in parallel on the same substrate (potentially up to 100), which allows meaningful comparisons between theory and experiment. Third, the crossed-wire device facilitates variable and low-temperature current-voltage (I-V) measurements to study the dominant conduction mechanisms of different molecular junction. Finally, the device structure is amenable to Inelastic Electron Tunneling Spectroscopy (IETS) that allows a direct and in-situ measurement of the vibronic properties that correspond to different electronic states of the molecular junctions. \n\nElectrical and spectroscopic measurements were conducted using three different molecules. First, saturated alkanethiol molecules were investigated to evaluate the new device structure because these s-bonded molecules with simple structure have been studied extensively in previous experiments. Second, conjugated oligo(phenylene-ethynylene) molecular wire molecules were used to study the effect of \u00a5\u00f0-conjugation on the electronic properties of molecular junction devices. Last, the bistable switching properties of thiol-substituted methylated oligoaniline SAM (self-assembled monolayer) junction devices were investigated by comparing I-V characteristics and IET spectra collected in high- and low-conductance states of the junction.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2362], "author_name_tesi": "Yoon, Heayoung ", "last_name_ssi": "Yoon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Heayoung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "David Lawrence Allara", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Chair", "David Lawrence Allara, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["molecular electronics", "nanoscale", "IETS", "alkanethiol", "OPE", "oligoaniline", "swtiching molecule", "crossed-wire device"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF \nTHE ASSESSMENT OF HUMAN AGENCY \nEMPLOYING ALBERT BANDURA\u2019S HUMAN AGENCY THEORY", "id": "12221", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2312", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a measurement tool that assesses the four core features of human agency: intentionality, forethought, self-reactiveness, and self-reflectiveness, based on Bandura (2001).

Instead, my dissertation proposes to shift the focus from countries as a whole to a range of policy issues, in order to assess the types and diversity of participation in overall policymaking across political systems. \n\nSpecifically, I compare the actors involved in a sample of policy issues in Korea, the EU, and the US. The three political systems offer interesting comparisons given the distinct features each represents\u2014the state has traditionally dominated policymaking in Korea whereas the nongovernmental sector remained weak, the US is an opposite case where well organized groups are central to the policy process rather than the state, and finally the EU where both the policymaking bodies and outside groups are weakly organized. I hypothesize that the types and diversity of participation in the overall policymaking process varies across three political systems depending on the different levels of government-group dominance. To test this claim, I collected original data on Korean policymaking, by drawing a representative set of 43 policy issues in Korea, relying on face-to-face interviews with over 100 (collected between June 2009-May 2010 during fieldwork in Seoul, Korea) policy actors, as well as in-depth case studies of each policy issue based on publicly available sources. The data were collected using similar methodologies as previous studies of policymaking in the US and EU, making direct comparisons possible across the three political systems. The findings confirm my hypothesis\u2014descriptive statistics of the participants show that overall participation is more diverse in the pluralist US than in the EU, and Korea. Similarly, state actors\u2014the executive and bureaucracy\u2014are frequent participants in the policy process in Korea in comparison to the US and EU.\n\nAdditionally, my dissertation examines the strengths and limits of nongovernmental groups in relation to the state in the Korean policymaking process. The statist perspective has largely shaped our understandings of policymaking in East Asian countries, but scholars of civil society have recently highlighted the growing prominence of outside interests in policymaking. Analyzing the types of actors participating in a sample of 43 issue debates in Korea, I find that nongovernmental groups, diverse in terms of the interests they represent, frequently participate in today\u2019s policy process in Korea. Furthermore, outside groups successfully prevent or slow the pace of policy changes sought by the state by shopping for other institutional venues (e.g., another bureaucratic agency or legislative members). \n\nMy dissertation contributes to scholarly debates in the following ways. First, my research provides one of the few explorations of policymaking across political systems based on a representative set of policy issues, confirming the long held belief that the structure of government-group relations has important implications for whose views are represented in overall policymaking. Additionally, my dissertation demonstrates the dynamic interactions between government insiders and outside interests in countries where the policymaking process has traditionally been dominated by the state\u2014outside groups are actively mobilized to promote their interests, and they attain policy success by taking advantage of multiple institutional venues.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3106], "author_name_tesi": "Yoon, Jiso ", "last_name_ssi": "Yoon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiso", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lee Ann Banaszak", "Lee Ann Banaszak", "Frank Baumgartner", "Marie Hojnacki", "Vineeta Yadav", "John David Mccarthy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lee Ann Banaszak, Dissertation Advisor", "Lee Ann Banaszak, Committee Chair", "Frank Baumgartner, Committee Chair", "Marie Hojnacki, Committee Member", "Vineeta Yadav, Committee Member", "John David Mccarthy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Comparative Policymaking", "Comparative Civil Society"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Applications of the ReaxFF reactive force field towards chemomechanical and electrocatalytic systems", "id": "13377kuy121", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13377", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes two distinct applications of ReaxFF reactive force field simulations, one for the high-kinetic energy collisions of nanoparticles and noble gas ions with graphene and the other for the effects of the charge on the surface stability of bismuth, which is an efficient catalytic metal for the reduction of CO2 in combination with imidazolium-based ionic liquids.\nDue to limited time-scale resolution, providing the dynamic atomistic details in high-kinetic energy impact experiments has been extremely challenging, even for the state-of-art characterization tools. Also, due to the issues inherent in the potential functionals of conventional molecular dynamics (MD) methods, they have not been able to simulate the fully-dynamic processes of fracturing materials, generating defects, and the relaxation of structures. In the first part of this thesis, the ReaxFF reactive force field method was used to investigate the dynamic mechanical behavior of graphene under high-kinetic energy impacts of nanoprojectiles and noble gas ions. The impact study of nanoprojectiles was focused on the atomistic features and energetics regarding the processes of crack initiation and subsequent crack extension, and on the effects of defects in graphene and the materials (nickel and silica) that were used to make the nanoprojectiles on the penetration energy (Ep*). The atomistic analysis of graphene during impacts by nanoprojectiles supported the previously-reported findings regarding the preferential edge orientation of graphene and indicated what makes graphene super-strong bullet-proof material. The impact study of noble gas ions was focused on the effects of the dosage and type of irradiating ions on defect density in graphene. The dynamic processes were also studied that were involved in the irradiation of noble gas ions (He+, Ne+, Ar+, Kr+) and subsequent relaxation. This study provided insight concerning the formation of defects in graphene during irradiation with noble gas ions and suggests a possible way to control defects in graphene. Furthermore, this study addressed the effects of hydrocarbon contaminants on the formation of defects in graphene during irradiation by noble gas ions. This is important because the hydrocarbon contaminants commonly exist and accumulate on graphene. The atomistic simulations allowed an understanding of the role of hydrocarbon contaminants in the irradiation of graphene.\nThe second part of this thesis was focused on the development of the force field for describing the solid-phase bismuth and its interactions with the molecules that are experimentally relevant in CO2 reduction processes, such as CO2, CO, H2O, MeCN, and [EMIM]BF4. Then the structure of a bismuth electrode was investigated upon application of charges. The electrocatalytic system that consists of the solid-phase bismuth and [EMIM]BF4 is of particular interest because of the high efficiency of CO2 reduction in this system under a low overpotential. Based upon the experimental finding that the surface of bismuth undergoes structural modification before the initiation of the electrocatalytic processes of CO2 reduction, we investigated the structural modifications of the surface at the atomic scale. The bismuth force field predicted that the surface stability of bismuth was affected by the charge state of bismuth.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13086], "author_name_tesi": "Yoon, Kichul ", "last_name_ssi": "Yoon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kichul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adri van Duin", "Adri van Duin", "Md Amanul Haque", "Donghai Wang", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adri van Duin, Dissertation Advisor", "Adri van Duin, Committee Chair", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ReaxFF", "reactive force field", "irradiation of graphene", "bombardment of graphene", "defects in graphene", "fracture of graphene", "penetration of graphene", "bismuth force field", "nanopores", "mechanical failure"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Development of a fast and accurate annual daylight simulation approach for complex window systems\n\n", "id": "7374", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6729", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The introduction of daylight through window systems to building interiors has the potential to save electric lighting energy and heating and cooling loads, but improper selection/design of window systems can negate the benefits of electric lighting energy reduction by increasing space conditioning requirements.

However, computation of annual daylight availability, which provides annual electric lighting energy use, requires long computation time, and there are no annual daylight simulation tools capable of simulating annual performance of complex daylight systems with reasonably short computation time. The main hypothesis of this research is that a fast and accurate annual daylight simulation approach for spaces with daylight systems and exterior obstructions can be performed.\nTo compute the illuminance contribution from the sky, a daylight coefficient approach and sky matching methods using the exterior vertical to horizontal illuminance ratio, illuminance vectors, and illuminance ratios were studied. The daylight coefficient approach provides more accurate simulation results and requires less computation time than the sky matching methods.\nTo compute the illuminance contribution from the sun, a daylight coefficient approach, a sun matching method, and a modified sun matching method were investigated. The modified sun matching method provides the most accurate sun illuminance results, but is the slowest method.

Therefore, the accuracy in the prediction of electric lighting energy use for the fastest and the most accurate annual simulation approaches were investigated. Both methods provide comparable accuracy to the standard RADIANCE hour by hour approach.\nIn this thesis, the daylight coefficient approaches for the sky and the sun were also successfully applied to simulate the performance of the photosensor that exhibits a directional sensitivity distribution. The simulation of the hourly photosensor performance for an entire year permits an evaluation of realistically accurate hourly electric lighting energy use for a given lighting control system, type, location, and orientation of the photosensor.\nThe proposed annual daylight simulation method consumes 0.0001~0.0002 times the computation time required for the standard RADIANCE rtrace method for illuminance sensor modeling and 0.004~0.006 times the computation time required for the RADIANCE psens method for photosensor modeling.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6724], "author_name_tesi": "Yoon, Younju ", "last_name_ssi": "Yoon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Younju", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Martin Moeck", "Richard George Mistrick", "William P Bahnfleth", "John Michael Cimbala"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Martin Moeck, Committee Chair", "Richard George Mistrick, Committee Member", "William P Bahnfleth, Committee Member", "John Michael Cimbala, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Annual photosensor performance modeling", "RADIANCE", "Annual daylight simulation", "Daylight Coefficient Approach", "Annual daylight simulation for blind and complex w"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FABRICATION OF TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOTUBE ARRAYS USING ORGANIC ELECTROLYTES\n", "id": "11334", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5892", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Self-organized, vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays are synthesized by anodic oxidation or electrochemical anodization of titanium foil generally in fluoride ion containing electrolytes.  The titanium dioxide nanotube arrays have attracted considerable due to their large surface area, high photocatalytic activity, and photoelectrochemical behavior.  TiO2 nanotubes are currently used in a variety of applications such as photocatalysis, biomolecular immobilization, chemical gas sensors, and dye-sensitized solar cells.  The ability to precisely control the architecture of TiO2 nanotubes, including wall thickness, pore diameter, wall topology, length, and tube-to-tube spacing is necessary to further enhance device performance and application.  In order to repeatedly and precisely control the tube morphology, the inter-related effects of the various anodizing variables including fluoride concentration, anodization voltage, time, concentration of additive species, electrolyte composition, reusing of the electrolyte, and the nature electrolyte medium must be understood to achieve nanotube arrays with desired tube morphology.  Anodization in aqueous electrolyte limits the nanotube length to less than 10 &#61549;m, while the polar organic electrolytes are capable of producing the nanotube length relatively longer, to date, up to approximately 1000 &#61549;m using ethylene glycol.  \nDifferent organic electrolytes commonly produce TiO2 nanotube arrays having different tube morphologies, however, very similar tube geometries can be achieved from different organic electrolytes through optimization of the anodizing parameters and the electrolyte composition.  From these findings, it was hypothesized that the fundamental principles controlling the formation process could be similar for different electrolytes, when the effect of the anodizing parameters on the resulting morphology should be clarified in each case to fundamentally understand the formation mechanism of nanotubes as well as the effects of the anodizing parameters on the tube morphology.  \nThis dissertation focuses on fabrication and improvement of morphological features of TiO2 nanotube arrays in the selected organic electrolytes including dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; see Chapter 4) and diethylene glycol (DEG; see Chapter 5).  Using a polar dimethyl sulfoxide containing hydrofluoric acid, the vertically oriented TiO2 nanotube arrays with well controlled morphologies, i.e. tube lengths ranging from few microns up to 101 &#61549;m, pore diameters from 100 nm to 150 nm, and wall thicknesses from 15 nm to 50 nm were achieved.  Various anodization variables including fluoride ion concentration, voltage, anodization time, water content, and reuse of the anodized electrolyte could be manipulated under proper conditions to control the nanotube array morphology.  Anodization current behaviors associated with evolution of nanotube length were analyzed in order to clarify and better understand the formation mechanism of nanotubes grown in the organic electrolytes.  Typically observed for DMSO electrolyte, the behavior that anodization current density gradually decreases with time is a reflection of a constant growth rate of nanotube arrays.  Large fluctuation of anodization current was significantly observed probably due to the large change in electrolyte properties during anodization, when anodizing in high conductivity electrolytes such as using high HF concentration and reusing the anodized electrolyte as a second time.  It is believed that the electrolyte properties such as conductivity and polarity play important role in affecting ion solvation and interactions in the solution consequently determining the formation of oxide film.  \nFabrication of the TiO2 nanotube array films was extended to study in the more viscous diethylene glycol (DEG) electrolyte.  The arrayed nanotubes achieved from DEG electrolytes containing either HF or NH4F are fully separated, freely self-standing structure with open pores and a wide variation of tube-to-tube spacing ranging from < 100 nm to ~2 &#61549;m.  In comparison to DMSO electrolyte, the electrochemical anodization rates are relatively slower in DEG electrolyte; as a result, the nanotube length is typically less than 10 &#61549;m.  Pore size of nanotubes grown in DEG has been extended from 150 nm up to approximately 400 nm.  The approach to pore widening could be achieved by using a specific condition of low HF concentration and prolonged anodization time.  The study of evolution of nanotubes grown in DEG electrolytes showed that a fibrous layer was formed in the early growth stages and then was chemically and gradually removed after a long duration, leaving behind the nanotubes with large pore size.  In DEG electrolyte, the closer spacing between Ti and Pt electrodes resulted in the larger nanotube morphological parameters due to the enhanced electrode kinetics facilitating the electrode reactions.  The cation choice of fluoride bearing species was found to enhance the nanotube growth rate; with larger cation size leading to the increased tube length of about 20 &#61549;m to be obtained.  The relatively larger cation may influence ion solvation behavior in electrolyte, which directly affects the oxide growth and the tube formation.  Also the inhibitory effect of larger cation was believed to restrict the barrier layer thickness thus enhancing the nanotube growth rate.  The average growth rate in DEG electrolyte is about 0.1-0.3 \u00b5m h-1, which is slowest among DMSO (1 \u00b5m h-1), FA (2 \u00b5m h-1), and EG (15 \u00b5m h-1) electrolytes.  For a given fluoride ion concentration, pore size (Dinner) and outer diameter (Douter) was found to depend on the anodization voltage as these following equations; Dinner = 0.86 V + 102.9 and Douter = 2.65 V + 137.1.  \nThe current behavior observed for DEG electrolyte is different from those observed in aqueous electrolytes, EG, FA, or DMSO.  Typically observed in the DEG electrolyte without additives, the anodic current showed a graduate increase with anodization time.  When high polar solvents were incorporated, the typical DEG anodization current was also observed in the early period of nanotube growth where the oxidation process dominates.  Then the current density starts to decrease when the chemical dissolution begins to dominate.  \nIn DEG electrolyte, the effect of electrolyte properties on the resulting nanotube array morphology was quantitatively investigated.  Important anodizing parameters including anodizing voltage, time, HF concentration, inter-electrode spacing, and solvent additives were found to have a strong influence on the electrolyte conductivity and the titanium ion concentration dissolving in electrolyte.  This work has confirmed that the electrolyte conductivity has a linear relationship with the titanium concentration under a variety of anodizing conditions.  Using a fixed Ti sample area of 3.0 cm2, a nominal electrolyte conductivity of 250 \u00b5S cm-1 and titanium concentration values of 1200 ppm were achieved.  The conductivity-titanium concentration relation was established as a function of anodization voltage, in which the self ordering regime was also built upon this relation based on the construction architecture of nanopores.  Using DEG&#61485;HF electrolyte as the model system, this work showed that the degree of self ordering was found to strongly depend on the electrolyte properties; particularly the electrolyte conductivity is a critical factor in the control of nanotube array morphological features.  \nIn addition, porosity of titania nanotube films was calculated and porosity regime was created as a function of conductivity of anodized electrolyte.  The aim of this part was to provide a new insight into the electrolyte properties-related porosity and the self ordering of pore arrangement affected by the synthesis conditions.  From the achieved results, the alumina-like porous structure was found to have porosity values between 18 % and 70 %, when the films were grown in the electrolytes having low conductivity (< 100 &#61549;S cm-1).  Whereas the more separated, well-ordered titania nanotube structure, the films grown in higher conductivity electrolytes have % porosity in a lower range of 10 %-30 %.  The % porosity also tends to decrease with the increased voltage.  A combination of anodization voltage and conductivity was expected to be a self-ordering determining factor that consequently controls the tube formation and porosity of the titania film.  The proposed porosity regimes could also be applied to the titania nanotube array films fabricated in other organic electrolytes such as DMSO and EG.\nFurthermore, this dissertation showed possibilities to crystallize the titania nanotube array films at room temperature via anodization in either DMSO or DEG electrolytes.  The partially crystallized films could be achieved specifically in the optimum slow growth process conditions.  Due to partial crystallization of the as-anodized samples, the high temperature annealing study revealed that the temperatures of phase transformation are 260 \u00baC and 430\u00b0C for respectively amorphous to anatase and anatase to rutile, which are accounted as the lowest phase transformation temperatures reported to date (2010).\nFinally, the photoelectrochemical properties of the DMSO fabricated nanotubes were investigated.  The maximum photocurrent density of ~ 11 mA cm-2 was achieved by using the 46-&#61549;m long nanotube array sample with completely open pores, and photoconversion efficiencies of 5.425 % (&#61617; 0.087) (under UV light) and 0.197 % (&#61617; 0.001) (under solar spectrum AM 1.5) have been demonstrated.  Biomedical applications of the DEG fabricated nanotube arrays films such as blood clotting, hemocompatibility, and drug delivery were investigated.  The titania nanotube arrays showed a significant platelet adhesion and activation, a higher viability, and a greater capability in blood clotting compared to a smooth Ti surface.  In drug delivery application, the drug elution kinetics, behavior and diffusion of drug molecules were most profoundly affected by the nanotube architectures such as the pore packing density and the gap or separation between the tubes, the nanotube length, and especially the nanotube pore diameter.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5888], "author_name_tesi": "Yoriya, Sorachon ", "last_name_ssi": "Yoriya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sorachon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Craig A Grimes", "Prof Craig A Grimes", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof Craig A Grimes, Dissertation Advisor", "Prof Craig A Grimes, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Titanium dioxide", "titania nanotubes", "anodization", "anodic oxidation", "fabrication", "porosity", "organic electrolytes", "in-situ crystallization", "photoelectrochemical properties", "biomedical applications"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Evaluating the Performance and Accuracy of Forecasting Incident Rates for Mining Operations", "id": "27493", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7887", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The push for increased safety in the workplace has led to advancements in regulations, technology, and techniques; many of which, have resulted in a reduction of incidents that affect employees, equipment, and the environment.  Unfortunately, the potential benefits of a safety program are only realized after an incident has occurred.  Resource allocation in an organization\u2019s safety programs has the important task of balancing cost versus often unseen benefits.\nOne way that safety professionals can provide an estimate of the potential return on investment is to estimate how incident rates can change, based upon different resource allocation strategies.  Previous studies have utilized four different statistical forecasting methods (moving average, weighted moving average, exponential smoothing, and double exponential smoothing) to predict how incident rates are affected by changes in the allocation of resources.\nThis study evaluates the incident rate prediction performance of five different statistical forecasting methods\u2014the four above as well as a new method (auto regressive moving average) which has never been used in prior resource allocation studies. This study evaluates the accuracy of the forecasting methods on common data sets to provide a commensurable comparison of the methods , in order to assess which forecast methods should be considered for incident rate prediction.   \nThis study finds that the double exponential smoothing and auto regressive moving average methods provide the most accurate incident rate predictions based on the datasets utilized.  For the two test data sets, the double exponential smoothing method has a forecast accuracy of 92.95% and the auto regressive moving average method has a forecast accuracy of 91.85%.  Both methods resulted in a coefficient of determination above the accuracy measure (0.50), with an average R2 of 0.78 for the double exponential smoothing method and 0.80 for the auto regressive moving average method. In contrast, the exponential smoothing method was least accurate with an average forecast accuracy of 78.31% and a coefficient of determination of 0.56.  This result is explained by the fact that the datasets tested demonstrated a decreasing linear trend, and the exponential smoothing method does not forecast as well with data that demonstrates trends.

Agricultural production in much of the world is constrained by the natural infertility of soil which restrains crops from reaching their yield potential. In developed nations, fertilizer inputs pollute air and water and contribute to climate change and environmental degradation. In poor nations low soil fertility is a primary constraint to food security and economic development. Increasing the acquisition efficiency of soil resources is one method by which crop yields could be increased without the use of more fertilizers. Maize is one of the most widely grown crops, both in terms of land area and in yield, so optimizing uptake efficiency of maize is an important goal.\nRoots are the primary interface between plant and soil and are responsible for the uptake of soil resources. The deployment of roots in space and time comprises root system architecture (RSA). Maize RSA is a complex phenotype that aggregates many elemental phenes (elemental units of phenotype). Integration of root phenes will be determined by interactions through their effects on soil foraging and plant metabolism. Many architectural, metabolic, and physiological root phenes have been identified in maize, including: nodal root number, nodal root growth angle, lateral root density, lateral root length, aerenchyma, cortical cell size and number, and nitrate uptake kinetics.\nThe maize root system is composed of an embryonic root system and nodal roots that emerge in successive whorls as the plant develops. Current phenotyping platforms often ignore the inner whorls and instead focus on the most visible outer whorls after excavating a maize root crown from soil. This dissertation researches the RSA among whorls of the maize nodal root system and demonstrates how the variation with the root crown could have functional significance. Nodal root number was decomposed to more elemental phenes including the number of nodes and the occupancies of each node. Simulations demonstrated that root systems forming fewer nodal roots and with delayed emergence perform well in low nitrogen soils. Nitrate uptake kinetics (NUK) vary within the maize root system, and simulations showing a lack of interaction between NUK and RSA reflects a knowledge gap in the costs of NUK at the molecular level. Finally, maize RSA among hybrids from different era periods over the past 100 years suggests evolution towards more nitrogen efficient states.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10350], "author_name_tesi": "York, Larry M", "last_name_ssi": "York", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Larry", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian", "Jason Philip Kaye"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch, Dissertation Advisor", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Chair", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Member", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian, Committee Member", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["functional traits", "crop", "agriculture", "ecology", "phenotyping"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Exploring Service-Learning Outcomes and Experiences for Low-income, First-generation College Students: A Mixed Methods Approach", "id": "17684", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8360", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "According to a 2008 Pell Institute report, Moving Beyond Access: College Success For Low-Income, First-Generation Students, about 24% (4.5 million) of the undergraduate college population in America are low-income, first-generation (LIFG) students.  However, for many of these students their chances of persistence to degree are extremely low.  In fact, the persistence rate for LIFG students is a mere 11%\u2014startling when compared to the national average persistence rate of 55% (Engle & Tinto, 2008).  In efforts to increase the academic success and persistence rates of these students, several institutions have turned their attention to pedagogical strategies like service-learning.  \n\nA growing body of literature indicates that students who participate in courses that utilize a service-learning pedagogy have significant gains in cognitive and affective outcomes (Eyler & Giles, 1999; Campus Compact, 2010 & 2011; Vogelgeslang & Astin, 2000; Astin, Vogelgesang, Ikeda, & Yee, 2000).  This research has been invaluable to the exploration of how service-learning is related to learning and development; however, very little has focused on the outcomes and experiences for \u201chigh-risk\u201d students, such as low-income, first-generation.  Investigation of service-learning experiences for LIFG students is vital for increasing our understanding of this pedagogy\u2019s relationship to learning and developmental outcomes, especially as it pertains to overcoming environmental barriers that hinder academic success.\n\nThis study utilizes a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design to explore the outcomes and experiences related to service-learning participation for LIFG college students.  The first phase of the study explores a national, longitudinal dataset from the Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) of over 5,000 cases at 86 public and private universities.  Analysis is conducted to examine differentiating characteristics between LIFG students that participate in service-learning courses and LIFG students that do not participate in service-learning courses.  Exploratory factor analysis is conducted for the LIFG population to explore latent constructs.  Analysis is also conducted for the overall sample of college students for comparison purposes.  The service-learning outcomes and experiences of LIFG students are then explored in phase two with the collection of in-depth, face-to-face interviews of LIFG students that have participated in service-learning courses from three institutions.  This phase\u2019s interview protocol and multi-step coding procedure were informed by the findings of the quantitative phase.  \n\nQuantitative analysis indicates that very factors differentiate whether or not LIFG students will participate in service-learning courses.  Other findings indicated that participation in service-learning has a significant positive relationship with college GPA, even when controlling for pre-college academic preparation.  Interviews yielded three core themes that were related to LIFG students\u2019 participation in service-learning: faculty and staff interactions, targeted programs, and a predisposition to service. Five core themes and one tentative theme emerged from the interview data about the outcomes related to participants\u2019 service-learning experiences: Cognitive Diversity, Service as Reciprocal, Critical Consciousness, Encountering the \u201cSelf\u201d, Aiding in Biculturalism, Career Acculturation. \n\nThis study has resulted in findings from each phase that provide greater understanding to the experience of LIFG students who participate in service-learning.  Four primary conclusions result from the synthesis of the findings of both phases: (1) LIFG students participate in service-learning at equal rates to the overall student population; (2) LIFG students\u2019 participation in service-learning results from the combination of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and has little to do with pre-college characteristics; (3) service-learning participation has positive impacts on academic outcomes for LIFG student; and, (4) service-learning participation has positive impacts on affective outcomes LIFG student.  \n\nThese conclusions have implications most readily for institutional and classroom practice, but also for policy and research.  Finally, the findings of this study highlight continuing gaps in our knowledge on this topic, and subsequently include a discussion of future directions for inquiry.  Suggested areas of future research include extending the current research to a variety of institutional contexts; continued investigation of the unique learning and developmental needs of LIFG students and the ways in which curricular strategies may be employed to meet those needs; and, exploration into the impact of service-learning participation on persistence for students who transfer from community colleges to 4-year institutions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8274], "author_name_tesi": "York, Travis Tilmond", "last_name_ssi": "York", "middle_name_ssi": "Tilmond", "first_name_ssi": "Travis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson", "Dr Kimberly Griffin", "Kai Arthur Schafft", "Nancy A Tuana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Kimberly Griffin, Committee Member", "Kai Arthur Schafft, Committee Member", "Nancy A Tuana, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Service-Learning", "Higher Education", "Student Outcomes", "Low-Income", "First-Generation", "Mixed Methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Explicit Instruction in Letter-sound Correspondences with Children with Complex Communication Needs in Pairs with Peers", "id": "13676amg294", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13676", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigated the effects of explicit instruction on the acquisition of letter-sound correspondences for children with complex communication needs (CCN) in small groups with peers with intellectual or developmental disabilities.

Of the six initial participants (three children with CCN and intellectual developmental disabilities and three peers who were children with intellectual developmental disabilities), four made progress in learning of letter-sound correspondences.

However, as the intervention was provided in pairs, the number of trials provided to each participant was divided between participants.

Because only thiolate ligated heme enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (P450), chloroperoxidase (CPO), and aromatic peroxygenase (APO) are capable of difficult hydrocarbon oxidations, we believe that Nature has specifically chosen the thiolate ligand in order to facilitate H-atom abstraction.  Current evidence suggests that the strong donating nature of the thiolate elevates the pKa of the compound II (ferryl) species, and could be the reason for the increased driving force.  Conversely, it is proposed that a lower ferryl pKa in histidine and tyrosine ligated heme enzymes significantly decreases the reactivity, thus preventing C-H bond activation.  In an effort to provide concrete evidence for the magnitude of the proposed driving force, we set out to quantitate the thermodynamic \u201cpKa\u201d parameter in histidine, thiolate, and tyrosine ligated heme systems.\nWhile it is has been shown that the thiolate ligated P450-II and CPO-II intermediates are basic in nature, there is much controversy over the protonation status of histidine ligated ferryls.  X-ray crystallographic studies favor long Fe-O bond lengths (~1.85 \u00c5), indicating protonated (FeIV-OH) moieties, while EXAFS report much shorter distances (~1.65 \u00c5), classifying them as authentic FeIV=O intermediates.  If histidine ligated ferryls are basic, then theory suggests that they could be able to activate C-H bonds, yet no experimental evidence supports this claim.  In order to investigate this controversy, we explored the protonation status of the histidine ligated myoglobin compound II (Mb-II) intermediate over a wide pH range (9.5\u21923.9).  Using a battery of spectroscopic techniques (M\u00f6ssbauer, Resonance Raman, and EXAFS) our results definitively show that Mb-II is an authentic FeIV oxo with a pKa \u2264 2.65.  We can infer from this study that all histidine ligated ferryls are FeIV oxos (at physiological pH), and that previous crystallographic reports for protonated ferryls in these systems are a direct result of radiation damage.\nAlthough we could only establish an upper limit for the pKa in histidine ligated proteins, we were able to directly measure the compound II pKa in both thiolate (CYP158A2 with pKa ~ 12) and tyrosine (Helicobacter pylori catalase with pKa ~ 13) ligated systems.  These values represent the first ever reported pKas for any FeIV-OH species.  Relative to histidine ligated enzymes, the elevated pKa in thiolate and tyrosine ligated ferryls could account for an additional ~ 13 kcals of driving force in a given hydrocarbon oxidation.  Unexpectedly, tyrosine ligated hemes have higher ferryl pKas than their thiolate ligated counterparts, suggesting that CPO, APO, and P450 may not be the only heme proteins capable of C-H bond activation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7904], "author_name_tesi": "Yosca, Timothy Howard", "last_name_ssi": "Yosca", "middle_name_ssi": "Howard", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Squire J Booker", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Thomas Green, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cytochrome p450", "compound II", "ferryl pKa"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Synthesis and Colloidal Properties of Anisotropic Hydrothermal Barium Titanate", "id": "6831", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6204", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Nanoparticles of high dielectric constant materials, especially BaTiO3, are required to achieve decreased layer thickness in multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs).  Tabular metal nanoparticles can produce thin metal layers with low surface roughness via electrophoretic deposition (EPD).  To achieve similar results with dielectric layers requires the synthesis and dispersion of tabular BaTiO3 nanoparticles.  The goal of this study was to investigate the deposition of thin BaTiO3 layers using a colloidal process.  The synthesis, interfacial chemistry and colloidal properties of hydrothermal BaTiO3, a model particle system, was investigated.  After characterization of the material system particulates were deposited to form thin layers using EPD.\n     In the current study, the synthesis of BaTiO3 has been investigated using a hydrothermal route.  TEM and AFM analyses show that the synthesized particles are single crystal with a majority of the particle having a <111> zone axis and {111} large face.  The particles have a median thickness of 5.8 &#61617; 3.1 nm and face diameter of 27.1 &#61617; 12.3 nm.  Particle growth was likely controlled by the formation of {111} twins and the synthesis pH which stabilizes the {111} face during growth.  With limited growth in the <111> direction, the particles developed a plate-like morphology.  Physical property characterization shows the powder was suitable for further processing with high purity, low hydrothermal defect concentration, and controlled stoichiometry.  TEM observations of thermally treated powders indicate that the particles begin to loose the plate-like morphology by 900 \u00b0C.\n     The aqueous surface chemistry of BaTiO3 is complex and difficult to model using current models due to the pH dependent dissolution/readsorption of Ba2+ at the surface.  In addition the precipitation of BaCO3 at high pH influences the surface chemistry.  In the current study a model was developed to account for the effect of dissolved Ba2+ as a function of pH.  Three distinct regions in the surface chemistry are observed as a function of pH.  At low pH, the dissolution of Ba2+ results in a TiO2 surface which can be described using the MUSIC model.  As pH increases the affect of dissolved Ba2+ becomes more prominent.  The adsorption of Ba2+ onto the TiO2 is observed and can be modeled using a modified Stern isotherm.  In basic environments (>pH 9.5) the precipitation of BaCO3 on the surface of the BaTiO3 particles requires the use of a Nernst-Gouy-Stern charging model to described the surface.\n     The aqueous passivation, dispersion, and doping of nanoscale BaTiO3 powders was investigated.  Passivation BaTiO3 was achieved through the addition of oxalic acid.  The oxalic acid selectively adsorbs onto the particle surface and forms a chemically stable 2-3 nm layer of barium oxalate.  The negative surface charge of the oxalate effectively passivated the BaTiO3 providing a surface suitable for the use of a cationic dispersant, polyethylenimine (PEI).  Rheological properties indicate the presence of an oxalate-PEI interaction which can be detrimental to dispersion.  With a better understanding of the aqueous surface chemistry of BaTiO3 the surface chemistry was manipulated to control the adsorption of aqueous soluble complexes of Co, Nb, and Bi, three common dopants in the processing of BaTiO3.  Surface charge, TEM, and EDS analysis showed that while in suspension the dopants selectively absorbed onto the particle surface forming an engineered coating.\n     The electrophoretic deposition of two different BaTiO3 nanoparticle suspensions was investigated.  The effect of solution chemistry on dispersion, deposition kinetics, and film microstructure is addressed.  The conditions necessary for optimum dispersion results in low deposition rates and poor film adhesion.  High dispersant concentration leads to electrochemical inhibition at the electrode and reduced field drop in the bulk of solution.  Low effective fields in the bulk of the suspension results in low electrophoretic velocities and reduced deposition kinetics.  Strong repulsive interactions between the particles and electrode lead to poor adhesion for the particles that do deposit.  The addition of an indifferent electrolyte reduces the repulsion and improves adhesion.  However, the indifferent electrolyte reduces the zeta potential of the particles in suspension, leading to aggregation prior to deposition.  Deposited films comprised of aggregates exhibit inhomogeneous microstructures.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6195], "author_name_tesi": "Yosenick, Timothy James", "last_name_ssi": "Yosenick", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair", "Clive A Randall", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Thomas R Shrout", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Hansell Adair, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Chair", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Thomas R Shrout, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Barium Titanate", "hydrothermal synthesis", "surface chemistry", "colloidal properties"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Machine Learning Methods in Portfolio Replication", "id": "16372", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8290", "abstract_tesi": "In this article, we address the problem of portfolio replication raised by researchers in finance.

The combustor is discretized into a number of cells along the axial direction, such that the axial mean flow properties can be assumed to be uniform within each cell.  Assuming that the source terms are mainly functions of the axial axis, the wave motions in the transverse plane can be approximated as the classical wave motions, which are called the normal modes.  Therefore, the oscillations can be expressed as a synthesis of the normal modes in the transverse plane with axial- and time-varying amplitudes.  Afterward, spatial averaging in the transverse plane is implemented to solve for the acoustic field from the derived wave equation.\nThe effects of the various source terms associated with the uniform mean flow, unsteady heat release, acoustic damping device, and cooling air on the wave-equation solution are formulated or modeled.  The oscillatory flow fields such as velocity and entropy fluctuations are solved from the linearized momentum equation or the equation of state.  These properties are matched at the interface of each pair of adjacent cells by applying the conservation laws.  The procedure will eventually yield a system equation, from which the eigen-frequencies and stability characteristics of the whole combustor can be determined while the combustor geometry and mean flow properties are given.  \nThe analysis is implemented to solve the acoustic fields in a step duct, a converging duct, a horn, and a straight duct with temperature gradient.  Results show good agreement with finite element software and analytical solutions, in terms of the frequencies and mode shapes.\nAfter model validation, a parametric study is conducted to investigate the effects of mean flow, temperature, cross-sectional area, and unsteady heat release on acoustic characteristics.  The wave motions including the first longitudinal, the first tangential, and the first radial modes of a model gas turbine combustor are also calculated.  Cases corresponding to both stable and unstable flames are considered.  The results match closely with the available experimental data and numerical solutions.  The combustion response of the flame to the acoustic field is examined.  The amplitude and phase angle of the response function of the unstable flame satisfy Rayleigh\u00a1\u00afs criterion, which explains the occurrence of instability.\nIt is demonstrated that the approximate solutions of a generalized wave equation, which characterize oscillation flow motions in the combustion chamber, can be obtained by discretization and spatial averaging techniques. The developed analysis is able to accurately predict the frequencies, damping coefficients, and mode shapes of the unsteady motions, which are the key elements of gas turbine combustion instability. The approaches are concise and efficient enough to be used at the design stage.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1662], "author_name_tesi": "You, Danning ", "last_name_ssi": "You", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Danning", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vigor Yang", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Timothy John Eden", "Laura Pauley", "Robert John Santoro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vigor Yang, Committee Chair", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "Timothy John Eden, Committee Member", "Laura Pauley, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["combustion instability", "pressure wave", "gas turbine", "acoustics", "liner", "stability"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Unit Commitment Problems: A Comparison of Algorithms and Heuristics", "id": "27420", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11956", "abstract_tesi": "Unit commitment problems have been an area of research interest for many decades.

The study has taken two broad and interrelated research questions as its starting points: \u201cHow are political, economic, and social forms of power associated with the production, distribution, and consumption of political entertainment?\u201d and \u201cHow has the production and dissemination of such programs changed over the past half-century and in what specific contexts?\u201d This approach has allowed particular attention to the role of political institutions in regulating media industries; the origin of Korean political entertainment and its distinctive features; the factors and conditions influencing the transformation in formats and genres of political entertainment; and the effects of technological shifts on political entertainment. \nTo answer these questions, this study began by examining the politics of Mandam, as its origin of a hybrid form of political information and entertainment during the period of the 1930s. \nIn particular, I argue that the initial rise of political entertainment in the early stages of modern Korea was led by the business sectors for commercial purposes, i.e., Mandam was situated at the nexus of the record industry, the theater business, the newspaper business, and the radio broadcasting industry. Though Mandam played a crucial role in the shaping of political opinion by conveying political information in a satirical way, it lost cultural influence with technological breakthroughs such as developments in radio broadcasting and the introduction of television. Accordingly, political entertainment did not flourish due to stringent political censorship until 1987, and the breakdown in the business relationships between newspaper companies and radio stations, which I called the dark period of political entertainment in Korea. During the period of military regimes which implemented a dual media policy epitomized as regulation and promotion directly influenced a transformation in the formats and genres of comedy on television. During the period, a handful of allegorical comedies as well as satiric call-in-shows continued to broadcast, stand-up comedy programs could not  be dominate the airwaves.\nPolitical entertainment faced another dramatic change concurrent with changing political circumstances in 1987. The \u201987 democratization movement proved a turning point for the boost in producing allegorical political satiric comedies and mock news shows. However, the IMF crisis and the rise of hallyu phenomenon contributed to the commercialization and globalization of Korean media industry, which resulted in a decrease of production and distribution of political entertainment program. Along with the rapid commercialization and globalization of Korean media industry after the IMF crisis, political entertainment programs were integrated into a unique form of Korean infotainment called the real variety show. Though the real variety show drew some attention, it focused more on civic education than political criticism, thereby causing the level of satiric criticism in infotainment to significantly decrease.\nRecently, politics-oriented blended programs reappear along with the introduction of a comprehensive programming system on cable networks (CP-CATV) cross-owned by major newspaper companies. These cable networks actively produced programs that blended news and entertainment for commercial purposes such as live news shows with political pundits and celebrities, mock news shows, and televisual satires. Though such hybrid programs contributed to the commercial success of CP-CATVs by reducing production costs, These programs provide on cable TV raised serious concerns about journalistic principles such as objectivity and impartiality in reporting, although these programs provides helped increase interest in political affairs. In the meantime, political entertainment within new media has shed light on the possibility of producing a counter-political discourse that would provide an alternative to the conservative bent mainstream news media, as exemplified by NaNeunGgomSuda (NGS). \nOver the past decade, political entertainment has faced dramatic change concurrent with technological breakthroughs and with dramatic changing political-economic circumstances such as a dual media policy epitomized as regulation and promotion led by two military regimes, the \u201987 democratization movement, the IMF economic crisis in 1997 and the rise of the hallyu phenomenon, which have directly influenced a transformation in the formats and genres of political entertainment programming. Political entertainment has undergone various transformations in response to a variety of external and internal challenges it has faced. Recently, a number of new hybrid formats that more strikingly problematize traditional distinctions between news and entertainment, and even fact and fiction, have developed. Political entertainment can be characterized as border genres that populate the space between the still-potent public perceptions of news/entertainment and fact/fiction. The results of the historical analysis of the transformation of political entertainment within Korean context can provide insight into how political entertainment has been generated and its history and functioning in specific contexts, given the current rise in the number of political entertainment programs.

The data for this study comes from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten cohort (ECLS-K) released by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).\n\nMuch of the related literature on school readiness has highlighted the lasting impact of early school readiness on later achievement and what factors constitute the definition of school readiness. Interestingly, many policy attempts at helping students with low school readiness have focused on interventions before school, such as building pre-literacy skills, whereas a lack of attention has been devoted to how the school itself may benefit those students who enter school at a disadvantage. Thus, this study aims to merge two important but seldom integrated inquiries: the impact of school readiness on children\u2019s learning growth trajectory and the role of teachers\u2019 academic support and responsibility in students\u2019 learning progress. \n\nFindings from this study suggest that children who enter school with low readiness (measured through math, reading, and approaches to learning scores) demonstrate consistently lower learning gains throughout their elementary school years. In addition, although teachers\u2019 academic intensity and sense of responsibility for learning increased the overall learning gain, only the responsibility of teachers appeared to moderate the math learning growth trajectory given different levels of school readiness at school entry. In addition, the benefit of school readiness for children with low readiness was cumulative across the elementary school years. Another noteworthy finding from this study is that while teachers appeared to have a lower sense of academic responsibility toward students with low readiness, these students did not in fact experience less academic intensity with their teachers. Based on these results the present study suggests a need for continuous support during the schooling years, as well as before the start of school, to compensate for a lower skill level at school entry.\n\nRevealing the impact of teachers\u2019 academic intensity and responsibility for learning on those children with low school readiness could help to identify practices and attitudes that will benefit students who are behind at the entry of school. These findings will aid in developing policies and interventions targeted at improving learning in the early school years and thus enhance educational opportunities for socially and economically disadvantaged students. Indeed, this study emphasizes the importance of teachers\u2019 academic intensity and sense of responsibility for learning to enhance learning gains during the elementary school years for disadvantaged children and suggests that the school reform effort should be devoted to changing the school as a community.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7726], "author_name_tesi": "Youn, Min-jong ", "last_name_ssi": "Youn", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min-jong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mindy L Kornhaber", "Suet Ling Pong", "Katerina Bodovski", "John Philip Christman", "Liang Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mindy L Kornhaber, Dissertation Advisor", "Suet Ling Pong, Committee Member", "Katerina Bodovski, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Liang Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["school readiness", "academic intensity", "sense of responsibility", "learning growth gap"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Sensitivity to Change of the Counseling Center Assessment of Psychological Symptoms-34 (CCAPS-34) \n", "id": "18392", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8839", "abstract_tesi": "Sensitivity to change of an outcome measure has been defined as its degree to which it is able to accurately detect client change that occurs after an individual has received treatment.

Seismic data recorded by eight stations deployed from February 2010 through July 2011 provide the primary dataset. Receiver functions have been computed using ~100 teleseismic events with epicentral distances of 30\u00b0-90\u00b0. The resulting waveforms, consisting of several Ps arrivals in the first 5s, indicate complicated basin structure. To estimate crustal thickness, an application of the H-\u03ba stacking method was attempted for each station. Well-resolved results from one station located on basement rock yield crustal thickness of approximately 38km, with an average Vp/Vs of 1.67. Sediment-filled basins below the other stations produce a seismogram ringing effect that masks the Moho Ps arrival and have been interpreted using other methods, including a joint inversion of the receiver functions, phase, and group velocities and forward modeling of the receiver function waveforms. Phase and group velocities were taken from other studies and were incorporated only in the joint inversion method. Results, where well determined, indicate basin thicknesses of 3km to 5.5km and Moho depths of ~38km. Within the basins, the top ~2km are found to have high Poisson\u2019s ratio (~0.40) with average shear wave velocity of ~1.5km/s, which are characteristics consistent with the Jurassic and younger marls and clays that outcrop in the basins. The velocity models also indicate that the next 1-3km have an average shear wave velocity of ~2.5km/s, most likely representing Karoo units comprised of fluvial siltstones and sandstones. The average crustal thickness beneath the basins is consistent with crustal structure away from the basins, indicating little, if any, crustal thinning. Little crustal thinning is also supported by a beta factor (stretching factor) of 1.1, which was calculated for the crust beneath the basins.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7846], "author_name_tesi": "Young, Alysa Joann", "last_name_ssi": "Young", "middle_name_ssi": "Joann", "first_name_ssi": "Alysa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Southeastern Tanzania", "Karoo", "Ruvu Basin", "Mandawa Basin", "Ruvuma Basin", "P-wave receiver functions", "Joint Inversion"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "HIGH ELEVATION DECIDUOUS FOREST STRUCTURE: A TEST OF WILLIAM BOND'S \"SLOW SEEDLING HYPOTHESIS\"", "id": "13360aby113", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13360", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I examine Bond\u2019s \u201cslow seedling\u201d hypothesis in an alpine forest system in central Japan. Bond (1989) developed this idea to explain the spatial partitioning of angiosperms and gymnosperms, in which gymnosperms are less responsive to resources like light and soil nutrients. Angiosperms prefer nutrient rich, dry soils in areas with relatively warm climates, relegating gymnosperms to the cool nutrient poor environments. Thus, gymnosperms typically dominate at high elevations and latitudes in environments such as treeline, with low temperatures and poorly developed soils. \nThe alpine treeline of central Japan is not composed of gymnosperms but an angiosperm, Betula ermanii Cham., and is bounded by a subalpine forest dominated by Abies mariesii Mast. below and a mat of scrub pine Pinus pumila (Pall.) Regel above. The B. ermanii treeline is abrupt and has had no apparent upward movement over the past 50 years despite significant warming (3\u00baC), indicating the ecosystem has long-term stability where gymnosperms and angiosperms coexist, though the dominance of each species is segregated by elevation. In this dissertation, I examine three drivers of the delineation of treelines - soil nutrients, the regeneration niche, and climate - from the subalpine forest through the B. ermanii treeline and into the P. pumila mat. \nIn Chapter 2, I assessed Bond\u2019s \u201cslow seedling\u201d hypothesis by examining relationships between soil nutrients and tree importance values across the three forest bands using linear mixed-effect models. I found that the predictions from Bond\u2019s hypothesis were inconsistently correct. For example, soil nitrogen was highest in the B. ermanii treeline on volcanic mountains, as I expected, but was similar across forest belts on non-volcanic mountains. This mixed evidence suggests lithology plays a role in driving local composition.\n\tIn Chapter 3, I explored differences in the regeneration niche across ontogeny (seedlings and trees) for B. ermanii and A. mariesii in the subalpine forest and treeline using a multivariate niche overlap approach. Evidence that B. ermanii, with its broad habitat niche but narrow regeneration niche, contrasted with A. mariesii, which has a broad regeneration niche but a narrow habitat niche, largely supports Bond\u2019s hypothesis. The broad regeneration niche of A. mariesii likely stems from the large investment in seedlings through advanced regeneration; however, many of these individuals do not successfully reach maturity. B. ermanii has a narrow regeneration niche limited by suitable conditions in high light on raised surfaces with low litter, though over ontogeny the habitat niche broadens.\nIn Chapter 4, I examined the influence of temperature, precipitation, PDSI on tree growth of B. ermanii and A. mariesii using a dendrochronological approach. B. ermanii responded positively to summer temperatures and negatively to summer precipitation, while A. mariesii had positive growth in the first year after warm and wet winters. 1.1% of the tree rings in B. ermanii were missing rings, possibly due to angiosperms\u2019 responsiveness to changes in their environment. Missing rings may result from disturbance events. Though no known insect outbreaks or fires occurred in the Japanese Alps, missing rings may have been caused by volcanic activity. \nUnderstanding how and why the B. ermanii treeline exists is important for assessing responses to climate change as well as the cultural ecosystem services provided by alpine biodiversity. The climate-growth responses of B. ermanii and A. mariesii indicated that future warming, especially in winter, may reduce B. ermanii\u2019s dominance at treeline. Warmer winter temperatures will likely increase A. mariesii\u2019s growth and possibly reduce mechanical damage. Though some A. mariesii trees occur in the B. ermanii treeline and P. pumila mat, they frequently have mechanical damage (tops are sheared off at snow height, needles show browning and mortality). If A. mariesii establishes at treeline and above, then the B. ermanii treeline may be at risk of being replaced. The competition with P. pumila, mechanical damage of the A. mariesii, longevity of B. ermanii, and elevated nitrogen in the B. ermanii treeline are all factors that allow B. ermanii to persist in an environment where it is theoretically unexpected. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13680], "author_name_tesi": "Young, Amanda Beatrice", "last_name_ssi": "Young", "middle_name_ssi": "Beatrice", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan H Taylor", "Alan H Taylor", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Andrew Mark Carleton", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan H Taylor, Dissertation Advisor", "Alan H Taylor, Committee Chair", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Member", "Andrew Mark Carleton, Committee Member", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["treeline", "Japanese Alps", "Angiosperm", "Gymnosperm", "Betula", "Abies", "Pinus"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "A Study of Mixtures of Regressions\n", "id": "7719", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1579", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mixtures of regressions are a set of mixture models that include\ncovariates in the mixture formulation.

While most genes are silenced some genes, such as Kdm5c, escape inactivation. At least four escapees in mouse are flanked by long, non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that also escape X inactivation, raising the possibility that lncRNAs may be involved in regulating escape domains on the inactive X. X-linked bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene approaches have shown that Kdm5c ectopically escapes inactivation, suggesting that sequences contained within the BAC contribute to Kdm5c escape. Truncated transgenes lacking sequences distal of Kdm5c, including the lncRNA escapee AK148627 adjacent to Kdm5c, leads to an escape domain expansion that extends into normally inactivated loci.  These results indicate that sequences distal to Kdm5c are necessary for X inactivation boundary regulation. Since lncRNAs can be cis-acting regulators within the genome, our goal is to determine whether the lncRNA juxtaposed to Kdm5c has a functional role in regulating escape, specifically in silencing adjacent genes. \n\n     AK148627 maps 2.6 kb downstream from Kdm5c and is transcribed in the same orientation. The close juxtaposition prompted us to test whether they are two distinct transcripts. While robust AK148627 transcription can be detected from both undifferentiated (prior to X-chromosome inactivation (pre-XCI)) and somatic (post-XCI) cells, transcription is not apparent immediately upstream of the annotated transcription start. Transcription extending from annotated Kdm5c exons to AK148627 is not detectable. Sequences upstream of the annotated lncRNA transcription start site show weak promoter activity by luciferase evaluation. Altogether, these data argue that AK148627 is indeed a separate transcript from Kdm5c. \n\n     To evaluate a possible cis-regulatory function for AK148627, a luciferase reporter vector containing AK148627 and its regulatory sequences was used.  Inclusion of AK148627 sequences decreased luciferase reporter activity suggesting that expression of the lncRNA from these sequences represses adjacent gene expression. Additionally, vectors containing a 5\u2019 truncated lncRNA lacking the transcription start site did not reduce luciferase levels, nor could AK148627 transcripts be detected. Interestingly, AK148627 is expressed from the luciferase vector in HEK293 cells in which AK148627 is not conserved in the human genome.  This suggests that the RNA transcript itself is important for the suppression seen. Importantly, AK148627 is expressed pre-XCI at levels that are roughly three times higher than post-XCI levels in mouse ES cells supporting a regulatory role at critical time points during inactivation. These results suggest that the RNA transcript is expressed at a biologically relevant time point in pre-XCI cells and are consistent with an X-chromosome inactivation regulatory role as predicted by previous transgene studies that require the lncRNA to silence adjacent genes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10604], "author_name_tesi": "Young, Heather Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Young", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Laura Carrel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Laura Carrel, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["X inactivation", "X chromosome", "lncRNA", "AK148627", "Kdm5c", "boundary regulation", "escape domain"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Star Formation Across Galactic Environments", "id": "16063", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8126", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I present here parallel investigations of star formation in typical and extreme galaxies.  The typical galaxies are selected to be free of active galactic nuclei (AGN), while the extreme galaxies host quasars (the most luminous class of AGN).  These two environments are each insightful in their own way; quasars are among the most violent objects in the universe, literally reshaping their host galaxies, while my sample of AGN-free star-forming galaxies ranges from systems larger than the Milky Way to small galaxies which are forming stars at unsustainably high rates. The current paradigm of galaxy formation and evolution suggests that extreme circumstances are key stepping stones in the assembly of galaxies like our Milky Way. To test this paradigm and fully explore its ramifications, this dual approach is needed.\n\n\nMy sample of AGN-free galaxies is drawn from the KPNO International Spectroscopic Survey.  This H-alpha-selected, volume-limited survey was designed to detect star-forming galaxies without a bias toward continuum luminosity.  This type of selection ensures that this sample is not biased toward galaxies that are large or nearby. My work studies the KISS galaxies in the mid- and far-infrared using photometry from the IRAC and MIPS instruments aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope.  These infrared bands are particularly interesting for star formation studies because the ultraviolet light from young stars is reprocessed into thermal emission in the far-infrared (24micron MIPS) by dust and into vibrational transitions features in the mid-infrared (8.0micron IRAC) by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  The work I present here examines the efficiencies of PAH and thermal dust emission as tracers of star-formation rates over a wide range of galactic stellar masses.  I find that the efficiency of PAH as a star-formation tracer varies with galactic stellar mass, while thermal dust has a highly variable efficiency that does not systematically depend on galactic stellar mass.\n\nComplementing this study of normal star-forming galaxies, my study of quasar host galaxies utilizes narrow- and medium-band images of eight Palomar-Green (PG) quasars from the WFPC2 and NICMOS instruments aboard the Hubble Space Telescope.  Using images of a point-spread function (PSF) star in the same filters, I subtract the PSF of the quasar from each of the target images.  The residual light images clearly show the host galaxies of the respective quasars.  The narrow-band images were chosen to be centered on the H-beta, OII, OIII, and Pa-alpha emission lines, allowing the use of line ratios and luminosities to create extinction and star formation maps.  Additionally, I utilize the line-ratio maps to distinguish AGN-powered line emission from star formation powered line emission with line-diagnostic diagrams.  I find star formation in each of the eight quasar host galaxies in my study.  The bulk star-formation rates are lower than expected, suggesting that quasar host galaxies may be dynamically more advanced than previously believed.  Seven of the eight quasar host galaxies in this study have higher-than-typical mass-specific star-formation rates.  Additionally, I see evidence of shocked gas, supporting the hypotheses presented in earlier works that suggest that AGN activity quenches star formation in its host galaxy by disrupting its gas reservoir.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8068], "author_name_tesi": "Young, Jason Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Young", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Caryl Ann Gronwall", "Michael Eracleous", "Robin Bruce Ciardullo", "Leisa K Townsley", "Christopher Howard House"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Caryl Ann Gronwall, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Eracleous, Committee Chair", "Robin Bruce Ciardullo, Committee Member", "Leisa K Townsley, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["star formation galaxies active galactic nuclei"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Modified Transmitted Reference Technique for Wireless Beaconing", "id": "14619jry136", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14619", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Transmitted reference defines a signal processing technique that has interested researchers and found applicability in a number of engineering areas. In this approach, the information required to decipher the received signal is transmitted in addition to the message signal. With its unique signaling scheme, transmitted reference allows communications systems to employ simple receiver architectures and utilize arbitrary waveforms to convey information. Thus, transmitted reference enables communications while maintaining low transmit power and operating in challenging environments. Despite its fundamental advantages, transmitted reference may suffer prohibitive performance degradation in communications channels that support considerable multipath propagation. Transmitted reference communications systems may face difficulty in distinguishing between the characteristic transmitted reference signals and multipath energy occurring naturally in the ambient environment.\n\tOne application in which transmitted reference processing may add value is wireless beaconing, which has evolved from its discovery in the 1880s into a suite of technologies that define commercial and military systems employed for a plethora of purposes. Wireless beaconing provides positioning information in scenarios as varied as search and rescue, identification and mitigation of radio frequency emitters, radar, sonar, and air traffic control. Additionally, wireless beaconing has been proposed for fifth-generation (5G) cellular base station discovery and ad-hoc networking.\n\tThis thesis documents research into a novel signal processing technique that, when integrated into a wireless beaconing system, enables robust performance in adverse communications channels and simultaneously affords low transmit power signal characteristics. Extending the state of the art in transmitted reference radar, this thesis develops a theoretical framework for a modified transmitted reference signaling scheme that facilitates node detection and beaconing via innovative signal processing. This thesis also implements MATLAB\u00ae software simulations and hardware experiments that confirm the utility of the technique when integrated into a functional beaconing system.\n\tThe modified transmitted reference signal processing technique enables the same features as conventional transmitted reference signaling, and uses time scale supplements to enhance performance relative to traditional transmitted reference. The modified transmitted reference algorithm creates two copies of the same signal, the reference signal and the modulated offset copy. Like standard transmitted reference, the modified technique encodes information by time delaying the offset copy relative to the reference signal. The modified transmitted reference technique supplements the encoding process by applying a time scale \u2013 dilation or compression \u2013 to the offset copy. The modified transmitted reference signaling scheme benefits from time scale, as it differentiates the transmitter-encoded offset copy from naturally-occurring multipath energy that arises in a practical signaling environment. The modified transmitted reference technique utilizes time scale to achieve reliable transfer of information in communications channels that present significant challenges for traditional transmitted reference.\n\tModified transmitted reference wireless beaconing employs spatially distributed, coordinated signal transceivers that broadcast and collect wide-bandwidth data. Each transceiver coordinates with all other nodes to broadcast a cooperative waveform that defines a modified transmitted reference beaconing transmission.

Comprehensive databases of various geophysical parameters were concurrently studied and analyzed to 2000, and similar data were subsequently considered during periods of eruption crisis in 2001 and 2006.  Of particular emphasis was the study of lava eruption rates based on dome volume estimates and seismic proxies for dome collapse volumes.  The detailed study period of deformation includes a major resumption in lava effusion in January 1992 and major dome collapses in November 1994, January 1997, and July 1998.  Monitoring techniques employed in the field are of two types.  Translational movements were recorded via electronic distance measurements (EDM) on a summit trilateration network, slope distance changes measured to the upper flanks, and other data collected from 1988 to 1995.  Tilt changes were detected by a summit and flank network of tilt stations that operated at various times from 1993 to 1998.  A major consequence of the deformation results is the documentation of a significant 4-year period of deformation precursory to the 1992 eruption.  Cross-crater strain rates accelerated from less than 3 x 10-6 /day between 1988 and 1990 to more than 11 x 10-6 /day just prior to the January 1992 activity, representing a general, asymmetric extension of the summit during high-level conduit pressurization.  After the vent opened and effusion of lava resumed, strain occurred at a much reduced rate of less than 2 x 10-6 /day.  The Gendol breach, a pronounced depression formed by the juxtaposition of old lava coul\u00e9es on the southeast flank, functioned as a major displacement discontinuity.\n  An elevated phase of magma production with respect to the long-term rate for the 20th Century characterized the activity at Merapi volcano, Central Java/Yogyakarta, Indonesia, for the period 1992-2006.  Most large (0.2 - 3.4 x 106 m3) dome collapses or dome collapse episodes in the 1990s were initiated during elevated short-term extrusion rates, at Merapi typically 0.2 m3 s-1 or greater.  Large collapses were often preceded by variable inflationary tilt of the crater rim, by increasing numbers of rockfalls and their associated seismicity, and by intensifying multiphase earthquake activity.  Multiphase earthquakes, rockfall counts, and amplitude-duration data established from seismic records show varying positive correlations with extrusion rate. Pyroclastic flow and rockfall seismic amplitude-duration data were calibrated as proxies to enable estimates of collapsed lava volume.  For the 20th Century as a whole, observed magma production rates suggest long-term cycles of ca. 30 years spacing that begin with heightened magma flux over 2 to 15 years with greater potential for explosive eruptive activity, followed by much-diminished mean magma flux in the concluding ~15-25 years of the cycle.  The data examined through 2006 suggest that if similar cycles are to continue well into the 21st Century, activity at Merapi will now experience relatively lower magma production for the next ~15 years, compared to the most recent eruptive phase during 1992-2006. \n \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3370], "author_name_tesi": "Young, Kirby David", "last_name_ssi": "Young", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Kirby", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Donald Myron Fisher", "Barry Voight", "Terry Engelder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Donald Myron Fisher, Committee Member", "Barry Voight, Committee Chair", "Terry Engelder, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["volcano deformation monitoring", "Volcanology", "lava domes", "extrusion rates", "EDM", "tiltmeters", "volcano seismicity"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS OF\nSTATE LOBBY DISCLOSURE LAWS\n", "id": "6264", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4296", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-03-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "State government and state legislatures are critical entities in the complex environment of government and have an enormous impact on millions of people. State government and state legislatures are major areas in the field of public administration. Public administration focuses on the public interest and implements the requirements of law.  This research examines significant design characteristics of state lobbying disclosure laws, such as registration, reporting, and administration through a content analysis of these laws.  This analysis reviews various design characteristics of the laws in relationship to variables, such as legislative professionalism, interest group strength, political culture, region, size of state population, size of per capita income of states, and others.\nThe research provides comparative information on state lobby disclosure laws and specific information on the evaluation of design characteristics of these laws.  The research provides a statistical model for investigating state laws and may help to craft better state and federal regulatory/ethics laws by examining the strengths and weaknesses of current state lobby disclosure laws.\nThe findings of the research are mixed.  Several environmental characteristics such as population of the state and corruption do influence design characteristics but even here there are questions about the nature of relationship.  A state with strict procedural requirements is more likely to be in the eastern region with an individualistic culture. It is found that professional legislatures are ranked highest in terms of the procedural requirements of the law but non-professional or citizen legislatures are higher in relation to substantive requirements. This research only touches the surface of the examination of characteristics of the laws. These laws and other laws require more addition to the construction and analysis detail.  Adopting the language of policy design is important in creating clearer laws and better communication means better implementation. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4269], "author_name_tesi": "Young, Mary Myrtle", "last_name_ssi": "Young", "middle_name_ssi": "Myrtle", "first_name_ssi": "Mary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Beverly Ann Cigler", "Steven Ames Peterson", "Harold Bundick Shill Iii", "Michael King"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Beverly Ann Cigler, Committee Chair", "Steven Ames Peterson, Committee Member", "Harold Bundick Shill Iii, Committee Member", "Michael King, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["state legislatures.", "content analysis", "lobbying", "policy design", "lobbying disclosure laws"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Role Of Sphingosine Kinase In The Crosstalk Between Apoptosis, Autophagy And Endocytosis", "id": "27408", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12009", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Autophagy is a catabolic process in which cytoplasmic components are sequestered within double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for degradation and recycling. Autophagy functions to maintain homeostasis through the removal of cellular damage and generation of nutrients. Although autophagy and the cell death pathway of apoptosis utilize fundamentally distinct machinery to regulate cell fate, the two pathways are joined through an intricate network of molecular crosstalk. Sphingolipids represent a class of bioactive lipids that regulate various cellular processes, including apoptosis and autophagy, and thus may serve as novel regulators of the crosstalk between the two pathways. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of sphingolipid metabolism using the pan-sphingosine kinase 1/2 inhibitor, SKI-I, induces the assembly of an intracellular death-inducing signaling complex (iDISC) on autophagosomal membranes for the activation of caspase-8 and induction of apoptosis. Mechanistically, we show that the iDISC consists of two arms that recruit pro-caspase-8 to the autophagosomal membrane for oligomerization and self-activation: 1) Atg12-Atg5:FADD:caspase-8 and 2) LC3-II:p62:caspase-8. To further dissect the role of sphingosine kinase in iDISC-mediated cell death, we identified several sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1)-selective inhibitors to test in our system. Unexpectedly, we observed that the sphingosine-based inhibitor SK1i, but not the small molecule inhibitor PF-543, induces massive cellular vacuolization and enlargement of late endosomes and amphisomes. Notably, the loss of Sphk1 suppresses vacuolization by SK1i, and SK1i-induced endocytic vesicles fail to acquire late endosomal markers in Sphk1-deficient cells. As SK1i inhibits Sphk1 activity and the protein localizes to the enlarged vacuoles during treatment, we hypothesize that Sphk1 promotes membrane fusion independent of enzymatic activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LC3 conjugation machinery and lysosome biogenesis regulate the clearance of the enlarged late endosomes. Collectively, these studies suggest that inhibition of sphingosine kinase alters autophagosomal and endosomal membrane dynamics and intracellular trafficking to regulate cell fate. Future studies will aid in identifying specific sphingolipid metabolites and/or proteins required for iDISC-dependent cell death as well as mechanistic insight into Sphk1 function in endosome trafficking. We believe that this knowledge will be critical for the implementation of autophagy-dependent apoptosis as a novel approach to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11442], "author_name_tesi": "Young, Megan Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Young", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Gang Wang", "Hong Gang Wang", "Mark Kester", "Jin Ming Yang", "Lisa M Shantz", "Richard Robert Young"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Gang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Hong Gang Wang, Committee Chair", "Mark Kester, Committee Chair", "Jin Ming Yang, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "Richard Robert Young, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["autophagy", "apoptosis", "endocytosis", "iDISC", "sphingosine kinase", "sphingosine", "sphingolipid", "SK1i", "SKI-I", "late endosome"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "STUDY OF CYBER SECURITY PROFESSIONALS IN THE ACADEMIC DOMAIN", "id": "11212", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4257", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The world of academia is a place of freedom.

In order to understand and frame this inquiry, the research will attempt to answer the following two research questions:  \nR1:  What are the characteristics that define the working environment of a security professional in an academic domain?\nR2:  How do cyber security analysts in the academic domain assess and maintain cyber situational awareness?\nTo address these research questions, eleven interviews were performed with security professionals from five different universities.

In this paper I compare estimates based on the Census Bureau\u2019s hot deck imputation to estimates from a multiple imputation procedure using data on children\u2019s health insurance coverage from the 2007 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement. This comparative analysis addresses three questions. First, what are the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of HD and MI for this particular data? Second, does the choice of imputation procedure change the state-level estimates of the number of uninsured children and how might this difference impact social policy? Finally, what are the potential substantive consequences of different imputation strategies for social science researchers who use the ASEC\u2019s children\u2019s health insurance variables in multivariate analyses? I find that while HD and MI produce different point estimates of the number of uninsured children by state, the consequences of imputation strategy for researchers who rely on these data to answer substantive questions may be minimal.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5237], "author_name_tesi": "Young, Rebekah Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Young", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Rebekah", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Johnson", "David R Johnson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Johnson, Thesis Advisor", "David R Johnson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["multiple imputation", "missing data", "current population survey", "hot deck"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Don't Know Responses in Survey Research", "id": "13934", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7232", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Survey respondents are occasionally unable to generate the type of response researchers hope to record. Respondents may, instead, offer non-substantive answers such as saying they are unsure, cannot recall, or don\u2019t know (DK). The first article of this dissertation asked which respondents were most likely to offer DK replies and under what circumstances. DK responses were frequently recorded for sensitive questions, to questions that occurred in the middle of a survey, and to questions which asked about politics, government, finances, and economics. Although women offered DK responses more often than men did, men were more likely than women to say DK to questions asking about family, friends, health, and health care. The second article of this dissertation explored the meaning of DK responses by examining response patterns in longitudinal data. An important finding was that forty percent of respondents offered DK replies to the same questions asked nine to ten years apart. This is strong inferential evidence that while some DKs may result from survey satisficing or passively refusing to answer, a sizable proportion also indicate genuine lack of knowledge. If a DK reply is, indeed, the best answer to a question, it seems prudent and perhaps necessary to allow these responses in data collection. At the same time, DK responses can pose a serious challenge to data analysts, a problem addressed in the third article. Using a simulation study, I explored six common methods for analyzing DK responses when different meanings were assumed to underlie them. In general, if researchers are uninterested in analyzing DK responses as a categorically meaningful response, and instead prefer to treat DK responses as missing values, modern missing data methods treated these responses with minimal bias. The exception to this finding occurred when DK responses represented \u201cpassive refusals,\u201d where respondent\u2019s intentionally withheld true answers from the researcher. Under this circumstance, no method for analysis emerged without limitations. An important theme that emerged from each article is that DK responses are much more nuanced, meaningful, and context-based than perhaps we recognized in the past.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7219], "author_name_tesi": "Young, Rebekah Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Young", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Rebekah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David R Johnson", "David R Johnson", "Paul Amato", "Alan Booth", "Melissa Hardy", "Eric Plutzer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David R Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "David R Johnson, Committee Chair", "Paul Amato, Committee Member", "Alan Booth, Committee Member", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Member", "Eric Plutzer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["don't know responses", "missing data", "item nonresponse", "survey methods", "questionnaire design", "surveys"]}]
