The disease has received a lot of attention because of its global presence, various forms of contraction, and long-term fatal effects.\nTreating HIV infection has been an active research topic for the last two decades. Mathematical modeling is an invaluable tool in this quest to capture different aspects of disease progression, in an attempt to assist research efforts on the development of treatment policies that enhance the life expectancy and quality of lives of patients.\n\nThe objective of this research is studying HIV infection dynamics and developing mathematical models to investigate aspects of the diseases which have not been previously mathematically analyzed. The proposed models enhance the current understanding of the disease dynamics and are used to identify optimal treatment strategies. This research consists of four distinct projects which are ultimately connected to build a multiscale model of HIV infection.\n\nThe study is initiated by focusing on the the early stages of infection. At this stage of the disease, the viral load is low and random fluctuations have significant effects on the dynamics of the disease progression. Currently, post exposure prophylaxis treatment regimens are advised for patients where high dosages of drug are prescribed for four weeks. Commonly used deterministic models that describe the expected progress of the infection can not be employed to predict the probability of infection establishment or eradication at the early stage.\nConsequently, a stochastic model based on Gillespie's algorithm is derived to determine the probability of infection establishment. The effect of treatment latency and efficacy on infection establishment probability is also investigated.\n\nIn the next step, toxicity and side effects of HIV drugs are taken into account. In fact, severe side effects cause early termination of recommended post exposure treatment regimens among many patients. Hence, an optimization problem is formulated which employs the developed stochastic model in the first project. The objective is to minimize the infection establishment probability by utilizing minimum amount of drug. The proposed optimal strategies are compared with constant treatment strategies and are shown to be more beneficial in silico, i.e., they either decrease the infection establishment probability or the amount of the drugs.\n\nDrug efficacy is considered as manipulated variable in the developed model of the early stage. Efficacy is an increasing function of drug amount, but their exact relationship has not been determined. In order to more accurately predict the dynamics of infection, it is necessary to improve the estimation of treatment efficacy based on treatment dosage and prescription protocols. Consequently, the mechanisms by which NRTIs, the most common class of drugs used in the treatment of HIV-1, exert their antiviral effects are analyzed and a mechanistic model to estimate drug efficacy in terms of measurable physical values is developed. The model is employed to compute and compare the effectiveness of four different drugs and a sensitivity analysis on mutation and resistance is performed.\n\nFinally, a hybrid intracellular/extracellular model that describes the changes in virus and host populations at the animal level, while having the required accuracy at the intracellular level is derived. This goal is achieved by building an intracellular model which identify the fate of an infected cell based on success or failure of intracellular events. The effect of treatment is estimated via the constructed model of NRTIs. The findings of the intracellular model is subsequently linked to the revised extracellular model which is initially developed to study the early stage of infection. The revised model includes eight virus populations to account for resistant strains to multiple drugs and is capable of providing quantitative correlations between medication dosages under HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) and the effect on the viral load and resistant populations. The evolution of resistant virus populations under regularly prescribed HAART and hypothetical interrupted HAART is compared and the potential benefit in interrupted HAART is described.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5966], "author_name_tesi": "Khalili, Samira ", "last_name_ssi": "Khalili", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Samira", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Antonios Armaou", "Antonios Armaou", "Ali Borhan", "Themis Matsoukas", "Craig Eugene Cameron"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Antonios Armaou, Dissertation Advisor", "Antonios Armaou, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HIV infection", "Multiscale model", "Optimal treatment", "Mechanistic model", "Efficacy estimation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Examining the relationships between student achievement and teacher monitoring and evaluation in lower secondary and secondary schools: A multinational study", "id": "19770", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9319", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Teacher quality is a significant determinant of student achievement in schools. One way through which schools endeavor to improve the quality of their teachers, and hence student achievement, is by evaluating them, identifying their professional needs, and making them accountable for the quality of their practice. While there is a general agreement that teachers should be monitored and evaluated, there is variation in the approaches and purposes of the process across schools and educational contexts. This dissertation responds to the research question, \u201cHow do teacher monitoring and evaluation practices and purposes associate with student achievement in mathematics, science, and reading in lower secondary and secondary schools.\u201d The study employs Ordinary Least Squares as it analytical approach and uses data and information in 21 countries from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS).\nFindings show that the developmental approaches to teacher evaluation in the form of evaluative focus in principals\u2019 pedagogical role that include classroom observations, suggesting teachers for improvement, and informing teachers about possibilities for updating their knowledge and skills do not associate significantly with student achievement in all three subjects. Schools\u2019 use of student data for instructional improvement also does not associate significantly with student achievement in all three subjects. Monitoring of teachers using student achievement and principal and staff observations relate positively to student achievement in reading. The study finds mixed results for high-stakes approaches to teacher evaluation. Public accountability establishes a positive relationship with student achievement in all three subjects. However, the use of student assessments for teacher evaluation and judging teacher effectiveness do not relate significantly to student achievement in mathematics. In reading and science, such uses of student assessments associate negatively with student achievement. The tracking of student assessments by an administrative authority develops a negative but insignificant relationship with student achievement in mathematics and reading, and an insignificant positive relationship in science.\nThe evidence in this study only confirms the complexity of teacher monitoring and evaluation practices and purposes while exploring their potential in raising student achievement in schools. The study suggests that the use of student assessments as an evidence of teacher performance should be avoided especially in high-stakes approaches to teacher evaluation. The study further suggests that the right mix of developmental and high-stakes approaches and purposes to monitoring and evaluating teachers should be driven by evidence obtained through rigorous research in indigenous settings.

Results reveal that children\u2019s narrative production and comprehension are best predicted by the most complex EF tasks which recruit attentional flexibility, executive goal management, monitoring, coordination, and inhibitory control, along with simple EF tasks which require planning. Syntax production is best predicted by phonological working memory, as well as a set of simple EF skills including updating and monitoring, and inhibition, and complex EF skills including attentional flexibility, shifting, and coordination. Syntax comprehension, in contrast, is only supported by simple EF planning, updating and monitoring skills, and the complex EF skills underlying card sorting and switching performance. And finally, vocabulary comprehension and production is best predicted by a set of simple EF skills including goal-setting, inhibition, planning, and updating and monitoring. Overall, our results reveal the dynamic recruitment and coordination of more and more EF functions as the domains of language shift from vocabulary, to simple syntax, to complex syntax, to narrative.

The underlying concept is to use the electricity from a renewable source, such as wind or solar, to capture CO2 via a biological agent, such as a microbe, into liquid fuels that can be used for the transportation sector. In addition to being renewable, the higher rate of energy capture by photovoltaic cells than natural photosynthesis is expected to facilitate higher rate of liquid fuel production than traditional biofuel processes.   The envisioned platform is part of ARPA-E\u2019s (Advanced Research Projects Agency - Energy) Electrofuels initiative which aims at supplementing the country\u2019s petroleum based fuel production with renewable liquid fuels that can integrate easily with the existing refining and distribution infrastructure (http://arpa-e.energy.gov/ProgramsProjects/Electrofuels.aspx). The Electrofuels initiative aimed to develop liquid biofuels that avoid the issues encountered in the current generation of biofuels: (1) the reliance of biomass-derived technologies on the inefficient process of photosynthesis, (2) the relatively energy- and resource-intensive nature of agronomic processes, and (3) the occupation of large areas of arable land for feedstock production. The process proceeds by the capture of solar energy into electrical energy via photovoltaic cells, using the generated electricity to split water into molecular hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), and feeding these gases, along with carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from point sources such as a biomass or coal-fired power plant, to a microbial bioprocessing platform. The proposed microbial bioprocessing platform leverages a chemolithoautotrophic microorganism (Rhodobacter capsulatus or Ralstonia eutropha) naturally able to utilize these gases as growth substrates, and genetically modified to produce a triterpene hydrocarbon fuel molecule (C30+ botryococcenes) native to the alga Botryococcus braunii. In addition to the genetic modification and bioreactor performance studies of these organisms for the production of botryococcene or squalene, the research examined the potential economic feasibility of the proposed platform through the use of bioreactor, microbial energetic models and experimentally measured growth yield and maintenance coefficients. \nIn order to carry out an economic analysis, a process model was created in Aspen with the bioreactor at the center. This is presented in Chapter 2. The model looked at the effects of growth yield and maintenance coefficients of R. capsulatus and R. eutropha, reactor residence time, gas-liquid mass-transfer coefficients, gas composition and specific fuel productivity on the volumetric productivity and fuel yield on H2. It was found that the organism with the lowest maintenance coefficient performed better under very low growth rates evaluated in the model (based on residence time through the reactor) performed the best. The optimum parameter values were then used to determine the capital and operating costs for a 5000 bbl-fuel/day plant and the final fuel cost based on the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). It was found that under the assumptions used in this analysis and crude oil prices, the LCOE required for economic feasibility must be less than 2\u00a2/kWh. While not feasible under current market prices and costs, this work identifies key variables impacting process cost and discusses potential alternative paths toward economic feasibility. This was the best case scenario of the two organisms evaluated, and an optimally suited organism with high growth yield and low maintenance coefficient should obviously improve the economics. This economic constraint will improve with the rise of fossil fuel prices, which should occur if the environmentally detrimental effects of their use are factored into the price, through higher taxation, for example.\nA review of the current status of metabolic engineering of chemolithoautotrophs is carried out in order to identify the challenges and likely routes to overcome them. This is presented in Chapter 3 of this dissertation. The initial metabolic engineering and bioreactor studies was carried out using a number of gene-constructs on R. capsulatus and R. eutropha. The gene-constructs consisted of Plac promoter followed by the triterpene synthase genes (SS or BS) and other upstream genes. In R. capsulatus, by genetically supplementing the methylerithrotol phosphate (MEP) pathway and supplementing the growth with glucose, it was found that the triterpene synthase enzymes were substrate-limited i.e. depended on the carbon-flux to them. A comparison of the production of triterpenes were done in the different growth modes that R. capsulatus was capable of growing \u2013 aerobic heterotrophic, anaerobic photoheterotrophic and aerobic chemoautotrophic. Small-scale testing (<50 ml) under typical (un-supplemented) growth conditions showed that the per-cell triterpene production levels were surprisingly similar in all the different growth modes (around 5 mg/gDW). However, the results were much improved when tested in controlled fed-batch bioreactors, capable of reaching significantly higher cell densities. In the heterotrophic case, production was found to increase up to 40 mg/L (~11 mg/gDW), unfortunately inhibited by some sort of toxic effect at OD660 around 12. Autotrophic growth on H2, O2 and CO2, on the other hand, showed no such effect and growth occurred well up to an OD660 of 17 (corresponding to about 7 gDW/L), limited only by the mass-transfer of the gases and triterpene productivity increased continuously to greater than 100 mg/L (16 mg/gDW) in the batch mode. Continuous autotrophic operation further increased the specific titer to 23 mg/gDW, reaching a steady state. The specific productivity was found to be around 0.5 mg/gDW-hr. This demonstrated that autotrophic productivity could likely be improved much further by increasing the available mass-transfer of the reactor. These efforts are presented in Chapter 4 of this dissertation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10694], "author_name_tesi": "Khan, Nymul Ehsan", "last_name_ssi": "Khan", "middle_name_ssi": "Ehsan", "first_name_ssi": "Nymul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis", "Manish Kumar", "Esther Winter Gomez", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis, Dissertation Advisor", "Manish Kumar, Committee Member", "Esther Winter Gomez, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chemolithoautotroph", "CO2 fixation", "Rhodobacter capsulatus", "Ralstonia eutropha", "triterpene", "squalene", "botryococcene", "chemostat"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Ferroelectric Polymer Thin Films \nwith High Energy Density and Low Loss \n", "id": "14507", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5005", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dielectric materials with large electric energy density are actively pursued for many applications.

Substrate cost is still a major factor in bioproduction of fuel and chemicals. Utilization of lower-valued substrates such as lignocellulose can reduce the cost of bioprocesses thereby enabling them to compete with traditional chemical synthesis. Xylose, which is the second most abundant sugar in nature and a major constituent of hemicellulose in lignocellulosic biomass and wastes, can play an important role in this contest. Escherichia coli is capable of utilizing a wide range of sugars as carbon and energy sources and producing native metabolites and non-native compounds. In E. coli, xylose uptake occurs primarily through a high-affinity, ATP-binding cassette transporter (XylFGH), although a second, low-affinity proton symporter (XylE) is also present. The efficiency of xylose utilization in this organism is therefore suboptimal due to energetic requirements for xylose uptake.\nEscherichia coli W3110 was previously engineered to co-utilize glucose and xylose by replacing the wild-type crp gene with a crp* mutant encoding a cAMP-independent CRP variant. Subsequent deletion of the xylB gene (encoding xylulokinase) and expression of xylose reductase from Candida boidinii (CbXR) resulted in a strain which produces xylitol from glucose-xylose mixtures. Our results show that although xylose is negligibly metabolized by wild-type E. coli W3110 in the presence of glucose (classic diauxic growth), xylose transport and xylitol production do occur in the presence of glucose in wild-type E. coli expressing XR, and xylitol production is significantly improved in a mutant strain expressing cAMP-independent CRP (CRP*). These results indicate that either the native xylose transporters are not tightly controlled by CRP or additional transport mechanisms exist. Finally, growth on xylose by E. coli W3110 strains with deletions in both native xylose transporters is recovered to nearly that of wild-type using high concentrations of xylose (~100 mM), demonstrating that xylose is transported by at least one other, low-affinity system.\nAccurate modeling of xylose metabolism in E. coli in the presence of high concentrations of xylose requires a more thorough understanding of xylose uptake mechanisms and their energy requirements. Conversion of xylose to xylitol (which is secreted) provides a measure of xylose transport without requiring xylose metabolism. This system allows studies of how different native and heterologous transporters (e.g., deleted or overexpressed) influence xylose uptake under various conditions (e.g. in the presence of glucose) and not coupled to growth or expression of genes specific to xylose metabolism.\nWe have examined the contributions of the native E. coli xylose transporters (the D-xylose/proton symporter XylE and the D-xylose ABC transporter XylFGH) and CRP* to xylitol production in the presence of glucose and xylose. The final batch xylitol titer with strain PC09 (\u0192\u00b4xylB and crp*) is reduced by 40% upon deletion of xylG and by 60% upon deletion of both xyl transporters. This shows that, up to 40% of xylose transport occurs via secondary transport. This uptake is apparently not affected by individual deletions in other transporters known to be promiscuous. Xylitol production by the wild-type strain (W3110) expressing CbXR is not reduced when xylE and xylG are deleted, demonstrating tight regulation of the xylose transporters by CRP and revealing significant secondary xylose transport. Finally, plasmid expression of XylE or XylFGH with CbXR in PC07 (\u0192\u00b4xylB and wild-type crp) growing on glucose results in xylitol titers similar to that achieved with PC09 and provides an alternative strategy to the use of CRP*.  Studies that correlate anaerobic growth of engineered strains on xylose to energy yield indicate that secondary xylose transport is largely energy dependent (not diffusion). \nE. coli K-12 strains W3110 and MG1655 and wild-type E. coli B were compared as platforms for xylitol production from glucose-xylose mixtures using either plasmid-based expression of a xylose transporter (XylE or XylFGH) or replacing the native crp gene with a mutant (crp*). The engineered strains were compared in fed-batch fermentations and as non-growing resting cells. Expression of CRP* in the E. coli B strains tested was unable to enhance xylose uptake in the presence of glucose. Xylitol production was similar for the (crp*, \u0192\u00b4xylB)-derivatives of W3110 and MG1655 expressing CbXR (average specific productivities of ~0.43 g xylitol g cdw-1 h-1 in fed-batch fermentation). In contrast, results varied substantially between different \u0192\u00b4xylB-derivative strains coexpressing either XylE or XylFGH. Thus, the differences in genetic background between these strains can profoundly influence metabolic engineering strategies.\nWhile previous studies have examined the effects of expressing CRP* mutants on the expression of specific catabolic genes, little is known about the global transcriptional effects of CRP* expression. We also compare the transcriptome of E. coli W3110 (expressing wild-type CRP) to that of mutant strain PC05 (expressing CRP*) in the presence and absence of glucose. \nWhile the simplest model of CRP*-mediated gene expression assumes insensitivity to glucose (or cAMP), our results show that gene expression in the context of CRP* is very different from that of wild-type in the absence of glucose, and is influenced by the presence of glucose. 238 genes were found to respond differently to glucose in PC05 compared to W3110. Genes whose expression is significantly altered by glucose in strain W3110 are generally not altered to the same extent in strain PCO5 and the glucose effect is significantly suppressed in this strain. We present a detailed transcription analysis and relate these results to phenotypic differences between strains expressing wild-type CRP and CRP*. Notably, CRP* expression in the presence of glucose, results in an elevated intracellular NADPH concentration and reduced NADH concentration relative to wild-type CRP. Meanwhile, a more drastic decrease in the NADPH/NADP+ ratio is observed for the case of CRP* expression in strains engineered to reduce xylose to xylitol via NADPH-dependent xylose reductase during glucose metabolism.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5392], "author_name_tesi": "Khankal, Reza ", "last_name_ssi": "Khankal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Reza", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Michael Cirino", "Patrick C Cirino", "Costas D Maranas", "William O Hancock", "Andrew Zydney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Michael Cirino, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick C Cirino, Committee Chair", "Costas D Maranas, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["XYLOSE UPTAKE", "ESCHERICHIA COLI", "XYLITOL PRODUCTION", "XYLE", "XYLFGH", "POLYOLS"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Quantization of Coadjoint Orbits via Positivity of Kirillov's Character Formula", "id": "27426", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11872", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Kirillov proved his character formula for simply connected nilpotent Lie groups in 1962 and conjectured its universality.

As a reflection of this, more than 50% of the current drug targets lie at the cell surface. The amount of a protein at the cell surface is determined by its rate of delivery, internalization, recycling and degradation. All these parameters are subject to change under normal physiological adjustments, development, varying environmental influences and pathological conditions.\nThe spectrin based membrane skeleton (SBMS) is a ubiquitous feature of all metazoan cells. This network of spectrin and associated proteins is attached directly or indirectly to plasma membrane proteins. Among the numerous functions of the SBMS, are roles in protein trafficking and turnover that determine levels of plasma membrane proteins. Regulated spectrin proteolysis, mediated by calpain, occurs under normal physiological conditions for various cellular processes, including establishment of synaptic contacts, long-term potentiation and platelet activation. Spectrin cleavage is also observed in age-related pathologies such as stroke and other ischemic events, Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases. However, little is known about the consequences of spectrin breakdown per se under these conditions.\nThe goal of this work is to establish the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster as model system for some aspects of ischemic stroke, of which spectrin breakdown is a hallmark. The hypothesis being tested in this work is that disruption of the SBMS will affect the levels of many proteins at the cell surface under pathological conditions. The significance of this with respect to an ischemic stroke is that changes in levels of cell surface proteins in the event of SBMS breakdown need to be compensated for in post-stroke drug therapies and rehabilitation.\nIn order to observe changes in the cell surface proteome under SBMS breakdown, one would first need to establish what it looks in normal conditions. Towards this, I developed a technique to isolate pure PM that employs a unique combination of density gradient centrifugation and aqueous two-phase affinity partitioning (2PAP). Density gradient centrifugation is an accepted method of fractionation on the basis of the buoyant densities of biomolecules and organelles but results in an overlap in cellular compartments due to similarities in densities. 2PAP is an established method for PM isolation in vertebrate model systems and makes use of the glycosylation pattern of PM proteins to isolate them from those in other compartments. My work demonstrates that a novel combination of both the techniques results in a robust PM preparation, which neither technique can achieve on its own. Using the new technique, 432 proteins were identified from Drosophila heads by MudPIT, of which 22% were found to be known PM residents and 34% are currently unassigned to any compartment and represent candidate PM proteins.\nThe SBMS was disrupted in Drosophila with the help of a temperature sensitive &#945;-spectrin allele (&#945;\u2013specR22S, R22S) that causes spectrin network disassembly at non-permissive temperature (29oC) and has been previously characterized. The R22S allele was introduced as a transgene into wild-type flies as well as an &#945;-spectrin null background. My data suggests that although there is no precedent for an effect of &#945;-spectrin R22S (&#945;(R22S) being expressed in a wild-type background, the mutant protein in my hands, shows a difference in distribution in the ovaries in comparison to its wild-type counterpart.  &#945;(R22S) is excluded from the spectrin network at the apical membrane of the ovarian follicle cells and is instead exclusively localized in the basal membrane in the presence of the wild-type &#945;-spectrin. It is also unstable in the presence of the wild-type &#945;-spectrin, while in an &#945;-spectrin null background, it is stable and its distribution in the ovaries resembles that of the wild-type protein. These data suggest a faster turnover of &#945;(R22S) in the presence of wild-type &#945;-spectrin due its selective exclusion from the membrane bound spectrin network. The work presented also shows similarity in phenotypes in the ovaries when &#945;(R22S) is present as the sole source of &#945;&#8722;spectrin and when it is present in a background heterozygous for &#945;&#8722;spectrin (heterozygous flies): at a frequency of about 8%, abnormal late stage egg chambers are observed, with gross morphological defects in the follicle cell layer, absence of nurse cells and necrosis. This effect seems to be independent of temperature and genotype. Also, flies with &#945;(R22S) as the sole source of &#945;-spectrin (rescued flies) don\u2019t produce any progeny.\nSince the heterozygous flies show similar phenotypes as the rescued flies, I decided to record significant changes in the Drosophila plasma membrane proteome by iTRAQ in these flies.  iTRAQ analysis revealed a significant change in 18 proteins, of which 4 are PM proteins and have been established in literature to being affected by the SBMS.\n \tThe structural role of the SBMS has been long established. The results presented in this thesis point to a more dynamic role for the SBMS in maintaining intercellular communication and maintaining surface protein levels.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4306], "author_name_tesi": "Khanna, Mansi Rajendra", "last_name_ssi": "Khanna", "middle_name_ssi": "Rajendra", "first_name_ssi": "Mansi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Graham Hugh Thomas", "Graham Hugh Thomas", "Richard W Ordway", "Hong Ma", "Melissa Rolls", "Bruce A Stanley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Graham Hugh Thomas, Dissertation Advisor", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Chair", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "Bruce A Stanley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["spectrin", "proteomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Role of CD82 tetraspanins in regulation of extracellular signals within the tumor microenvironment during transendothelial migration", "id": "15163", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7602", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Melanoma cancer arises in approximately 70,000 new patients each year and nearly 1 in 63 of patients will have in an invasive form of the cancer, which spreads to the heart and lungs (King 2006; Pennacchioli, Tosti et al. 2012). Once melanoma has spread to distant organs, the disease is increasingly difficult to treat and few therapeutic approaches exist to inhibit melanoma metastasis. An important event during cancer metastasis is tumor cell extravasation through blood vessels into neighboring tissues in which the cancer cell adheres to endothelial substrates, degrades and migrates through the underlying extracellular matrix, and then forms a new colony in the invaded tissue. Understanding the underlying mechanisms that facilitate these events will lead to the development of effective cancer therapies. The goal of this work is to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which cancer cells activate endothelial signaling networks to form gaps in endothelial substrates and facilitate the migration of cancer cells into the blood stream. \nEndothelial gap formation is triggered by adhesion molecules (such as \u03b14\u03b21 integrins) and inflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin (IL)-8), IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2) from the tumor microenvironment. The binding of these molecules to endothelial cells allows Rac GTPase to exchange a GTP molecule for GDP and subsequent activation of PAK and p38 mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which regulate events leading to gaps in endothelial cells. Gaps in the endothelium form through two primary mechanisms: (i) the dissociation of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin homodimers and (ii) contractility of endothelial cells involving the phosphorylation of myosin light chain and actin polymerization. \nIn normal physiology, duffy antigen receptors/groups (DARC) on endothelial cells DARC binds to chemokines, in particular, IL-8. DARC receptors on endothelial cells undergo transcytosis of IL-8 to the lumen surface where they are presented on the cell surface to direct recruitment and chemotaxis leukocytes through endothelial monolayers ((Middleton, Patterson et al. 2002)). During tumor induced inflammation, excess secretion of IL-8 within the tumor microenvironment disrupts homeostasis and IL-8 on endothelial surfaces recruits PMN to sites of melanoma cell extravasation. In melanoma cells, IL-8 induced effects promote adhesion of melanoma cells to endothelial cells, facilitating formation of gaps and transendothelial migration of melanoma cells. Similarly, overexpression of VLA-4 adhesion molecules on melanoma cell surfaces result in abnormal activation of signaling pathways in endothelial cells and an increase in invasiveness of melanoma cells. \nThe mutated form of B-Raf is found in nearly 50% of patients with malignant melanomas and is a known target for treating melanoma cancer (Flaherty, Robert et al. 2012). Results have shown that targeting mutant V600EB-Raf reduces melanoma metastasis through reductions in active melanoma cell extravasation through endothelial cells. Mechanistically, reduced melanoma extravasation following inhibition of mutant V600EB-Raf is due to the disruption of downstream NF-\u03baB signaling, which inhibits IL-8 production. While previous data show knocking down V600EB-Raf decreases melanoma cell extravasation, our current data shows that inhibiting V600E or wild-type B-Raf genes in early stage melamoma cancers increases melanoma cell extravasation. B-Raf is upstream of many proteins in the cell membrane, specifically tetraspanins known to have varying functions. \nTetraspanins (including CD82) play an important function in regulating adhesion molecules (VLA-4) and secretion of cytokines (IL-8) from melanoma cells. CD82 tetraspanin is one tumor suppressor gene which is expressed in the early stages of melanoma cancer, but disappears as melanoma cancer increases invasive capabilities of melanoma cancer. \nIn this work we show that re-introducing CD82 expression in late stage melanoma cancer suppresses melanoma cell invasion through human blood vessels. We show that CD82 binding to DARC receptors interrupts IL-8 binding to endothelial substrates. While knocking down B-Raf in late stage melanoma cells suppresses metastasis, CD82 expression is still present in early stage melanoma cancers. As a result, inhibiting B-Raf (an upstream mediator of CD82) could result in a decrease in CD82 expression and an increase in melanoma cell invasion. \nFurthermore, CD82 expression plays a role in suppressing IL-8 secretion and maturation of the \u03b21 subunit of VLA-4 integrins and their binding affinities. Previous work has shown that these two factors within the tumor microenvironment play a key role in cancer invasiveness. Consistent with previous work, we find that IL-8 secretion and VLA-4 binding affinities trigger signaling proteins (such as p38 and PAK) that play a key role in regulating VE-cadherin disassembly and contractility of endothelial cells. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7537], "author_name_tesi": "Khanna, Payal ", "last_name_ssi": "Khanna", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Payal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheng Dong", "Peter J Butler", "Margaret June Slattery", "Costas D Maranas", "Esther Winter Gomez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheng Dong, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Margaret June Slattery, Committee Member", "Costas D Maranas, Special Member", "Esther Winter Gomez, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tetraspanins", "cytokines", "melanoma", "cadherins", "cancer", "endothelial"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A PARAMETRIC STUDY OF RESERVOIR COOLING FOR ENHANCED RECOVERY BY CO2 FLOODING", "id": "16352", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7868", "abstract_tesi": "Miscible gas flooding has recently overtaken steam flooding as the most successful enhanced oil recovery technique, resulting in about 440,000 barrels/day in increased oil production (Oil & Gas Journal 2012). Carbon dioxide flooding is an integral part of miscible gas flooding. This thesis focuses on the feasibility of injecting water along with CO2 at temperatures lower than reservoir temperature, which may result in more incremental oil production. \nA key parameter of miscible CO2 flooding is the determination of the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP). MMP is the minimum pressure at which the oil and injected gas achieve miscibility so that previously trapped oil can be recovered. There are various ways in which MMP can be determined: experimental methods, analytical methods, computational methods and from various empirical correlations. In this thesis, we have developed a simple MMP correlation for pure CO2 injection with the help of an extensive database of slim tube MMPs, relying on data not used previously.\nLiterature indicates a linear relationship between MMP and temperature as has been investigated by slim tube tests on various oils (Yellig and Metcalfe 1980). We have conducted waterflood and continuous CO2 injection at two different temperature scenarios, one at original reservoir temperature and the other at lower temperature. Conducting a long waterflood at a lower temperature has resulted in lowering of the reservoir temperature. Subsequently, this has reduced the MMP at the start of CO2 injection, resulting in incremental oil recovery of almost 26% as compared to 3% when injecting the fluids at reservoir temperature. \nWe have also injected various cold water slug sizes at two different temperatures in-between a conventional waterflood at reservoir temperature and CO2 injection.  Injecting a cold water slug does reduce the MMP when more than 1.0 PV of cold water is injected, but results in the delay of CO2 injection, which likely adversely impacts economics. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7794], "author_name_tesi": "Khanzode, Amey Mohan", "last_name_ssi": "Khanzode", "middle_name_ssi": "Mohan", "first_name_ssi": "Amey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["MMP", "slim tube", "correlation", "incremental oil recovery"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DECOMPOSITION AND IGNITION OF \nHAN-BASED MONOPROPELLANTS BY ELECTROLYSIS\n\n\n\n", "id": "9134", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5006", "abstract_tesi": "In this research, electrolytically-induced HAN ignition has been studied.

A vital aspect of such systems that is essential for success during a live procedure is the registration of the bronchoscope in the multi-detector computed-tomography (MDCT) derived virtual space. This registration of the bronchoscope enables navigational pathplanning to guide the physician to the diagnostic regions of interest (ROIs). When the ROI is reached, which is very often beyond the airway walls, the registration aids in localization for effective biopsy sampling.\n\nDuring a live bronchoscopy procedure, adverse events such as patient coughing lead to the bronchoscope moving to an unknown location. Such events disrupt bronchoscopy guidance. Manual intervention by an assisting technician often helps in recovering from such a disruption, but this results in extra procedure time and some potential uncertainty in the registered position. Furthermore, at some bifurcations, physicians are forced to carry out bronchoscope maneuvers spanning across several airway generations. Previously proposed local registration-based systems find it difficult to handle these maneuvers. To address these situations, we propose a global registration system for image-guided bronchoscopy. This system identifies the bronchoscope position without the need for significant bronchoscope maneuvers or technician intervention. The algorithm involves a fast local registration search over all the branches in a global airway-bifurcation search space, with the weighted normalized sum of squares distance metric used for finding the best match. The algorithm was tested using virtual cases, airway phantoms and also video frames from live patients. The algorithm was implemented in a parallel paradigm and takes less than 2 seconds to execute making it feasible for use in a clinical setting. Experiments also show that the performance of the algorithm can be improved by incorporating multiple frames.\n\nWe also proposed a technician-free system-level solution for image-guided bronchoscopy with two main features. The first feature is a system-level guidance strategy that incorporates a global registration algorithm to provide the physician with updated navigational and guidance information during bronchoscopy. The system can handle general navigation to a region of interest(ROI), as well as adverse events, and it requires minimal commands so that it can be directly controlled by the physician. The second feature visualizes the global picture of all the bifurcations and their relative orientations in advance and suggests the maneuvers needed by the bronchoscope to approach the ROI. The guidance system was tested during live bronchoscopy for nine patients and was able to guide the physician to the ROIs with a success rate of more than 97%.

The model incorporates kinetic and nutrient limits on biological productivity, along with constraints imposed by metabolic thermodynamics. We have used this model to predict the biogenic CH4 flux and net primary productivity (NPP) of the marine biosphere prior to the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis. Organisms considered include chemotrophic and organotrophic methanogens, H2-, H2S-, and Fe-using anoxygenic phototrophs, S-reducing bacteria, CO-using acetogens, and fermentative bacteria.\n\nCH4 production and NPP in our model are limited by the downward flux of H2, CO, S8, and H2S through the atmosphere-ocean interface and by the upwelling rate of Fe2+ from the deep oceans. For reasonable estimates of the supply of these compounds, we find that the biogenic CH4 flux should have ranged from ~&#8531; to 2.5 times the modern CH4 flux. In the anoxic Archean atmosphere, this would have produced CH4 concentrations of 100 ppmv to as much as 35,000 ppmv (3.5%), depending on the rate at which hydrogen escaped to space. Recent calculations indicating that hydrogen escape was slow favor the higher CH4 concentrations. Calculated NPP is lower than in the modern oceans by a factor of at least 40. In our model, metabolism based on H2 and Fe is about equally productive, with S-based metabolism being considerably less productive. Internal recycling of sulfur within the surface ocean, neglected here, could conceivably raise rates of sulfur metabolism to much higher values.\n\nAlthough explicit calculations of the methane greenhouse effect are not performed here, our model is consistent with the idea that the early Archean mean surface temperature could have been very high, perhaps as high as the 55-85oC estimate obtained from oxygen isotopes in 3.3-Ga cherts. The climate could have been particularly warm if methanogens evolved before anoxygenic phototrophs, as this would have maximized the ratio of CH4 production to organic carbon burial. CH4 concentrations and surface temperatures should have declined once phototrophs evolved because increased primary productivity and organic carbon burial would have drawn down total atmospheric hydrogen mixing ratios. CH4 concentrations may have increased again (and the climate warmed) in the late Archean following the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis because primary productivity would no longer have been constrained by the supply of reductants.

Anomalies may manifest themselves with self excitation, or under excitation of certain exogenous stimuli. These anomalies may be benign or malignant depending on their impact on the mission objectives and operating conditions.\nMajor catastrophic failures in large scale engineering systems (e.g., aircraft, power plants and turbo-machinery) can possibly be averted if the malignant anomalies are detected at an early stage. This dissertation experimentally validates a novel method for anomaly detection in electromechanical systems, derived from time series data of pertinent measured variable(s). The core concept of the anomaly detection method is Symbolic Time Series Analysis (STSA) that is built upon the principles of Automata Theory, Information Theory, and Pattern Recognition.\nThe anomaly detection methodology, investigated in this dissertation, consists\nof two parts:\nForward problem - The objective in the forward problem is to learn how the grammar of the underlying system dynamics evolves as the system parameters gradually change. The forward problem is that of learning where the value of a parameter is associated with an anomaly measure.\nInverse problem - The inverse problem is that of inferring the system parameters based on the observed asymptotic behavior.\nThis dissertation deals with both the forward and inverse problems. The performance of this anomaly detection method is compared with that of other existing pattern recognition techniques from the perspectives of early detection of fatigue damage in polycrystalline alloy structures. The experimental apparatus, on which\nthe anomaly detection method is tested, is a multi-degree of freedom mass-beam\nstructure excited by oscillatory motion of two electromagnetic shakers.

The dissertation presents Symbolic Time Series Analysis (STSA) of bearing acceleration for detection and estimation of parametric changes in flexible disc/diaphragm couplings due to angular misalignment between shafts. The concept is validated on a simulation model, where the dynamic model of a flexible mechanical coupling is subjected to angular misalignment.

Inconel\u00ae 625 would be primarily used as the overlay material in a weld clad because of the high corrosion and wear resistance it exhibits. However, instead of only adding a few layers of material to a dissimilar base material, there is interest in using AM to process entire components made from Ni base alloys that will exhibit the material properties in bulk form. \nAlloying element compositions in Inconel\u00ae 625 can vary over rather wide ranges, with Fe, in particular, ranging from 0 to 5 wt%. The impact of changes in the Fe content on the properties of AM materials is investigated using a series of laser-based directed energy deposited (DED) builds with Fe contents of 1 wt% and 4 wt% in both the as deposited and post processed hot isostatically pressed (HIP) conditions. While similar solidification structures and microhardness values of the fabricated builds are observed with both powder feedstocks, the low Fe content feedstock samples displayed higher yield (520 MPa \u00b1 12 MPa) and tensile strengths (860 MPa \u00b1 27 MPa) and lower elongation values (36 % \u00b1 5 %) in the as-deposited condition compared to yield (450 MPa \u00b1 27 MPa) and tensile strengths (753 MPa \u00b1 25 MPa) and elongation values (44 % \u00b1 9 %) with the high Fe content feedstock samples. The differences in mechanical properties were highly dependent on the condition and were connected to differences in the strengthening mechanisms associated with the two different Inconel\u00ae 625 powder compositions.\nLow Fe content samples had an average grain size 10x smaller than that of high Fe content samples in the as deposited condition, which led to differences in mechanical properties. After HIP, Low Fe content samples displayed smaller grains, but compared to the as deposited condition, there was not substantial grain growth or recrystallization. The yield strength of both low and high Fe content builds decreased by 14%, while elongation increased by 15%. While on the other hand, post processed tensile strengths changed by only 3%. This small change in tensile strength can be traced to higher levels of strain hardening for high Fe content feedstocks. These differences in mechanical behavior can be attributed in part, to changes in precipitate formation after HIP. It is speculated that in low Fe content samples large Nb and Mo rich precipitates form that pin grain boundary motion while in the high Fe content samples, tiny Ti rich precipitates form that pin dislocation motion.\nPrecipitate formation is denoted as secondary phase formation. In order to study the impact alloying elements had on the resulting secondary phase constituents, thermodynamic phase stability calculations were conducted. Calculations showed different phase formation tendencies for each powder feedstock material. In addition, phase stability calculations helped set guidelines in order to distinguish between secondary phase constituents based upon the Nb content. Coupled with a low C/Nb ratio and verified using an electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), secondary phase constituents were characterized as Laves phase", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15882], "author_name_tesi": "Khayat, Zakariya Radwan", "last_name_ssi": "Khayat", "middle_name_ssi": "Radwan", "first_name_ssi": "Zakariya", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Todd Palmer", "Allison Michelle Beese", "Jingjing Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Todd Palmer, Thesis Advisor", "Allison Michelle Beese, Committee Member", "Jingjing Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Additive Manufacturing", "Inconel 625", "directed energy deposition", "powder feedstock", "Nickel base alloys", "HIP", "materials science", "alloying elements"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "NEUROMODULATORY MECHANISM UNDERLYING ETHANOL-INDUCED \nBEHAVIORAL DISINHIBITION IN DROSOPHILA\n", "id": "10374", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4505", "abstract_tesi": "Ethanol, an active ingredient of alcohol beverages, is the most abused drug around the world and has numerous negative effects on behavior, including cognitive and motor impulsivity and addiction. The effects and underlying mechanisms of chronic ethanol exposure have been addressed in the genetically tractable Drosophila, as Ethanol affects behaviors of Drosophila and humans in a similar manner. In particular, ethanol increases disinhibited courtship between wild-type male flies (cognitive impulsivity) and the level of disinhibited courtship increases with additional ethanol exposure (behavioral sensitization). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these phenomena are unknown. Here, we used genetic approaches to manipulate dopamine receptors and transporter to investigate their roles in the disinhibited courtship under the influence of ethanol. We also investigated the role of additional neuromodulator Amnesiac (Amn), a putative neuropeptide, since Amn is previously shown to be crucial for the ethanol\u2019s effect on loss of motor control or sedation. Mutant flies defective in D1 receptor showed higher levels of male-male courtship compared to the wild-type flies upon exposure to ethanol. However, D2 mutant flies did not display behavioral sensitization, a type of plasticity associated with addiction. Dopamine transporter mutant fumin, which is unable to re-uptake released dopamine and thus presumably has an enhanced dopamine level, showed drastically reduced disinhibited courtship. Fumin mutant flies, on the other hand, exhibited enhanced motor impulsivity. These observations indicate the critical role of dopamine in ethanol-induced cognitive and motor impulsivity. Further characterization of the neural sites and downstream effectors that dopamine mediates ethanol-induced behavioral changes should help clarify the underlying cellular mechanisms. Various amn mutants showed inconsistent behavioral responses under chronic ethanol exposure. While amn1 mutants exhibited enhanced sensitivity to the sedative effect of ethanol and enhanced inter male courtship, other amn alleles showed normal sensitivity or reduced inter male courtship. Continued studies on the molecular and cellular characteristics of different amn alleles should help clarify discrepancies in the phenotypes and provide insights into the role of Amn in the ethanol-induced sedation and cognitive impulsivity.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4475], "author_name_tesi": "Kherad Pezhouh, Maryam ", "last_name_ssi": "Kherad Pezhouh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Maryam", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Paul Han", "Kyung An Han"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Paul Han, Thesis Advisor", "Kyung An Han, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Drosophila", "Behavioral Disinhibition", "Ethanol"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "An Efficient Implementation Of Link Analysis Algorithm In High-Speed Interfaces for NRZ In The Presence Of CMOS Non-Linearity In Receivers", "id": "27441", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11275", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Today's communication systems have achieved data rates in the range of multi-gigabits per second (Gb/s). With such an incessant escalation in data rates, design engineers are working hard to maintain the performance of these high-speed systems. At higher data rates, it is imperative to preserve the system performance by estimating the impairments of signal. These impairments are mainly due to the frequency dependent nature of transmitters, channels, and receivers in a communication system. Jitter plays a major role in contributing to these impairments thereby, degrading the performance of communication systems. As the speed of data transfer increases, the effects of jitter become more critical with tighter jitter budgets.  In order to reduce the effects of jitter in a system, it is crucial to understand its causes and characteristics.\nIn this thesis, the fundamentals of jitter along with its components and sources are reviewed. It illustrates several parameters relevant to the analysis of jitter and its types. This is followed by an overview of some traditional techniques used for jitter measurement and modeling such as the sampling oscilloscopes, bit error ratio tester (BERT), time interval analyzer (TIA), and some state-of-the-art algorithms such as the Tail fit, Peak distortion analysis (PDA), and direct computation of probabilities algorithms. These techniques are well-elucidated with examples as well as their pros and cons.\nThis thesis presents an implementation of the most recent link statistical signaling technique for modeling jitter, in the presence of CMOS non-linearity observed in receivers. This algorithm is based on a superposition technique using HashMaps for determining the accurate logic level of digital data bits, in the presence of jitter. This approach deals with the overall effect of unwanted alterations observed on a data bit positioned at the cursor, contributed by neighboring bits in a digital data stream. In this technique, HashMaps are employed to sustain the computational intricacies involved in this algorithm. The time required for the execution is also reduced, making it an efficient technique for this implementation. The execution time of this technique is reduced by more than a third as compared to a prior implementation of the Link Analysis algorithm called \u2018Bin Multiplication\u2019. This technique is implemented for non-return to zero (NRZ), which is the most preferred signaling scheme in high-speed digital systems. \nMost of the jitter modeling techniques are based on the assumption of linear behavior of components in communication systems. However, in reality, receivers exhibit non-linear traits and this aspect substantially detriments the performance of a system. Thus, the statistical analysis for jitter measurement in terms of bit error rate (BER), is extended to account for the receiver\u2019s non-linearity. In this research, the voltage characteristic of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) receivers is nominated for modeling the non-linearity in terms of hyperbolic tangent. The total jitter probability density function (PDF) acquired for a linear system is obtained based on this non-linearity. This precise PDF adjustment for non-linearity can be used to estimate the bit error rate (BER) values.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10815], "author_name_tesi": "Khilnani, Tapan Lalit", "last_name_ssi": "Khilnani", "middle_name_ssi": "Lalit", "first_name_ssi": "Tapan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aldo W Morales", "Sedig Salem Agili", "Jeremy Joseph Blum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aldo W Morales, Thesis Advisor", "Sedig Salem Agili, Thesis Advisor", "Jeremy Joseph Blum, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Jitter", "Probability density function", "HashMap", "Random Jitter", "Deterministic Jitter", "Inter-symbol interference", "Non-Linearity"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Reducing Car Use through New Urban Design Schemes in Western Tehran ", "id": "22542", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2401", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The world has become progressively more modernized and urbanized during the past century, and the growth of megacities is now a worldwide phenomenon. Despite differences in the nature, level, and magnitude of urbanization in developed and less-developed countries, all countries face similar problems in their urbanized areas. Current development patterns have become a major source of concern in developed countries due to the extent of environmental damages and health problems that they have caused. However, the need for new urban development paradigms and modern environmentally conscious patterns is not limited to developed countries. Addressing the development pattern of developing cities is also critical to meeting the dual challenges of climate change and urbanization.\nAs the second-largest city in the Middle East and one of the largest cities in the world, Tehran faces substantial challenges of which spatial and traffic congestion, air pollution, and inadequate infrastructure seem most prominent. This thesis is an attempt to identify problems associated with the current development pattern of Tehran. Municipal districts 21 and 22 in the west of Tehran are the focus of this study. In 1993, these districts were added to the city in an attempt to implement environmentally friendly principles and create a development pattern based on a logistic plan. However, the existing master plans for development of these districts primarily promote a private-car-dependent urban environment. The author proposes strategies, alternative plans, and design guidelines for reducing reliance on automobile transportation in these developing areas.\nThis thesis provides an overview of Tehran\u2019s growth and its problems with an emphasis on development patterns.

In the case of dielectric nanoparticles in a polymer, it is expected that dielectric properties of the nanocomposite are dominated by the expansive interface rather than anticipated by the inherent properties of individual components. An in-depth review of dielectric polymer nanocomposites shows conflicting trends where addition of nano-sized particles resulted in increase or decrease in dielectric properties. This contradictory behavior could mainly stem from 1- the state of dispersion of nanoparticles and 2-The unique nature of interface based on the particle-polymer system. The hypothesis of the proposed research is that the role of the interfacial region is not only influenced by its expansive nature but is also governed by their interaction at nanoscale regime. In order to achieve a high internal surface area, the first important challenge to address is controlling the state of dispersion and disaggregation of nanoparticles. Therefore the first goal of this research is studying the effectiveness of different processing methods in achieving uniform nanoscale dispersion in dielectric polymer nanocomposites. Silane functionalization of titania nanoparticles is investigated as one possible solution of better dispersion of titania in PVDF polymer where two coupling agents namely, aminopropyltriethoxy silane called as APS, and Nonafluorohexyltriethoxysilane called as FHES, are studied. FHES is shown to be more effective in reducing the average aggregate size of titania nanoparticles in PVDF matrix to below 100nm, whereas the average aggregate size in untreated and APS-functionalized TiO2/PVDF nanocomposite was approximately one to two orders of magnitude higher than that. Dielectric permittivity of FHES-functionalized TiO2/PVDF nanocomposite, showed improvements over untreated and APS-functionalized TiO2/PVDF nanocomposite at weight fractions up to 10wt% (5vol%), as a result of higher interfacial area and resulting polarization at interface. However, DC dielectric breakdown and maximum achievable stored energy density did not show any dependence on average aggregate size or the type of silane surface treatments; both DC dielectric breakdown and maximum achievable stored energy density showed a similar decreasing trend as the titania weight fraction increased for all three cases. Besides silane functionalization of titania, in-situ and ex-situ sol-gel synthesis of titania were also studied as another effective method to achieve nanoscale dispersion in titania/PVDF nanocomposites. In- situ sol-gel technique resulted in uniform nanodispersion of titania in PVDF and 30% higher dielectric permittivity at 1kHz compared to commercial titania/PVDF composite with the same wt% of titania phase. However, high dielectric loss and lower DC dielectric breakdown were also observed in the in-situ sample, due to ionic impurities and trapped residues of the sol-gel process, which is a disadvantage of in-situ technique. On the other hand, ex-situ technique showed uniform dispersion of titania aggregates in the range of 100nm homogeneously dispersed in PVDF matrix. Dielectric permittivity and DC dielectric breakdown both improved in case of ex-situ; leading to 20% improvement in storage energy density of ex-situ titania/PVDF compared to pure PVDF sample; therefore this processing technique is a promising one. As to the second goal of this research, understanding the role of interfacial phenomena on final dielectric behavior of polymer nanocomposites, other metal oxides, namely, alumina, silica and magnesia are considered. In addition to varying contrast in dielectric permittivity with PVDF, these metal oxide particles also bring dissimilar surface chemistries in terms of type and concentration of physisorbed and chemisorbed water on their surfaces. Alumina nanoparticles in particular showed relatively higher amount of physisorbed and chemisorbed water on the surface; it also exhibited nanoscale dispersion in PVDF. Dielectric permittivity of alumina/PVDF nanocomposites, despite similar dielectric constant values for both phases, showed higher improvements compared to the other particles. Dehydrated alumina/PVDF nanocomposites also showed similar increase in dielectric permittivity. Therefore, a second important conclusion of this work is that improvements in dielectric permittivity in alumina/PVDF is mostly a result of dipolar interactions of chemisorbed water in form of hydroxyl group on the surface of alumina and C-F dipoles in PVDF chain at the interface. The combination of nanoscale dispersion in alumina/PVDF and dipolar interaction with PVDF verifies that interfacial phenomena could be significant enough in nanocomposites to lead to improvements in final dielectric permittivity of nanocomposite systems and a step forward to resolving the role of interfacial phenomena in dielectric behavior of polymer nanocomposites based on type and surface chemistry of nanoparticles.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10086], "author_name_tesi": "Khodaparast, Payam ", "last_name_ssi": "Khodaparast", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Payam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zoubeida Ounaies", "Michael T Lanagan", "Evangelos Manias", "James Hansell Adair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zoubeida Ounaies, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Evangelos Manias, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer nanocomposite", "dispersion", "dielectric"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "KINETIC MODELING IN GENOME-SCALE METABOLIC MODELS: PARAMETERIZATION AND STRAIN DESIGN", "id": "13690auk241", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13690", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-01-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The emergence of versatile synthetic biology tools for genome editing brings to the forefront the need to a priori predicting the quantitative effect of genetic and/or environmental perturbations on product yield and titer to streamline strain development pipelines. Developing kinetic models of metabolism on a genome-scale that faithfully recapitulate the effect of multiple genetic interventions would be transformative in our ability to reliably design novel overproducing microbial strains. In contrast to stoichiometric-based models, the development of large-scale kinetic models of metabolism has been hindered by the challenge of identifying kinetic parameter values and kinetic rate laws applicable to a wide range of environmental and/or genetic perturbations. The recently introduced ensemble modeling (EM) procedure provides a promising remedy by decomposing metabolic reactions into elementary reaction steps thereby bypassing the need for detailed kinetic expressions for all reactions.\nThe central theme of this dissertation is developing predictive kinetic models of microorganisms using multiple \u201comic\u201d datasets and subsequently leveraging them for strain design. To this end, in Chapter 1 we first review the challenges and recent advances in the construction of kinetic based models of metabolisms. Incorporation of regulatory events at transcription, translation, post-translational, and substrate-levels into the kinetic formalisms are also described along with their associated challenges. In Chapter 2, we describe the EM based systematic procedure that we developed to construct kinetic models of metabolisms by addressing the existing challenges as mentioned above. We used this procedure to construct two kinetic models of E. coli metabolism, namely core kinetic model and k-ecoli457. The core kinetic model encompasses 138 reactions, 93 metabolites, and 60 substrate-level regulatory interactions accounting for glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle, major pyruvate metabolism, anaplerotic reactions, and a number of reactions in other parts of the metabolism. Model parameterization is performed using a machine-learning based genetic-algorithm that minimizes the discrepancies between model predictions and flux measurements for a wild-type and seven knockout mutants under aerobic conditions (25 measured fluxes per mutant). A leave-one-out cross-validation test to evaluate the flux prediction performance of the model showed that metabolic fluxes for the mutants located in the proximity of mutations used for training the model can be predicted more accurately. The prediction performance of the core kinetic model was also tested against multiple experimental datasets such as steady-state metabolite concentrations and experimentally measured Michaelis-Menten constants. In Chapter 3, we describe integration of the core kinetic model into the computational strain design protocol known as k-OptForce. Minimal intervention strategies are identified that improve succinate yield under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions to test the fidelity of model predictions under both genetic and environmental perturbations. In contrast to succinate overproduction under fermentative conditions, k-OptForce predicted interventions that match existing experimental strategies pointing at a number of unexplored flux redirections under aerobic conditions. This study shed light on the importance of condition-specific model parameterization and provides insight onto how to augment kinetic models so as to correctly respond to multiple environmental perturbations. Motivated by these observations, we introduce k-ecoli457 in Chapter 4, a genome-scale kinetic model of E. coli metabolism by expanding both the scope of flux datasets and the complexity of regulatory interactions of the core kinetic model. Model k-ecoli457 contains 457 reactions, 337 metabolites, and 295 substrate-level regulatory interactions while encompassing all flux carrying pathways from iAF1260. Model parameterization is carried out using the machine-learning based procedure by simultaneously imposing all fluxomic datasets for a wild-type and 25 mutant strains for different substrates (glucose, pyruvate, and acetate) and growth (aerobic vs. anaerobic) conditions (30 measured fluxes per mutant). Several analyses such as leave-one-out cross-validation tests and comparing estimated metabolite concentrations and Michaelis\u2013Menten equivalent formalism against experimental datasets were then performed to assess the robustness and performance of the parameterization. In Chapter 5 we discuss how we can leverage the introduced modeling procedure to expand the range of biofuel and bio-renewable molecules using microbial production hosts. We review both in silico and experimental advances in the introduction of non-native pathways in model organisms and the bio-prospecting of non-model organisms with desirable features. Finally, in Chapter 6 we discuss our future perspectives and describe upcoming challenges remain to be addressed in future studies.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13777], "author_name_tesi": "Khodayari, Ali ", "last_name_ssi": "Khodayari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ali", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Costas D.

Using a broadened conceptualization, based on the clarification view (Halliwell, 1986; Nussbaum, 1986; Oatley, 2011), this research proposed a new catharsis theory and tested its hypotheses using narrative media and a 20-minute self-reflection task. A 4-condition controlled experiment was designed to examine and explore catharsis through mediated human drama in two modes: cinematic and text-based. Results showed that the direct effects of catharsis through media exposure and subsequent introspection were weak. Nonetheless, indirect cathartic effects through cinematic human drama were found in the form of improved general health and psychological well-being. These therapeutic effects were mediated by identification with fictional characters, improvements in self-efficacy in regulating sadness, increases in self-compassion, and the use of particular word categories during contemplation. For the latter, the use of greater insight and discrepancy words indirectly predicted better general health and mental well-being, whereas the use of more certainty and causation words marginally deteriorated health and well-being.

Additionally, such devices without anti-inflammatory compounds are less likely to maintain their efficacy due to fibrous encapsulation associated with tissue reaction reducing the effective transfer of signals. Thus, there is considerable incentive to fabricate devices capable of delivering therapeutic compounds while maintaining electrical performance. Polypyrrole (PPy) has gained significant interest for biomedical applications owing to its excellent biocompatibility, electrical properties, and mechanical actuation. Poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) is biodegradable and highly biocompatible, making it an ideal matrix for drug encapsulation. In this research, we have produced hollow PPy cups from template PLGA microspheres on Au electrodes, which were fabricated on Si wafers (two circles with diameters 1.5 and 5.0mm connected with a rectangle 1.0x10mm). Briefly, 4/2wt% PLGA/benzyltriethylammonium chloride was dissolved in chloroform and electrosprayed on the Si electrodes using an applied electrical field of 100kVm-1. PLGA was then coated with PPy/poly (styrenesulfonate) using electrochemical deposition (current density 0.5mA/cm2) for 5 different time durations. The spherical PLGA coated with PPY was then dissolved in chloroform to create hollow PPy cups. These microspherical cups are relatively uniform in size, having average diameters of 3.45\u00b10.31\u00b5m, indicating a CV of 9%. Furthermore, Impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry were performed on all 5 samples and a gold reference to investigate the impedance and charge storage capacity. The size and shape of PPy cups were characterized using Field-Emission SEM. The hollow PPy cups decreased the impedance from 445 \u00b1 63 \u03a9 for bare gold to 354 \u00b1 39 \u03a9 for 8 min PPy-coated electrode, a difference of 20% at 1kHz. The additional surface area obtained by removal of the PLGA cores significantly increased the effective surface area of electrode, thus lowering the impedance.

In conclusion, we successfully demonstrated: (1) electrochemical deposition of PPy around the electrosprayed PLGA microspheres, (2) removal of PLGA microspheres to fabricate hollow PPy cups, and (3) improvement of electrical properties of Au electrodes by decreasing impedance and increasing charge storage capacity.

The interaction is more complex for EOR techniques that rely on mass transfer between phases such as those that occur during miscible gas floods. Accurate estimation of local displacement efficiency is important for successful design of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. Displacement efficiency can be estimated by experimental and computational methods. \nThe dispersion-free displacement efficiency is 100% at a pressure above the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) for gas flooding processes. Slim-tube experiments are one of the most reliable experimental approaches for MMP calculation. Computational methods including simulation, mixing cell and method of characteristics (MOC) solutions rely on accurate EOS fluid characterization. MOC is the fastest and the only solution method which is not affected by dispersion. However, current MOC methods have significant limitations in converging to the correct solution. In addition, the assumptions made in MOC may not be correct for some fluids, which can cause errors as large as 5000 psia in calculated MMPs. Current MOC solutions are simplified by assuming that only shocks connect key tie lines. Likewise the velocity condition cannot be applied directly to the shock-jump approximate approach. These simplifications reduce the computation time but result in decreased reliability of \u201cshock-jump\u201d approximation methods as well. \nWe examined the assumptions of MOC for the case where the two-phase region splits at a critical point. This is referred to hence as bifurcating phase behavior. In this case, the assumption that the non-tie-line eigenvalues change monotonically between two key tie lines is incorrect. The correct solution is constructed for ternary displacements with bifurcating phase behavior by honoring all constraints required for a unique solution \u2013 velocity, mass balance, entropy and solution continuity. The solution is further validated using simulation and the mixing cell method. The simulation results are highly affected by dispersion for some cases such that the results of simulation and analytical solutions match only after using a very large number of grid blocks. \nThe construction of the entire composition route using conventional MOC solutions is very challenging as the number of components increases. The other option is to separate the phase behavior from flow and then solve the tie-lines independent of fractional flow. We examined and developed this approach in detail here. We developed a global Riemann solver for ternary displacements and later extended the splitting technique to multicomponent displacements. Our approach does not suffer from the singularities present in Pires et al. (2006) and Dutra et al. (2009). The solution in tie-line space is constructed for a variety of fluid models including pseudoternary displacements with bifurcating phase behavior, and real fluid displacements (Zick 1986, Metcalfe and Yarborough 1979). Finally the MMP is calculated for several multicomponent (>4) fluids using the analytical solution based solely on solving the continuous tie-line problem, where tie-line rarefactions and shocks can exist in tie-line space. Thus, we eliminate the need for the \u201cshock jump\u201d approximation assumption in determining the MMP. \nThe splitting technique is used to construct analytical solutions for low salinity polymer flooding considering wettability alternation caused by cation exchange reactions. The solutions are validated using numerical simulation and experimental data. The solutions demonstrate that multiple salinity shocks form in low salinity injection and the fast moving salinity shock does not change the surface composition and wettability. In contrast, oil is recovered as a wettability front slowly moves in the reservoir and reduces the residual oil saturation. The wettability front creates an oil bank which will be gradually produced.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11859], "author_name_tesi": "Khorsandi Kouhanestant, Saeid ", "last_name_ssi": "Khorsandi Kouhanestant", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Saeid", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns", "Russell Taylor Johns", "Turgay Ertekin", "Luis F Ayala H", "Wen Shen", "Alberto Bressan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns, Dissertation Advisor", "Russell Taylor Johns, Committee Chair", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Member", "Luis F Ayala H, Committee Member", "Wen Shen, Committee Member", "Alberto Bressan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Enhanced oil recovery", "MMP", "Riemann problem", "Hyperbolic equations", "Method of Characteristics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Extendable chord rotors for helicopter performance improvement and flight envelope expansion ", "id": "15521", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7746", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A helicopter with a fixed geometry rotor, operating at a fixed rotational speed, performs sub-optimally over the vehicle\u2019s flight envelope. On the other hand, if the rotor geometry and RPM can be varied from one flight condition to another, the aircraft performance can be substantially improved over the operating envelope. The geometry change considered in this study is the variation of rotor chord over a spanwise section of the blade. Simulations are based on a UH-60A Blackhawk helicopter with an effective chord increase of 20% realized by extending a Trailing-Edge Plate (TEP) through a slit in the trailing-edge between 63\u201383% blade span. Rigid and elastic blade models are studied. Since TEP extension changes the baseline SC-1094R8 airfoil profile, 2D aerodynamic coefficients of the modified profile from Navier-Stokes CFD calculations are used, coupled with 12x12 dynamic inflow and Leishman-Beddoes dynamic stall model in the Rotorcraft Comprehensive Analysis System (RCAS). From the simulations, reductions of up to nearly 18% in rotor power requirement are observed for operation at high gross weight and altitude.  Further, increases of around 18 kts in maximum speed, 1,500 lbs in maximum gross weight capability, and 1,800 ft in maximum altitude are observed. Moreover, maneuvering flights can benefit from an extended chord. Required power for a steady level turn could be reduced nearly 7% at the maximum turn rate. Vibratory loads also reduce with TEP.

By compiling and comparing data from previous studies involving cofactor switching mutations, we show that their effect cannot be explained as straightforward changes in volume, hydrophobicity, charge, or BLOSUM62 scores of the residues populating the cofactor binding site. Instead, we find that the use of a detailed cofactor binding energy approximation is needed to adequately capture the relative affinity towards different cofactors. The implicit solvation models Generalized Born with molecular volume integration and Generalized Born with simple switching were integrated in the Iterative Protein Redesign and Optimization (IPRO) framework to drive the redesign of Candida boidinii xylose reductase (CbXR) to function using the non-native cofactor NADH. We identified ten variants, out of the 8,000 possible combinations of mutations, that improve the computationally assessed binding affinity for NADH by introducing mutations in the CbXR binding pocket. Experimental testing revealed that seven out of ten possessed significant xylose reductase activity utilizing NADH, with the best experimental design (CbXR-GGD) being 27-fold more active on NADH. The NADPH-dependent activity for eight out of ten predicted designs was either completely abolished or significantly diminished by at least 90%, yielding a greater than 104-fold change in specificity to NADH (CbXR-REG). The remaining two variants (CbXR-RTT and CBXR-EQR) had dual cofactor specificity for both nicotinamide cofactors. The modified IPRO software is available at http://maranas.che.psu.edu. \nIn the second part of this thesis we present the first steps to developing an enzyme design workflow. We first explored whether changes in interaction energy at the ground state or transition state or both as a result of mutations can explain experimental activity. We chose as our test system the cytochrome P450BM-3 monooxygenase to catalyze the hydroxylation of ethane. \nFor the design of this system, first, we had to identify the rate limiting step, and calculate the ground and transition states using quantum mechanical methods. Next, we parameterized these calculated states into the CHARMM forcefield. Thirdly, we explored whether mutations identified by directed evolution always maximize the interaction energy or not. Finally, we systematically selected design positions and explored redesigns via the IPRO algorithm.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2002], "author_name_tesi": "Khoury, George  Adeeb", "last_name_ssi": "Khoury", "middle_name_ssi": "Adeeb", "first_name_ssi": "George ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas", "Costas D Maranas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas, Thesis Advisor", "Costas D Maranas, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["evolution", "protein design", "protein engineering", "computation", "mutagenesis", "cofactor"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Unbridled globalization: The transformation of higher education in Qatar", "id": "16375", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8299", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Qatar is a state that has attempted to develop very quickly since the rise to power in 1995 of Sheikh Hamad Al Thani.

The durability of the CuCl electrolyzer operating for 168 hours while maintaining the high current density of 0.3 A cm-2 under 0.7 V is reported for the first time. The impedance spectra of the cell, along with the polarization curves (V-I data), show the effect of operating temperature and contact pressure at the end plates of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). \nAfter the durability test, the potential required to maintain the cell at 0.3 A cm-2 increased from 630 mV of the fresh membrane electrode assembly (MEA) to 710 mV. The increase in the ohmic resistance of the membrane by 41 % was observed to be the primary cause of degradation. Starting from 0.6 \u2126 cm2, there was a small change in the ohmic resistance of the cell during the first 90 hours, followed by a significant increase of 25 %, and then attained a steady value of 0.85 \u2126 cm2. Simultaneously, a change in the decomposition potential was observed as it increased from 0.18 V in the beginning to 0.25 V at the end of testing. This is mainly due to the decrease in efficiency of the regeneration column and dilution of the anolyte solution over time. Further, the use of EIS in the through-plane conductivity cell proved to be a reliable and time-efficient method for evaluation new and existing membranes before testing in the electrolyzer. \nA liquid metal anode solid oxide fuel cell (LMA-SOFC) is constructed to study the kinetics and transport properties of the system. The behavior of the system is investigated by operating the cell as a metal-air battery while operating under argon, and as a fuel cell with hydrogen and coal as the fuel feeds. EIS signatures and OCP analysis provides insight into the reaction mechanism and indicate the formation of a SnO2 layer at the electrolyte/anode interface. The OCP of 0.885 and 1.117 V was observed for the coal and hydrogen powered fuel cell, respectively. The results show the gradual increase in efficiency of the reduction of SnO2 by using carbon and hydrogen as the fuels. The EIS spectra obtained for the hydrogen fed cell was a characteristic of the diffusion controlled systems and equivalent circuit modeling was used to calculate the oxygen diffusion coefficients.

This\ndeadly disease originates from squamous epithelia in the head and neck region\nand is associated with tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and Human\nPapilloma Virus (HPV) and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infections. HNSCC\ndevelops due to many different genetic aberrations. Loss of p120-catenin\n(P120CTN), a tumor suppressor, is one of such events. P120CTN is\ndownregulated or lost in many cancers of epithelial origin. This loss frequently\ncorrelates with decreased HNSCC patient survival. In addition to P120CTN\ndysregulation, PIK3CA mutations are often found in HNSCC. For the scope of\nthis dissertation we demonstrate two approaches to studying HNSCC. Our first\napproach focuses on a P120CTN-null mouse model and the immune milieu,\nwhile our second approach focuses on the interactions of P120CTN\ndownregulation with the most common oncogene found in HNSCC, mutant\nPIK3CA. We demonstrate that activating PIK3CA mutations cooperate with\nP120CTN in promoting cell migration and invasion.\nDeletion of P120CTN in the mouse oral and esophageal epithelium leads\nto formation of squamous tumors with a concomitant increase in Myeloid-derived\nSuppressor Cells (MDSCs). We have investigated whether a specific subset of\nMDSCs is upregulated in the P120CTN-null mice. Although we observed several \ntrends in our results, we did not identify any significant differences in the subset\nfrequency between P120CTN-null and P120CTN-wild-type mice. We have also\nstudied the effects of epithelial cells on MDSCs in vitro. P120CTN-null epithelial\ncells did not increase MDSC survival, activation or directional migration\ncompared to P120CTN-wild type cells. Finally, we have assayed MDSC counts\nfrom P120CTN-wild-type and P120CTN-null tissues. Previous studies\ndetermined that P120CTN-null organs experience an increase in MDSCs. We\nhave determined that this increase is systemic and can be seen in all of the\ntissues of a P120CTN-null mouse.\nWe have also investigated the cooperation of P120CTN with the most\ncommon oncogene found in HNSCC, PIK3CA. We have utilized two different\nactivating mutations of PIK3CA, E545K and H1047R, to investigate the\ncooperation of PIK3CA and P120CTN on anchorage-independent growth,\nmigration, and invasion. We performed our experiments using two cell lines,\nnormal oral keratinocytes (NOK) and normal esophageal keratinocytes (EPC1).\nWe used cell lines that are as close as possible to normal cells to limit\ninterference from other mutations. Additionally, we have confirmed the findings\nfrom our normal oral keratinocyte cell line in a normal esophageal keratinocyte\ncell lines, the most closely related keratinocyte cell line not derived from tumor\nsamples. We have discovered that P120CTN downregulation and PIK3CA\nmutations cooperate to induce migration and invasion, while only minimally \nincreasing the anchorage-independent growth. P120CTN downregulation and\nPIK3CA mutations increase invasion via increased MMP1 expression. Inhibition\nof MMP1 abrogates the invasion induced by P120CTN downregulation and\nPIK3CA mutations. The in vitro data were confirmed by analyzing The Cancer\nGenome Atlas (TCGA) database of HNSCC tumors.

(c) Imagery strategy: Readers can select an image from a library\nof images that is most representative of the contents of a given section. (d) Reading selfassessment\nor comfort-meter strategy: Readers can mark on a scale of 1-5 how comfortable they\nfeel with their understanding of each section of the instructional unit. (e) Note-taking strategy:\nReaders can take notes on an element-by-element basis\u2014these notes are attached to the elements\nthat make up the instructional unit.\n2. Establish validity and reliability of Web-based measurement instruments that were\ndesigned to measure memory and understanding of the instructional unit on the human heart at\nfour levels of knowledge representation\u2014micro-textbase, macro-textbase, micro-situation model\nand macro-situation model.\niv\n3. On the basis of these measurement instruments, determine whether participants who\nread the instructional unit on the human heart in the Web-based learning environment developed\nbetter memory and understanding of the instructional unit when compared with participants who\nread the same text on a regular Web page.\n4. Develop an understanding of participants\u2019 use of the five reading strategies in the\nWeb-based learning environment and their experience in the Web-based learning environment.\nA design-based research framework guided a series of studies that addressed these\nresearch goals. These studies were conducted in four phases. Findings from each of the first three\nphases of the investigation were used to inform and update the design of the Web-based learning\nenvironment, the Web-based measurement instruments, and the research design of the\nsubsequent phase. The investigation culminated in a large-scale quasi-experimental study.\nSummary of Findings\nIn the Phase I study, participants\u2019 use of the text-macrostructure or chunking strategy was\ninvestigated with the help of an early-stage paper prototype of the Web-based learning\nenvironment. Participants\u2019 organization of the individual elements that made up the instructional\nunit on the human heart into sections, and the labels that participants gave these sections were\nmarkedly different across the six participants who completed this study. This evidence indicated\nthat participants in the study made use of the text-macrostructure strategy to develop unique\nmacro-level representations of the instructional unit on the human heart. Findings from this\nstudy provided support for incorporating the text-macrostructure strategy in the Web-based\nv\nlearning environment. This strategy played a key role in the overall design of the Web-based\nlearning environment.\nIn the Phase II study, Web-based measurement instruments that measured participants\u2019\nknowledge of the instructional unit on the human heart at four levels of knowledge\nrepresentation\u2014micro-textbase, macro-textbase, micro-situation model, and macro-situation\nmodel\u2014were designed and validated. Cronbach\u2019s alpha for scores on the multiple-choice items\non all four Web-based human heart tests was greater than .75. Knowledge of human anatomy\nand spatial ability were treated as possible covariates. The Cronbach\u2019s alpha for scores on the\nknowledge of human anatomy test was .713. On the basis of item-total statistics and the\ndiscrimination index data, two items were identified as being most problematic; one item was\nupdated, the other item was replaced. Reliability for scores on the spatial ability tests could not\nbe calculated because of insufficient data. An implementation of the Damerau-Levenshtein\ndistance (DLD) algorithm was found to be suitable for scoring the \u201crearranging-type\u201d questions\nin the macro-textbase and macro-situation model tests. Given the high correlations between\nscores on the Web-based human heart tests, the knowledge of the human anatomy test, and the\npaper-folding test, it was determined that there would be an advantage to using scores on the\nknowledge of human anatomy and paper-folding tests as covariates in studies in the subsequent\nphases. Technology used to develop the measurement instruments (implementation of the\nautocomplete design-pattern, drag-and-drop, and AJAX) and online delivery of measurement\ninstruments was tested; bugs that were identified were fixed. The Web-based measurement\ninstruments developed in this study were used in the subsequent phases of the investigation.\nParticipants in the Phase III study read the instructional unit on the human heart in the\nWeb-based learning environment. Participants engaged deeply with the reading task in the Webvi\nbased learning environment spending nearly twice as much time reading when compared with\nparticipants in the Phase II study who read the instructional unit on the human heart on a regular\nWeb page. An animated demonstration that provided participants an overview of the user\ninterface of the Web-based learning environment was prepared and tested. Feedback questions\nrelated to participants\u2019 experience in the Web-based learning environment and the Web-based\nmeasurement instruments were prepared and tested. On the basis of data collected from\ninterviews with participants, responses to the feedback survey, think-aloud and video data,\nnumerous updates were made to the user interface and the design of the reading strategies in the\nWeb-based learning environment.\nOn the basis of observations in the Phase III studies, a decision was made to develop two\nvariants of the animated demonstration for the Web-based learning environment. The first\ndemonstration was similar to the demonstration used in the Phase III studies. The objective of\nthis demonstration was to provide participants an orientation of the user interface of the Webbased\nlearning environment. In addition to providing participants an orientation of the user\ninterface of the Web-based learning environment, the second demonstration provided explicit\ninstruction on the five reading strategies.\nThe Phase IV study investigated the impact of the Web-based learning environment on\nreaders\u2019 memory and understanding of an instructional unit on the human heart. Two levels of\nthe independent variable\u2014the Web-based learning environment\u2014were set up: (a) Web-based\nlearning environment with demonstration that did not include explicit instruction on the reading\nstrategies (T1); and (b) Web-based learning environment with demonstration that included\nexplicit instruction on the reading strategies (T2). In the control condition participants read the\ninstructional unit on the human heart on a regular Web page. The six dependent variables in the\nvii\nstudy included scores on four tests that measured participants\u2019 memory and understanding of the\ninstructional unit on the human heart (micro-textbase, macro-textbase, micro-situation model,\nand macro-situation model), time spent reading the instructional unit on the human heart, and the\ntime spent responding to test questions. Six research questions were pursued: (a) Did the Webbased\nlearning environment help participants develop better memory (micro-textbase and macrotextbase)\nof the instructional unit on the human heart, and was there an effect of the explicit\ninstruction on reading strategies? (b) Did the Web-based learning environment help participants\ndevelop better understanding (micro-situation model and macro-situation model) of the\ninstructional unit on the human heart, and was there an effect of the explicit instruction on\nreading strategies? (c) Did participants in the three experimental conditions spend equal amount\nof time reading the instructional unit on the human heart? (d) Did participants in the three\nexperimental conditions spend equal amount of time responding to Web-based human heart\ntests? (e) How did participants use the five reading strategies in the Web-based learning\nenvironment and what was their experience in the Web-based learning environment? (f) What\nwas participants\u2019 experience with the Web-based human heart tests?\nParticipants in the Web-based learning environment group with demonstration that\nincluded explicit instructions on the reading strategies (T2) performed significantly better (p <\n.10) than participants in the control group on the macro-textbase, micro-situation model, and\nmacro-situation model tests (p = .076, p = .079, and p = .012 respectively). There was no\ndifference in performance on the micro-textbase test (p = .274). Performance of participants in\nthe Web-based learning environment group with demonstration that did not include explicit\ninstructions on the reading strategies (T1) was unexpected; they scored lower than participants in\nthe control group on all four tests.\nviii\nParticipants in the two Web-based learning environment conditions (T1 and T2) spent\nnearly twice as much time reading the instructional unit on the human heart when compared with\nparticipants in the control group who read the instructional unit on the human heart on a regular\nWeb page (p = .000 and p = .000 respectively).\nParticipants in the Web-based learning environment group with demonstration that did\nnot include explicit instructions on the reading strategies (T1) spent significantly less time\nresponding to questions on the Web-based human heart tests when compared with participants in\nthe control group and the Web-based learning environment group with demonstration that\nincluded explicit instructions on the reading strategies (T2) (p = .001 and p = .001 respectively).\nFeedback from participants in the Web-based learning environment groups indicated that\nthey engaged deeply with the instructional text in the Web-based learning environment; many of\nthe participants were able to use the five reading strategies effectively, several participants\nthought that they benefited from using these reading strategies. Overall, 87% of the participants\nnoted that they had a favorable experience in the Web-based learning environment. There was a\nsignificant difference between the Web-based learning environment group with demonstration\nthat did not include explicit instructions on the reading strategies (T1) and the Web-based\nlearning environment group with demonstration that included explicit instructions on the reading\nstrategies (T2) [\u03c72 (1, N = 353) = 8.10, p = .004]; 93% of the participants in Treatment 2 (T2)\nvoted favorably, as compared to 83% of the participants in Treatment 1 (T1). Furthermore, 89%\nof the participants in Treatment 2 (T2) noted that they would have liked to use the Web-based\nlearning environment in the following semester. In comparison, this percentage was only 75%\nfor participants in Treatment 1 (T1). This difference was statistically significant [\u03c72 (1, N = 351)\n= 13.88, p = .000].\nix\nOverall, 82% of the participants found the experience of responding to questions on the\nWeb-based human heart tests to be favorable. There was a significant difference between the\nthree experimental groups [\u03c72 (2, N = 545) = 16.62, p = .000]. Participants in the control group\nand the Web-based learning environment group with demonstration that included explicit\ninstructions on the reading strategies (T2) rated their experience to be more positive (89%, 84%\nrespectively) than participants in the Web-based learning environment group with demonstration\nthat did not include explicit instructions on the reading strategies (T1) (73%).\nReading comprehension is contingent upon the successful execution of a series of\ncognitive and metacognitive processes. The reading strategies in the Web-based learning\nenvironment support a subset of these comprehension processes. Findings from this research\nstand to inform our understanding of these comprehension processes, and ways in which\naffordances of current Web technologies can be used to design compelling reading environments\nand assessments that measure learning that occurs in these environments. The Web-based\nlearning environment also has potential for impacting the practice of reading strategies\ninstruction.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3411], "author_name_tesi": "Kidwai, Khusro ", "last_name_ssi": "Kidwai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Khusro", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara L Grabowski", "Dr Grabowski", "Dr Dwyer", "Dr Van Meter", "Dr Hoadley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara L Grabowski, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Grabowski, Committee Chair", "Dr Dwyer, Committee Member", "Dr Van Meter, Committee Member", "Dr Hoadley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Learning Environment"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EFFICIENT WEB SERVICE COMPOSITION: FROM SIGNATURE-LEVEL TO BEHAVIORAL DESCRIPTION-LEVEL", "id": "11469", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2280", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Web services are software systems designed to support machine-to-machine inter-operation over the Web. Many researches have been carried out for the web service standards, and these efforts have signi\fcantly improved exible and dynamic functionality of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) in the current web services. However, there still remain a number of research challenges one of which is the web service composition (WSC) problem|when a single web service does not satisfy a given requirement, one wants to automatically combine web services to satisfy the requirement entirely. In this dissertation, we tackle this WSC problem in three\nlevels, i.e., a signature level, a behavior description level and a QoS description level based on the web service descriptions.\n  For a signature-level approach where each web service is described with its signature in WSDL, we first analyze the topological landscape of the web service networks formed by real-world web services based on graph theory. We then propose a SAT-based algorithm based on the analysis.\n  Since web service composition based on signatures has a limitation due to a lack of information provided by a WSDL signature, we need additional information, e.g., a semantic annotation of data and/or a behavioral description of a web service function. Focusing on the latter one, we first define a realistic model for the WSC problem on behavioral descriptions, and investigate the computational complexities for the composition of web services on restricted (i.e., with full observation) and\ngeneral cases (i.e., with partial observation). We then prove that the WSC problem with full observation is EXP-hard and the WSC problem with partial observation is 2-EXP-hard. To solve these high complexities, we propose approximation-based algorithms using abstraction and refinement. \n  The previous two approaches consider only functional requirements specified WSDL or BPEL. However, non-functional ones, such as Quality of Services (QoS)constraints help clients to select a service provider with good quality. In this case, the main aim of the WSC problem is to find a composite web service which satisfies a given complicated task with the optimal accumulated QoS value, which is called QoS-aware WSC problem. We first propose applying anytime algorithm based on beam stack search to the QoS-aware WSC problem. Moreover, to improve the\nbasic anytime algorithm, we propose dynamic beam width with more heuristics, i.e., short backtracking and upper bound propagation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2260], "author_name_tesi": "Kil, Hyunyoung ", "last_name_ssi": "Kil", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyunyoung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee", "Dongwon Lee", "Soundar R.

The use of high-density EEG may allow unique insight into the complexity of mothers\u2019 in-the-moment responses to their infants and emotional/motivational processes that can undermine competent parenting.  The present study examined the links between frontal EEG alpha asymmetry as a trait measure (baseline condition), state measure (experimental conditions), and an index of ones capacity for emotional responding (shift in asymmetry from a baseline to an experimental condition) and maternal responsiveness.  During continuous a EEG recording, mothers viewed videos of their own infants expressing joy, anger/distress, and neutral interest.  Maternal responsiveness was conceptualized as self-reported experienced emotions in response to infant emotion displays, self-reported anxious and depressive symptoms, and observed emotional availability during mother-infant free-play interaction.  Greater relative right frontal activity at baseline was associated with greater reported anxiety, but was unrelated to maternal responsiveness.  Limited relations emerged between frontal EEG alpha asymmetry during the experimental conditions (infant emotion videos) and maternal responsiveness.  However, a shift toward greater relative right frontal activation was associated with maternal experience of sadness, concern, irritability, and a lack of joy in response to seeing ones own infant in distress, along with lower anxiety and adaptive parenting behaviors.  These findings are suggestive of an empathetic maternal response.  The shift in frontal EEG alpha asymmetry was driven by a decrease in left frontal activation from a baseline condition to the onset of the infant emotion videos.

The addition of a small amount of water to chocolate in a controlled manner provides the potential for increased heat resistance through the formation of an internal sugar skeleton that maintains the structural integrity of chocolate at higher temperatures.  Water-in-oil emulsions are one way to deliver this water.\n\n\tThe overall goal of this work was to determine if water-in-oil emulsions produced via a lab-scale cross flow membrane emulsification system are suitable for use in the production of heat resistant chocolate products.  In order to accomplish this goal, 30% water-in-soybean oil emulsions were produced with different ingredients in the dispersed or continuous phases as well as under different processing conditions.  The droplet size distributions of the resultant emulsions were examined both initially and over time.  The results from this investigation were used to produce stable and unstable emulsions which were then added to dispersions of sugar crystals in oil which were then cooled to crystallize the fat and form a model chocolate.  Samples prepared in this manner were compared to samples made with the direct addition of unemulsified water in order to determine the impact of different modes of water addition on the formation of a sugar skeleton and melt resistance in the product.\n\n\tAnalysis of emulsion droplet size distributions showed that polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) was a more effective emulsifier than either soya lecithin or a 50:50 PGPR:lecithin blend at concentrations of 1 to 6 % (w/w; with respect to the continuous phase).  At 2% emulsifier, PGPR-stabilized emulsions remained stable over a period of 4 weeks (d = 22 &#956;m) while lecithin-stabilized emulsions nearly doubled in droplet size over 6 hours (d = 43 to 77 &#956;m) and blend-stabilized emulsions completely destabilized within 3 hours (initially d = 68 &#956;m).  Water droplet size decreased with increasing concentration of the emulsifiers used.  Emulsion droplet size and size distribution were also significantly affected by the use of different membranes.  Decreasing the continuous phase flow rate (95.3 to 64.2 g/sec) resulted in larger droplets (d = 22 to 33 &#956;m) and increasing the dispersed phase flow rate (0.6 to 1.1 g/sec) also resulted in larger droplets (d = 22 to 42&#956;m).  The addition of a gelling agent (2% &#954;-carrageenan) to the dispersed phase prior to emulsification made it more difficult to produce stable emulsions.\n\t\n\tA stable (2% PGPR-stabilized) and unstable (2% lecithin-stabilized) emulsion (30% water-in-soybean oil) were selected from the first portion of this work and 2 g were added to 120 g of a sugar-in-molten confectionery coating fat (CCF) dispersion (50% sucrose) and cooled to produce model chocolate samples.  These samples were compared to samples with water added directly and control samples prepared without added water.  Microscopy of sugar-in-oil dispersions in the presence of water-in-oil emulsions provided evidence for the formation of sugar aggregates formed by the adsorption of water at the capillaries between hydrophilic surfaces and resultant interparticle capillary forces.  The effect of the presence of such structures was examined within the model chocolate samples.  A quantitative test was developed in which samples on mesh stages were immersed in hexane.  The hexane dissolved the solid fat component and any sugar not incorporated in the sugar skeleton fell through the mesh.  Results showed that addition of water in any form to the samples produced a significant sugar skeleton (44 to 47% out of the total 49.2% sucrose in the original sample) while control samples prepared without added water had no skeleton and almost no sugar was retained on the mesh (0.4% out of the total 49.2% sucrose in the original sample).  Since the presence of a sugar skeleton alone does not signify heat resistance, a meltability test was also developed.  Samples were placed in an oven at 50 \u00b0C for 20 minutes and the change in height and the spread area were measured.  Samples with water added via emulsions decreased in height by approximately 12% while samples with unemulsified water decreased by 41% and control samples decreased by 60%.  Samples with stable emulsions added were able to contain the melted fat better than samples with unstable emulsions added resulting in areas of spread of 10.5 and 14.4 cm2 respectively.\n\t\nThis study showed that water-in-oil emulsions produced by cross flow membrane emulsification and added to model chocolate are effective in producing samples with increased heat resistance conferred through the formation of a sugar skeleton.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3699], "author_name_tesi": "Killian, Lauren Bantz Ashworth", "last_name_ssi": "Killian", "middle_name_ssi": "Bantz Ashworth", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Neil Coupland", "John Neil Coupland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Neil Coupland, Thesis Advisor", "John Neil Coupland, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["water-in-oil", "emulsions", "chocolate", "heat resistant"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Extending Vulnerability Discovery with Fuzzing and Symbolic Execution to Realistic Applications", "id": "14016eyk5120", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14016", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In 2016, DARPA held the Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) using a special execution and evaluation environment to compare the results of different techniques in automated vulnerability discovery.

Of interest to leaders of DCoPs is that the SRRs affected members\u2019 differentially, based on their level of experience.  Among members with low levels of experience, the presence of the SRRs in content decreased their expressed willingness to contribute their own content.  Among members with high levels of experience, exposure to the SRRs in content related positively with their expressed willingness to contribute. In this way, the presence of SRRs in content appears to foster an epistemology in DCoPs that values contributions from the most experienced practitioners.

This modification functionally influences membrane targeting, protein conformational state, complex formation and protein-protein interactions. Palmitoylation is a rapidly reversible and dynamically regulated post-translational modification that affects the function or localization of many neuronal proteins including GABAA receptors (GABAARs). \n GABAARs are heteropentameric chloride channels responsible for mediating phasic inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain.  The \u03b32 subunit of GABAARs is critically important for trafficking of these receptors to the synapse and for normal GABAergic synaptic transmission.  GABAAR \u03b32 heterozygous knockout mice have moderate functional deficits in GABAergic neurotransmission that result in behavioral and other alterations that are analogous to depression in humans.  Diverse post-translational modifications of the \u03b32 subunit intracellular loop affect the membrane dynamics of GABAARs and therefore the function of inhibitory synapses.  The \u03b32 subunit is subject to palmitoylation by Golgi-specific DHHC-type zinc finger protein (GODZ, DHHC3) and its paralog, Sertoli cell gene with a zinc finger domain (SERZ-\u03b2, DHHC7).  Knockdown of GODZ by shRNA or a dominant negative construct indicated that GODZ-mediated palmitoylation regulates the accumulation of GABAARs at synapses, as well as GABAergic innervation.  Neurons derived from GODZ knock-out (KO) and GODZ/SERZ-\u03b2 double KO mice grown in co-culture with wild-type (WT) neurons, exhibit a loss of punctate immunostaining for presynaptic glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and postsynaptic \u03b32 indicating a loss of GABAergic innervation.  The loss of synapses could potentially be a result of GODZ palmitoylating other proteins involved in synapse formation and maintenance such as the postsynaptic adhesion molecule, neuroligin 2 (NL2).  \nThe main objective of this dissertation was to further elucidate the mechanism by which GODZ-mediated palmitoylation controls GABAergic inhibition in vivo, by utilizing GODZ KO mice.  I screened for candidate novel substrates of GODZ using a combined acyl-biotin exchange assay and quantitative proteomics with isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approach.  Proteomic analyses of putative palmitoylated proteins revealed that there were a wide variety of proteins that were differentially palmitoylated or expressed in brain tissue of WT compared to GODZ KO mice.  This result is consistent with previous evidence that GODZ has broad substrate specificity.  Through proteomics, growth associated protein (GAP-43) was identified as a palmitoylated protein that is less abundant or less palmitoylated in brain of KO compared to WT mice.  We confirmed that GAP-43 could be palmitoylated by GODZ in transfected HEK 293T cells. Moreover, steady state palmitoylation of the \u03b32 subunit and GAP-43 was significantly reduced in brain extracts of GODZ KO vs. WT mice, thereby identifying both proteins as important substrates of GODZ in vivo.  In contrast, palmitoylation of PSD-95, which can be palmitoylated by GODZ in transfected HEK 293T cells, was unaffected.  \nThe next objective was to assess the precise localization of GODZ in the Golgi apparatus using cis- and trans-Golgi markers in HEK 293T cells to gain further insights into the subcellular role of GODZ-mediated palmitoylation.  GODZ was more strongly associated with the cis- than with the trans-Golgi network, suggesting a role in controlling the exit of substrate proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi. In addition to Golgi membranes in the soma, GODZ was also found localized to Golgi outposts in dendrites.  These results suggest that GODZ-mediated palmitoylation occurs on de novo synthesized proteins and contributes to trafficking of its substrates from the ER to the Golgi complex.  \nFinally, synaptic deficits seen in GODZ KO neurons could also be explained by the loss of NL2 palmitoylation.  NL2 is localized preferentially to inhibitory synapses where it is important for synapse maturation. Moreover, knockdown of NL2 leads to defects in inhibitory synapse formation similar to those of GODZ KO neurons where deficits are only seen selectively when mutant neurons compete with WT neurons.  Indeed, we find that GODZ and SERZ-\u03b2 can palmitoylate NL2 in transfected HEK 293T cells.  However, we could not ascertain a measurable difference in NL2 palmitoylation between WT and GODZ KO mice.  A screen of the 23-member DHHC family of PATs in transfected HEK 293T cells identified GODZ and SERZ-\u03b2 as two of several PATs that can act on NL2.  A unique Cys residue (C710) present in the cytoplasmic domain of NL2 but is absent in the other neuroligin isoforms has been identified as the primary site of palmitoylation by site directed mutagenesis.  Palmitoylated NL2 was observed in cultured neurons and in the cerebellum of transgenic Histidine-Flag-YFP-NL2 tagged mice.  Native NL2 is likely to be palmitoylated as the protein was detected in the proteomics screen of palmitoylated proteins.  Both putative palmitoylation sites of NL2 are also subject to nitrosylation, a potential competitive post-translational modification.  Nitrosylated NL2 was also isolated from whole brain extracts.  These results suggest the interplay between palmitoylation and nitrosylation of NL2 likely influences the synaptic localization of NL2 and could contribute to the GABAergic synaptic deficits seen in GODZ KO mice.     \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11744], "author_name_tesi": "Kilpatrick, Casey Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Kilpatrick", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Casey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher", "Bernhard Luscher", "Melissa Rolls", "Curtis John Omiecinski", "Yanming Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher, Dissertation Advisor", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Chair", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Member", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Special Member", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["GODZ", "palmitoylation", "GABA"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Signal-Based Approach To an Instrument Driver System\n\n", "id": "9292", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3357", "abstract_tesi": "Although automated test equipment standards have improved substantially since as recently as the early 1990s, the standards have not reached the point where instrument models are interchangeable.

Competent parents promote a balance of social connectedness (including parent-child attachment) and self-regulation (including emotion regulation) as developmentally appropriate in their children (Baumrind, 1996; Darling & Steinberg, 1993). Understanding parenting quality and how it relates to child social and emotional outcomes is essential in light of the important implications that these outcomes have for children\u2019s adjustment in larger society. \nThe first aim of the present dissertation was to better understand the factors that influence parenting quality, the relations between parenting quality and child social-emotional outcomes, and the role of child characteristics in both parenting and child outcomes during the first two years of life. The second aim was to extend the parenting literature in several ways: to examine parenting quality through the lens of emotional availability (EA), to assess mothers\u2019 EA from video recordings of mother-infant interactions during the less-studied context of infant bedtimes, and to consider contributions of infant temperament (including surgency, negative affectivity, and orienting/regulation) to EA and its links to infant social-emotional outcomes. Data for the three studies was drawn from a larger NIH-funded study of 167 children and their families.\nStudy 1 examined mothers\u2019 depressive symptoms, coparenting quality, maternal and infant sleep, and infant temperament during infants\u2019 first 6 months as predictors of mothers\u2019 EA at bedtime with their infants at 9 months. Whereas mother-reported coparenting quality was both directly and indirectly predictive of EA, changes in depressive symptoms during the first 6 months only predicted lower EA when infants were temperamentally highly surgent. \nIn Study 2, trajectories of mothers\u2019 bedtime EA across five time points (1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months) during the infant\u2019s first year were examined as predictors of infant attachment security at 12 months. Infant temperamental reactivity was also included as a potential moderator. Two maternal EA trajectory types, one that was consistently high and another that was consistently low, were identified and found to predict infant attachment security. In addition, infant temperamental surgency/extraversion moderated the relation between EA trajectories and infant attachment security such that highly surgent infants of mothers showing a low EA trajectory had the lowest attachment security at the end of the first year.\nStudy 3 examined the influences of mothers\u2019 EA towards their infants during bedtime, infant attachment security, and interactions between bedtime parenting and attachment with infant temperamental reactivity, on infants\u2019 emotion regulation strategy use at 12 and 18 months. Whereas EA was not directly related to infants\u2019 emotion regulation strategies, infant attachment security had direct relations with infants\u2019 orienting towards the environment and tension reduction behaviors. Both maternal EA and infant attachment security were particularly important in the use of less-adaptive strategies for infants high on negative affectivity. \nIn conclusion, the results of the studies indicate the significant relations between mothers\u2019 psychosocial resources and mothers\u2019 parenting quality, parenting quality across the first year and infant attachment security, secure attachment and infants\u2019 more adaptive emotion regulation, as well as the significant role of infant reactive temperament in all of these relations.

Chapter 2 then analyzes market exchange versus vertical integration in the simplest environment: one composed of homogeneous upstream and downstream firms. In this setting, we assume that firms can enter the industry as either independent or vertically integrated. An upstream asset --- including one within a vertically integrated arrangement --- cannot produce every type of widget that may be required by a given downstream asset.  This may force even vertically integrated firms to search for widgets produced by independent upstream firms.  In contrast to other papers in the literature, we show that independent and integrated firms can co-exist in a non-knife-edge equilibrium.<br>\n\n<p>\nIn Chapter 3 we then extend the simple model presented in Chapter 2 to allow for asset trading -- i.e., takeovers -- between independent upstream and downstream firms.

For extrapolations, it is assumed that evidence from one set of data can be generalized to another set. Because past behavior is a good predictor of future behavior, extrapolation is appealing. It is also appealing in that it is objective, replicable, and inexpensive. This makes it a useful approach when one needs many short-term forecasts.\nUsing neural networks to make forecasts is controversial. One major limitation of neural nets is that one must rely on the data to lead him to the proper model. Also neural nets are more complex than many of the older time-series methods. The method is similar to stepwise regression, an earlier method in which the analyst depends on the data to produce a model. \nAs it stands now, there is no universal method of solving a general extrapolation problem. As a matter of fact, there is no consensus of opinion concerning whether the general extrapolation problem is a mathematically well-posed problem. It is a central contention of this proposal that if the extrapolation problem carries with it a group-like property, extrapolation is possible. It is a second central contention of this proposal, that if extrapolation is possible, the mechanics involve developing a linkage between the extrapolating object and the extrapolating agent.\nIn this thesis project we focus on an investigation of a mathematical approach to extrapolation, using a combination of a modified neural network architecture and semigroup theory. Semigroup theory provides a unified and powerful tool for the study of differential equations on abstract spaces, covering systems described by ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, functional differential equations and combinations thereof. The target of this investigation will be the prediction (by way of extrapolation) of the temperatures within the boiler facility of a power plant. Given a set of empirical data with no analytic expression, we first develop an analytic model and then extend that model along a single axis. In this thesis, the empirical data set can be composed of experimental data or simulated data. For applications to control systems, estimation techniques are often required to compensate for an inadequate amount of data, arising from the unavailability of that data. Classical methods such as the Kalman filter have the major drawback of needing a model as their basis; the method being proposed requires no such model.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [855], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Byounghee ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Byounghee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kwang Yun Lee", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Shizhuo Yin", "Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kwang Yun Lee, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Semigroup Theory", "neural networks", "Extrapolation"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Development of Macrosegregation During Solidification of Binary Metal Alloys\n", "id": "6007", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "858", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tA combined experimental and theoretical study of the convective transport phenomena during the solidification of a binary metal alloy is performed.

The aim of this project is to simulate an electrostatic ion thruster operating in a cone-jet mode and to characterize its performance under several different operating conditions.  Liquid gallium at 320 K was modeled as the liquid metal ionic source using a modified Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential, which takes account of the effect of electrons.  The potential model was confirmed by finding the radial distribution function that matches the experimental value.  For EMIM-BF4 the coarse-graining potential model was used instead of the all-atomic potential model in order to lessen the computational cost.  The platinum capillary was simulated by a three-zone wall model with a Langevin thermostat capable of controlling the heat transfer between liquid ionic sources and the platinum capillary.  To study the effect of the wettability between liquid ionic sources and the platinum wall, the interaction potential was approximately modeled based on the Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential.  This potential model has factors to control the strength of the attractive and the repulsive interaction between liquid atoms and platinum atoms.  The flow rate of liquid ionic sources in the platinum capillary, the critical variable for the stable current jet, was generated by the FPM (Fluidized Piston Method) method.  To investigate the motion of an ion jet in the long term, it is necessary to supply the platinum capillary with liquid atoms continuously without physical violations.  To do this, the creation part of the Grand canonical ensemble (&#956;VT) in Monte Carlo was employed.

The variations studied in this research are the inner radius of the extraction ring, the operation voltage, the separation between the two electrodes, the flow rate, the wettability, and the temperature of the platinum capillary.  The results are presented in terms of the total current and the current density and the average velocity of liquid ions passing through the extraction ring. The comparison with Child\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s law and scaling laws shows that this simulation is valid.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12782], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, DaeYong ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "DaeYong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael M.

In the case of multicomponent materials such as Ni base superalloys, it is very important to understand the effect of each alloying element on the phase stability and mechanical properties of the system. For last few decades, a thermodynamic modeling technique, known as the CALPHAD method (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams), has shown to be a reliable approach in calculating phase equilibria, stability and transformation in multicomponent system. At the same time, the first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory has demonstrated that it can predict the thermodynamic and mechanical properties comparable with experimental data. The first-principles calculation can also provide quantitative inputs in the CALPHAD modeling when the experimental thermochemical data is scarce. \nIn this dissertation, the integrated CALPHAD and first-principles calculations approach is used to study the thermodynamic, elastic and thermal expansion properties of Ni base alloys, focusing on &#947;+&#947;&#61602; phases in the Ni-Al-Cr-Hf-Pt system. The available constituent binary and ternary systems in the literature are carefully reviewed and selected to combine into the quinary system. The binary systems should be well developed since binary interactions are dominant in a higher order multicomponent system. From the review of the all constituent binary system, it is found that the Al-Pt system should be remodeled since existing thermodynamic database did not include the AlPt2 and &#61538; phases and the disordered fcc_A1 phase and the ordered fcc phase(L12-AlPt3) were modeled using two different Gibbs energy functions with a two-sublattice model for the ordered fcc phase, which is not consistent with other binary systems. In this work, the AlPt2 and &#61538; phases are added according to new experimental observations and the four-sublattice compound energy formalism is applied to describe the ordered fcc phase, which gives the consistency with other constituent binary systems. The enthalpies of mixing of the fcc, bcc, B2 and L12 phases are calculated from the first-principles calculations using special quasirandom structures (SQS) and used to evaluate model parameters of the corresponding phases since there is no available experimental data. Then, the Ni-Al-Pt ternary system is remodeled by combining the updated Al-Pt system and other two sub-binary systems (Ni-Al and Ni-Pt) from the literature. The first-principles calculations using ternary SQS are performed to calculate the enthalpies of mixing for the fcc, bcc, B2 and L12 phases, and through this approach the challenge of scarce experimental thermochemical data for the ternary solid solution phases can be overcome. The thermodynamic database of the Ni-Al-Cr-Hf-Pt system is generated by combining the remodeled Al-Pt and Ni-Al-Pt system with the other constituent binary and ternary systems in the literature.\nApart from the highlighting the development of the thermodynamic database of the Ni-Al-Cr-Hf-Pt system, the dissertation also gives an understanding of the influence of alloying elements on the elastic and thermal expansion properties of Ni and Ni3Al alloys based on the first-principles calculations. The alloying element of Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hf, Mo, Nb, Pt, Re, Ta, Ti, W, Y and Zr are considered for elastic properties of Ni alloys, and Al, Cr, Hf, Pt, Y and Zr are selected for elastic properties of Ni3Al alloys and thermal expansion properties of Ni and Ni3Al alloys. The efficient strain-stress method is used to predict the elastic properties of the Ni base alloys by the resultant change of stress due to the applied strain. The calculated elastic constants are correlated to ductility, solid solution strengthening and elastic anisotropy, thus providing a better understanding of the mechanical properties of Ni alloys with alloying elements. The effect of each element on the elastic properties is analyzed in terms of the volume change, electron density and alloying element\u2019s elastic properties, and the elastic constant change rates of the alloying element are obtained. \nThe first-principles quasiharmonic approach is used to investigate the effect of alloying element on the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of &#947;-Ni and &#947;\u2019-Ni3Al phases. The Helmholtz free energy as function of volume and temperature is used to estimate the finite temperature thermodynamic properties, including the 0K static energy, vibrational and thermal electronic contributions. The static energy at 0K is obtained by fitting the energy vs. volume data points with the four parameters Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. The vibrational contribution is estimated from Debye model for the sake of the efficiency and simplicity. The validity of Debye model is carefully tested for both Ni and Ni3Al by comparing the results with experiments and phonon calculation results. The change rates of the coefficients of thermal expansion due to the alloying element at elevated temperatures in &#947;-Ni and &#947;\u2019-Ni3Al phases are obtained. \nBy combining the obtained elastic constant and CTE change rates from the first-principles calculations with the thermodynamic properties such as mole fraction, site fraction and phase fraction of an alloy calculated from thermodynamic databases, the elastic constant and CTE for Ni base alloys consisting of &#947; and &#947;\u00b4 phases is predicted. The methodology and results presented in the dissertation provide a better understanding of the mechanical properties of &#947; and &#947;&#8242; phases of Ni base alloys and can also be a bench mark to study the same properties not only for other phases in Ni base alloys but also for other alloy systems with different major element, for example, Al base alloys.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1582], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, DongEung ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "DongEung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu", "Zi Kui Liu", "Long Qing Chen", "Digby D Macdonald", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Digby D Macdonald, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermodynamic modeling", "Ni-base superalloys", "elastic property", "thermal expansion property"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Regulatory mechanisms of G protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) signaling at follicle selection in the hen ovary", "id": "20048", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9365", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In vertebrate species that ovulate a species-specific number of eggs each ovulation cycle, ovarian follicles undergo a process of selection for further development and final maturation prior to ovulation. Subsequent to follicle selection, ovarian follicles mature into preovulatory follicles and are eventually ovulated. In monovulatory vertebrate species, which maintain reproductive cycles, only one follicle from the limited growing follicle population is typically selected for fertilization. Ovarian follicle selection is largely dependent upon the transition of granulosa cells (GCs) from an undifferentiated to a fully differentiated state, which accompanies the morphological and functional changes that initiate follicle development. In both mammals and birds, it has been well established that GC differentiation during follicle development is dependent upon gonadotropin-responsiveness (e.g. initially follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)- and subsequently luteinizing hormone (LH)-responsiveness). In the hen ovary, the selection of a single follicle each day occurs from a small cohort of prehierarchal follicles measuring 6-8 mm in diameter. To date, considerable research has been focused on identifying the role of growth factors or the signaling pathways in granulosa cells to understand the principle of follicle selection. Nonetheless, the ultimate signals responsible for cellular events which result in a single follicle being selected have yet to be demonstrated in any vertebrate.\nThe present studies were conducted to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling to better understand mechanisms that initiate the differentiation of GCs at follicle selection in the hen ovary. It is hypothesized that prior to follicle selection, FSH receptor (FSHR) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptors (VPAC-1 and -2) are desensitized by a \u03b2ARRESTIN-mediated event in undifferentiated GCs. Additionally, it is proposed that receptor-desensitization is maintained and/or promoted by inhibitory mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Therefore, at follicle selection, actively\niv\ndifferentiating GCs are able to acquire receptor-responsiveness due to reduced MAPK signaling, that results in inducing cyclic 3,5-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-induced signaling. Finally, the present studies demonstrate that the acquisition of receptor-responsiveness initiates GC differentiation by promoting cAMP-induced steroidogenesis, clock gene expression, and angiogenesis.\nUndifferentiated GCs from hen prehierarchal follicles failed to initiate signaling via cyclic 3,5-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) following a 3-4 h challenge with recombinant human (rh)FSH (10 ng/ml) and chicken (ch)VIP (1 \u03bcM), despite the finding that undifferentiated GCs from prehierarchal follicles express FSHR mRNA and FSHR protein plus VPAC1/2 mRNA during follicle development. In addition, these cells demonstrated an inability to induce steroidogenic acute regulatory (STAR) protein expression and progesterone production due to the absence of GPCR-mediated cAMP formation. Specifically, knockdown studies using small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for Gallus \u03b2ARRESTIN1 revealed that reduced \u03b2ARRESTIN expression in undifferentiated GCs results in increased cAMP formation, STAR protein expression, progesterone production following a rhFSH or chVIP treatment compared to cells transfected with non-targeting (scrambled) siRNA. Furthermore, co-transfection of bovine \u03b2ARRESTIN and GPCR kinase 2 (GRK2) constructs in actively differentiating GCs significantly decreased cAMP and progesterone production following a 3 h rhFSH treatment.\nIn chickens, VIP, unlike the unchanging concentrations of circulating of FSH, is rhythmically expressed within the hypothalamus during a photo-induced reproductive cycle [1, 2]. Accordingly, it was hypothesized that immediately subsequent to follicle selection in the hen, VIP derived from a neuronal and/or humoral origin can serve to regulate expression of clock genes within the GC layer. Significantly, it was determined that cAMP-induced clock gene expression was not initiated by a 4 h challenge with chVIP (1 \u03bcM) in undifferentiated GCs. Using \u03b2ARRESTIN1-siRNA, it was confirmed that undifferentiated GCs with reduced levels of\nv\n\u03b2ARRESTIN became competent to respond to chVIP, which resulted in increasing cAMP-dependent BRAIN AND MUSCLE ARNT-LIKE PROTEIN 1 (BMAL1) gene expression. Finally, BMAL1 and CIRCADIAN LOCOMOTOR OUTPUT CYCLES KAPUT (CLOCK) gene expression in actively differentiating GCs varied in a time-in-culture-dependent fashion, compared to undifferentiated GCs in which clock gene expression demonstrated no rhythmicity.\nThe number and size of blood vessels surrounding and within the follicle theca layer increases dramatically beginning at the time of follicle selection when compared to prehierarchal follicles. However, processes regulating angiogenesis have not been studied in chicken ovarian follicles. There is elevated expression of VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR (VEGF) mRNA in GCs from the selected (preovulatory) follicle, compared to GCs from unselected (prehierarchal) follicles. In addition, it was determined that ANGIOPOIETIN (ANGPT)-2, a natural antagonist for ANGPT-1 with angiogenic functions, is highly expressed in undifferentiated GCs and its gene expression decreases after follicle selection. In hen GCs, it was determined that VEGF and ANGPT-2 gene expression is regulated by gonadotropins and several transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) superfamily members, including TGF\u03b21 and BMP4. Levels of VEGF and VEGF RECEPTOR (VEGFR) mRNA were determined to be dramatically lower in atretic follicles compared to healthy prehierarchal follicles, which suggests VEGF signaling may play a role in maintaining follicle survival.\nCollectively, the present studies provide novel evidence that prior to follicle selection FSHR and VPACs in undifferentiated hen GCs are, at least in part, desensitized by a \u03b2ARRESTIN-mediated event. This receptor desensitization contributes to the absence of cAMP-mediated signaling, that results in the inability to synthesize steroids, the arrhythmicity of peripheral clock genes, and a minimal extent of vasculature within prehierarchal follicles.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9167], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Dongwon ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dongwon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan Leslie Johnson", "Alan Leslie Johnson", "Joy Lee Pate", "Francisco Javier Diaz", "Robert Paulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan Leslie Johnson, Dissertation Advisor", "Alan Leslie Johnson, Committee Chair", "Joy Lee Pate, Committee Member", "Francisco Javier Diaz, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ovarian follicle", "follicle selection", "granulosa cell", "granulosa cell differentiation", "G protein-coupled receptor", "follicle stimulating hormone receptor", "vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor", "beta-arrestin", "GPCR kinase2", "desensitization", "circadian rhythm", "angiogenesis", "vascular endothelial growth factor", "angiopoietin"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Thermal and Thermoelectric Transport Studies in Nanomaterials Using Microfabricated Testbench", "id": "23733", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10854", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " This dissertation presents development of a microfabricated device (testbench) for measuring thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient of low-dimensional materials in addition to electrical conductivity and discusses the thermal and thermoelectric transport in nanoscale systems based on measurements performed using testbench. Despite the potential and obvious advantages of thermoelectric transduction, widespread use of such systems for energy harvesting and refrigeration remains limited to niche and specialized applications due to low efficiency. The thermoelectric efficiency is represented by a dimensionless figure of merit ZT = \u03c3S2T/\u03ba, where \u03c3 is electrical conductivity, S is Seebeck coefficient, \u03ba is thermal conductivity, and T is absolute temperature. Low-dimensional structures are expected to have improved power factor (\u03c3S2) and suppressed lattice thermal conductivity, and can therefore exhibit higher ZT than their bulk counterparts. Thus, there is a critical need for understanding thermal and thermoelectric transport in low-dimensional materials. However, in the case of low-dimensional materials, the accurate measurement of the thermal and thermoelectric properties is extremely challenging because of their small size. In order to address this need, we have developed a microfabricated testbench that can be used to measure two-probe electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient of a variety of low-dimensional materials.\n Using the testbench, the thermoelectric efficiency of bismuth telluride nanotubes has been investigated. The bismuth telluride is one of the most efficient thermoelectric materials. Although the efficiency of bismuth telluride nanowires and nanoplates was already reported by other groups, no enhancement in the ZT in these materials was observed. This has been primarily attributed to the unexpectedly small Seebeck coefficient caused by unintentional doping or surface band bending. Owing to small wall thickness (< 15nm) and nanocrystalline nature, bismuth telluride nanotubes synthesized by solution-phase method showed ZT of 0.75 at T = 300 K which is 88 % larger than bulk bismuth telluride.\n As a further application of the microfabricated testbench, studies on the effects of magnetic field on the thermoelectric transport in GaAs/MnAs core/shell nanowires and Co nanowires have been carried out in this work. The thermoelectric transport in magnetic nanoscale systems has been the subject of intense investigation since the recent observation of spin-Seebeck effect in ferromagnetic thin films. By measuring Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity of ferromagnetic nanowires under the influence of magnetic field, it has been shown that the absolute value of Seebeck coefficient is increased by electron-magnon scattering whereas it is decreased by s-d scattering (scattering of spin-up 4s electrons into spin-down 3d states)", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10452], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Duksoo ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Duksoo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Suman Datta", "Gerald Dennis Mahan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Dissertation Advisor", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Gerald Dennis Mahan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thermal", "Thermoelectric", "Nanomaterials", "Testbench"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "LOCAL INDICATORS OF TEMPORAL BURSTINESS FOR SPATIO-TEMPORAL EVENT ANALYSIS", "id": "15045euk163", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15045", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Exploring space-time structures is essential to understanding geographic events that are localized in space and time. The need to understand a range of space-time events has prompted development of many exploratory spatio-temporal data analysis (ESTDA) methods that include spatiotemporal cluster detection (e.g. space-time scan statistics). The focus of this dissertation is on extending ESTDA methods and their application to include attention to temporal and spatio-temporal burstiness of dynamic, geographical scale phenomena. This focus on burstiness complements and extends existing research on spatial and spatio-temporal clusters. The concept of clusters can be defined in multiple ways; many statistical methods to detect clusters statistically define a clustered pattern as one that rejects a completely random process (CRP). CRP is based on the density of events within specific space and time. The dissertation introduces a new concept of temporal clusters, \u2018bursts\u2019 that do not just reject CRP, but indicate a characteristic temporal pattern in which short term high activity periods labeled as \u2018bursts\u2019 alternate with extremely lengthy inactive periods. More specifically, this dissertation develops a new set of ESTDA statistics that characterize temporal burstiness, or frequency-invariant temporal regularity/irregularity, and applies the new statistics to analyzing geographic events including wildfires, geo-tweeting behaviors, and jet contrail outbreaks. In Chapter 1, I lay out the context for the overall work and describe the research goals and objectives. In Chapter 2, I review relevant literature on ESTDA statistics including point pattern analysis methods as well as the concepts and methods for burst analysis, and position the indicators of temporal burstiness presented here in the context of existing ESTDA methods. In Chapter 3, I develop a novel burstiness measure for event data with finite sample sizes, addressing the issue of small sample size effects of burstiness metrics as initially proposed in statistical physics. In Chapter 4, I propose a set of local indicators of temporal burstiness that integrates spatial containers filtering input data points into the burstiness measure developed in Chapter 3; the resulting methods are applied to analysis of wildfire data as an illustration of their utility. In Chapter 5, I apply the proposed methodology in a more comprehensive application, for characterizing temporal regularity/irregularity patterns of contrail outbreaks in the conterminous United States. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is adopted to explore relationships between the upper-troposphere (UT) meteorological factors, temporal burstiness, and frequency of contrail outbreaks.

First, this research investigates how relationship norms influence consumer price fairness perceptions when a company\u2019s decision to support a green cause results in higher prices than the competition.  Second, this research investigates the effects of relationship norms and perceived benefit of CRM on consumer perceptions of price fairness.\nThis research was conducted in two parts.  The empirical investigation of Study I included one pretest and one main study.  The proposed hypotheses were tested by experimentally manipulating the relationship norms and the presence of a price trade-off, and measuring consumer price fairness perceptions.  The results support the hypothesis that the effect of a CRM price trade-off on perceived price fairness is moderated by relationship norms.  The results indicate that relationship type only affects CRM price fairness perceptions when there is a price trade-off.  \nThe objective of Study II was to examine how salience of CRM benefit to either the company or the consumer and consumer-company relationship type affect consumer perceptions of CRM price fairness.  The results support the hypothesis such that when the benefit to a company is salient, consumers in communal relationships perceive CRM pricing as less fair and are more likely to prefer and stay at a hotel with CRM than those in exchange relationships.  On the other hand, when the benefit to consumers is salient, consumers in exchange relationships perceive CRM pricing as less fair and are more likely to prefer and stay at a hotel without CRM than those in communal relationships.

Rotation of the conical bits in its block can extend bit life through a process of even wear on the tip that allows the bit to maintain its tip shape and work more efficiently for an extended period of time. Frequently, this fact does not hold true in actual conical bit application. Grinding on one side of the bit, breaking the bit tip, and severe irregular deformations of conical bits are found when inspecting bits on the cutterhead of mechanical excavators. Strikingly, little is known about causations of bit rotation. Reliable measurement of bit rotation has not been made prior to this study. Therefore the effectiveness of bit rotation and its impact on bit life has been in doubt.\nTo investigate the conical bit rotation phenomenon and parameters affecting this process, a new device was designed and fabricated to measure rotation of a bit in bit holder. For a given conical pick, the main controlling parameters for bit rotation are considered to be skew angle, cut spacing, depth of penetration, and travel speed. To measure the impact of these parameters on bit rotation, full-scale cutting tests were performed at the Kennametal rock cutting lab in Latrobe, PA. This includes linear and rotary cutting tests with single and multiple bits to examine the rotation mechanism of conical bits. \nLinear cutting tests involve full scale cutting of rock samples along preset lines to measure normal, drag, and side forces and bit rotation while changing the cutting geometry (including skew angle, spacing, and depth of cut). A skew plate was used to change the skew angle for testing. Two different bits, AM-470 from the mining tools and RZ-24 pick from the construction tools were selected for testing. Results of the linear cutting test showed no systematic bit rotation. Some sporadic rotation on the RZ-24 conical tool was primarily due to the contact of the bit body with the ridges formed at higher spacing, something that should be prevented in operational conditions. As such, bit rotation did not show any trends with the primary cutting geometry parameters. A series of analytical and numerical solutions were performed to evaluate the configuration of forces at the bit tip that can cause bit rotation under various loading conditions. This analysis focused on calculation of the required lateral forces for rotation of the bit under certain axial loading of the bit which causes friction between bit shoulder and bit block. This friction prevents bit rotation. The results of the analysis supported the linear cutting test results and observations.\nSubsequently, rotary cutting tests on a drum laced with a single bit were performed. And bit rotation was measured using the instrumented bits at different skew angles, cutting geometry, and cutting speeds. The results of rotary cutting test show that limited bit rotation occurs as the bit enters and exits the rock (cutting surface). Among the cutting parameters, the skew angle has a significant effect on the bit rotation. However, higher bit rotations were observed at lower skew angles from zero to six degree. The use of higher skew angles (i.e.-12&#778; or 12&#778;) reduced bit rotation and increased cutting forces and specific energy of cutting. Higher bit rotation also coincided with narrow spacing. Intriguingly, the direction of the bit rotation follows the face that contacts the rock surface first. Thus, positive rotation (CW) was observed with positive skew angles. Similarly, negative rotation (CCW) was measured at negative skew angle. Positive skew angle in this case was considered cutting towards the lower cutting surface (or the adjacent line that is previously cut)\nRotary cutting tests using the drum laced with multiple bits were also performed. This drum was fitted with four (4) bits at two (2) bits per line at equal circumferential spacing of 90 degrees. A higher bit rotations was observed at a lower spacing and skew angle seems to impact bit rotation. The limited data available to date are inconclusive on the final impact of the skew angle on bit rotation and optimum skew angle for maximum rotation of the bit One of the main conclusions of the rotary cutting tests is that the bit rotation occurred at small increment at each revolution during the point of entry and exit of the bit into the cut. At this stage, several mechanisms have been proposed to improve bit rotation. The effectiveness of these solutions requires confirmation by additional full scale cutting tests. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1914], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Eunhye ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Eunhye", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamal Rostami", "Jamal Rostami", "R Larry Grayson", "Derek Elsworth", "Francesco Costanzo", "Antonio Nieto", "Yaw D Yeboah"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamal Rostami, Dissertation Advisor", "Jamal Rostami, Committee Chair", "R Larry Grayson, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Member", "Antonio Nieto, Committee Member", "Yaw D Yeboah, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Finite Element Analysis", "Full scale cutting test", "Rock fragmentation", "Conical bit rotation"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Supersolid Transition of 4He\n", "id": "6377", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1920", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "First experimental observation of supersolid 4He is presented for both bulk solid helium and solid 4He confined in porous media.  Non-Classical Rotational Inertia (NCRI), a direct evidence of the existence of a supersolid, is detected by the reduction in the resonant period of the torsional oscillator.  \nFor bulk solid 4He torsional oscillator measurements have been performed in the range of temperature from 2K to 0.02K and pressure from 26 bars to 66 bars. Below 0.27K, non-classical rotational inertia is detected by a sharp drop in the resonant period of the torsional oscillator, indicating entry into a supersolid phase.  The temperature dependence of the supersolid fraction exhibits a universal behavior of an exponential-like rise with decreasing temperature and then a saturation in the low temperature limit. This temperature dependence is distinct from other BEC systems such as superfluid of liquid helium and Bose-Einstein condensation of dilute gases. For all pressures very strong dependence of non-classical rotational inertia on the oscillation speeds is observed. The scatters in the supersolid fraction, varying between 0.7% and 1%, makes it difficult to conclude if there is any trend of the supersolid fraction with increasing pressure. \nSolid 4He confined in porous Vycor glass has been studied in the range of temperature from 2K to 0.03K and pressure from 40 to 65 bars. NCRI is detected below 0.175K for all samples that we have studied. The fractional NCRI at low temperature ranges from 0.2% to 0.5%. The presence of disordered porous media does not alter the supersolid transition. The fractional NCRI of solid 4He confined in Vycor glass resembles that of bulk solid 4He, exhibiting strong oscillation speeds dependence as well as universal temperature dependence.\nFor solid mixtures with very dilute concentration of 3He reveals a very intriguing behavior. The addition of 3He not only broadens the transition but also enhances transition temperature as opposed to the effect of 3He in the superfluid helium. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1902], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Eunseong ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Eunseong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Moses Hung Wai Chan", "Jayanth R Banavar", "Milton Walter Cole", "James Bernhard Anderson", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Moses Hung Wai Chan, Committee Chair", "Jayanth R Banavar, Committee Member", "Milton Walter Cole, Committee Member", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bose Einstein Condensation", "Superfluidity", "Quantum solid", "Phase Rransition"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Performance Analysis and Guidelines for Lightshelves\n", "id": "10454", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2139", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This paper focuses on the performance of lightshelves in terms of daylight illuminance distribution, sunlight penetration, and lighting energy use.

Unsteady forces developed by the interaction of the fan blade with inlet flow are the dominant source for both discrete-frequency and broadband noise of the subject propeller fan.  In many cases, a primary source of discrepancy between fan noise prediction and measurement is due to incomplete description of the fan inflow.  Particularly, in such engine cooling systems where space is very limited, it would be very difficult, if not, impossible to measure the fan inflow velocity field using the conventional, stationary hot-wire method.  Instead, the fan inflow was measured with two-component x-type hot-film probes attached very close to the leading edge of a rotating blade.  One of the advantages of the blade-mounted-probe measurement technique is that it measures velocities relative to the rotating probe, which enables the acquired data to be applied directly in many aerodynamic theories that have been developed for the airfoil fixed-coordinate system.  However, the velocity time data measured by this technique contains the spatially non-uniform mean velocity field along with the temporal fluctuations.  A phase-locked averaging technique was successfully employed to decompose the velocity data into time-invariant flow distortions and fluctuations due to turbulence.  The angles of attack of the fan blades, obtained from inlet flow measurements, indicate that the blades are stalled. \nThe fan's radiated noise was measured without contamination from the engine noise by driving the fan with an electric motor.  The motor operated at a constant speed while a pair of speed controllable pulleys controlled the fan speed.  Narrowband and 1/3-octave band sound power of the cooling fan was measured by using the comparison method with a reference sound source in a reverberant room.\nThe spatially non-uniform mean velocity field was used in axial-flow fan noise theory to predict the discrete-frequency noise at the blade passing frequency (BPF) and harmonics.  The unsteady lift was predicted by considering transverse and longitudinal velocity fluctuations.  The influences due to an upstream finger guard were also investigated.  The radiated sound power spectra that were measured for the fan are shown to be in excellent agreement with those predicted.  The agreement between prediction and measurement is only fair at the fundamental BPF tone.  Further experimental investigations revealed that the interaction noise between the fan blades and a shroud surrounding the fan might be the dominant source for the radiation at the first harmonic.\nThe space-time correlation functions of the inflow velocity fluctuations were measured and utilized in stochastic lifting surface theory to calculate the unsteady blade lift and resulting broadband fan noise.  The integral length scale of the inlet flow was found to be much smaller than the blade-to-blade separate distance of the fan.  Therefore, contributions from blade-to-blade correlations of the various elements on different blades were found to be negligible and hence ignored; only the correlations between the strip elements on a given blade were considered.  The cross-correlations measured between elements separated by more than the integral length scale were also found to be negligibly small.  The predicted broadband sound power spectra agree well with those measured for frequencies greater than 400 Hz.  There are deviations between the predictions and measurements at lower frequencies.  These are likely due to fan blade stall, and possibly, anomalies in the noise measurement environment.\nIn order to reduce the sound radiation at the blade rate tones, the baseline fan was replaced with a skewed fan.  The backward skew angle of 30\u00a1\u00c6 was found to effectively reduce the 2nd and higher harmonics of the blade rate tone.  The interaction of the shroud opening and the blade tips dominates the sound level at the fundamental tone.  This tone was successfully reduced by incorporating a serrated shroud opening.  Overall, a 2.8 dB sound power level reduction was achieved by applying the skewed fan and the serrated shroud opening simultaneously.  Almost all blade rate tone levels were reduced without adversely affecting the flow performance of the system.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2118], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Geon-Seok ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Geon-Seok", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gerald Clyde Lauchle", "Timothy A Brungart", "Dean Capone", "Gary Hugo Koopmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gerald Clyde Lauchle, Committee Chair", "Timothy A Brungart, Committee Chair", "Dean Capone, Committee Member", "Gary Hugo Koopmann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cooling fan noise", "hot-wire", "cross-correlation of incoming turbulence"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DESIGN AND NONLINEAR FORCE CONTROL OF A POWER-BY-WIRE\nPIEZOELECTRIC-HYDRAULIC PUMP ACTUATOR\nFOR AUTOMOTIVE TRANSMISSIONS\n", "id": "9309", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2155", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation research, a new concept of actuation system and corresponding control method are developed for automotive automatic transmission (in short, AT) shift control.  \nA piezoelectric-hydraulic pump (in short, PHP) based actuation system can be one of the potential alternatives that can replace a current electro-hydraulic actuation system for an automatic transmission friction element such as a band brake.  In this dissertation, a stand-alone prototype of the PHP actuator is synthesized with the new concept of power-by-wire actuation, with a primary emphasis on the development of required performance for AT shift control.  The fundamental performance of a prototype PHP is evaluated through the measuring of the flow rate and dead-head pressures.  In addition, both the effects of a Helmholtz resonator and a fluid effective bulk modulus on the performance are experimentally examined.  \nNext, a nonlinear sliding mode controller is developed for actuation force tracking control of the piezoelectric-hydraulic pump based actuation system.  With a derived governing equation of motion of the PHP-band brake actuation system, a simple but effective switching control law is synthesized based on the sliding mode theory for the given nonlinear system.  To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller, its force tracking performance for a smooth engaging of friction elements during the AT 1 \u201e\u00b3 2 up shift is validated experimentally.  In addition, implementation method using a two-level driver that is appropriate for a pulse-driven actuator is established.  It not only can successfully track the desired force trajectory for AT shift control with small tracking error, but also provides a new opportunity for pressure control of fluid power systems, eliminating three traditional hydraulic components: oil pump, regulating valve, and control valve.  These promising results demonstrate the potential of the PHP actuator as a new controllable actuation system for AT friction elements.\nFinally, the PHP actuator and controller are applied to the automatic transmission shift control scenario to examine the effectiveness of the new power-by-wire actuation concept.  To do this, a real time automotive power train model is first synthesized to develop the simulation model for hardware-in-the-loop simulation.  Only power on 1 \u201e\u00b3 2 up shift model using band brake as on-coming friction element and one-way clutch as off-going friction element is provided for evaluating the single actuator performances.  In addition, both fill volume control to prevent over-fill and the desired force trajectory learning control for AT shift controller are designed to achieve the enhanced shift performance.  With the real time power train model and the PHP actuator, the whole structure of HILS is constructed, and its successful use in the development of AT shift control system is presented to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of using the new PHP actuator.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2135], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Gi-Woo ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gi-Woo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Kon Well Wang", "Kon Well Wang", "Christopher Rahn", "Mary I Frecker", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Kon Well Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Kon Well Wang, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Chair", "Mary I Frecker, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Piezoelectric-Hydraulic Pump", "Automotive Transmission", "Nonlinear Force Control"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "CITRATE-BASED BIOMATERIALS FOR NERVE TISSUE ENGINEERING AND BRAIN DRUG DELIVERY", "id": "14875bzk136", "access_level_ss": "restricted", "db_id": "14875", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Citric acid-derived biomaterials have recently become an intense focus of research in the search of new functional biomaterials for solving pressing medical problems.

However, rumination and worry have never been compared in this regard. Therefore, this study aims to compare worry and rumination within the framework of the contrast avoidance model. Participants were selected based on GAD-Q-IV and BDI-II. Participants with high MDD, high GAD and low MDD & GAD controls were randomly assigned to engage in either rumination, worry or relaxation. In each condition, all participants were exposed to three emotion-inducing video clips designed to arouse sadness, fear and amusement. During the process, subjective emotionality and heart rate variability was measured. Results from multilevel modeling showed that rumination induction attenuated a sudden increase of sadness during sad follow-up video exposure. Similar to findings from a previous study, worry induction also attenuated abrupt increase of fear during the fear video exposure. However, such specificity was not found in amusement in response to amusement video exposure. Analysis of the group-by-induction condition interaction showed that the GAD group reported worry as more helpful in coping during the negative video exposure than the control group. However, rumination was linked to greater coping with sadness, regardless of group differences. Heart rate variability analysis revealed that worry was more closely related to cardiac defensive reactivity than rumination. RSA score in rumination was inconsistent across different trials. Nonetheless, compared to the control group, the GAD group reported the greatest comfort with sustained negative emotion, suggesting a greater tendency toward contrast avoidance. In addition, results showed that the reactivity of rumination and worry was nuanced by the type of stressor. In this study, rumination showed more reactivity to sadness, and worry was more reactive to fear. These results indicate that there is convergence and divergence of rumination and worry. Although rumination and worry share a similar emotion processing mechanism, results of this study show that presentation of their emotional response can vary based on the type of emotions.

Second, we develop the video linkage algorithm using record linkage methods to detect copied videos from a large multi-media database or sites such as YouTube and Yahoo Videos. The utilization of video characteristics is reflected to the hierarchical structure of the proposed algorithms. In addition, the uses of pipe-lined linkage structures accelerate the speed further. Third, the parallel linkage algorithm, the parallelization of the data linkage frame, is introduced, when slow but optimal sequential linkage frames occur where iterative matching operations apply to clean and merge dirty sets. Any data matching functions can be adapted to the proposed parallel framework because a data linkage function is considered as a black box in the parallel scheme. Finally, we introduce a hashed linkage structure based on the locality sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm. By remedying the poverty of a basic LSH structure to suit linkage problems, the proposed hashing structure reduces the precessing time tremendously comparing to the conventional LSH structures.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2323], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Hung-sik ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hung-sik", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee", "Dongwon Lee", "Padma Raghavan", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Ae Ja Yee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dongwon Lee, Dissertation Advisor", "Dongwon Lee, Committee Chair", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Committee Member", "Ae Ja Yee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["record linkage", "parallel computing", "information retrieval", "data cleaning", "copy detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Effects of online buddies and bandwagon cues on user participation in an online health community", "id": "15375", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7681", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Individuals who join online communities generally do so to obtain information and support than to offer it to other users, thus raising concerns of under-contribution. Social impact theory (SIT) suggests that this could be due to lack of perceived social responsibility\u2014also referred to as social loafing (Latan\u00e9, 1981). The core argument of SIT is that individuals are unlikely to offer someone help unless they have received a specific request for such help. This dissertation operationalizes the notion of a specific request in the form of an online buddy and investigates whether it encourages participation among users in a health community website. In addition, it investigates whether collective community feedback, in the form of bandwagon cues, persuades users to participate, as predicted by social facilitation theory (Zajonc, 1965) and the MAIN model (Sundar, 2008a). \nThe study employed a 2 (online buddy: absence vs. presence) by 2 (bandwagon cues: weak vs. strong) between-participants factorial design experiment to test the effects of two main variables on participants\u2019 psychological outcomes, including perceived responsibility, social presence, perceived evaluation, sense of community, perceived helpfulness, and psychological reactance, as well as their posting attitudes, posting intentions, and website attitudes, across two sessions that were two to three days apart. The study constructed a prototype of an online health community website for the experiment. \nThe major findings of the study are that 1) assigning specific online buddies to users in a community forum may lead to negative psychological and behavioral consequences; 2) the online buddy cue interacts with bandwagon cues to activate different cognitive processes, leading to differential interpretation of the meanings of those bandwagon cues \u2014 either as compliments (in the presence of online buddy) or as unreliable feedback (in the absence of online buddy) \u2014 and consequent psychological outcomes; and 3) in the absence of strong community feedback, the online buddy reduces users\u2019 sense of community, thus leading to negative attitudinal and behavioral reactions among participants. \nThese findings imply that the social responsibility that users typically associate with online communities is undermined by the personal responsibility involved in helping specific individuals in those communities. Furthermore, the existence of online buddies makes users interpret community feedback in different ways. More specifically, when users have online buddies, positive community feedback signaled by strong bandwagon cues creates more pleasant psychological states than negative community feedback signaled by weak bandwagon cues. However, in the absence of online buddies, the strong bandwagon cues generate a greater level of accuracy motivation to verify the veracity of community feedback.

The alteration of ethylene synthesis, perception or response might alleviate or eliminate undesirable effects of ethylene, prompting delay of flower senescence, fruit ripening and organ abscission, and improving postharvest or postproduction quality. However, global interference in ethylene synthesis or action could interfere with important ethylene-mediated responses such as plant growth and development, and adaptive plant responses to unfavorable environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate the ethylene involvement in various stress responses of horticultural crops during horticultural protocols by using natural and man-made genetic variations lacking of ethylene sensitivity. \n\nNr (never-ripe) tomato and etr1-1 (ethylene-resistant) petunia plants were evaluated to investigate the effect of ethylene on root and shoot development in response to low phosphorus stress. Adventitious root formation in tomato plants was significantly increased by low phosphorus in wild-type, but not in Nr. Ethylene production by adventitious roots was reduced by low phosphorus in both genotypes. The results suggest that enhanced adventitious root formation in phosphorus deficient wild-type tomato was induced by the increase in tissue sensitivity to ethylene, and that ethylene perception plays an important role in carbon allocation to adventitious roots under low phosphorus stress. Shoot growth of both species was decreased by low phosphorus similarly in ethylene sensitive and resistant genotypes. Reduced ethylene sensitivity of Nr tomato did not affect most plant growth responses to low phosphorus, while ethylene insensitivity of etr1-1 petunia significantly reduced shoot weight, root weight, and total biomass at 4 weeks after transplanting, but not at 7 weeks regardless of phosphorus level. In tomato, the effective quantum yield of photosystem II was affected by phosphorus level at 2 weeks after transplanting but not by genotype. However, that of etr1-1 petunia grown with low phosphorus was significantly lower than wild-type at 2 and 4 weeks after transplanting, and sequentially recovered to the level of the wild-type, suggesting that etr1-1 petunia under low phosphorus following transplanting may undergo more severe stress compared to Nr tomato due to the stronger constitutive ethylene insensitivity. Our results demonstrate that ethylene mediates adventitious root formation in response to phosphorus stress and plays an important role for quick recovery of plants imposed to multiple environmental stresses, i.e. transplanting and low phosphorus.\n\nLow phosphorus dramatically enhanced disease symptom development, as measured by percent necrotic leaves, in both wild-type and etr1-1 petunias during a 7 week period after transplanting. Ethylene insensitive etr1-1 petunia developed earlier and more severe disease symptoms than the wild-type during the first 4 weeks after transplanting, but showed less severe disease at 7 weeks as compared to the wild-type, indicating that ethylene plays a role in symptom development. Disease symptom development was positively correlated with the number of colonies that grew from root segments plated on a Thielaviopsis selective medium (TB-CEN) in both wild-type and etr1-1 petunia. The etr1-1 petunias displayed more severe disease development symptoms compared to wild-type when the roots were equally infected by T. basicola. Inoculation methods and environmental conditions considerably influenced disease severity. \n\nEthylene induced petal abscission is a significant problem in Regal Pelargonium during commercial shipping and handling. A genotype of Regal Pelargonium, \u201899-128-1\u2019 has been developed with exceptional production and postharvest characteristics. The individual floret longevity is about twice that of current commercial genotypes. Two progeny also displayed superior floral longevity when compared to commercial genotypes. \u201899-128-1\u2019 and its progeny have significantly reduced ethylene responsiveness resulting in enhanced individual floret longevity. They also have significantly reduced rates of ethylene production. Further, these genotypes exhibited dramatically prolonged whole plant longevity, and displayed more than twice the number of florets than commercial cultivars. Floret longevity of 6 genotypes was strongly correlated with ethylene sensitivity indicated by S50 (ethylene concentration for 50% petal abscission), but not with ethylene production, indicating that reduced ethylene responsiveness is an important determinant of enhanced postproduction performance in superior genotypes. Pretreatment with the ethylene action inhibitor 1-methycyclopropene (1-MCP) dramatically decreased petal abscission during simulated transport (3 days, 5 \u00baC and 95% RH) in all evaluated cultivars, but the extent of the effect varied with genotype. In all genotypes, petal abscission in response to ethylene increased with floret age. Consequently, 1-MCP had a significant effect on petal abscission of older florets, less effect on freshly opened florets, and no effect on the florets that opened after simulated transport. The longevity of floral display and maximum floret numbers in a postproduction environment were significantly affected by genotype but not by 1-MCP treatment. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2178], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Hye-Ji ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hye-Ji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Marie Brown", "Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Richard Craig", "Edmund Jay Holcomb", "Gary William Moorman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Chair", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Member", "Richard Craig, Committee Member", "Edmund Jay Holcomb, Committee Member", "Gary William Moorman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["1-methylecyclopropene; 1-MCP", "postharvest", "abscission", "black root rot", "ethylene responsiveness", "ethylene production", "adventitious rooting", "Nr", "ETR1", "transplant stress", "Lycopersicon esculentum", "Petunia xhybrida", "Pelargonium xdomesticum"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR BASIS OF \nFUSARIUM WILT IN ARABIDOPSIS \n\n", "id": "9289", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2342", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although the persistence of soil-borne fungal pathogens continually poses a serious threat to the sustainability of the production of many crop plants, only a very limited number of control strategies exist to manage soil-borne fungal diseases in part due to a limited understanding of the biology and ecology of soil-borne fungi. Current paradigms on the molecular and cellular basis of plant-pathogen interactions have been mostly derived from foliar diseases. The number of model systems for studying soil-borne diseases is limited. The main goal of this thesis work is to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning soil-borne fungal diseases through the use of a new model system, based on Arabidopsis thaliana as the principal host and Fusarium oxysporum as the primary pathogen. F. oxysporum causes vascular wilt and root rot diseases in a wide variety of plant species, including A. thaliana.  Using a combination of molecular and cytological tools, I investigated the role of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A gene in F. oxysporum (named as FoCPKA) in pathogenesis of Arabidopsis thaliana. Disruption of FoCPKA causes several mutant phenotypes, including complete loss of pathogenicity with no penetration/colonization of the vascular system, reduced vegetative growth and conidiation, reduced root attachment by spores, and an altered hyphal growth pattern. Preliminary functional characterization of two additional F. oxysporum genes, including NUC2 (Negative regulator of phosphorous acquisition) and ZRT2 (Iron/zinc transporter), has also been conducted.  \nTo monitor real-time cellular and physiological changes during host-pathogen interactions, I report here the first successful expression of a FRET (Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer)-based calcium sensor in two plant pathogenic fungi, F. oxysporum and Magnaporthe oryzae. Time-lapse imaging of live fungal cells expressing this sensor revealed the presence of transient tip high Ca2+ gradient that occurs in a pulsate manner.  Examination of dynamic changes in cytosolic Ca ([Ca2+]c) suggested that Ca2+ might play important role in regulation of hyphal branching, septum formation, and cell-cell contact during fungal growth. The same sensor was also introduced into three A. thaliana ecotypes that differentially interact with F. oxysporum as a first step to investigate how host responses to fungal infection are controlled via calcium. Increased knowledge about dynamic Ca2+ changes using this Ca2+ sensor offers novel opportunities for understanding mechanisms underlying signal transduction changes in response to external stimuli during plant-pathogen interaction. \nA different calcium sensor and a pH sensor based on modified single green fluorescent proteins have also been developed, and their utilities for probing physiological changes in fungal and plant cells and at their interfaces are currently being evaluated.  In combination with the genetic and molecular cytology tools described here, genome sequences of A. thaliana and F. oxysporum and other experimental tools should help us dissect the genetic, cellular, and biochemical basis of Fusarium wilt. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2326], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Hye-Seon  ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hye-Seon ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seogchan Kang", "Charles Peter Romaine", "Timothy W Mcnellis", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco", "Majid R Foolad"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seogchan Kang, Committee Chair", "Charles Peter Romaine, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco, Committee Member", "Majid R Foolad, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fusarium", "Arabidopsis", "Pathogenicity", "Calcium biosensor"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Essays in Consumer Preference Measurement", "id": "17606", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8543", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation aims to propose new frameworks and marketing research methods to get a better understanding of consumer preferences.

Chapter 2 is an essay which proposes a new holistic framework of preference, PIE, which incorporates social influence in the formation of consumer preferences, as well as a measurement method to demonstrate the framework. I propose and test an incentive-aligned approach, a group-sourced mechanism, which mimics a real life consultation of a consumer with her friends in purchase decision making. The results provide support for the PIE framework, including superior predictive power.\nChapters 3 and 4 explore the possibility of using human speech data to better understand consumers. Audio data are ubiquitous and contain rich information, and with the recent advancement of technology, marketers are able to collect, store, and analyze them. Because using the human voice to understand consumers is a relatively new attempt being done in the marketing field, in Chapter 3 I aim to identify opportunities for marketers by reviewing what has and is being done in other areas.\nIn Chapter 4, I demonstrate an application of speech analysis in marketing. Marketing survey methods such as customer satisfaction surveys usually only consider the semantic aspect of responses, without accounting for uncertainty in such responses. I propose the use of human voice as an alternative data collection format that allows uncertainty to be inferred based on pitch, intensity, and temporal features extracted from a respondent\u2019s voice. I show that a modified construct using the inferred uncertainty to reweight different survey items predict people\u2019s behavior better than using the unmodified construct.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8432], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Hye-jin ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hye-jin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Min Ding", "Rajdeep Grewal", "Mosuk Chow", "Fuyuan Shen", "Daniel Kifer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Min Ding, Dissertation Advisor", "Rajdeep Grewal, Committee Member", "Mosuk Chow, Committee Member", "Fuyuan Shen, Committee Chair", "Daniel Kifer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["consumer preference measurement", "conjoint analysis", "speech analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF FOREST LIMING IN APPALACHIAN WATERSHEDS: CHEMISTRY AND MULTI-ISOTOPE APPROACHES", "id": "7615", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2279", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An investigation was conducted to determine the short-term effects of liming on soils, soil solutions, and streamwater at acidified watersheds in the northeast United States, using an integrated set of hydrometric, hydrochemical, and multi-isotope measurements. Additionally, this research compared timing of liming response on chemistry with estimated residence time as of water in soil and on basins. Based on Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design, coarse-grained dolomitic limestone sand was applied at a rate of 5 t ha-1 over the Laurel and 90 Degree watersheds in fall 2003 and 2004 and over six soil plots (15.2 meter by 9.1 meter) within the same watersheds in summer 2005.

Using 18O in water as a tracer, the mean residence time of soil water was estimated as about 2-4 months.

The recent progress in sensor networks and hybrid technologies has brought significant focus on this topic. Electric energy scavenging is now looked upon as the alternative for rechargeable batteries. In this study, the important issues of energy recovery were addressed and a comprehensive investigation was performed on harvesting electrical power from an ambient mechanical vibration source. Also discussed are the impedance matching methods used to increase the efficiency of energy transfer from the environment to the application. \nInitially, the mechanical impedance matching method was investigated to increase mechanical energy transferred to the transducer from the environment. This was done by reducing the mechanical impedance such as damping factor and energy reflection ratio. The vibration source and the transducer were modeled by a two-degree-of-freedom dynamic system with mass, spring constant, and damper. The transmissibility employed to show how much mechanical energy that was transferred in this system was affected by the damping ratio and the stiffness of elastic materials. The mechanical impedance of the system was described by electrical system using analogy between the two systems in order to simply the total mechanical impedance. \nSecondly, the transduction rate of mechanical energy to electrical energy was improved by using a PZT material which has a high figure of merit and a high electromechanical coupling factor for electrical power generation, and a piezoelectric transducer which has a high transduction rate was designed and fabricated. The high g material (g33 = 40 [10-3Vm/N]) was developed to improve the figure of merit of the PZT ceramics. The cymbal composite transducer has been found as a promising structure for piezoelectric energy harvesting under high force at cyclic conditions (10 \u00a1V 200 Hz), because it has almost 40 times higher effective strain coefficient than PZT ceramics. The endcap of cymbal also enhances the endurance of the ceramic to sustain ac load along with stress amplification. In addition, a macro fiber composite (MFC) was employed as a strain component because of its flexibility and the high electromechanical coupling factor. This characteristic is useful for a small force vibration source which has a high displacement such as human\u00a1\u00a6s activities. \nAn experimental setup was used to apply the same conditions as a vibrating car engine. The experiment was done with a cymbal transducer which has 29 mm PZT diameter, 1mm PZT thickness, and 0.4mm endcap operating under force of 70 N in the frequency range of 10 \u00a1V 200 Hz. It was found that the generated power was increased and the output impedance was decreased with a higher frequency of vibration source at a constant force. The experimental results were found to be in agreement with the analytical results from the model using the equivalent circuit. In addition, the FEM simulation (ATILA) was employed to optimize the dimensions of cymbal transducer such as endcap thickness and PZT thickness.\nFinally, the electrical impedance matching method used to increase the electrical to electrical energy transfer for some applications was discussed. To match the output impedance, two methods were employed: one is changing capacitance of transducer by size effect and multilayered ceramics, and another one is developing an energy harvesting circuit which consumes low electrical power and maximizes the output transferred to the intended load. The fabricated multilayered ceramics which has 10, 100 \u0192\u00ddm thick, layers yielded 10 times higher output current for 40 times reduced output load. Also the electrical output power was double. A DC-DC buck converter which has 78% efficiency was fabricated to transfer the accumulated electrical energy to the low output load without consuming more than 5 mW of power itself. In this DC-DC converter, most of the power was consumed by the gate drive which was required for PWM switching. To reduce the power consumption of the gate drive, the switching frequency was fixed at 1 kHz with optimal duty cycle around 1~5%. Also the dependence of the inductance (L) in the DC-DC converter was investigated and optimized to increase the output power transferred to the small output load. Using this optimized DC-DC converter, two circuits used to light LEDs and charge battery were demonstrated. It was found that the power transferred to the loads was not the maximum power generated by a cymbal transducer because the loads were not matched to the energy source with the DC-DC converter even though the output power was significantly improved by DC-DC converter. An AC-DC converter with a piezoelectric transformer which has 98% efficiency was also studied to maximize the energy transfer to the load of 10~100\u0192\u00c7. The output impedance was controlled by a piezoelectric transformer and the driving frequency of the transformer at resonance was adjusted by the AC-DC converter. A DC-DC converter was also used to stabilize the input power of the piezoelectric transformer.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3563], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Hyeoungwoo ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyeoungwoo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino", "Robert E Newnham", "Heath F Hofmann", "Craig A Grimes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino, Committee Chair", "Robert E Newnham, Committee Member", "Heath F Hofmann, Committee Member", "Craig A Grimes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting", "Piezo Generator", "Cymbal Transducer"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The New Order of Workplaces: How Human Resource Management Has Changed Labor Unions in South Korea, 2005-2015", "id": "14525hxk271", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14525", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many industrial relations researchers and sociologists have observed that the broad diffusion of human resource management (HRM) practices across many contemporary workplaces correlates with the recent corresponding decline of unions.

Song, Chemtech, 29 (1999) 26-30].\nThe hybrid zeolite-supported Pd catalyst was prepared to improve sulfur tolerance, based on the proposed catalyst design concept. The hybrid catalyst consists of Pd supported on Y and A type zeolites. For further investigation on small pore system in hybrid catalyst, surface metal passivation by silica coating and pore size control by potassium ion exchange were employed to zeolite A-supported Pd catalyst. Although Pd on Zeolite A showed no catalytic activity for hydrogenation of tetralin, adding the small-pore catalyst to Pd/Y significantly enhanced sulfur tolerance of the catalyst for both naphthalene and tetralin hydrogenation in the presence of sulfur in the form of benzothiophene. Sulfur tolerance of the hybrid catalyst is mainly attributed to the small pore system, inducing size-selective exclusion of bulky sulfur compounds as well as hydrogen spillover from metal inside small pore component. Hydrogen spillover plays two roles in maintaining high sulfur tolerance of the hybrid catalyst: first, regeneration of sulfur-poisoned metal active sites in the large pores of Pd/Y as well as hydrodesulfurization of aromatic sulfur compounds over the zeolite Y support.  \nOn the basis of the above results and discussion focusing on the importance of the supports and metal types for improving sulfur tolerance, the hybrid catalyst system based on the new design concept of sulfur tolerant catalyst is effective in the development of sulfur tolerant catalysts for low-temperature

Twitter is currently the most popular microblogging service in the world. Millions of people\u2019s thoughts, opinions, and emotions melt into billions of short posts, or tweets, on Twitter. Most tweets are accessible through the web and Twitter\u2019s application programming interface (API). Twitter has become a living history and a repository of human thoughts thanks to its gigantic amount of tweets. Analyzing microblogged messages is therefore helpful in understanding and predicting human behavior; computational data mining techniques can be used to recognize common patterns of certain groups of people.\n\nSupport Vector Machine (SVM) is a nonparametric supervised learning method constructing a hyper-plane in a high-dimensional space that has the largest functional margin to achieve a good separation of multiple groups of microbloggers. In general the larger the margin results in the lower the generalization error of the classifier. This thesis adopts Support Vector Machine together with several feature selection methods including SVM-RFE (SVM Recursive Feature Elimination), Relief, and InfoGain algorithms to systematically recognize the genders of microbloggers and shows what gender-specific features are, and how the feature selection process affects the overall classification accuracy. \n\nThe gender classifier can be helpful in preventing a serious social problem: suicide. It is known that risk factors for suicidal thoughts vary with gender and age. Suicide is the third leading cause of death among people ages 10 to 24 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Also, 15 percent of high school students have seriously considered suicide. There is a consistent finding that more than 90% of people who committed suicide had shown a diagnosable psychiatric disorder. Mental health services can help people at high risk for suicide to relieve. However, we cannot solely rely on mental treatment to solve this problem given the fact that two third of the people who committed suicide had not received any appropriate treatment. \n\nThe tweets posted by people before they committed suicide over a year clearly showed that they were suffering from a profound depression. Moreover, some of them posted their final messages to the world on their microblogs. We study how a theoretical model describes the nature of many types of suicide, investigate the microblogging behavior of teenagers who killed themselves, and discuss how a future research may build a statistical model to measure the degree of one\u2019s depression that may be used for suicide prevention. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2329], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Hyun-Woo ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyun-Woo", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Yen", "John Yen", "Bernard James Jansen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Yen, Thesis Advisor", "John Yen, Thesis Advisor", "Bernard James Jansen, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["data mining", "suicide prevention", "gender classification", "gender recognition", "feature selection", "attribute selection", "support vector machine", "SVM"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Polyethylene Based Ion Conductors", "id": "14483", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7340", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, new ion conductive polymeric membranes were synthesized and studied for potential fuel and electrolysis cell applications. Polyolefin was used as the polymer backbone that provides the membrane with a stable and hydrophobic matrix, and some ionic groups were introduced in random or graft microstructure fashion to provide ionic channels for conductivity. The random copolymers were prepared by direct copolymerization and the graft copolymers were obtained by graft-onto reaction.\nIn Chapter 1, general background and theory for ion conductive membrane are introduced. It covers the principles of fuel cells, synthesis of functional polyolefins, and fabrication of membranes. In Chapter 2, new cationic exchange membranes are discussed, which is the main topic of this thesis. This chapter covers the procedures to prepare new polyethylene-graft-poly(arylene ether sulfone) graft copolymers, their structure characterization and membrane fabrication, and evaluation for fuel cell applications. Some PE-based PEMs show promising results with the desirable properties for proton exchange membrane and direct methanol fuel cells. Chapter 3 discusses a new polyethylene-based anionic exchange membrane, containing ammonium chloride (NR3+Cl-) groups and cross-linkers. The chemistry was successfully developed to prepare a broad range of copolymer compositions for a systematic structure-property relationship study. Some cross-linked anionic membranes, with high IEC value and moderate water swelling, outperform all commercial membranes with exceptionally high ionic conductivity. In Chapter 4, conclusion and future work are included with the suggestions for further developing this class of polyolefin-based membranes. At the end of the thesis, appendix are provided, related to more detail information about measurements including proton conductivity and methanol permeability.\nOverall, this thesis is devoted to develop a new chemical route to prepare ion conductive polyolefins (PE, PP, etc.) that are semi-crystalline, ductile, good chemical stability, excellent hydrophobicity in the matrix, and cost-effective.

To address this research objective, this study samples approximately 163,000 students, nested in 21 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, who took the 2009 Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). This study employs multilevel logistic regression in order to investigate the research question. An analysis of whether the relationship between the expansion of higher education and the use of shadow education is substantial after controlling for national- and individual-level variables follows.\n\tThe current study found a significant, positive relationship between the expansion of higher education and shadow education use in academic subjects for 21 countries in terms of the average growth rate of the population with higher education between 1955 and 2005 (AGR). The relationship was substantial even after controlling for national- and individual-level variables. This means that a student in a country with a high AGR was more likely to participate in shadow education than a student in a country with low AGR. When higher education was institutionalized in terms of AGR, shadow education use increased as a supplementary tool to achieve academic success in public education. \nThis study also supports previous findings that a female student from a family with high socioeconomic status (SES) was more likely to participate in shadow education than a male student from a family with low SES. The findings show that while high-stakes testing did not have a substantial relationship with shadow education use in analyses with 21 and 20 countries, public education expenditure was negatively associated with shadow education use in the analysis with 20 countries. Further, the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and the relative income between high school and college graduates did not have significant relationships with shadow education use in the analyses with 21 and 20 countries, respectively. Public social expenditure was negatively associated with shadow education use for 20 countries. Therefore, the results of this study suggest that economic and social benefits are not likely to be determinants of shadow education, while the institutionalization of higher education in terms of AGR is related with shadow education use. In other words, the findings support the assertion that neo-institutionalism can explain the growth of shadow education use in parallel with the expansion of higher education across 21 OECD countries, although the functionalism, human capitalism, and competitive theory perspectives seemed to explain the relationship.\n  This study contributes to the research literature by expanding the empirical understanding and body of evidence for the relationship between shadow education use and the expansion of higher education and the characteristics of shadow education. In the present era of mass shadow education, shadow education is rapidly becoming a salient focus of education policy around the globe. This research can help policymakers better prepare relevant policy measures for increasing shadow education use in order to supplement academic deficits, particularly for low-achieving students from families with low SES. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9089], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Hyung-kee ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyung-kee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David P Baker", "David P Baker", "Soo Yong Byun", "Roger C Shouse", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David P Baker, Dissertation Advisor", "David P Baker, Committee Chair", "Soo Yong Byun, Committee Member", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Shadow education", "private tutoring", "hakwon", "formal schooling", "formal education", "public school", "public schools", "afterschool class", "afterschool programs", "NCLB", "Baker", "Bray", "Institution", "supplementary institution", "ritual", "parental satisfaction", "enrichment motive", "enrichment strategy", "remedial motive", "remedial strategy", "out of school lesson", "out-of-school lesson", "out of school class", "out-of-school class", "ESCS", "achievements", "achievement score", "SES", "private internal rate", "IRR", "wage premium", "return of educational investment", "conflict theory", "status competition", "higher education expansion", "human capital theory", "functionalism", "neo-institutionalism", "Schofer and Meyer", "Meyer", "the expansion of higher education", "Barro-Lee", "GDP per capita", "public social expenditure", "welfare", "welfare state", "high-stakes testing", "high-stakes test", "school quality", "quality of schooling", "public educational expenditure", "higher education enrollment"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "HIGH FREQUENCY LOW VOLTAGE PIEZOELECTRIC MEMS DEVICES WITH CLOSE COUPLED ELECTRONICS", "id": "10371", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2399", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two different types of piezoelectric MEMS devices, a high frequency quartz resonator and a high frequency ultrasound lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducer, were developed in this work.  The first section of the work aimed at developing oven controlled crystal oscillators (OCXOs) with reduced volume, power, and start-up time.  OCXOs provide high frequency accuracy and stability and are widely used for communication and network systems, cellular phones, and GPS navigation systems.  In a typical OCXO package, multiple printed circuit boards for the resonator, oscillator circuit, and other temperature sensitive components are packaged in a metal enclosure, which results in a large package volume, large power consumption, and long warm-up time.  A crystal-on-chip technique was developed with a high frequency, high-Q MEMS-based quartz crystal resonator as a new approach of OCXO manufacturing.  Unlike previous tab mesa\u2013type quartz crystal resonators, for this work a recess was etched in the middle of the quartz crystal substrate so that the resulting resonator would have two different thicknesses: (1) a thinned enclosed active resonator region, and (2). a thick support frame. Controlled wet etching was demonstrated for a 10 \u00b5m active layer thickness with a 150-MHz thickness shear mode resonant frequency. The resonator was combined with a control chip in a proof-of-concept miniature OCXO with only 10 mm3 of core volume, power consumption of 1.2 W at start-up, and 300 mW at steady state.  The warm-up time to reach the steady state was 190 seconds. \nThe second section of the work aimed to demonstrate a reduced scale device with a lower Q, but a high piezoelectric coefficient material, PZT, for use as an ultrasound transducer. High-frequency ultrasound devices in the >30 MHz range are capable of resolving submicron features; however, they are typically limited by traditional fabrication methods. Moreover, the large-drive voltage level usually requires bulky and expensive cables and complex external electronics. In this work, PZT thin films were used so that the voltages required to excite the transducer were greatly reduced. Therefore, the transducers could be driven directly with CMOS signals. The ultrasound PZT transducer was fabricated by a multilayer dry-etching technique in contrast to the wet etching used for the quartz resonator. The transducer design was based on a partially released unimorph structure used in length- or width-mode vibration. This design used SiO2 and PZT as the passive and active layers, respectively. Because of their high piezoelectric response, sol-gel-deposited PZT films were selected as the transducer material. These films exhibited good ferroelectric properties with remanent polarizations of 25 \u00b5C/cm2 and coercive fields of 50 kV/cm.  Platinum was used for the top and bottom electrodes to pole and drive the transducer. The PZT and the remaining films in the stack were patterned using ion-beam etching. The transducers were partially released by etching sacrificial silicon in gas-phase xenon difluoride. The transducers have 30 ~ 70 MHz resonance frequencies and low Q (20), and the pitch-catch mode test showed a received signal bandwidth of ~65%. A fabrication method for two-dimensional transducer arrays using a pillar structure was also proposed. A custom-designed CMOS transceiver chip for a high-frequency ultrasound imaging system was designed by Mixed Signal Chip Design Lab, Department of Computer Science and Engineering. The chip size was 10 mm2, and its average power consumption in receive mode was approximately 270 mW with a 3.3V power supply. In comparison with conventional ultrasound imaging systems, the system size and power consumption were remarkably reduced by integrating the MEMS transducers with the CMOS transceiver chip. Moreover, expensive cables and other bulky components are not required because of the close coupling of the CMOS transceiver chip and MEMS transducers and because the proposed system does not necessitate any extra parts. \nThe MEMS transducers were integrated with the CMOS transceiver chip such that the transducers were successfully excited, receiving ultrasound waves during the test. These results serve as a guideline for portable ultrasound-imaging systems with thin-film MEMS transducers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2383], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Hyunsoo ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyunsoo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Chair", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MEMS Devices", "Ultrasound transducers", "Quartz crystal oscillators", "Piezoelectric thin film", "Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducers"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Communicative Aspects Of Children\u2019s Art Making:\nan Examination Of The Dialogic In Children\u2019s Visual Arts\n", "id": "13734", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7046", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite the plethora of perspectives researchers have used to study children\u2019s art, noticeably few researchers have attempted to provide strategies to elucidate the multilayered and responsive nature of visual languages in children\u2019s art and the complex discourses in which children engage when making art. Consequently, the diverse and complex processes and meanings surrounding children\u2019s art making often seem to be described in limited terms. The purpose of this study was to examine the communicative aspects of children\u2019s art making. This study focuses on the multiple layers of communication in children\u2019s art making and children\u2019s early communication during art making,. The study also includes a discussion of the interactive realm of children\u2019s art, which focuses on children\u2019s interactions, the circulation of visual messages, and the role of art making in their daily lives.\nThis research was conducted in a preschool located in a university-affiliated town in the Midwest. In the data-collection process, ethnographic methods were used, including observations, interviews, videotaping (to record children\u2019s art-making process), analysis of the environment, and collection of documents in the selected classroom. As verbal and visual data were collected from the classroom environment, children\u2019s talk and their evolving images were observed to be the main implements by which the flow of interaction and communication in context could be understood. \nThis study approached the real actions of children across multiple communicative phases through observations of their art making. Results showed that the children used visual art as a cultural tool to communicate with others. Twenty-three communicative patterns were identified within their verbal and visual utterances during art making. In the analysis of art-making events, multiple types of utterances, different purposes, and various influences were observed to be operating together. Both the children\u2019s verbal and visual utterances were formed from various types of talk, ranging from individual mediation to social negotiation, and these utterances had different purposes, such as art-related talk, play talk, self-talk, personal stories, and social talk. The term, \u201cvisual utterance,\u201d is meant  to capture the multiple symbolic languages involved in the generation of images and the stories behind the images, including the verbal discourses, the nonverbal interaction, and the context, in order to elucidate more fully the complexity of children\u2019s process of creating visual images. Children\u2019s various underlying meanings and communicative practices acted together to create utterances that emerged from internal negotiation, multiple relationships with others, and influences of the larger social discourse. Children construct communicable meanings in their art-making process through the interpersonal process of acquiring the importance of the other, and the mediated process of recognizing how the self makes meaning. Whenever children\u2019s art-making process is investigated by focusing on their actions, talk, and the visual images they are creating, we should remember that particular situated contexts and the children\u2019s internalization processes need to be valued as achievements of self-consciousness in dialogue with social factors. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7039], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Hyunsu ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hyunsu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine M Thompson", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius", "Kimberly Anne Powell", "James Ewald Johnson", "Liora Bresler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine M Thompson, Dissertation Advisor", "Yvonne Madelaine Gaudelius, Committee Member", "Kimberly Anne Powell, Committee Member", "James Ewald Johnson, Committee Member", "Liora Bresler, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Children's art making", "dialogism", "discourse analysis", "visual methodology"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "FULLY INTEGRATED CMOS ULTRASOUND TRANSCEIVER CHIP FOR HIGH-FREQUENCY HIGH-RESOLUTION ULTRASONIC IMAGING SYSTEMS\n\n", "id": "9995", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2471", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ultrasound techniques are common for diagnostic imaging and often supersede X-ray imaging in medical sectors. Recently studies for imaging smaller organs or surfaces, such as skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and intravascular blood vessels, have emerged utilizing ultrasounds with frequencies over 20 MHz. A need remains for better clinical ultrasound imaging for detecting tumors and micro-sized tissues in vivo without the use of biopsy. In addition, a recent demand for portable ultrasound imaging systems in medical services has emerged. \nHowever, conventional ultrasound imaging systems have complicated electronics and high voltage transducers connected via bulky and expensive cables. Thus, over two decades many researchers have tried to miniaturize ultrasound imaging systems, and applied mixed-signal IC design techniques for integrating the front-end electronics on a single IC chip. However, no one has yet achieved an ultrasound imaging system with a fully integrated, custom-designed front-end IC chip that combines transmitters and receivers with high-resolution A/D converters and high-capacity on-chip memory devices.\nThe proposed CMOS ultrasound transceiver chip enables development of portable high-resolution, high-frequency ultrasonic imaging systems. The transceiver chip design incorporates closed-coupled thin film ultrasound transducer array which operates with a 3.3 V power supply. In addition, a prototype chip, supported by digital beamforming system architecture, contains 16 receive and transmit channels with preamplifiers, Time-Gain compensation amplifiers, multiplexed Analog-to-Digital (A/D) converter with 3 Kbyte on-chip SRAM, and 50-MHz resolution time-delayed excitation pulse generators. By utilizing a shared A/D converter architecture, the numbers of A/D converters and SRAMs are reduced to one, although typical digital beamforming systems need 16 A/D converter for 16 receive channels. \nThe carefully designed preamplifier minimizes stray capacitance and resistance between the transducers and the transceiver chip for ease of impedance matching and shows 100 MHz bandwidth at a gain of 20 dB. The VGA shows 23 dB linear gain, control range with 250 MHz bandwidth. The implemented TIQ ADC (Threshold Quantization Inverter A/D converter) achieves fast data conversion speed.  Specified 6-bit resolution at a conversion speed of 250 MS/s was achieved.  \nFurther, this study presents a highly efficient TIQ comparator design methodology based on an analytical model for TIQ ADCs. The TIQ technique has gained importance in high speed flash A/D converters due to their fast data conversion speeds. The key to TIQ comparators\u2019 designs is to generate   different-sized TIQ comparators for an n-bit A/D converter; however, this technique is difficult and time-consuming for a higher-bit A/D converter. Thus, this thesis suggests a design algorithm based on MOSFET\u2019s current SPICE model, and a customized program that automatically generates the TIQ comparators. The proposed methodology improves TIQ ADC design accuracy by 55% and reduces design time by approximately by 75%.\nTo substantiate the technology, ultrasound signal acquisition experiments include pitch mode, catch mode, and pitch\u2013catch mode tests, using the thin film ultrasound transducer arrays and the high frequency composite transducer arrays. The experimental results demonstrate the viability of the proposed chip architecture and designs, and the feasibility of the proposed ultrasound imaging system.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2454], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, In Soo ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "In Soo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kyusun Choi", "Kyusun Choi", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler", "Suman Datta", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Nadine B Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kyusun Choi, Dissertation Advisor", "Kyusun Choi, Committee Chair", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Chair", "Richard Laurence Tutwiler, Committee Member", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Nadine B Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ultrasound imaging", "analog-digital converter", "Ultrasound transceiver"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Preemptive Interventions to Increase Patient Safety by Using Behavior-based Feedback", "id": "26586", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11755", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For the past decade, patient safety has become a focus for both governments and researchers alike due to the 44,000 deaths and 29 billion dollars spent annually on preventable medical errors. In fact, up to 70 percent of hospitalization that end in extended stays or permanent disabilities have been attributable to preventable human errors. These human errors are especially problematic in technology-condensed medical specialties such as vascular-, cardiac-, and neurosurgeries. Despite over-a-decade of efforts to reduce these human errors, however, patient safety has not been significantly improved and there has even been backward progress in medical workforce training. While many people still argue that the best way to prevent human errors is to monitor performance and better train healthcare providers, there is currently limited understanding of how to appropriately train these individuals or how to objectively assess their performance in these areas. Thus, the goal of this dissertation is to reduce medical errors and instill safe and effective behaviors in healthcare through a three-pronged approached. First, it aims to develop and test a method for identifying risk-prone medical devices through the creation of a data-mining algorithm that mines the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s adverse event reports and identifies problematic medical instrumentation. Next, it aims to develop an objective method for assessing clinical skills with the identified risk-prone medical devices.

Main motivation to use sapphire fibers as optical media for supercontinuum generation is that they have characteristics of good transparency in mid-IR, high laser damage threshold, and high melting temperature compared to conventionally utilized fibers including silica-based fibers and infrared fibers. As an introductory step, the general theories of supercontinuum generation including derivation of Schr\u00f6dinger equation and explanation of various nonlinear effects are covered. Also, laser systems including a femtosecond laser system and an optical parametric amplifier in our lab are explained since they are key equipments for most experiments performed in this thesis. Sapphire fibers are pumped at various wavelengths to verify their ability to generate supercontinuum in wide wavelength regions since they are known to be transparent from visible to 4~5&#61549;m. Since nonlinearity, dispersion, and fiber length play important roles on nonlinear interactions in sapphire fibers, corresponding nonlinear effects are also investigated and explained. The core diameter of sapphire fibers we used for experiments is quite large that its nonlinear coefficient inversely proportional to mode area is quite small even though its nonlinear refractive index is comparable to silica fiber. To overcome small nonlinear coefficient due to large mode area, sapphire fibers are pumped by three pumping sources to have very wide spectrum ranged from UV to mid-IR region, which can be predicted by the superposition of three different spectra. As application purposes, experiments of IR spectroscopy and remote sensing are performed.

The study used a case study method using an ethnographic approach. In depth interviews with nine workers from the Seoul, Incheon, and Kyounggi area were conducted. An ethnographic approach was used because this approach highlights three key aspects: cultural process as an object, reflexivity as a process, and etic and emic as an analysis production. Purposeful sampling using chain sampling was used to select participants. Mezirow\u00a1\u00afs theory of perspective transformation was used as the theoretical framework for this study.\nThis research addressed the following questions: 1) How did Korean workers learn to deal with their new work situation since the economic crisis of 1997? 2) How did they relate their experiences to the larger economic restructuring that has occurred in Korea since 1997? 3) How have cultural, social and class-based traditions and processes shaped the meaning the workers make of their individual experiences? 4) How has their identity changed in their new self-employed context? 5) How have these Korean workers maintained their occupational pride as self-employed persons since the global economic crisis? \nThree broad themes emerged: (1) transformation of the concept of lifetime employment; (2) transformation of social and economic status; and (c) transformation in overcoming job instability.

Thus, deterministic integration of nanostructures such as nanowires and nanoshell spheres on silicon CMOS circuitry represents a significant step toward cross-reactive silicon CMOS chip where different types of off-chip synthesized sensory materials are merged.  Applying this deterministic bottom-up integration to substrate or circuit eliminates the constraints of thermal budget, chemical compatibility, lattice mismatch between nanostructures to be assembled and substrate. This thesis discusses a deterministic assembly strategy for nanowires and spheres and their integrations onto silicon CMOS circuitry for electronic microsystem applications.  \nThe nanowire assembly structure was designed to create a dielectrophoretic attractive force toward the electrode gap, resulting in uniformly-spaced rhodium nanowire array due to mutual electrostatic interaction between assembled nanowires. Systematic investigation reagarding nanowire array formation reveals that stronger long-range dielectrophoretic forces attract more nanowires at the electrode gap, forming less-spaced array while stronger electrostatic nanowire interaction results in the larger spacing within the array. Thus, their interplay tends to determine the average spacing between the assembled nanowires. \nBased on understanding the electrostatistic interaction between assembled nanowires, lithographically defined wells with a localized electric field determines the final alignment position of assembled rhodium nanowires on a substrate. Post-assembly process using electrodeposition and subsequent lift-off process completes monolithic integration of rhodium nanowires while preserving nanowires assembled only within the recessed region. Individual rhodium nanowire assembly yields exceeding 95% were obtained at nanowire densities >105 /cm2 with a submicron registration accuracy. PEDOT/ClO4 nanowire chemical sensors are also fabricated to demonstrate functional nanowire integration for on-chip sensing.\nThis thesis also describes a bottom-up strategy for fabricating ultra-high-density cross-point sensor arrays (>107 elements/cm2) that uses fluidic assembly to position the functional nanoshell microspheres between lithographically-defined electrodes on-chip.  Cross-point array structure is designed to accommodate single spherical particles at each cross-point and make them electrically connected to upper and lower access electrodes. As proof-of-concept, PEDOT nanoshell microspheres are assembled to fabricate chemical sensor devices for on-chip application. Individually addressing each PEDOT nanoshell sphere enables monitoring of an array of sphere for conductance change by chemical gas, solvent, humidity. \nDue to upper and lower electrodes format and intrinsic form factor of spheres, it is advantageous to achieve high integration density compared to nanowires with a high aspect ratio. Additionally, this architectural framework combines the advantages of large surface-to-volume ratio particle-based sensor elements with high sensor redundancy to enhance performance metrics such as detection sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3169], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Jaekyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jaekyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Craig Grimes", "Jerzy Ruzyllo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Dissertation Advisor", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Craig Grimes, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanotechnology", "Nanowire"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF END-TO-END\nSMALL SEQUENCE NUMBERS ROUTING PROTOCOL\n", "id": "10647", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3079", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nIn networking communication, there are several nodes and stations such as base station or destination nodes. For communication among each node, they send packets or data to each nodes and destination nodes. In this perspective, it is very important to determine the way or direction that packets or data are sent to each of the nodes or destination nodes. Thus the data or packet transmission efficiency is based on routing direction. One of the standard routing protocols is an ad-hoc routing protocol which determines the way the packets are sent to their destination.\nIn an ad-hoc routing protocol, there are several kinds of protocols such as DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) and AODV (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector). In the proposed protocol based on small end-to-end sequence numbers, route direction can be changed properly with the assistance of helper nodes. Between each station, there are helper nodes which guide the proper routes efficiently.\nIn this thesis, we focus on the simulation analysis of the proposed protocol and comparison with other routing protocol models such as AODV (Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector) and DSR (Dynamic Source Routing). We simulated using parameters such as simulation time, number of nodes, number of connections and packet size. The performance criteria will be packet delivery fraction (reliability), routing load (routing overhead) and data throughput.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3068], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Jangyoung ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jangyoung", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kyusun Choi", "Kyusun Choi", "John Metzner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kyusun Choi, Thesis Advisor", "Kyusun Choi, Thesis Advisor", "John Metzner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["routing protocol", "sequence numbers"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "multilayer transfer matrix characterization of complex materials with scanning acoustic microscopy", "id": "18778", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8922", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A multilayer structured thin film system, such as a biomedical thin film, Micro Electric Mechanical System (MEMS) / Nano Electric Mechanical System (NEMS) devices, and semiconductors, is widely used in various fields of industry.

One observable time management device found in practice is the ubiquitous use of deadlines for both cognitive and manual work. Deadlines are known to increase productivity by helping companies and workers manage time efficiently, although many unaddressed questions remain regarding individual differences in performance, measurement, and appropriate deadline settings. For example, compared to individuals with longer deadlines, those who work with frequent and shorter deadlines exhibit longer work times and more completed tasks, while very short deadlines are known to reduce work performance and quality. Few studies have quantitatively modeled individualized pacing behavior and applied it to the workplace with a focus on conceptualization. \n\nThe purpose of this dissertation is to model and estimate individual behavior related to deadlines, then to propose an improved design for time management policies. To do so, several experimental (an air-traffic control setting and online learning settings with eye-tracking measurements), field (Bayesian estimations to the course website data), and simulation (queueing simulations) investigations were conducted. The dissertation concludes with four major findings. First, the dissertation examines effective factors in generating models for aligning time pacing in the presence of deadlines, finding that task complexity and group size affect individual performance with temporal motivation in an air-traffic control setting. Second, the dissertation improves the quality of estimation for individual time-pressure reactivity by using a parametric Bayesian estimation approach. Third, it models the relationships between individual pacing with work productivity. Both the quality (e.g., GPA and class scores) and quantity (e.g., task completion time) of performance are found to be related to individual time pacing based on course website and eye-movement data that was analyzed using a structural equation model. Fourth and lastly, the dissertation proposes designs and policies for time management that improve productivity; prioritizing tasks via early due dates is recommended to increase individual productivity, based on the results from a queueing simulation. The result of this research contributes to generating policies or designing personalized learning by considering individual differences in time-pressure reactivity that had been previously ignored or oversimplified in their practical application.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15395], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Ji Eun", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "Eun", "first_name_ssi": "Ji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Nembhard", "David Nembhard", "Andris Freivalds", "Gul E.

Several applications involving these mesh-based computational techniques include ocean dynamics (PDEs), surface cracks (nonlocal peridynamics), hydrocephalus (mesh deformation), and object recognition (shape matching).\n\nThe first part of the dissertation explores the best combinations of mesh quality metrics, preconditioners, and sparse linear solvers for solving various elliptic PDEs, multiobjective mesh optimization methods, and the effect of mesh anisotropy, mesh refinement, and kernel functions on the conditioning of nonlocal peridynamics models. Engineers use various mesh quality improvement methods for solving PDEs to improve the efficiency and accuracy as well as various types of preconditioners and sparse linear solvers for various PDE problems. However, little research has been performed with respect to choosing the most efficient combinations of these three factors for solving various elliptic PDE problems. First, we investigate the effect of choosing various combinations of mesh quality metrics, preconditioners, and sparse linear solvers on the numerical solution of elliptic PDEs. Many PDE-based engineering and scientific applications have multiple requirements for the finite element mesh discretizing the geometric domain; however, most traditional mesh optimization algorithms improve only one aspect of the mesh, Second, we propose a multiobjective mesh optimization framework for simultaneous mesh quality improvement and mesh untangling for PDE-based applications for optimizing two or more aspects of the mesh. Recently, a new paradigm called nonlocal peridynamics, which employs integral equations, was proposed to model discontinuous domains. Third, we investigate the effect of mesh anisotropy, mesh refinement, and kernel functions on the conditioning of the global stiffness matrix for a nonlocal peridynamics model.\n\nThe second part of the dissertation studies mesh deformation algorithms for robust anisotropic mesh deformation and for shape matching. First, we propose a robust mesh deformation algorithm using the anisotropy of the boundary deformation and multiobjective mesh optimization. When mesh deformation occurs, it is challenging to preserve element shape and noninverted mesh elements. In order to achieve this on the deformed domain, we use the direction of the boundary deformation to estimate the interior vertex positions and employ multiobjective mesh optimization for simultaneously preserving element shape and untangling the mesh.\nSecond, we propose an improved shape matching algorithm for deformable objects modeled by triangular meshes.

Image is defined as the impressions that a person or persons hold about a state in which they do not reside (Hunt, 1971). Image is also considered to be a set of beliefs, ideas, and impressions that a person holds regarding an object. Gunn (1972), who was one of the first researchers to develop a conceptual framework of destination image, theorized that destination image consists of two major components\u2014organic and induced. Organic images are based primarily upon information assimilated from non-touristic, non-commercial sources, such as the general media (news reports, magazines, books, movies); education (school courses); and the opinions of family and friends. Induced images are formed through more commercial information sources such as travel brochures, travel agents and travel guidebooks. Hence, people can have images without actually visiting a destination, and their images can be impacted through multi sensory processing such as seeing a travel brochure, smelling the surrounding environment, listening to music, tasting a local dish, and touching handicrafts. Unclear is to what extent each type (i.e., seeing, smelling, listening, tasting, touching) of multi sensory processing influences image? \nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of multisensory processing on individuals\u2019 image of South Korea as a tourism destination while comparing study participants\u2019 responses to the dependent variable of empathy, image of South Korea and willingness to visit.

Unfortunately, traditional pharmacological management of blood pressure has not been highly effective in older women, and there are only a few low risk, estrogen-based therapies for improving vascular health in this age group.  Consequently, there is a clinical need to investigate novel interventions for vascular health in post-menopausal women, particularly dietary interventions that have the potential to augment nitric oxide bioavailability and lower their blood pressure.  The studies comprising this dissertation tested the ability of nitrate-rich beetroot juice (140 ml of beetroot juice containing 0.6g of nitrate) to raise circulating concentrations of nitrite (NO2-) and favorably influence central (aortic) hemodynamics and arterial stiffness at rest (study 1), ischemic forearm exercise tolerance and perceived effort (study 2), and muscle metaboreflex control of blood pressure (study 3) in normotensive, metabolically healthy post-menopausal women (57-64 yr; n = 9).  A double-blind, placebo-controlled (BRnitrate vs. BRplacebo; IND#119978), cross-over study design was used, with a 7-day washout period between treatments, and standardized pre-visit instructions to minimize between-visit variation in plasma [NO2-].  Compared to responses observed during the BRplacebo visit, BRnitrate consumption raised plasma [NO2-], reduced resting systolic blood pressures (brachial and aortic), delayed the initial rise in perceived exertion during graded ischemic exercise, and attenuated the peak increase in mean arterial pressure during maximal engagement of the exercise pressor reflex (all p < 0.05).  Non-significant effects were observed for resting arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity; p = 0.33), ischemic forearm exercise time to fatigue (p = 0.13) and diastolic blood pressures during metaboreflex isolation (p = 0.18).  Collectively, these results provide the first evidence that acute dietary nitrate supplementation has beneficial cardiovascular effects in healthy older women at rest and during a condition known to promote the conversion of NO2- to nitric oxide (ischemic forearm exercise).  These studies also raise a new series of questions related to the mechanisms by which dietary nitrate may benefit cardiovascular health and exercise tolerance/blood pressure reactivity in older women, and support the pursuit of larger scale trials of dietary nitrate supplementation to determine whether these effects are in fact clinically significant and sustainable.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13686], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Jin-Kwang ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jin-Kwang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor", "James Anthony Pawelczyk", "Penny Margaret Kris-Etherton", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Penny Margaret Kris-Etherton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Nathan Proctor, Dissertation Advisor", "James Anthony Pawelczyk, Committee Chair", "Penny Margaret Kris-Etherton, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member", "Penny Margaret Kris-Etherton, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cardivascular", "Aging", "dietary nitrate supplementation", "beetroot juice", "women"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF CLUSTER-BASED WEB SERVERS", "id": "6793", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3176", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As cluster-based Web servers are increasingly adopted to host a variety of network-based services, improving the performance of such servers has become critical to satisfy the customers demand.Since user-level communication is an effective technique to reduce the intra-cluster communication overhead, design of cluster-based Web server with user-level communication has been a recent research focus.\n\n\nIn this context, the overall thesis of the investigation is to explore several design issues to maximize the performance of cluster-based network servers based on the user-level communication.First, we propose a coscheduled server model, which coschedules the communication processes of a request. The main objective of this\nis to improve the latency of requests that need intra-cluster communication for completion.\nThe coscheduled server will be modeled using two known coscheduling techniques, called Dynamic\nCoscheduling (DCS) and DCS with immediate blocking.\n\nSecond, we propose a NIC data caching scheme, which uses the available NIC memory for caching recently accessed data blocks to improve the \ndistributed Web server's performance. Although the NIC memory is traditionally used for communication, since recent\nprogrammable NICs come with a large memory, we believe it can be used for improving performance as well.\n\nNext, we investigate the impact of the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) offering in cluster-based application servers and propose a SSL backend forwarding scheme, called SSL_with_bf.\nAlthough SSL is the most popular protocol to provide a secure channel between a client and an application server, its high overhead degrades the server performance considerably, and thus, affects the server scalability. Therefore, improving the performance of SSL-enabled application servers is critical for designing scalable and high performance data centers.\n\nTo investigate the proposed techniques, we plan to develop a comprehensive simulation testbed that captures the underlying communication layer in a cluster, the characteristics of various coscheduling algorithms, and the characteristics of a distributed Web server model.\nUsing the simulation testbed, we plan to conduct in-depth performance evaluation of proposed schemes with several workloads to explore the \ncluster-based Web server design space.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3163], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Jin-ha ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jin-ha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas La Porta", "Wang Chien Lee", "Chitaranjan Das", "Dongwon Lee", "C Lee Giles"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas La Porta, Committee Member", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Chair", "Dongwon Lee, Committee Member", "C Lee Giles, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["NIC memory", "SSL", "cluster-based Web server", "User-level communication", "multi-tier datacenters"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Do we improve, disrupt, or embrace sadness?

Due to these distinctive attributes, pre-existing theories of media use\u2014uses and gratifications and Zillmann\u2019s mood management\u2014that center around hedonism-driven media choice are not sufficient to explain the media preferences of individuals with sad feelings. As those theories predict, sad individuals may not always opt to improve their negative feelings into positive ones or distract themselves from those feelings. In order to predict sadness-based media preferences that correspond to the three potential salient goals of sadness regulation\u2014improving, distracting, or embracing\u2014the present study conducted an experiment manipulating sad and neutral feelings and repeatedly measuring preference for three media genres\u2014comedies, game shows, and sad dramas. Results showed that most participants wanted to watch comedies over sad dramas or game shows regardless of their prevailing mood states. However, a series of mediation analyses revealed that sadness indirectly affected preference for sad dramas because of an expectation of gaining profound life meanings and purposes. Additionally, sadness indirectly affected the tendency of some viewers to avoid comedies and/or game shows because they expected viewing such programming to induce unhappy or annoyed feelings respectively. These findings were interpreted as suggesting that although most sad individuals preferred to watch comedies, some viewers are motivated to experience self-understanding and maturity and to gain insights into life and the world, and sad dramas with their truthful, compelling, and meaningful messages provide viewers with constructive coping resources. To more fully understand the media consumption of sad people, the results are further discussed in terms of the importance of cognitive responses distinct from the emotional responses that resulted from the use of media. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3167], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Jinhee ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jinhee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Beth Oliver", "S.

In addition, this study analyzed the reason for participating in private tutoring activities among academic high school students. \nThe data were collected from the Korean Education and Employment Panel (KEEP) conducted by the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training (KRIVET) \u2013a government sponsored research institute- since the year 2004. Among a total of 6,000 samples which consisted of 2,000 middle schools seniors, 2,000 academic high school seniors, and 2,000 vocational and technical high school seniors during a three-month period from March to August in 2004, only the data of 2,000 academic high school seniors were used for these research questions and hypotheses.  \nDependent variables for this proposal are measured by cost and time of private tutoring activities. These include: 1) cost of private tutoring: average monthly costs for participating in at least one type of private tutoring activity; and 2) time spent in private tutoring: average weekly hours spent participating in private tutoring activities for English, Math, Korean Language, Social Science, and Science.\nIndependent variables have three categories; student-level variables, school-level variables, and country-level variables. The first set of independent variables is student-level variables, which consist of family background characteristics including mother\u2019s level of education, total family income, parents?interest in their children\u2019s education, and student perception of their competence in English, Math, Korean Language, Social Science, and Science. The second set of independent variables is school-level variables, which consist of school quality characteristics, including the extent of school satisfaction, school location, and teacher competence, school type (public or private), access to school facilities, the number of students admitted to college or universities, and students?interest in class. The third set of independent variables is country-level variables, which consist of the implementation of the equalization policy, the implementation of ability-grouping between classes, and the percentage of students who participate in talent and aptitude class as an after school program. \nThe first important finding of this study is that the equalization policy is not an important factor affecting private tutoring participation. The second important finding of this study is that there is no difference in the amount of time used in private tutoring between students who perceive their competence in English, Math, Korean language, Social Science, and Science as low and students who perceive their competence in English, Math, Korean Language, Social Science and Science as high. The third important finding of this study is that the efforts of the Korean government to reduce private tutoring expenditure are partially effective.\nPolicy implications for research and practice can be derived from the findings of this study. First of all, it is necessary to change perspectives on private tutoring.  Policy makers and researchers have to realize that private tutoring is not a unique practice in Korea; rather it is becoming a world-wide phenomenon. Second, the assertion that the equalization policy should be abolished is not supported in these findings. Third, this study support the previous finding that students from higher socio-economic families spend more money for private tutoring than do students from lower socio-economic families. Fourth, the current educational policy measures to reduce the expenditures of private tutoring among high school students need to be examined.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3170], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Jinsu ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jinsu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William L Boyd", "Roger C Shouse", "John W Tippeconnic Iii", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William L Boyd, Committee Chair", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Chair", "John W Tippeconnic Iii, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["private tutoring", "the high school equalization policy"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Oviposition-mediated interactions of tomato fruitworm moth Helicoverpa zea \n(lepidoptera: Noctuidae) with its host plant tomato Solanum lycopersicum and \nthe egg parasitoid Trichogramma pretiosum (hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)\n\n", "id": "16411", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8317", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An increasing number of reports document that, upon deposition of insect eggs, plants induce a variety of defenses to remove the eggs from plant tissue using plant toxic compounds or lending a hand of egg predators and egg parasitoids. In this research, I explored the interactions of tomato fruitworm Helicoverpa zea Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) with its host plant tomato Solanum lycopersicum L. (Solanales: Solanaceae) and its egg parasitoid Trichogramma pretiosum (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) mediated via H. zea eggs laid on tomato plants. In Chapters 2 and 3, tomato\u2019s defensive response to H. zea oviposition was investigated, and in Chapter 4, a novel defense mechanism of H. zea eggs against the egg parasitoid T. pretiosum was explored. The tomato fruitworm moth, H. zea, lays eggs on tomato plants and the larvae emerging from the eggs consume leaves first and then fruit to cause serious loss in the plant fitness. However, little is known about the oviposition-inducible defenses in tomato. When tomato plants were exposed to H. zea eggs, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was produced and pin2 expression was induced in the leaf tissue beneath H. zea eggs. H2O2 functions as a secondary messenger compound between early responses (e.g. activation of wound signaling pathway) and late responses (e.g. expression of defense traits such as protease inhibitors) in tomato, and pin2 is the gene encoding a well-studied induced defense trait of tomato, of which the expression indicates the level of induced defense in this plant. I also found that pin2 expression at the H. zea oviposition sites reached the highest right before the emergence of larvae from the eggs. More importantly, H. zea oviposition primed tomato antiherbivore defensive responses. Jasmonic acid (JA), the plant hormone responsible for the activation of defenses against insect herbivores, is quickly and transiently produced in plant tissue when plants are challenged by chewing insects or mechanical damage. The level of JA accumulation in plant tissue represents the level of antiherbivore defenses in the plant. Tomato plants previously exposed to H. zea oviposition induced higher levels of both pin2 expression and JA accumulation upon mechanical damage than when without oviposition pretreatment. These results suggest that tomato antiherbivore defenses are primed by H. zea oviposition in preparation for the future herbivory by neonates that emerge from the eggs. Unfertilized eggs of H. zea also elicited pin2 expression at the oviposition site, but did not prime the defensive gene expression, indicating that tomato is able to distinguish the real future threat (i.e. viable fertile eggs) from the false alarm (i.e. inviable infertile eggs). Tomato also showed a varietal variation in the oviposition priming. The tomato cultivar Better Boy that was used throughout this research primed pin2 expression by H. zea oviposition as stated above, while another tomato cultivar Castlemart failed to prime pin2 expression upon H. zea oviposition. More interestingly, in the JA-deficient mutant of Castlemart, def-1, H. zea eggs suppressed pin2 induction upon the following wound treatment. The effect of priming of defenses by H. zea oviposition on the performance of H. zea neonates was dynamic. In one experiment, H. zea showed decreased performance on tomato plants pretreated with H. zea oviposition, but in the other experiment, previous H. zea oviposition treatment did not influence the growth and survival of H. zea neonates. Interestingly, some neonates were found feeding inside of rachises of tomato plants, and they apparently grew faster than other leaf-eaters. This rachis-boring behavior of H. zea neonates might be one of the reasons of the inconsistent results and an adaptation of H. zea neonates to cope with the decreased quality of food plant by induced defense in tomato. In Chapter 4, I tested the hypothesis that H. zea unfertilized eggs may function as a lethal trap of T. pretiosum. H. zea virgin females laid significantly fewer unfertilized eggs than fertilized eggs laid by mated females in the absence of tomato plants. However, when tomato plants are present, H. zea virgin females laid as many unfertilized eggs on tomato plants as mated females lay fertilized eggs. It was also found that, when the population density is high, H. zea females may remain unmated in the presence of males and lay unfertilized eggs on the host plants, implying male mate choice. T. pretiosum egg parasitoids not only parasitized H. zea unfertilized eggs but also preferred them as the host to the fertilized eggs. Many of H. zea unfertilized eggs desiccated in a few days after parasitization by T. pretiosum, and the undesiccated eggs were almost completely parasitized, meaning the parasitization rate of T. pretiosum on H. zea unfertilized eggs is almost 100%. While T. pretiosum successfully emerged from 90% of H. zea fertilized eggs, only half of H. zea unfertilized eggs allowed successful development and emergence of T. pretiosum, mainly because of desiccation of the unfertilized eggs. These results demonstrate that H. zea unfertilized eggs can function as a lethal trap of T. pretiosum egg parasitoids. The results of this dissertation provide valuable insight into the nature of the interactions between tomato and H. zea and between H. zea and T. pretiosum mediated by H. zea eggs deposited on tomato plants.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8232], "author_name_tesi": "Kim, Jinwon ", "last_name_ssi": "Kim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jinwon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Felton", "John Frazier Tooker", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii", "Dawn S Luthe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Felton, Dissertation Advisor", "John Frazier Tooker, Committee Member", "James Homer Tumlinson Iii, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Plant-insect interactions", "antiherbivore plant defenses", "oviposition", "defense priming", "egg defense against egg parasitoids"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Developing conceptual understanding of sarcasm in a second language through concept-based instruction", "id": "18649", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8891", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis reports on a study that used concept-based instruction (CBI) to mediate U.S. university learners of English (L1=Korean, N=9) into developing a conceptual and functional understanding of native speaker use of sarcasm. Derived from Vygotsky\u2019s theory of consciousness and Gal\u2019perin\u2019s associated theory of educational development, this research represents the first attempt to provide direct instruction on sarcasm in any L2 environment. The study analyzes both qualitative data (i.e., individual interviews, in-class interaction, focus group discussions, student-produced SCOBA (Schema for the Orienting Basis of Action), interpretive-essay writings) and quantitative data (i.e., performance on pre-, post-, and delayed-post tests). Through these analyses, the study documents student development in (1) their conceptual knowledge of English sarcasm and (2) their functional ability to detect and understand the underlying speaker intent in sarcastic utterances produced by native U.S. English speakers. The analysis of CBI interactions and test scores reveals significant learner development. Students gained mature knowledge of the concept and improved their ability to comprehend different intentions and attitudes conveyed by sarcasm users. By developing scientific knowledge of sarcasm, students established a solid cognitive framework for understanding the L2 concept more readily, which in turn raised their awareness of the comprehension and use of sarcasm in their L1. More importantly, learners gained a sense of empowerment by finally understanding the subtle features of sarcasm that they had not previously recognized. The results highlight the importance of instructional quality and teacher-learner dialectics, referred to by Vygotsky with the Russian term 'obuchenie' in which learners interact with an expert tutor who offers pedagogically designed psychological tools and semantic-pragmatic explanations to promote a functional understanding of subtle concepts like sarcasm.

My dissertation study addresses the decay of procedural skills. A study paradigm was created to investigate learning and forgetting of procedural skills in a laboratory setting. Human participants learned and performed a set of novel spreadsheet tasks that are declarative or procedural, and perceptual-motor or cognitive. To examine procedural skills on learning and forgetting, one group of participants used key-based commands and the other group used a novel mouse and menus to complete the task. Participants were able to learn the task well in four learning sessions, confirming the Power Law of learning. Mouse users did not learn or perform better than keyboard users. Retention intervals (6-day, 12-day, or 18-day) showed clear effects on the amount of forgetting. Two modalities (mouse or keyboard), however, did not provide any statistically different rates of forgetting on the first return. When it comes to relearning (2nd and 3rd returns), mouse users showed significantly decreased mean task completion time, indicating relearning occurred in mouse users more effectively than keyboard users. The ACT-R theory, which is used as the main theoretical background, was tested against human data with regard to learning and forgetting. The skill retention model in ACT-R was developed to predict a mouse user\u2019s learning and forgetting performance in one subtask. The model predicted the learning performance with   = 0.8 and RMSSD = 1.8, when compared with human data. The skill retention model proved that an ACT-R model is able to predict learning performance.
