Some students with MLD may maintain this disability throughout elementary school and even into secondary school, but some may be not identified as MLD later in their school life. The concept of correlated constraints will be used to describe this unstable phenomenon. This concept suggests that behavioral development involves the interaction of multiple factors working together as a dynamic system. This dynamic system could be a possible explanation for the unstable development of MLD. In this thesis, first, the developmental trajectory of students with MLD is outlined. Second, several possible factors affecting the math performance of students with MLD are discussed. Third, the connection between correlated constraints and the unstable development of MLD will be explained.

Accurate cash flow forecasting is crucial to companies, since a healthy cash flow is essential to sustaining their existence; a cash shortfall may lead to a huge crisis, such as bankruptcy. The primary goal of this thesis is to determine the relationship between customer behavior and forecasting accuracy.

A comprehensive analysis of the run-time leakage reduction techniques for both subthreshold leakage and gate leakage is presented. The techniques evaluated include input vector control, body bias control and power supply gating. The impacts of technology scaling on leakage reduction techniques are also evaluated. Due to the lack of leakage reduction technique for interconnects, new schemes for leakage-aware crossbar designs are also proposed. In order to facilitate exploration of leakage power trade-offs at a higher level of abstraction, an architectural level leakage power estimation tool which is built on top of a cycle accurate simulator is proposed. The tool accounts for the design styles, process variations, and the leakage power is evaluated at run-time using dynamic temperature feedback. \nProcess variations (such as variations in transistor channel length and transistor threshold voltage) as a percentage of their nominal values increase when technology advances. Many of the theories behind leakage reduction techniques are based on controlling these parameters which vary increasingly across technology scaling. Thus, the interrelationship between leakage reduction mechanisms and process-related delay and leakage uncertainty is investigated. The results presented point out the importance of considering the delay and leakage uncertainties when applying leakage reduction techniques and quantify the uncertainties caused by process variations.

While the contribution of abiotic processes on cave development has been studied, less research has focused on microbial contributions through the complete oxidation of reduced sulfur sources. \nI used culture-dependent and culture-independent methods to study the metabolic properties of Thiobacillus baregensis, a dominant sulfur oxidizing bacterium in sulfidic streams within the cave system, and a novel strain of Sulfuricurvum kujiense (Sulfuricurvum sp. strain Frasassi), the first Epsilonproteobacterium successfully cultured from the Frasassi Caves. Since T. baregensis is abundant and capable of completely oxidizing multiple reduced sulfur sources, it is likely to contribute to cave development. While Sulfuricurvum sp. strain Frasassi exhibits growth on reduced sulfur sources, its ability to completely oxidize sulfur remains to be tested. Both T. baregensis and Sulfuricurvum sp. strain Frasassi show growth on nitrate, a chemical species perennially below detection limits in the Frasassi Caves.

The mesh needs to be fine throughout the entire simulation in both\ntransverse and longitudinal directions to capture high gradients. Isotropic adaptive meshing performs simultaneous coarsening, and\nrefining, in all spatial dimensions. Application of isotropic adaptive meshing allows the use of a coarse mesh as the analysis begins and it refines as needed in all directions during the\nsimulation. However, because of the nature of isotropic refinement, elements need to remain fine in all dimensions even if the gradient is high in only one direction. In this work, an efficient Anisotropic h-Adaptive (abbreviated AH-adaptive) FEA method is developed that performs independent\nrefining and coarsening among all spatial dimensions. Application of the anisotropic h-adaptive meshing allows the use of a coarse\nmesh as the analysis starts. If there is one direction in which the gradient is much smoother than the others, the mesh coarsens\nin the corresponding direction, thus reducing the number of DOFs by n^{1/2} in 2D analyses, and n^{1/3} in 3D analyses.\n\nDependent (also referred to as \"constraint\") nodes occur when h-adaptive refinement strategy is applied. The DOFs (degrees of freedom) on these dependent nodes must be separated from the\noriginal system of algebraic equations. Only the unconstrained (also referred to as \"free\") DOFs can exist in the real equation system to solve and therefore yield accurate solution fileds. To\ndeal with the dependent DOFs, several methods can be applied for the numerical computations. A comparison between Condensation and\nRecovery Method, Lagrange Multiplier, and Penalty Method is performed. And the Condensation and Recovery Method is chosen to be applied in the AH-adaptive FEA scheme to maximize the\ncomputational efficiency.\n\nHighlights from this research include important contributions such as: 1) simplified gradient calculations for each element, 2) nonzero fill-in effects induced by condensing the original algebraic equation systems, 3) moving forced refinements of anticipated high gradients, 4) procedures which assist meshes with neatly coarsening elements to the allowed maximum, and 5)\ncomparisons among possible approaches for the original system equations from a mesh which has constrained nodes.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5876], "author_name_tesi": "Tsau, Shih-Horng ", "last_name_ssi": "Tsau", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shih-Horng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Panagiotis Michaleris", "Ashok D Belegundu", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Francesco Costanzo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Panagiotis Michaleris, Committee Chair", "Ashok D Belegundu, Committee Member", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nonzeros in tangent matrix", "finite element", "AH-adaptive", "condensation theory", "algorithm", "large structure", "multi-scale", "anisotropic h-adaptive", "penalty method", "Lagrange multiplier"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Is Watching Others Self-Disclose Enjoyable?

Considerable research has supported the positive associations between disclosure of personal information and relationship satisfaction, attainment of intimacy, and pursuit for relational longevity. If self-disclosure is conceptualized as a means through which closeness or familiarity is produced between partners (under the premise that the disclosure is not negative), can such a response be attributable to mediated forms of self-disclosure between a viewer and character on television? The present study empirically tests the effects of two particular dimensions of self-disclosure: depth (private vs. public information) and mode of information delivery (character-to-viewer vs. character-to-character vs. narrator-to-viewer). Findings support the prediction that a viewer\u2019s overall enjoyment of witnessing the disclosure of a character\u2019s personal information, identification, and transportation are functions of depth and mode of information delivery.

It explored how the social status of women influences and shapes their leadership roles as practicing female principals. This study contributes to the sparse academic literature on female leadership with a focus on the critical tension between conventional practices in which women on the one hand, are treated as minors while at the same time are expected to conduct serious professional responsibilities as senior administrators.  On the basis of the literature review, I outlined some of the main trends which are characteristic of female educational leadership. The analytical framework used to frame the data emerged organically from the data. The analytical framework had five conceptual strands: 1) the notion of education as a process; 2) the distinction between two forms of leadership consensual as opposed to autonomous leadership; 3) three features closely related to leadership: authority, gender, and age; 4) attempts to create a new environment; and 5) leadership as social welfare. The findings suggest that female school principals are likely to be more successful because of the diverse roles which they play. Through the study I demonstrated that although female school principals are in a minority they bring with them special types of expertise which all educational leaders might benefit from.  The data from the informants show the strategies to address the social, political and economic challenges which they are faced with in their day-to-day practices as principals. On the basis of the study I describe the nature and type of research which can form the basis of further studies. My study was based on data collected from female school principals, future studies need to extend the data base by eliciting data from  other communities which are also involved in education: students, parents, teachers, and male headmasters so that the views of the female school principals can be situated in a broader  context.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5142], "author_name_tesi": "Tsemunhu, Rudo ", "last_name_ssi": "Tsemunhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rudo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger C Shouse", "Iris M Striedieck", "John W Tippeconnic", "Priya Sharma"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger C Shouse, Committee Chair", "Iris M Striedieck, Committee Chair", "John W Tippeconnic, Committee Member", "Priya Sharma, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["educational leadership", "female principals"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Postsocialist Collectivities: Institutions, Aesthetics, Politics in the Sinophone Novel", "id": "13402dht5032", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13402", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation, \u201cPostsocialist Collectivities: Institutions, Aesthetics, Politics in the Sinophone Novel\u201d examines the concept of collectivity in the modern fiction of China, Taiwan, and Chinese Malaysia.

Investigation of the coupling effect between the individual feet of half toe standing posture should provide further guidance for understanding movement control in ballet.  In this study, two force platforms were synchronized so as to investigate the amount of variability and the coupling effect of the COP left, COP right, COP net in different ballet poses.  Fourteen young female adult college ballet dancers, 11 recreational runners, and 10 non-exercisers participated in the study.  The five ballet postures investigated were: parallel position in flat foot (hip width distance), ballet first position (heel to heel) in flat foot, ballet first position in half toe-standing, ballet second position (separate two times hip-width distance) in half toe standing, and ballet second position in half toe standing posture.  Three 30 s trials were collected for each participant in each condition.  Quantification of the variability of COPL and COPR trajectories and their relation with COPnet was conducted by analysis of the standard deviation, approximate entropy (ApEn), and cross-approximate entropy (cross-ApEn).  In the COPR, COPL in medial-lateral direction, the non-exerciser group had the lowest amount of variability compared to the college ballet dancers and the recreational runners.  The SDs of COPL, COPR and COPnet were significantly (p<0.05) influenced by ballet posture.  Moreover, the pattern of SDs for AP and ML motion on each COP variable was different.  ApEn and cross-ApEn of COP net in the AP direction, and COPL and COPR in ML and AP revealed greater irregularity in the coupling of the half toe standing posture.  There were no differences between groups except for SD of the individual foot in ML directions.  Previous studies have shown that ballet dancers are qualitatively, but not quantitatively different in postural control than non ballet dancers.  However, our finding did not support this hypothesis.  One possible explanation for our failure to support this may be due to the testing of a less experienced ballet dancer than tested in other studies.\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6623], "author_name_tesi": "Tseng, Wan-Tng ", "last_name_ssi": "Tseng", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wan-Tng", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell", "Karl Maxim Newell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Maxim Newell, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["postural control", "ballet dancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND STUDY OF PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT IN A VANADIUM REDOX FLOW BATTERY\n", "id": "11842", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6932", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\nA reliable Vanadium Redox Flow Battery (VRB) system was designed, built, and tested in a laboratory environment.

The\nmethod developed relies on assuming the behavior of the system of\ninterest is ``nearly classical', or semiclassical, in a\nprecise quantitative sense. The approximation is formulated as a\nperturbative hierarchy of the expectation values of quantum\nobservables and their non-linear combinations, such as spreads and\ncorrelations. We formulate the constraint conditions and additional\nquantum gauge transformations that arise directly on the\naforementioned quantities. We specialize this framework to several\nsituations of particular interest. The first situation considered is\nthe case of a constraint that commutes with all quantum observables,\nwhich is appropriate for quantization of a Lie algebra with a single\nCasimir polynomial. Through explicit order-by order counting argue\nthat the true degrees of freedom are captured correctly at each\norder of the approximation.\n\nThe rest of the models considered are motivated by the canonical\napproach to quantizing general relativity. The homogeneous sector of\ngeneral relativity splits into classes of models, according to\ntopology, which are described by a finite number of degrees of\nfreedom and can therefore be quantized as quantum mechanical\nsystems, making our construction directly applicable. In the\nHamiltonian formulation the dynamics of these systems is governed by\nthe Hamiltonian constraint, which, in the quantum theory, gives rise\nto several conceptual and technical issues collectively known as the\nProblem of Time. One of the aspects of this problem that does not\npossess a general solution is the dynamical interpretation of the\ntheory. We use our construction, truncated at the leading order in\nquantum corrections, together with the intuition gained from dealing\nwith constrained systems in classical mechanics, to define local\nnotion of dynamics relative to a chosen configuration clock\nvariable. We consider a class of models, where the chosen clock in\nnot globally valid, eventually leading to singular dynamics.

Experiments were performed in a nearly isothermal plasma flow reactor (PFR), using reactant mixtures highly diluted in an inert gas (e.g., Ar, He, or N2) to minimize temperature changes from chemical reactions. At the end of the isothermal reaction zone, the gas temperature was rapidly lowered to terminate any continuation in reaction. Product composition as a result of any observed reaction was then determined using ex situ techniques, including non-dispersive infrared (NDIR), and by sample extraction and storage into a multi-position valve for subsequent analysis by gas chromatography (GC). Hydroxyl radical concentrations were measured in situ, using the laser induced fluorescence (LIF) technique. Reactivity maps for a given fuel system were achieved by fixing the flow rate or residence time of the reactant mixture through the PFR and varying the isothermal temperature. Fuels studied were hydrogen, ethylene and C1 to C7 alkane hydrocarbons, to examine pyrolysis and oxidation kinetics with and without the effects of a high-voltage nanosecond pulse duration plasma discharge, at atmospheric pressure from 420 K to 1250 K. In select instances, experimental studies were complimented with detailed chemical kinetic modeling analysis to determine the dominant and rate-controlling mechanisms, while elucidating the influence of the plasma chemistry on the thermal (neutral) chemistry.\n\nIn the hydrogen oxidation system, no thermal reaction was observed until 860 K, consistent with the second explosion limit at atmospheric pressure, at which point all the hydrogen was rapidly consumed within the residence time of the reactor. With the plasma discharge, oxidation occurred at all temperatures examined, exhibiting a steady increase in the rate of oxidation starting from 470 K, and eventually consuming all the initial hydrogen by 840 K. For ethylene, kinetic results with the discharge indicated that pyrolysis type reactions were nearly as important as oxidative reactions in consuming ethylene below 750 K. Above 750 K, the thermal reactions coupled to the plasma reactions to further enhance the high temperature fuel consuming chemistry. Modeling analysis of plasma-assisted pyrolysis revealed that ethylene dissociation by collisional quenching with electronically-excited argon atoms formed in the presence of the plasma, resulted in the direct formation of acetylene and larger hydrocarbons by way of the ethyl radical. Similarly, during plasma-assisted oxidation, excited argon was able to directly dissociate the initial oxidizer to further enhance fuel consumption, but also facilitate low temperature oxidative chemistry due to the effective production of oxygenated species controlled by R+O2 chemistry. At the highest temperatures, the radical production by neutral thermal reactions became competitive and the effectiveness associated with the plasma coupled chemistry decreased. Under the effects of the plasma, alkane fuels exhibited extended limits of oxidation over the entire temperature range considered, compared to that of the thermal reactions alone. At atmospheric pressure, propane and butane exhibited cool flame chemistry between 420 K to 700 K, which normally occurs at higher pressures (P > 1 atm) for thermally constrained systems. This chemistry is characterized by the alkylperoxy radical formation, isomerization to the hydroperoxyalkyl radical, followed by dissociation to form aldehydes and ketones. Whereas, intermediate temperature chemistry between 700 K to 950 K, is characterized by beta-scission of the initial alkyl radical to form alkenes and smaller alkanes.

First, the development of potential barrier at the grain boundaries during oxidative annealing was investigated in (Mn, Nb)-doped SrTiO3 (STO) internal barrier layer capacitors (IBLCs). The methodology used for the (Mn, Nb)-doped STO IBLC was then applied to CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO), which is known as a different type of IBLCs. The motivation for these two materials was to find a correlation between the interfacial electronic states at the grain boundary and macroscopic varistor-capacitor properties. In addition, a relatively new colossal permittivity material, namely, Nb and In co-doped rutile TiO2 (NITO) was also investigated. In contrast to (Mn, Nb)-doped STO and CCTO, the research was focused on the origin of the colossal permittivity in NITO. A detailed dielectric relaxation analysis of the permittivity response of NITO at low temperatures was performed and discussed. \n\n(Mn, Nb)-doped STO IBLC\n(Mn, Nb)-doped STO barrier layer capacitors with a colossal permittivity (\u03b5\u2019~ 50,000) were synthesized with different oxidative annealing times.  First, combination of microstructural analysis was performed: including scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The elemental mapping confirmed that the IBLC was associated with internal grain boundaries instead of segregated secondary layers. A minor Mn-rich segregation layer was found at the electrode/ceramic interface.  The EELS results reveal the valence change of manganese changed from a mixed Mn2+/Mn3+ to a mixed Mn3+/Mn4+ during the annealing as the oxygen was incorporated into the grains. \nAn impedance study showed that an IBL was designed by an oxidative annealing process, leading to improved dielectric loss and breakdown voltages. The systematic change with the annealing time was then explained in terms of the Double-Schottky-barrier height and depletion layer width across the grain boundaries, which was quantified by a Capacitance-Voltage (C-V) analysis. Moreover, a charge Deep Level Transition Spectroscopy (Q-DLTS) approach was also applied to show the three electronic traps existing at the IBL. The nature of these trap states is discussed in detail in Chapter 3. \nThe concept of a \u201clocal electric field at a grain boundary, EGB\u201d was introduced to better account for the d.c. conduction analysis in (Mn,Nb)-doped STO. The local field was estimated from a microstructural analysis made by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and an electric (C-V) analysis. Then, the d.c. conduction mechanism was discussed based on the temperature dependence of J (Current density)-EGB characteristics. Three different conduction mechanisms were successively identified and transitioned with the increase of EGB. In the low EGB regime, J-EGB characteristics showed linear Ohmic behavior. In the intermediate EGB, it showed a non-linear characteristic with a thermally activated process. In the higher EGB, it became relatively insensitive to the temperature. The J- EGB in each regime is explained by Schottky Emission (SE) followed by Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) tunneling. Based on the F-N tunneling, a breakdown voltage was then scaled to the product of the depletion layer thickness and the Schottky barrier height at a grain boundary. These parameters control the breakdown strength of each GB in this system.\n\nCCTO IBLC \nThe combination of SEM and C-V analysis was also performed to estimate EGB in CCTO IBLC. While the macroscopic varistor-capacitor properties were similar to the (Mn,Nb)-doped STO, the d.c. conduction mechanism was found to be quite different in CCTO. Ohmic, Poole-Frenkel (P-F) and SE were successively observed in CCTO in different field ranges. The transition point from P-F and SE depends on the EGB and temperature. A Q-DLTS study revealed that there are three types of trap states existing in CCTO. The first trap with E_t~0.65 eV below the conduction band showed excellent agreement with the trap level from P-F analysis. The electronic structure of the potential barrier in the CCTO was then proposed.\n\nNITO\nDielectric spectroscopy was performed on NITO ceramics synthesized by a low-temperature spark plasma sintering (SPS) technique. The annealing temperature after the SPS was critical for the development of an IBL in NITO. The dielectric properties of the NITO were not found to be largely influenced by the blocking metal electrode contacts. NITO ceramics with lower heat treatment, which did not show IBLC effects, were then investigated. A large dielectric relaxation was observed at very low temperatures below 35 K. Both the activation energy and relaxation time suggested that a polaronic polarization was the underlying mechanism responsible for the colossal dielectric permittivity (CP) and its relaxation, instead of the internal barrier layer effect or a dipolar relaxation. Havriliak-Negami (H-N) fitting revealed a relaxation time with a large distribution of dielectric relaxations. The broad distributed relaxation phenomena indicated that the Nb and In ions were involved, controlling the dielectric relaxation by modifying the polaron dipole and localized states. The associated distribution function is calculated and presented. The frequency-dependent a.c. conductance was successfully explained by a hopping conduction model of the localized electrons with the distribution function. It was demonstrated that the dielectric relaxation is strongly correlated with the hopping electrons in the localized states. The CP in SPS NITO was then ascribed to a hopping polaron polarization.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16189], "author_name_tesi": "Tsuji, Kosuke ", "last_name_ssi": "Tsuji", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kosuke", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clive A Randall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clive A Randall, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ceramic capacitors", "Grain boundaries", "Schottky barriers", "Tunneling"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Application of a Homotopy Method to Low-Thrust Trajectory Optimization", "id": "8862", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1194", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Continuous optimization methods, historically classified into direct and indirect method categories, have demonstrated notable success in continuous-thrust trajectory optimization. An optimization problem is transformed into a nonlinear programming problem (NLP) in a direct method or a multiple-point boundary value problem (MPBVP) in an indirect method. The solution of the resulting NLP or MPBVP is obtained by numerical computation. However, the class of extremely low-thrust trajectory optimization problems creates a challenge for the direct use of those methods. Very low thrust acceleration levels (<1 mN/kg) in these problems result in lengthy trajectories and subsequent large optimization problems to solve. The sizes of these problems raise the concern of convergence and computing time. Thus, an accurate initial estimate of the solution (i.e. initial guess) becomes highly valued to reduce the search effort. However, such an accurate initial guess may be unavailable or difficult to construct. \n\nA homotopy optimization method obtains the solution of one problem from a known solution from another problem. In its application to trajectory optimization, the optimal trajectory of one mission scenario can be derived from a known optimal trajectory of a similar scenario, which creates a means of generating initial guess for successive, more complex problems. This thesis develops a homotopy method which modifies the level of thrust produced by the propulsion system of a spacecraft from a low value to a higher value and forms a chain of problems linking the original low-thrust problem to a modified higher-thrust problem. The optimal trajectory of this higher-thrust problem is first obtained by using a direct method. The modified higher level of the thrust results in a shorter mission trajectory which in turn means a smaller NLP that is easier to solve at first. The obtained solution then serves as an initial guess for the next neighboring problem (lower thrust level) in the problem chain. The computer program implementing the homotopy method successively loads the result from the previous higher-thrust problem as the initial guess and optimizes the next lower-thrust problem in the chain by using the same direct method. After traversing through the problem chain from one end to another, the optimal trajectory of the original low-thrust problem can be obtained. This method has high probability of achieving convergence. In fact, if any two values of the thrusts of two neighboring problems in the chain are close enough, the method ensures probability-one (i.e. definite) convergence to a locally optimal trajectory (local optima). We apply this method to a realistic force three-dimensional escape transfer problem which is modified from the model of SMART-1 or \u201cSmall Missions for Advanced Research in Technology\u201d of the ESA scientific program. A straightforward way of optimizing this problem using a direct method requires direct handling of a huge NLP.  By using the homotopy method, we start by solving a small NLP and eventually obtain a locally optimal minimum-time escape transfer trajectory. We discuss the direction of future development to enable the homotopy optimization method to search for the global minimum. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1182], "author_name_tesi": "Tu, Chenmeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Tu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chenmeng", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Graham Melton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Graham Melton, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Trajectory Optimization", "Low-Thrust", "Homotopy Method"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Information Extraction and Metadata Annotation for Algorithms in Digital Libraries", "id": "24966", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11043", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Algorithms are developed in computer science and related disciplines to provide concise step-by-step instructions for solving particular problems.

For example, algorithms for stock portfolio optimization are used for diversifying search results in information retrieval systems.\n\nThough algorithm collections such as encyclopedias (e.g. Wikipedia) and algorithm textbooks manually catalog algorithms and make them available, such collections only contain standard algorithms (algorithms which are well defined and well known). Examples of standard algorithms include Dijkstra's algorithm, Binary search, Fast Fourier transform, etc. Despite the well-established nature of these standard algorithms, they hardly satisfy the needs of algorithm users and researchers who seek cutting-edge solutions to their problems. Fortunately, researchers constantly develop new algorithms to solve new problems that have not been solved before, or new algorithms that improve upon the existing ones. A significant number of scholarly articles in computer science and related disciplines hence contain high-quality algorithms developed by researchers. However, manually searching for algorithms in a pile of papers would be tedious. Therefore, it would be useful to have a system that automatically collects and enables the search for this ever increasing collection of algorithms.\n\nDespite the development of various search engine systems for entities in scholarly documents such as tables, figures, mathematical expressions, etc., systems that collect and index algorithms from scholarly documents never existed.

The ability to predict the mental states of an individual could prove critical to healthcare practitioners. Currently, the practical ways to predict an individual's mental state is through mental examinations that involve psychological experts performing the evaluations. However, such methods may be time and resource consuming, mitigating its broad applicability to a wide population. Furthermore, some individuals may also be unaware of their mental anomalies or may not feel uncomfortable to express themselves during the evaluations. Hence, their mental anomalies could remain undetected for a prolonged period of time. The hypothesis of this work is to prove that current and future mental states of an individual could be estimated using only the information directly observable from the his/her physical activities and behaviors. The problem of emotion prediction is transformed into the time series forecasting problem where an individual is represented as a multivariate time series stream of monitored physical and behavioral attributes. A mathematical model is then generated to capture the dependencies among these attributes, which is used for prediction of emotion states. In particular, we first illustrate the drawbacks of traditional multivariate time series forecasting methodology such as vector autoregression. Then, we show that such issues could be mitigated by using machine learning regression techniques which are modified for capturing temporal dependencies in multivariate time series data. A case study using the data from 150 human participants from the Pennsylvania State University community illustrates that the proposed machine learning based forecasting methods are more suitable for high-dimensional psychological data than the traditional vector autoregressive model in terms of both magnitude of error and directional accuracy. These results not only present a successful usage of machine learning techniques in psychological studies, but also serve as a building block for multiple medical applications that could rely on an automated system to gauge individuals' states of emotion.

Although successful during his lifetime, Vaccaro currently suffers a reputation that is, at best, second rate.  Due to the hundreds of paintings attributed to Vaccaro of dubious quality, modern art historians characterize his art as \u201ceclectic\u201d and \u201cacademic.\u201d  The sole monograph on Vaccaro, Maria Commodo Izzo\u2019s Andrea Vacccaro pittore (1604-1670) published in 1951, is also sorely out of date.  This study provides a new and more accurate portrayal of the artist.  Rather than the customary all-inclusive approach, this study is based on the solid foundation of all known documents about the artist\u2019s life and art, which are gathered and analyzed in one place for the first time.  An overview of  Vaccaro\u2019s career organized in three sections provides an original assessment of the artist.  Vaccaro\u2019s early period (ca. 1604-1636) is the least documented and therefore the least understood.  An analysis of different speculations on his formation reveals the biases of those who propose them.  I also suggest a model employed by the eighteenth-century biographer Bernardo De Dominici for characterizing Vaccaro and his artistic advancement.  Vaccaro\u2019s mature (ca. 1636-1660) and late (ca. 1660-1670) periods are studded with documented artistic activity for both private and public patrons.  In my chronological discussion of the paintings, stylistic and iconographic links are made in order to revise the wide-spread perception of Vaccaro\u2019s so-called eclecticism.  The results of this study demonstrate that Vaccaro was a good painter, on par with his contemporaries Massimo Stanzione and Bernardo Cavallino.  In addition, contrary to what is believed, Vaccaro\u2019s art and reputation did not decline as he grew older and he was not immediately eclipsed by Luca Giordano. Instead, numerous prestigious church commissions, his post as the first prefetto of the renewed Corporation of Painters, and a variety of other documented activity attest to his artistic importance and the public recognition he enjoyed before he died in 1670, making him a model religious painter of the period.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [197], "author_name_tesi": "Tuck-Scala, Anna Kiyomi", "last_name_ssi": "Tuck-Scala", "middle_name_ssi": "Kiyomi", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeanne Chenault Porter", "Roland Edward Fleischer", "George L Mauner", "Alfred Angelo Triolo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeanne Chenault Porter, Committee Chair", "Roland Edward Fleischer, Committee Member", "George L Mauner, Committee Member", "Alfred Angelo Triolo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["seventeenth-century Neapolitan painting"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Broken Bridges: Disrupted Religious Participation Among the New Immigrants\n\n\n", "id": "10746", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "964", "abstract_tesi": "Increasing attention is being paid to the importance of religious congregations and their involvement in building social capital for new immigrants to the US.

The activity of eIF2B is  tightly regulated and is rate controlling with regard to global protein synthesis by impacting the  rate of the initiation phase of mRNA translation. Alterations in skeletal muscle eIF2B activity and  expression of its catalytic epsilon subunit (eIF2B&#949;) have been observed in a number of  physiological conditions where protein synthesis is altered. One objective of the dissertation was  to directly examine the effects of exogenously expressed eIF2B&#949; on GEF activity and protein  synthetic rates in rat skeletal muscle in vivo. Using electro gene transfer, a plasmid encoding  FLAG-eIF2B&#949; was transfected into the tibialis anterior (TA) of one hindlimb while the  contralateral TA received a control plasmid. Overexpression of the eIF2B&#949; subunit resulted in  increased GEF activity in TA homogenates of healthy rats demonstrating that the expressed  protein can enhance catalytic activity.  In an effort to restore a deficit in eIF2B activity, an  established model of chronic sepsis was utilized in which skeletal muscle eIF2B activity is known  to be impaired. Ectopic expression of FLAG-eIF2B&#949; in the TA rescued the sepsis-induced deficit  in eIF2B GEF activity and muscle protein synthesis. The results demonstrate that modulation of  the expression of eIF2B&#949; may be sufficient to correct deficits in skeletal muscle protein synthesis  associated with sepsis and possibly other muscle wasting conditions.    \n\tUnexpectedly, attempts at longer-term experiments revealed difficulty in maintaining  elevated expression of eIF2B&#949; in rat skeletal muscle beyond a few days despite the ability to  express other genes in muscle for several weeks. Thus, a second objective of the research was to  identify the mechanism(s) accounting for the rapid loss of exogenously expressed eIF2B&#949; protein.  Evidence obtained in this regard points to a covalent modification of the eIF2B&#949; protein  (ubiquitination) that targets it for proteasome-mediated degradation. Following co-immunoprecipitation of eIF2B&#949; with ubiquitin from lysates of C2C12 myoblasts treated with  proteasome inhibitor, tandem mass spectrometry analysis was performed to locate  posttranslational modifications on the eIF2B&#949; protein. Although the site(s) of ubiquitin  modification have not yet been identified, the mass spectrometry analysis resulted in the  identification of two novel phosphorylation sites in the rat eIF2B&#949; protein. The newly identified  mechanism for regulating eIF2B&#949; expression via the ubiquitin-proteasome system may be  particularly important with regard to its potential role in muscle wasting conditions where protein  synthesis is impaired.   \n\tStatins are a widely prescribed and effective class of lipid lowering drugs with many  beneficial effects; however, one of the less desirable side effects of statin use is the incidence of  muscle related complaints. To explore the mechanism(s) contributing to the statin-induced  alterations in protein metabolism, C2C12 myoblasts were treated with simvastatin or vehicle for  24 h. Cells exposed to simvastatin exhibited reduced rates of protein synthesis as evidenced by  [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine incorporation into protein. The reduction in protein synthesis  occurred with concomitant repression of the GEF activity of eIF2B. Simvastatin treatment also  resulted in reduced expression of several subunits of the eIF2B heteropentameric complex at the  protein level. These results suggest that repression of eIF2B expression and activity may  contribute, at least in part, to the statin-induced reduction in protein synthesis.   \n\tFinally, experiments were also undertaken to elucidate the role of the 5'- and 3'-  untranslated regions (UTRs) of the human eIF2B&#949; mRNA in the translational regulation of the  gene. Luciferase reporter constructs were generated containing the 5'- and 3'-UTRs of eIF2B&#949;,  alone or in combination, in the appropriate location relative to a firefly luciferase coding  sequence. Several cell lines were transfected with the reporter plasmids and subjected to various    cell culture conditions followed by luciferase activity assays. Similar experiments were  performed in an attempt to validate microRNAs predicted to target the 3'-UTR of eIF2B&#949;.    \n\tOverall, the work described in this dissertation contributes several novel findings for an  important point of regulation in the control of skeletal muscle protein synthesis. Specifically, the  present findings emphasize the functional significance of enhanced expression of eIF2B&#949; in  muscle and provide further insight into the regulation of its expression. Advancing our  understanding of the role of eIF2B and the regulation of expression of its subunits has important  implications for future interventions aimed at the prevention of muscle wasting. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [330], "author_name_tesi": "Tuckow, Alexander Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Tuckow", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Alexander", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Scot R Kimball", "Charles H Lang", "Lisa M Shantz", "Willard M Freeman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Committee Chair", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "Willard M Freeman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["translation initiation", "protein synthesis", "skeletal muscle"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Molecular Mobility, Morphology, and Ion Conduction in Ionomers for Electroactive Devices", "id": "14129", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7137", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A sequential study of ion-containing polymers capable of ion solvation with varied ion content, dielectric constant, and counterions is presented in this dissertation in order to compare ion transport properties in ionomers with various ionic interactions. Structure-property relationships in these ion containing polymers are defined using x-ray scattering, rheology and dielectric spectroscopy, enabling the quantification of ion transport dynamics.  Poly(ethylene oxide), (PEO) based ionomers are investigated in order to probe the relation between ion conduction and segmental relaxation, and copolymers of PEO and Poly(tetramethylene oxide), (PTMO) further develop an understanding of the trade-off between ion solvation and segmental dynamics.  Ionomers with ionic liquid counterions probe diffuse charge interactions and steric effects on ion transport, and incorporation of ionic liquids into ionomer membranes such as Nafion provides desirable thermal and ion conducting properties which extend the use of such membranes for electroactive devices.\n\nPEO ionomers exhibit a strong relation between ionic conductivity and segmental dynamics, providing insight that the glass transition temperature, Tg, dominates the ion conduction mechanism.  Increasing temperature induces aggregation of ionic groups as evidenced by the static dielectric constant and X-ray scattering as a function of temperature, revealing the contribution of ionic dipoles in the measured dielectric constant. The trade-off between ion solvation and fast polymer segmental dynamics are quantified in copolymer ionomers of PEO and lower Tg PTMO.  While conducting ion content remains nearly unchanged, conductivity is lowered upon incorporation of PTMO, because the vast majority of the PTMO microphase separates from the PEO-rich microdomain that remains continuous and contributes most of the ion conduction.  Dielectric constants and X-ray scattering show consistent changes with temperature that suggest a cascading aggregation process in Na ionomers as ionic dipoles thermally randomize and lower the measured dielectric constant of the medium, leading to further aggregation. We observe amplified microphase-separation through ionic groups preferentially solvated by PEO chains, as seen in block copolymers with added salt.  Even at 25%PEO / 75%PTMO the ionomers have VFT temperature dependence of conducting ion mobility, meaning that the 25% PEO/ion microphase is still continuous\n\nA model is developed to describe the frequency dependent storage and loss modulus and the delay in Rouse motion due to ion association lifetime, as functions of ion content and molecular weight for our low molecular weight ionomers.  The ion rearrangement relaxation in dielectric spectroscopy is clearly the ion association lifetime that controls terminal dynamics in linear viscoelasticity, allowing a simple sticky Rouse model, using the most-probable distribution based on NMR Mn, to fully describe master curves of the frequency dependent storage and loss modulus.\n\nUsing insight from ionic interaction strength, ionic liquids are used as counterions, effectively plasticizing the ionomers without added solvent.  Ionic interactions were weakened with increasing counterion size, and with modification of cations using ether-oxygen, promoting self-solvation, which increases conducting ion density by an order of magnitude.  Room temperature ionic liquids were subsequently used in combination with Nafion\u00ae membranes as electroactive substrates to correlate ion transport to morphology as a function of volume fraction of ionic liquid.  This study illuminated the critical volume uptake of ionic liquid in Nafion, identifying percolation of ionic pathways and a significant increase in dielectric constant at low frequencies, indicating an increase in the number density of ions capable of polarizing at the electrode surface.\n\nConsequently, the fundamental information obtained about the structure-property relations of ionomers can be used to predict and design advanced ion-containing polymers to be used in battery membranes and a variety of electroactive devices, including actuators and electromechanical sensors.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7127], "author_name_tesi": "Tudryn, Gregory John", "last_name_ssi": "Tudryn", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby", "James Patrick Runt", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Scott Thomas Milner", "Karen I Winey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby, Dissertation Advisor", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Scott Thomas Milner, Committee Member", "Karen I Winey, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ionomer", "PEO", "polymer physics", "actuator", "battery", "dielectric spectroscopy", "X-ray scattering", "rheology", "ionic liquid", "counterion"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "AN ASSESSMENT OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC BIOFUELS AND ELECTROFUELS TECHNOLOGIES UNDER RATE-LIMITED CONDITIONS\n", "id": "12318", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "245", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis investigates the yields and system productivities for two different biofuel production processes, where the kinetics of the systems are constrained by rate-limitations expected in commodity-scale systems.  \n\nThe system that is the subject of the first investigation is an experimental comparison of algal biomass and fuel productivities under light-limited growth, where it is hypothesized that system productivities will be a function of light-limited growth kinetics rather than the intrinsic maximum growth rate of an algal species.  Biomass and algal oil productivities were determined for two algal species -- the fast-growing, lipid-producing Chlorella vulgaris and the slow-growing, isoprene hydrocarbon-producing Botryococcus braunii -- in a continuous high-density, light-limited trickle-screen photobioreactor.  In a light-limited system, all light is being utilized to its fullest extent such that the algal growth kinetics are dominated by the rate of light available to them.  Despite an order-of-magnitude difference in the growth rates of these two algae, biomass productivities in the system conditions differed only by 10%, and the slower-growing alga (B. braunii) actually achieved slightly higher productivities.  However, the productivity of energy captured into both algal oils and biomass (determined by bomb calorimetry) were very different: B. braunii captured 2.2 times as much light energy into algal oils than C. vulgaris, and twice as much light energy into the total algal biomass (oil + non-oil cell mass).  These results highlighted the importance of species selection based on energy conversion efficiency and not intrinsic growth rate.   Because the lipid-synthesis kinetics of C. vulgaris are growth dissociated, a loop air-lift batch reactor run was executed to determine if higher lipid productivities could be achieved by the induction of lipid-synthesis under non-growth conditions, at both light-limited and non-light limited conditions.  C. vulgaris biomass and oil productivity under light-limited conditions far exceeded those in the non-light limited conditions,  which confirmed the hypothesis that maximum utilization of light (i.e., light-limited growth) was essential for maximal productivities.  C. vulgaris productivity in the batch system peaked during light-limited growth, but fell below the performance of the continuous reactor system.  While C. vulgaris lipid productivity in the light-limited batch system exceeded that found during the continuous growth, it did so by only 25%.  Furthermore, the biomass and lipid productivities peaked simultaneously when the lipid content of C. vulgaris was still very low (prior to lipid accumulation induction).  Although the lipid content of C. vulgaris increased from 6-22% by the end of the batch run, lipid productivities during this accumulation phase were still lower than those found during the active growth phase.  This emphasized that lipid productivity and not lipid content is a more important metric for assessing the performance algal fuels technologies.  \n\nThe system that is the subject of the second investigation is a theoretical \u201cElectrofuels\u201d process, where gaseous H2, O2, and CO2 are the growth substrates for chemolithoautotrophic production of isoprene hydrocarbons by Rs. eutropha or Rb. capsulatus.  The H2 and O2 are generated by abiotic electrolysis, using electricity that could be generated by solar photovoltaic cells, and serve as the electron donor and acceptor to provide energy for microbial metabolism.  The yields, productivities, and process economics of such a system were assessed theoretically to provide insight and focus towards research areas with the highest possible impact for process feasibility.  This was accomplished through the development of a modified theory of microbial energetics, based heavily upon the \u2018Electron Balance\u2019 approach originally developed by McCarty (1971; 2007); this method predicts maximum yields of microbial growth based on the relative energetics of energy generation (catabolic reactions) and cell synthesis (catabolic reactions).  Employing this approach, the maximum theoretical yields of cell and product fuel were established on each of the gaseous substrates; expressions for realistic, net fuel yields for the system were then derived based on an assumption of kinetic limitation by gas-liquid mass-transfer in a commodity-scale continuous-growth bioprocess.  This quantitative theoretical framework was utilized in the calculation of fuel yields, fuel productivities, and minimum operating costs for fuel production in a range of process conditions.  The rate of mass-transfer to the bioprocess is a critical process parameter that determines the productivity of the system.  Furthermore, it was established that a continuous growth-process siphons metabolic energy that could otherwise be used for fuel synthesis; very little of the energy contained in the H2 substrate was captured into fuel.  Therefore, high-mass transfer, low-growth perfusion-type process development and genetic manipulation for the metabolic decoupling of fuel and growth processes are important research thrusts for Electrofuels process feasibility in order to maximize the amount of substrate hydrogen utilized towards fuel synthesis.    \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [243], "author_name_tesi": "Tuerk, Amalie Lauren", "last_name_ssi": "Tuerk", "middle_name_ssi": "Lauren", "first_name_ssi": "Amalie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis", "Wayne Roger Curtis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wayne Roger Curtis, Thesis Advisor", "Wayne Roger Curtis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["renewable energy", "biofuels", "chemolithoautotrophic growth", "rhodobacter capsulatus", "ralstonia eutropha", "chlorella vulgaris", "botryococcus braunii", "mass-transfer limited growth", "light-limited growth"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "NUCLEAR HIV-1 GAG SPECIFICALLY ASSOCIATES WITH UNSPLICED VIRAL RNA DURING TRANSCRIPTION", "id": "13172kxt247", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13172", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ability for the retroviral Gag protein of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) to transiently traffic through the nucleus is well established and has been implicated in efficient genome packaging. Although Gag proteins of several other retroviruses (PFV, FIV, MPMV, MMTV, MLV, and HIV-1) have also been observed in the nucleus, little is known about the functional role their nuclear trafficking plays in viral replication. In addition to its localization in the nucleus, human immunodeficiency virus type1 (HIV-1) Gag was recently reported to associate with the HIV-1 regulatory protein Rev, which facilitates the nuclear export of the genomic viral RNA (vRNA), in nucleoli. Together with the knowledge that RSV Gag associates with its vRNA in the nucleus, it is possible that the HIV-1 Gag/Rev interaction may be mediated through the vRNA. Therefore, we investigated whether HIV-1 Gag, similarly to RSV Gag, associated with its vRNA in the nucleus. Through the use of a cell line expressing a stably integrated inducible HIV-1 provirus, we visualized HIV-1 Gag and unspliced (US) vRNA foci in the nucleus. Two-dimensional co-localization analysis and three-dimensional surface renderings revealed that nuclear HIV-1 Gag specifically co-localized with US vRNA. Interestingly, treatment of the cells with transcription inhibitors reduced the number of HIV-1 Gag and US vRNA nuclear foci observed, yet increased their co-localization. Conversely, when cells were treated with an inhibitor blocking the nuclear export of US vRNA, an increase in the number of HIV-1 Gag and US vRNA nuclear foci was observed but there was no significant change in co-localization.

Since these are main components of the political culture, a series of important questions arise: How does political culture change? Is there a single political culture, or are there different patterns of political culture? How do these patterns evolve over time? How can these patterns and their evolution be explained? The project analyzes these issues by studying the Romanian political culture from the beginning of the transition to the present time. To answer these questions I use seventeen years (from 1990 to 2006) of data which will allow me to identify the different patterns of political culture in Romania and to explain their evolution over time.  \n\nThe study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, while previous studies have focused either on a single country and a single point in time or on a group of countries and a single point in time, this study analyzes political culture change over a long period of time. The results of such an endeavor add a temporal dimension, which was not addressed in previous studies, to our understanding of political culture in postcommunist countries. \n\nSecond, while most of the existing literature studied political culture in postcommunist countries during the initial stage of the transition process (there are only a few studies that go beyond 1995), this project analyzes political culture change during the whole process of transition to democracy and market economy. The findings will indicate whether the relationships among different components of political culture identified in previous studies continue to hold, or whether they were context-specific, depending on a particular stage during the transition. \n\nFinally, the study of Romanian political culture by itself is a minor contribution to the literature. In the field of postcommunist transitions Romania is an understudied country, scholars focusing rather on the successful countries of the region (i.e. the Czech Republic, Hungary, or Poland) or on countries considered important from a policy perspective (Russia, FSU). Since Romania may be considered a representative case for the group of countries that had a late and troublesome transition (i.e. Bulgaria, Romania, and Ukraine) the project will fill a gap in our knowledge about troubled transitions and about the region. \n\nBy focusing on the attitudes of the citizens, this study aims at recognizing the important role society has in transitions to democracy and addresses \u201cthe missing agenda\u201d (Clark 2002) in the postcommunist transitions literature.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [956], "author_name_tesi": "Tufis, Claudiu Daniel", "last_name_ssi": "Tufis", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniel", "first_name_ssi": "Claudiu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Bernhard", "Lee Ann Banaszak", "Eric Plutzer", "Catherine Wanner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Bernhard, Committee Chair", "Lee Ann Banaszak, Committee Member", "Eric Plutzer, Committee Member", "Catherine Wanner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["support for democracy", "political culture", "political culture change", "Romania", "postcommunism", "transition", "Central and Eastern Europe"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF SOCIO-POLITICAL SYSTEMS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ON STATUS ATTAINMENT: FORMER SOCIALIST CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES IN COMPARISON TO WESTERN CAPITALIST COUNTRIES", "id": "7846", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4856", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using ISSP data, this study estimates and compares links among social origins and social status characteristics (education, occupation and earnings) across a range of societies and across time.

In order to test this hypothesis, the present research is organized around differences and similarities in patterns of status attainment among countries characterized by different types of socio-political organization and different degrees of economic development. In particular, the study focuses on characteristics of state socialist stratification and the question of existence of socialist effects on social stratification and characteristics of postsocialist stratification \u2013 its departures from the \u2018logic\u2019 of socialist stratification and that of capitalist stratification. In order to follow this line of research, the question of homogeneity of status attainment patterns within regions of countries characterized by similar socio-political systems and similar levels of development is also examined. The results suggest that there is no single model of capitalist stratification, or a single type of socialist stratification and a common process that describes transformations of the stratification system during the postcommunist transition in all former state socialist societies. The empirical analyses also suggest that while socialism might have had some isolated effects on status attainment processes, the effects are weak and it is not clear whether they are indeed attributable to the influence of socialist ideology and policy rather than other processes like economic development and industrialization. At the same time, the status attainment patterns characterizing statue socialist societies are not radically different from those characterizing western capitalist societies. Postcommunist effects on social stratification are also observed only in isolated cases, and stability rather than change describes the over-time trends in status attainment in the Central and Eastern European former socialist countries.

Previous seismicity studies of the Western branch in Uganda show earthquake nucleation at depths greater than or equal to 40 km suggesting that heat flow from the rift is not elevated. However, terrestrial heat flow measurements for the Western branch in Tanzania are high (~109mWm-2), similar to high average heat flow in the Eastern branch of the East African Rift System  in Kenya (100mWm-2).\nTo investigate further the depth extent of seismicity in the Western branch, seismological data were collected and analyzed to obtain accurate hypocenters using both standard and double difference location algorithms. Focal mechanisms were also obtained to place constraints on the local stress regime. Results show that seismicity is concentrated along the major border faults of the Rwenzori horst, suggesting an eastward dip on the Ruimi-Wasa Fault and a northwestward dip on the Toro-Bunyoro Fault. Fault motions are predominantly normal, with strike slip motions between the Ruimi-Wasa and Toro-Bunyoro Faults. The observed depth distribution of seismicity peaks at 16 km depth and extends to 31 km. Strength envelope models indicate that heat flow in the range of 54 mWm-2 to 66 mWm-2 is required to explain this result.  A heat flow of 54-66 mWm-2 is similar to heat flow in other mobile belts in East Africa away from major rift valleys, and is much lower than the high heat flow reported for Eastern branch in Kenya or the Western branch in Tanzania. Therefore, heat flow around the Rwenzori Mountains does not appear to be elevated. This finding does not preclude the possibility of a deep seated (i.e., mantle) thermal anomaly beneath the rift, which simply may not have had sufficient time to reach the surface.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1925], "author_name_tesi": "Tugume, Fred Alex", "last_name_ssi": "Tugume", "middle_name_ssi": "Alex", "first_name_ssi": "Fred", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heat flow", "seismicty"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE PRECAMBRIAN CRUSTAL STRUCTURE OF EAST AFRICA", "id": "12432", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13239", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nIn this thesis, the Precambrian crustal structure of East African is investigated along with the crustal structures of three Cenozoic rift basins located in the western branch of the East African Rift System (EARS).  In the first part of the thesis, P-wave receiver functions are modeled using the H-k method to obtain new insights about the bulk composition and thickness of the crust for Precambrian terrains throughout East Africa. The average crustal thickness for all but one of the terrains is between 37 and 39 km. An exception is the Ubendian terrain, which has an average crustal thickness 42 km. In all terrains, the average Poisson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratio is similar, ranging from 0.25 to 0.26, indicating a bulk crustal composition that is felsic to intermediate.  The main finding of this study is that crustal structure is similar across all terrains, which span more than 4.0 Ga of earth history. There is no discernable difference in the crustal thicknesses and Poisson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratios between the Archean and Proterozoic terrains, or between the Proterozoic terrains, unlike the variability in Precambrian crustal structure found in many other continents.\n\tIn the second part of the thesis, a joint inversion of Rayleigh wave phase and group velocities and receiver functions was used to investigate the shear wave velocity structure of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath the Precambrian terrains of East Africa. In comparison with other areas of similar age in southern and western Africa where the same joint inversion method has been applied, I find that while there is little difference in the mean shear wave velocities for the entire crust across all of the Precambrian terrains, and also few differences in the thickness of the crust, there exists substantial variability in lower crustal structure. This variability is reflected primarily in the thickness of the lower crustal layers with shear wave velocities &#8805; 4.0 km/s. This variability is found both within terrains of the same age (i.e., Archean) as well as terrains of different ages. In global studies of continental crustal structure, it is shown that high velocity (Vp ~ 7km/s and Vs ~4.0 km/s) lower crustal layers indicate the presence of mafic rocks, and that such layers are common in most Precambrian terrains. In contrast, my results show large variability in lower crustal structure between terrains of similar age within Africa, suggesting that making generalizations about the structure and evolution of continental crust based on global averages of the crustal velocity structure is difficult to do. The results of this study indicate that the local geological history of each terrain can lead to significant variability in crustal structure, making the use of global averages less representative of global processes than previously thought. \nIn the third part of this thesis, forward modeling of receiver functions is used to investigate the crustal structure beneath three of the rift basins in the western branch of the East African Rift System (Lake Albert, Lake Edward and the northern part of the Lake Malawi rifts). Modeling results reveal sediment thickness of about 1 km beneath stations BUTI and KATE, located at the margins of the Lake Albert and Lake Edward rifts, respectively, and about 1.5 km beneath station KYLA in the northern part of the Lake Malawi rift. The Poisson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratio obtained (0.4) indicate that the sediments are poorly consolidated. A thin sedimentary layer (1 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 1.5 km) and high Poisson\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratio is consistent with the young age (Miocene) of the rift basins. The Ps from the Moho cannot be easily identified because the first 5-6 sec of data are dominated by the Ps conversion from the sediment-bedrock interface and its reverberations. Therefore crustal thickness beneath these stations remains unknown.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12786], "author_name_tesi": "Tugume, Fred Alex", "last_name_ssi": "Tugume", "middle_name_ssi": "Alex", "first_name_ssi": "Fred", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew A.

This dissertation presents design, optimization, and testing of novel, monolithic, contact-aided compliant mechanisms with nonlinear stiffness. They are called compliant spine, bend-and-sweep compliant element and twist compliant element. Such mechanisms have been designed to achieve passive wing morphing of flapping wing unmanned aerial vehicles or ornithopters thus improving their steady level flight performance. Ornithopters have a unique potential in revolutionizing both civil and military sectors.\n\nA compliant spine is a novel contact-aided compliant mechanism with nonlinear stiffness\nin the bending direction alone. Such a mechanism is very flexible when bent in one direction and is very stiff when bent in the other direction because of contact. This mechanism was designed to achieve passive bending of ornithopter wings during upstroke, while remaining fully extended and rigid during downstroke. The bend-and-sweep compliant element has nonlinear stiffness in two orthogonal directions, namely, bending and sweep directions. This mechanism was designed\nto achieve simultaneous passive bending and sweep of ornithopter wings during upstroke. During downstroke, this mechanism is very stiff in both bending and sweep directions because of contact, thus causing the wings to remain fully extended. Finally, twist compliant mechanism was\ndesigned to achieve passive twisting of ornithopters wings during upstroke. This mechanism is very flexible when twisted in the counter-clockwise direction but is very stiff when twisted in the clockwise direction because of contact between the parts of the mechanism.\n\nTo design these contact-aided compliant mechanisms for ornithopter applications a new\ndesign optimization procedure was developed as part of this research. This procedure involves\nsolving a multi-objective optimization problem using genetic algorithms with geometrical\nconstraints. The objectives of the optimization problem were to minimize the mass and maximum\nvon Mises stress while maximizing the deflections observed. The optimization problem was solved for compliant spine, bend-and-sweep compliant element and twist compliant element\nusing numerical computing software, MATLAB and finite element software, ANSYS. The optimal solutions obtained from the optimization procedures were then fabricated and tested.\n\nBased on the optimization results for compliant spine and bend-and-sweep compliant elements, it was found that adding a compliant joint adds a small amount of mass but decreases their stiffness at the same time. The thickness of the optimal compliant hinges is dependent on the\ntype of loads applied on the compliant elements. Based on the optimization results for twist compliant element, it was found that stiffness of a twist compliant element in its flexible direction is independent of the number of sectors while its stiffness in the stiff direction is dependent on the number of sectors and the thickness of the sectors.\n\nTesting of the compliant spine and bend-and-sweep compliant elements was done by our collaborators Ms. Aimy Wissa and Dr. James E. Hubbard Jr. at University of Maryland, College Park. Bench top testing of compliant spine showed that it results in a decrease in the power consumption of an ornithopter by 45% and increase its lift by 16%. Ornithopters with compliant spines were also successfully free flight tested at Air Force Research Lab - Wright Patterson Air Base indoor flight facility. Bench testing of the bend-and-sweep compliant element showed that simultaneous, passive bending and sweep of ornithopter wings is possible. The twist compliant element was tested for its nonlinear stiffness in the twisting direction.\n\nFinally, a mathematical model using rods and springs was developed to represent the leading edge spar of an ornithopter with bending compliant elements in it. Equations of motion\nfor the mathematical model were derived using Newtonian mechanics and solved numerically. A\nshape matching optimization problem was formulated and solved to determine optimal locationsof bending compliant elements in the leading edge spar thus achieving shape tailoring of ornithopters wings during the whole flapping cycle.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9117], "author_name_tesi": "Tummala, Yashwanth ", "last_name_ssi": "Tummala", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yashwanth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker", "George A Lesieutre", "Matthew B Parkinson", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker, Dissertation Advisor", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member", "Matthew B Parkinson, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Design optimization", "compliant mechanisms", "passive morphing", "ornithopters", "contact-aided compliant mechanisms"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Just Remembering: The Experience of Rhetoric and Public Memory\n", "id": "8887", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4466", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In Just Remembering: The Experience of Rhetoric and Public Memory, I analyze how the rhetoric of public memory texts is experienced, how such experience informs the character and practices of ethics, politics, and justice in the United States, and how we might re-experience public memory in a way that does it justice.

Piezoelectric ultrasonic motors were selected as the target actuator schemes because of their unbeatable characteristics in the meso-scale range, which covers the structure sizes from hundred micrometers to ten millimeters and with operating ranges from few nanometers to centimeters.\n\nIn order to meet the objectives and the design constraints, a number of key research tasks had to be undertaken. The design constraints and objectives were so stringent and entangled that none of the existing methods in literature could solve the research problems individually. Therefore, several unique methods were established to accomplish the research objectives. The methods produced novel solutions at every stage of design, development and modeling of the multi functional micro ultrasonic motor.\n\nSpecifically, an ultrasonic motor utilizing slanted ceramics on a brass rod was designed. Because of the unique slanted ceramics design, longitudinal and torsional mode vibration modes could be obtained on the same structure. A ring shaped mobile element was loosely fitted on the metal rod stator. The mobile element moved in translational or rotational, depending on whether the vibration mode was longitudinal or torsional.\n\nA new ultrasonic motor drive method was required because none of the existing ultrasonic motor drive techniques were able to provide both output modes in a compact and cylindrical structure with the use of single drive source. By making use of rectangular wave drive signals, saw-tooth shaped displacement profile could be obtained at longitudinal and torsional resonance modes. Thus, inheriting the operating principle of smooth impact drive method, a new resonance type inertial drive was introduced. This new technique combines the advantages of inertial method with resonance drive. The motor that combines inertial drive at resonance will be a new type of ultrasonic motor, according to the classification of vibration types.\n\nA method to analyze the stator vibration by incorporating the piezoelectric loss coefficients was developed. By using the model, natural frequencies of the operating modes were predicted and exact formulations of the vibration displacements in longitudinal and torsional modes were obtained. The vibration model was in perfect agreement with the ATILA finite element analysis simulations even for different design parameters. The model was also used in design optimization and for theoretical explanation of the newly introduced motor drive technique. The theoretical analysis of the operating principle was verified with finite element analysis simulations and by vibration measurements.\n\nSeveral prototypes of motor were built in order to realize the dual function output as the main objective of this research. Translational output was observed for rectangular wave input signals at the resonance frequency of the fundamental longitudinal mode.The output mode changed to the rotational mode when the operating frequency switched for the fundamental torsional mode. While the mode of motor could be switched by switching the operating frequency, the direction of motion could be reversed by switching the duty cycle of rectangular input signals from D% to (100-D)%. A prototype (5 mm diameter, 25 mm total length produced 55 mm/s (translational) and 3 rad/s (rotary) speed under 40 mN blocking force, when the input signal was 40 Vpp rectangular with 33% duty cycle. The motor speed at translational mode was characterized for different input voltage and output force.\n\nThe meso-scale ultrasonic motor which utilizes smooth impact drive method, provided a unique ability to produce dual function with prominent output characteristics in a compact structure by using simple drive conditions.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5878], "author_name_tesi": "Tuncdemir, Safakcan ", "last_name_ssi": "Tuncdemir", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Safakcan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino", "Kenji Uchino", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Clive A Randall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenji Uchino, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Louis Schiano, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["2-dof", "piezoelectric", "ultrasonic motor", "translation", "rotary", "slanted"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Characterization of a novel phenotypic neurotransmitter plasticity in the central nervous system  \n", "id": "8650", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5730", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Neurotransmitter phenotype for a given neuron is determined not only by intrinsic but also extrinsic factors during development. While intrinsic factors might be responsible for the majority of neurotransmitter phenotype, the role of extrinsic factors has been explored but the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, we report an inducible plasticity of inhibitory neurotransmitter phenotype after alteration of postsynaptic receptors together with cell adhesion molecules.  In embryonic hypothalamic cultures, inhibitory neurotransmission is mediated by GABAergic neurons only. Although no glycinergic currents can be detected in pure neuronal cultures, functional glycinergic synapses are inducible in cocultured HEK 293T cells expressing glycine receptors (GlyRs) and a cell adhesion molecule neuroligin-2 (NL-2). In fact, mixed GABAergic and glycinergic synapses are formed on HEK 293T cells that co-express NL-2, GlyRs and GABAA-Rs.  Importantly, hypothalamic neurons do express high level of GlyRs  in addition to GABAA-Rs. Ectopic expression of NL-2 or GlyRs alone in hypothalamic neurons cannot change the GABAergic transmitter phenotype. However, coexpression of NL-2 and GlyRs in hypothalamic neurons induces robust functional glycinergic synapses in hypothalamic cultures. Moreover, both homomeric and heteromeric GlyRs can be clustered at the postsynaptic sites of induced synapses. Our data reveal that molecular manipulation of postsynaptic receptor organization, not receptor expression, is critical in altering the neurotransmission phenotype. Such inducible plasticity in central neurons also suggests that brain function is much flexible in adapting to extrinsic signals. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5724], "author_name_tesi": "Tuncdemir, Sebnem Nur", "last_name_ssi": "Tuncdemir", "middle_name_ssi": "Nur", "first_name_ssi": "Sebnem", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gong Chen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gong Chen, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["glycine", "GABA", "Inducible plasticity", "co-transmission"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Labor Market Transitions of Involuntary Part-time Workers:How Hard Is It To Get Back To Full-time Jobs?\n", "id": "7505", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4837", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In 2006, 3% of the total labor force worked part-time because they could not find enough work.

Moreover, gender and residential disadvantages exist for those who want longer hours, i.e., women are less likely to move into full-time jobs than men and workers who live in central cities and non-metro areas are less likely to find full-time jobs than their suburban counterparts.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4814], "author_name_tesi": "Tunceli, Ozgur ", "last_name_ssi": "Tunceli", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ozgur", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis", "Stephen Michael Smith", "Stephan J Goetz", "Amy Glasmeier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis, Committee Chair", "Stephen Michael Smith, Committee Member", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Member", "Amy Glasmeier, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multinomial probit models", "labor market transitions", "involuntary part-time labor", "CPS"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Haloacetic acid removal by granular activated carbon", "id": "6386", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2366", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Haloacetic acids (HAAs) are disinfection by-products (DBPs) in drinking water and are regulated under the Stage 1 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rules (D/DBP) by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The most popular methods for DBP control included enhanced coagulation/softening processes. Granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption is also widely used for the removal of HAA precursors. Several studies revealed that HAAs could be removed by biologically active carbon (BAC). The purpose of this study is to explore the processes of HAA removal by activated carbon adsorption and biodegradation in drinking water systems. \nThe adsorption capacities of GAC were determined by adsorption isotherms and revealed that the adsorption process plays only a minor role in HAA removal. Several bioactivity inhibition factors were applied to BAC columns and the reduction in bioactivities verified that biodegradation is the major avenue of HAA removal. Chloride released from HAAs incubated with BAC indicated that a complete dehalogenation took place with corresponding depletion of the HAA compounds. This further confirms that the major means for HAA removal in BAC column involved biological dehalogenation and biodegradation. The BAC biofilm community structure was also explored. From the ribosomal intergenic spacer region analysis, biofilm diversity was greater at the beginning of the GAC filter operation. With biofilm development, HAA removal commenced. When the bacterial community stabilized, HAA removal efficiency achieved steady state. \nThis research will provide water professionals with a better understanding of the process of HAA removal by GAC in water treatment and assist water systems in complying with D/DBP rules. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2351], "author_name_tesi": "Tung, Hsin-hsin ",

Novel therapies, especially non-pharmacological, lifestyle-based interventions that prevent or slow metastatic disease with less severe side effects are greatly needed. Numerous lifestyle factors (including dietary components, body weight, and physical activity patterns) significantly impact BC risk and survival. Emerging population data suggests an inverse relation between physical activity and BC incidence, as well as an important role for exercise in the prevention of cancer recurrence and mortality. The observational nature of these studies limit the ability to determine biological mechanisms and the extent to which exercise, as opposed to changes in body weight, drive beneficial effects. Additionally, very little is known about the mechanisms contributing to the relation between physical activity and survival. Given the importance of metastases in the mortality of women with BC, understanding the role of exercise on metastatic burden may reveal important new targets for secondary and tertiary cancer prevention. \n\nThe aim of study one was to control for weight and examine the effects of exercise, mild dietary restriction, or the combination of diet and exercise on the inflammation-immune axis and tumor progression in a preclinical metastatic BC model to determine the extent to which exercise or body weight contribute to cancer prevention. Dietary energy restriction-induced weight control (i.e., SED+ER mice) was effective at altering host splenic immunity and the expression of key genes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) related to immunosuppression and metastatic progression; however, this intervention failed to induce changes in primary tumor growth or spontaneous metastases. Moderate exercise in weight stable mice (EX+ER) resulted in a similar reduction in immunosuppressive and metastatic genes in the TME compared with the SED+ER mice; however, in addition, EX+ER mice had the greatest reduction in splenic immunosuppressive cells and plasma insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). The effects of moderate exercise in weight stable mice culminated in a significant delay in primary tumor growth and spontaneous metastases, suggesting that exercise-induced alterations in metabolic drivers of tumorigenesis, not simply a change in body weight, underlie the protective effects in the dual intervention group. Interestingly the exercise-induced protective effect on the emergence of immunosuppressive factors and reduced tumor burden was lost when mice continued to gain weight over the course of the study, suggesting that weight gain-induced disturbances on hormonal, inflammatory, and/or immunological function can override the exercise-induced benefits. Collectively, study one provided a deeper understanding of the extent to which exercise, and changes in body weight, underlies cancer protection. \n\nFew researchers have examined the effect of energy balance interventions on the efficacy of immunotherapeutic strategies. Two subsequent studies were designed to investigate the response to emerging cancer therapeutics in mice randomized to an energy balance paradigm (i.e., sedentary, ad libitum, weight gain [WG] group vs. exercising, mild dietary restriction, weight maintenance [WM] group) to identify potential mechanisms and provide translational support. \n\nStudy two aimed to determine if there were any additive effects of moderate exercise in weight stable mice and the therapeutic administration of a broad-based, allogeneic, whole tumor cell cancer vaccine (VAX). There was a significant effect of both WM and VAX alone on primary tumor growth; and an additive effect of WM+VAX on primary tumor growth, lung and heart spontaneous metastases, splenocyte count at sacrifice, the number of total splenic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and granulocytic subset of MDSCs, and plasma levels of IGF-1. Splenic interferon gamma (IFN) secretion in response to re-stimulation with tumor antigens was significantly elevated in response to VAX and WM; however, there was no additive effect of WM+VAX. These results suggested that our whole tumor cell cancer vaccine augmented the weight maintenance (via diet and exercise) effects on primary tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis; and suggested that vaccination may provide an immune stimulus to further promote the protective effects of moderate exercise alone in the metastatic 4T1.2 mammary tumor model.\n\nStudy three aimed to determine if there were any additive effects of moderate exercise in weight stable mice and the dual therapeutic administration of a whole tumor cell cancer vaccine and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) checkpoint blockade. We observed a cancer prevention effect of PD-1 checkpoint blockade in WG mice on primary tumor growth and spontaneous lung metastasis. However, moderate activity in weight stable mice, independent of PD-1 checkpoint blockade, was effective in reducing primary tumor growth and metastatic burden. The WM+PD-1 group displayed the lowest number of splenic MDSCs and granulocytic MDSCs and maintained its splenic lymphoid populations. Neither the number of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, the effector or activation status of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ helper and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, nor functional outcomes were significantly different between groups. PD-1 checkpoint blockade in WG mice, moderate exercise in weight stable mice, and PD-1 checkpoint blockade in moderately exercising, weight stable mice showed comparable, albeit subtle differences, in tumor-immune crosstalk gene expression markers that drive the expansion of immunosuppressive cell types and impact metastatic progression. The lack of responsiveness to VAX+PD-1 checkpoint blockade in WM mice suggests that moderate exercise in weight stable mice may be enhancing antitumor immunity and/or reducing protumorigenic factors (i.e., similar mechanisms mediated by VAX+PD-1 checkpoint blockade). \n\nResults from the current studies provided insight into the extent to which exercise in weight stable mice underlie cancer protection. Also, results provided insight into potential mechanisms by which exercise can act via the inflammation-immune axis to attenuate the generation of a protumorigenic and immunosuppressive TME. These data demonstrated that preventing weight gain through diet and exercise may be an important recommendation to maintain prolonged antitumor effector responses and improve clinical outcomes. Results from the current studies provided insight into potential mechanisms by which physical activity exerts primary and secondary cancer prevention effects and provides a biological rationale for randomized clinical trials to investigate physical activity strategies to prevent metastatic progression in BC survivors and ultimately improve survival outcomes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14972], "author_name_tesi": "Turbitt, William James", "last_name_ssi": "Turbitt", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative and Biomedical Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Connie Jo Rogers", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Matam Vijay Kumar", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Andrea Marie Mastro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Connie Jo Rogers, Dissertation Advisor", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Chair", "Matam Vijay Kumar, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cancer immunology", "exercise", "energy balance", "4T1.2 model", "metastasis", "mammary tumor model"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "NONAXISYMMETRIC ENDWALL CONTOURING AND LEADING EDGE MODIFICATIONS ON TURBINE NOZZLE GUIDE VANES\n", "id": "12569", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4814", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The three main sources of the total pressure deficit in a turbine stage are profile loss, leakage loss, and the endwall boundary layer loss. The total pressure loss related to endwall boundary layer in a turbine passage may represent about one third of the total loss measured. The endwall loss definition involves the secondary flows such as the horseshoe vortex, passage vortex, and the cross-passage flow from the pressure surface to the suction surface. Researchers have been trying various methods to reduce the effect of these flow structures. The successful approaches for meaningful aerodynamic improvements can be counted as the axisymmetric/nonaxisymmetric endwall contouring, blade leading edge modifications, using shape optimized blades, and the insertion of endwall fences.\n\nOne of the promising methods for reducing the secondary flows in a turbine stage is the nonaxisymmetric endwall contouring. Besides the improvement with axial endwall contouring having cylindrical endwalls, nonaxisymmetric contouring could significantly contribute to the energy efficiency in turbomachinery systems. The modern turbine stages with reduced blade count could undergo additional secondary flow losses which can be counteracted by nonaxisymmetric endwall contouring. Additionally, the aerodynamic losses related to the horseshoe vortex can be minimized using a leading edge (LE) fillet, which fills the intersection of the nozzle guide vane (NGV) and the hub endwall. It forms a smooth transition from the NGV leading edge to the endwall surface. These LE fillets improve the aerodynamics of the flow and the heat transfer effectiveness, as well.\n\nThe main goal of this study was to minimize the secondary flows by developing methods such as designing nonaxisymmetric endwall contouring and LE fillets. The study is unique in itself because it was performed in the well simulated turbine stage, the Axial Flow Turbine Research Facility (AFTRF), that is including an actual rotor. Many current studies of this sort were performed either in linear cascade facilities with no rotor influence or isolated annular NGV cascades. The procedure was to evaluate the new conceptual designs computationally, perform experimental investigations, and compare the simulation results with the experimental data for validation and further analysis. The AFTRF installed at the Turbomachinery Aero-Heat Transfer Laboratory of the Pennsylvania State University is a low speed, single-stage, cold flow turbine having a diameter of 91.66cm. It has a stationary NGV assembly with 23 vanes and a High Pressure (HP) turbine rotor row with 29 blades. The NGV inlet and exit Reynolds numbers based on midspan axial chord are around 300000 and 900000, respectively. The current research presented the total pressure measurements at a plane perpendicular to the axial direction, between the NGV and the rotor blade. The measurements were taken by a Kiel probe which was highly insensitive to yaw and pitch angles of the flow. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) evaluations were accomplished by a commercial finite-volume viscous flow solver which was based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equation model.\n\nThe computational validation of the baseline case was achieved by comparing the CFD results with the already available experimental data of a previous researcher. This validation showed the difference of the grid structure type and the body fitted, multi-block structured mesh was found to be superior to the unstructured grid. The flow transition effect and the influence of corner fillets at the vane-endwall junction were also studied. The CFD validation also reported that it was necessary to include the rotating domain in the simulations. Another important criterion to be included was the rim seal leakage flow. The consideration of these two parameters in the simulation improved the agreement of the CFD results with the experimental measurements.\n\nThe contoured endwall and the LE fillet designs were manufactured using stereolithography (SLA) technique. The SLA models of the designs were installed at the AFTRF and tested experimentally. The contoured endwall successfully reduced the crossflows from the pressure side to the suction side of the vane. Also, LE fillets achieved to minimize the horseshoe vortex formation. The experimental results showed 15.06% total pressure loss reduction, while CFD estimated a 7.11% reduction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4791], "author_name_tesi": "Turgut, Ozhan Hulusi", "last_name_ssi": "Turgut", "middle_name_ssi": "Hulusi", "first_name_ssi": "Ozhan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci", "Cengiz Camci", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Deborah A Levin", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Dissertation Advisor", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Chair", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Deborah A Levin, Committee Member", "Anil Kamalakant Kulkarni, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nonaxisymmetric endwall contouring", "secondary flows", "gas turbine", "leading edge fillets"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "MOLECULAR AND ISOTOPIC INVESTIGATIONS OF THE BIOGEOCHEMISTRY \nOF ARCHAEAL ETHER LIPIDS\n", "id": "7400", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "994", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Once thought to inhabit only extreme environments, the Archaea are now known to occur globally in oceans, marshes, lakes, sediments, and soils. Archaea abundance and metabolic diversity link these microbes to important biogeochemical transformations. Archaea also generate abundant and diagnostic membrane lipids that are widespread in modern environments as well as the sedimentary record. These lipid compounds offer important evidence for past Archaea distribution and activity, and are a key means for understanding archaeal contributions to biogeochemical cycles, especially carbon and nitrogen, over Earth\u2019s history. \nTo link records of naturally occurring lipid to their biological and metabolic origins, I studied archaeal lipid distributions from a global set of modern waters in order to test the hypothesis that specific lipid assemblages will correspond to specific genotypic groups. Cluster analysis showed that marine lipid distribution patterns fell into two groups: the epipelagic zone and mesopelagic/upwelling zones. Multivariate analysis with environmental data showed that nitrate concentrations largely explained the variation observed within these two marine groups, thereby linking metabolism to the archaeal lipid distributions ultimately in preserved sediments. In the more extreme gradient from marine to hypersaline environments, differences in lipid assemblages form the basis of a novel paleosalinity indicator, the \u201carchaeaol/caldarchaeol ecometric\u201d (ACE). The robust linear relationship between ACE and salinity in modern environments can be applied to ancient sedimentary organic matter deposited in the Mediterranean prior to the Messinian Salinity Crisis (5.7 Ma). ACE-based salinity values are consistent with mineral and faunal evidence of salinity increases, and complement bulk organic and isotopic geochemical records of differences in productivity and carbon cycling in the lead up to the Messinian Salinity Crisis. Finally, targeting the hydrogen (for hydrological reconstruction) and carbon (for metabolic reconstruction) isotope compositions of archaeal lipids requires a method capable of measuring isotope ratios in these large and non-volatile lipid compounds. I describe the method development for the analysis of isolated compounds using continuous flow elemental analysis isotope ratio mass spectrometry, with the critical step of concentrating the gas effluent through cryogenic refocusing in order to reduce sample size requirements. Thus far, sample sizes have been reduced by several orders of magnitude. Memory effects and isotopic fractionation within the thermal conversion-elemental analyzer for hydrogen isotope analysis currenly hinder precision and accuracy. However, isotope analysis in the nanomolar range is now possible for carbon and nitrogen. This novel technique, Nano-EA-irMS, will allow studies of the isotopic properties of compounds which could not previously be analyzed. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [984], "author_name_tesi": "Turich, Courtney Hanna", "last_name_ssi": "Turich", "middle_name_ssi": "Hanna", "first_name_ssi": "Courtney", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman", "Maryann Victoria Bruns", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Christopher Howard House", "Daniel Jones"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Chair", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member", "Daniel Jones, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Archaea", "Lipids", "TEX86", "isotopes"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Transient Structural Analyses Using Frequency-Domain Computations and Fourier Transform Techniques\n", "id": "10694", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1446", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Structural-acoustic calculations are most often performed in the frequency-domain assuming time-harmonic (i.e. steady-state) forcing functions.  While frequency-domain modeling can be used for most calculations, some problems in engineering and acoustics are inherently transient.  In these cases, it becomes important to model the response of the structure in the time-domain, a task that can be difficult given existing frequency-domain solution infrastructure and certain frequency-domain specific types of damping.  The purpose of this thesis is to establish techniques and guidelines for frequency-domain analyses by documenting time-domain solution accuracy for frequency-domain data transformed using the Fourier Transform.  These guidelines have been developed by comparing time-domain solutions that are known to be accurate with transformed frequency-domain calculations first for a simple spring mass system, and then a more complex system where the finite element method is used to compute the response.  \nThe primary guidelines involve setting frequency range and frequency resolution to values that are computationally efficient, yet still produce accurate results once transformed into the time-domain.  Frequency range must be set based on the highest modal frequency of interest so its waveform is well resolved in the time-domain.   Frequency resolution is tied directly to the damping of the system.  The sharpest modal peak in a frequency-domain response will dictate frequency resolution, which will be set to produce accurate time-domain amplitudes.  Computational savings will come mostly from limiting the modal frequency analysis range and zero-padding portions of the linear spectrum, sacrificing total sample duration in the final time-domain response and interpolating rather than directly computing certain parts of the frequency-domain response.  These techniques allow for transient problems to be solved using frequency-domain results without having to create new time-domain specific analysis programs.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1433], "author_name_tesi": "Turkosz, Daniel John", "last_name_ssi": "Turkosz", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Brian Fahnline", "John Brian Fahnline"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Brian Fahnline, Thesis Advisor", "John Brian Fahnline, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["structural acoustics", "computational acoustics", "frequency-domain", "time-domain", "fourier transform", "transient", "acoustics", "finite element method", "damping"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "FRIENDS OF BILL W.: THE STORIES OF HOW EIGHT MEN FOUND \u201cA NEW PAIR OF GLASSES\u201d THROUGH TRANSFORMATIONAL LEARNING ", "id": "12301", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4467", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this qualitative study the primary researcher utilized research methods of heuristic phenomenology in order to better understand the experience of recovery for a group of male participants.

Despite the contribution that relatedness or similarity plays in forming false memories, no one has systematically measured or paid close attention to the perceptual relatedness of items in false memory studies. Measuring relatedness of critical lures (i.e., how related is a chair shown at encoding to other non-studied chairs shown at retrieval that produce false alarms) can provide information on item relatedness contributes to the development of false memories. Using a modified perceptual false memory paradigm, the current study aimed to elucidate the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying both true and false memory retrieval, as well as the influence of perceptual relatedness of lures on false retrieval, in a sample of young adults. Our results converge with previous studies in finding that true and false memories engage many of the same regions, when relatedness is not considered. Furthermore, we replicated previous research showing that there is distinct neural activity supporting true versus false memories. Altogether, similar to previous studies, our study revealed true memories, compared to false memories, to be associated with regions involved in evaluation, accurate reconstruction, and recapitulation of item-specific details of the encoding event. In contrast, gist processing, monitoring, and decision-making regions accompanied false memories, suggestion the strong involvement of gist-based level processing. Unique to our study, we also examined the role of systematic increases in perceptual relatedness/similarity in false memories on neural recruitment supporting false memories. Together, results revealed many perceptual and constructive processes that contribute to false memories, identifying unique regions within the false retrieval network that modulated related false memories, as a function of relatedness.

The development of metamaterials exemplifies this pursuit; metamaterial devices, such as materials with a negative index of refraction (NIM) where light `travels' backwards or low-index media where the effective phase velocity exceeds the speed of light, allow interactions with electromagnetic fields in ways unavailable to devices constructed from conventional materials. These properties are used to improve the operation of existing systems and also allow the creation of entirely new optical and electromagnetic devices. Thin slabs composed of negative-index materials, for example, can be used as near-field imaging lenses that can resolve details in the structure being imaged that are smaller than a wavelength in the medium. Metamaterials research is being performed for all regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, from applications in the LF to Microwave, IR, and optical devices. Metamaterials are useful for the improvement of antenna and radiation characteristics, with the capability to exert precise control over the behavior of the electromagnetic field within a region. \n\nThis thesis describes the development of a microwave metamaterial for the implementation of a far-field collimating flat lens for use with a crossed-dipole antenna. The lens must be constructed from a material with an index of refraction that is nearly zero, a property that does not exist in natural materials. Thus, a metamaterial is required. The design and selection of appropriate unit cell structures are described, along with descriptions of unit cells that were tested and found to be inadequate. Like most microwave metamaterials, the lens uses printed circuit board (PCB) technology for straightforward fabrication and implementation. The final metamaterial design was simulated as a finite lens to confirm correct operation; the metamaterial lens improves the gain of the original crossed-dipole antenna by 6dB, without excessive return loss or absorption loss in the lens.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2938], "author_name_tesi": "Turpin, Jeremiah Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Turpin", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Jeremiah", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner", "Douglas Henry Werner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner, Thesis Advisor", "Douglas Henry Werner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["split-ring resonator", "crossed-dipole antenna", "metamaterials"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A Switchable Magnetic Low-index Metamaterial for use in a Dynamically Reconfigurable Beam-scanning Lens Antenna with a Single Feed", "id": "23268", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10511", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Metamaterials and Transformation Optics (TO) have been used to design and implement many novel electromagnetic devices that can achieve effects not possible using conventional materials.

A cylindrical slab of zero-index magnetic metamaterial controls the radiation pattern by altering the effective shape of the lens through switching of selected regions 'off' to emulate free-space conditions. A design for a switchable metamaterial is presented that allows for digital control over its bulk properties, from near-zero-index to near-free-space at the targeted operational frequency. Extensive modeling and simulations were performed for the design of the lens and metamaterial and during the analysis of measurement results. Initial prototypes of the tunable metamaterial were fabricated and characterized to confirm the original measurements, and the design updated to incorporate the measured data. These measurements were performed using custom test fixtures manufactured specifically for this project. Finally, a simplified prototype lens was manufactured and characterized in an anechoic as a proof-of-concept for the design. \nThis dissertation presents the lens and metamaterial specifications, as well as the design process and considerations that were determined for practical tunable and reconfigurable metamaterials. Although the focus is on the particular example of the beam-scanning reconfigurable antenna, the analysis and modeling methods presented here are applicable to any reconfigurable metamaterial application. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10160], "author_name_tesi": "Turpin, Jeremiah Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Turpin", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Jeremiah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner", "Douglas Henry Werner", "Pingjuan Li Werner", "Victor P Pasko", "Douglas Edward Wolfe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Chair", "Pingjuan Li Werner, Committee Member", "Victor P Pasko, Committee Member", "Douglas Edward Wolfe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electromagnetics", "antennas", "reconfigurable pattern antennas", "metamaterial", "Transformation Optics"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "A QUANTIFIED METHOD OF DISTINGUISHING PATTERNS IN SESSILE DROPLETS OF WHOLE HUMAN BLOOD ", "id": "15173axt348", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15173", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The drying of liquid droplets on solid substrates has been a growing area of discussion \nin modern research due to vast increases of application in industry and nature.

The overall aim of this project was to evaluate the role of EBNA-3A in the pathogenesis of EBV infection, specifically within a newly characterized subset of Burkitt Lymphoma (BL) exhibiting a W promoter-restricted form of latency (Wp-R BL), and in lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) that express Type III latency. By using RNAi, we found that EBNA-3A was essential for the proliferation of both Wp-R BL and LCLs, such that knock-down of EBNA-3A resulted in rapid loss of proliferation proceeded by progressive apoptosis. Following EBNA-3A knock-down, the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 increased, and correlated with the onset of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Importantly, the related viral protein, EBNA-3C, was not essential for the proliferation of Wp-R BL, whereas it has been shown by other laboratories to be essential for LCL proliferation, with no effect on p21. Furthermore, knock-down of EBNA-3A in these two different latently infected cell lines resulted in hypophosphorylation of the Retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which is indicative of its activation, and over time, resulted in its depletion. Notably, in the literature, elevated p21 expression is associated with hypophosphorylation and depletion of Rb, suggesting that in our system p21 may be responsible for these effects on Rb. Thus, we concluded that EBNA-3A contributes to the pathogenesis of EBV by repressing p21, inactivating Rb and promoting cell proliferation. Importantly, this is the first unique function identified for EBNA-3A that is distinct from EBNA-3C.

While a number of studies have focused on the vulnerabilities and urban problems associated with this pattern, the dynamics of internal migration with emphasis on young people in a slum setting have not been explored. To accomplish the goal of understanding the dynamics of internal migration among young people from the north of Ghana to Old Fadama, an Accra slum in the south, three specific objectives have been pursued. First, the dissertation explores the reasons behind the movement of young people over long distances to the slum and identifies the stressors and risks encountered during the journey and at the destination. It examines what is proposed by the migrants themselves to improve their lives. Second, I explore the self-rated resilience of young migrants to the stressors encountered at the destination. Third, I assess the determinants of return migration propensities among the young people in a high-risk environment. I employ a mixed-method approach (focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, key informant interviews, and surveys) with a sample of young people of Old Fadama and with personnel of a government and a non-government agency. A variety of analysis methods were used including thematic analysis, one-way analysis of variance, chi-square tests, and ordinal logistic regressions. The findings from thematic analysis suggest that 1) environmentally-induced migration due to poor crop yields and 2) a lack of confidence in farming as a viable livelihood, arguably an economic factor, are major push factors of migration, in addition to the already established economic, social, and political factors. The findings further suggest that the slum is a place where stressors are created and perpetuated, and the young migrants consequently access the worst of its poor infrastructure, including housing and shelter, toilets, and electrical wiring. Also, I found non-sovereign power has emerged in the slum. At the association level, the Basare Association (ethnic-based group) exemplifies non-sovereign power in settling disputes and financing members in the event of long hospitalization. Non-sovereign power, as illustrated using the Basare Association, I argue, is justifiable grounds for improving the well-being of young people with regard to the daily stressors encountered. This may be achievable through the negotiation of rights and privileges of young members in the slum. Sovereign power (possessed by elected governments and their institutions) is almost non-existent in the slum except when exercised to engage slum members in the management of the Korle Lagoon and in discussion towards their possible relocation. Through the assistance of the central government in the area of formal education and the pro-activity of social institutions, the young migrants believe they may experience improved lives. An ordinal logistic regression model shows that the determinants of resilience among young migrants in Old Fadama include social capital, type of employment, the number of stressors encountered, and the ability to afford medicine when sick. Finally, return migration is found not only to be a passive reaction to economic forces but also determined by other variables such as sex, marital intention, and knowing where to get information essential for coping in the slum. Assessing the spaces of the migration process and incorporating these suggestions for improving well-being in the slum, based on the evidence of non-sovereign and sovereign power, which falls outside previously recommended methods of slum upgrading or eviction, epitomizes new insights for dealing with the materiality of young migrants and advancing the push-pull hypothesis of previous migration literature. Furthermore, this dissertation contributes to geography\u2019s comprehension of the interrelationships between social capital and resilience through a re-conceptualization of the social capital-resilience nexus. Social capital is conceived as actual resources received by migrants, which enables them to withstand stressors. Such a re-thinking enhances the understanding of specific social capital constructs which, I argue, are the resilience predictors in a squatter settlement. The re-thinking enables hypothesizing directionality regarding the relationship between social capital and resilience while eliminating inconclusive evidences due to the ambiguities inherent in bonding, bridging, and linking social capital.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5089], "author_name_tesi": "Tutu, Raymond Asare", "last_name_ssi": "Tutu", "middle_name_ssi": "Asare", "first_name_ssi": "Raymond", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Petra Tschakert", "Petra Tschakert", "Lakshman S Yapa", "Ikubolajeh Logan", "Kevin J Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Petra Tschakert, Dissertation Advisor", "Petra Tschakert, Committee Chair", "Lakshman S Yapa, Committee Member", "Ikubolajeh Logan, Committee Member", "Kevin J Thomas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["non-sovereign power", "internal migration", "risks", "stressors", "social resilience", "urban geography", "vulnerability"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Sparse Linear Time Invariant System Identification Using Weighted Lasso", "id": "23710", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10775", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, the identification of a single-input single-output (SISO) linear time invariant (LTI) dynamical system from a finite set of completely known input signals and noisy output signals is studied. The identification problem studied aims at estimating the transfer function coefficients, the order of the system, and the standard deviation of the measurement noise. Estimations are performed by employing an existing linear shrinkage method, which is the modified least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). In the modified LASSO, the transfer function coefficients and the standard deviation of the measurement noise are estimated by minimizing the l2 norm of the error with an l1 norm penalty on the transfer function coefficients. Owing to the nature of the l1 norm penalty, the true order of the system is obtained by sparsifying the parameter vector, which contains the transfer function coefficients. An iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the modified LASSO optimization problem. We do not give the true order information of the system to the algorithm. This leads the problem of having a sparse and a correct parameter vector estimate at the same time, which causes wrong order estimation. In order to overcome this issue, we introduce the use of two types of weight matrices. The first weight type is the iterative reweighting for the LASSO, which is a well-known weighting for l1 norm minimization problems. The second weight type is a fixed weighting containing constant numbers. In this context, we show the applicability of the fixed weighting for sparsification. Finally, we test the validation of the proposed algorithm by synthetic randomly generated bounded-input bounded-output (BIBO) stable systems with noisy measurements.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10394], "author_name_tesi": "Tutuk, Fatih ", "last_name_ssi": "Tutuk", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fatih", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["System Identification", "Sparsity", "Lasso", "Reweighting"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Energy Harvesting Wireless Networks: Transmission Policies and Coding Schemes", "id": "26515", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11461", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the wide deployment of battery powered wireless devices, prolonging the lifetime of wireless networks is becoming ever more critical. Systems powered by batteries suffer from a limited lifetime, whereas networks consisting of energy harvesting nodes can survive indefinitely. Along with its unique benefits, energy harvesting introduces a new challenge in terms of managing the intermittently available energy. Energy harvesting wireless networks call for transmission policies and coding schemes tailored to their variable nature of available energy.\n\nA fundamental concern in energy harvesting wireless nodes is to maximize system performance under the inherent energy constraints. This entails utilizing the limited capacity battery to adapt to variations in harvested energy. The first part of this thesis investigates power policies to maximize the throughput of energy harvesting nodes for various system models. First, a single-user communication scenario with an energy harvesting transmitter is considered. Subject to energy causality and battery capacity constraints derived from offline knowledge of energy harvests, the throughput maximizing power policy is found. In particular, properties of the optimal power policy are identified, and the benefit of power control for energy harvesting communications is demonstrated.\n\nNext, extensions to inefficient energy storage, interfering transmitters, and energy cooperation are considered. In particular, for the inefficient energy storage case, the trade-off between storing and consuming energy as harvested is outlined, and the optimal power policy is attained with thresholds that regulate battery utilization. Similar thresholds are observed to arise for the fading channel, and for the online problem where harvested energy is revealed causally to the transmitter. As a multi-transmitter setting, the interference channel with two energy harvesting transmitters and two receivers is studied. This configuration requires nodes to not only adapt to their own energy harvests, but to adapt to each others\u2019 transmission policies as well. To solve the problem, an iterative algorithm based on directional water-filling is proposed, and is shown to admit simpler interpretations in specific interference regions. A new dimension to energy management in energy harvesting networks is introduced via wireless energy transfer, which has become increasingly efficient in the past decade. The impact of energy cooperation is studied for various channel models by finding the jointly optimal power allocation and energy cooperation policies. Through the use of a subset of optimal policies, this joint optimization problem is simplified and solved with methods similar to the non-cooperating case.\n\nIntermittency of available energy leads to challenges in coding as well. In the second part of this thesis, a simple energy harvesting channel is studied from an information theoretic perspective, with the purpose of identifying the theoretical limits of communication under energy harvesting constraints at the codeword symbol level. The equivalence of this channel to a timing channel is utilized to propose encoding schemes and upper bounds that characterize its capacity within a small gap. Moreover, the amount of information revealed to the decoder about the energy harvesting process is compared for different encoding schemes, addressing the state amplification and state masking problems for energy harvesting channels.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10978], "author_name_tesi": "Tutuncuoglu, Kaya ", "last_name_ssi": "Tutuncuoglu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kaya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aylin Yener", "Thomas La Porta", "Vishal Monga", "Adam Davison Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aylin Yener, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas La Porta, Committee Member", "Vishal Monga, Committee Member", "Adam Davison Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy harvesting", "power allocation", "wireless communications", "transmission policies", "energy cooperation", "communication theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development and Implementation of a Passive Vhf Radar System Using Software Defined Radio Techniques to Study Equatorial Plasma Instabilities Near the Peruvian Andes", "id": "18133", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8038", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, a new passive radar system named Coherent Atmospheric Passive Radar Imager (CAPRI) is presented.

A network of temperature sensors, sonic anemometers, and net radiometers was deployed to the Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory, a 0.08 km2 forested valley in central Pennsylvania with a 49 m elevation change from valley bottom to ridge top. These sensors collected data during March-June 2013. Measurements were taken above-canopy (30 m above ground) and below-canopy (0.91 m and 1.83 m above ground).\n\nStudy nights were separated to identify the EET period. Nights with an EET differed in several ways from non-EET nights; nights with an EET tended to have more negative average net radiation, calmer above-canopy wind speeds, and higher stability than non-EET nights. Three-month composites of these variables across the nighttime period of 1930-0600 LST show differences in temporal evolution throughout the night for net radiation, above-canopy wind speed, and air temperature decrease on EET vs. non-EET nights. \n\nRanking histograms indicated that both EET nights and non-EET nights showed spatial temperature patterns. The more variable spatial temperature pattern was found in the cluster with an EET, suggesting radiative sheltering does not fully explain the spatial temperature pattern on these nights. Components of an energy budget computed for three different case studies throughout the measurement period revealed that vertical turbulent mixing is not the only process distributing the surface radiative cooling.  Horizontal advection and horizontal turbulent fluxes might also be important. Thus, a 1-D, vertical-only energy budget is not likely to explain the valley system.

While the stock answer, \u201cthe study of human movement,\u201d may initially satisfy some, it leaves the content and mission of the field quite vague, perhaps even empty. What type of \u201cmovement,\u201d after all, are we talking about; sewing, crossing the street, playing basketball, eating spaghetti? All such movement forms would seem to fit the popular definition of kinesiology, yet intuitively most people would admit that basketball seems much more appropriate than any of the other options. Why? Is such an intuition justified? Or is this obsession with \u201csport\u201d merely an artifact of the dumb-jock dark ages? Is physical education a coincidental or necessary part of Kinesiology? If kinesiologists cannot give an adequate response to such questions how can the discipline possibly even begin to understand itself?\n \nThis ambiguity regarding the mission of Kinesiology leads to and informs another problem. What is the proper relationship between the sciences and humanities in Kinesiology? Why are philosophers, historians, physiologists and biomechanists all under the same roof? How should their common discipline of Kinesiology inform their work and define their relationship? There is little doubt that in most contemporary Kinesiology departments the power structure is tilted, (for both pragmatic and philosophical reasons) in favor of the sciences. Whether this is a problem that needs to be remedied or is the proper constitution of a Kinesiology department cannot be fully answered until one has nailed down in more concrete terms what Kinesiology actually is.  Until such an understanding has been achieved, articulating the proper relationship between the sciences and the humanities in the field of Kinesiology is a foolhardy quest.\n\nPerhaps part of the problem is with the understanding of \u201cmotion\u201d itself? An Aristotelian understanding of what the word kinesis actually means reveals a more dynamic and more human understanding of motion. According to Aristotle, kinesis is central to human identity. Motion involves more than merely change of place. In the case of animals (which includes human beings), motion cannot be understood apart from choice and perception. Human locomotion is impossible without the conscious perceptions of the mover. Kinesis is not a mere brute fact of nature, but rather a central aspect of human being. If this is correct then the field of Kinesiology needs to embrace culture as much as it embraces mathematics and measurement.\n \nIn addition, scientist/philosopher Michael Polanyi argues through his theory of \u201cpersonal knowledge\u201d that the gulf between the sciences and humanities is in a very real sense imagined. Knowledge is real but requires a conscious and skilled engagement with the world. As such, science is not a self-sufficient or all-encompassing mode of inquiry but is dependent on human culture, language and tradition. Consequently the sciences and humanities should be seen as partners rather than antagonists. Building on the work of both Aristotle and Polanyi I argue that a fresh understanding of both motion and epistemology must be constituted if Kinesiology is to become a coherent and unified academic field.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2041], "author_name_tesi": "Twietmeyer, Gregg ", "last_name_ssi": "Twietmeyer", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gregg", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Doug Anderson", "Mark Dyreson", "Dagmar Sternad", "Christopher P Long"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Scott Kretchmar, Committee Chair", "Doug Anderson, Committee Member", "Mark Dyreson, Committee Member", "Dagmar Sternad, Committee Member", "Christopher P Long, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["humanities", "sport", "play", "skills", "two cultures", "kinesiology", "kinesis", "tacit", "Polanyi", "Aristotle", "purpose", "epistemology", "games", "physical activity", "entelecheia"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL RODENT MODEL OF DRUG INDUCED DEVALUATION OF NATURAL REWARDS AND ITS RELEVANCE TO FEATURES OF DRUG ADDICTION\n\n", "id": "7934", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5140", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Humans and animals learn to avoid pain and to seek pleasure. In fact, actions that are essential to the survival of the organism such as mating, eating, and drinking, are invariably pleasurable. The subjective experience of pleasure is typically perceived when engaging the sensory systems, but may even begin in anticipation of consumption of a given reward. These sensory systems send neural projections to areas of the brain that, when activated, produce euphoria in humans and reinforce behavior that is instrumental in obtaining rewards. To protect from over consumption, organisms also have evolved the capacity to stop seeking and consuming rewards. These feedback mechanisms reduce the sensation of pleasure with continued consumption. This is why turkey tastes far better at the beginning of Thanksgiving dinner than at the end.\nSuch is not the case with the consumption of drugs of abuse. Drugs of abuse directly and potently activate brain reward systems and they do not rely, at least initially, on the senses to produce their pleasurable effects. In fact, this potent activation turns ordinary sights, sounds, places, smells, and tastes into profound emotional experiences and coveted goals in and of themselves by mere association. In this way, abused drugs \u2018hijack\u2019 brain reward systems by eroding self-control and redirecting attention and motivated behaviors toward the drug and its associated cues. Furthermore, as drug taking escalates, brain reward substrates are repeatedly overstimulated and become hypersensitive in the presence of drug while becoming hyporesponsive in its absence. This hyposensitivity increases negative affect, and reduces the sensitivity to the relative value of less powerful natural rewards and increases drug craving and seeking. The result is a compulsive preoccupation with drug seeking and consumption, and a reduced motivation to pursue natural rewards (e.g., employment, child care, nutritional needs, sex). Despite the pervasive nature of this debilitating aspect of drug addiction there are no animal models that target it. Therefore, the basic research contained within this dissertation is organized under one theme: To create a rodent model of drug-induced devaluation of natural rewards and cue induced craving.  \nTo that end, rats were given access to a saccharin cue that always predicted access to either passively delivered or self-administered drug (usually cocaine). Upon repeated pairings with the drug of abuse, the value of the saccharin cue decreased similar to when it predicts access to a much sweeter sucrose solution. In the first set of experiments, the parameters under which devaluation of a palatable taste cue occurs were determined, individual differences in the phenomenon were characterized, and this variation was compared to cocaine seeking and self-administration. Principally, it was found that the more sensitive a rat was to the reinforcing properties of the drug the less of the saccharin cue they consumed. \nThe next set of experiments tested manipulations that might protect against the acquisition of cocaine self-administration. Interestingly, relative to active administration, the unpredictable, uncontrollable yoked delivery of cocaine enhanced saccharin avoidance, reduced the motivation to work for cocaine, and reduced the preference for contextual cues associated with drug delivery. Additionally, it was found that a sudden unexpected loss or gain of sucrose reward had no effect on the motivation to self-administer cocaine; however, daily experience with a consistently high sucrose reward, relative to a low one, greatly reduced the motivation to work for cocaine.   \nThe last two chapters investigated the role of the VTA and NAc, two brain regions critical for drug reward, in modulating the devaluation of saccharin by drugs of abuse. It was found that dopaminergic lesions of the VTA had little effect on the phenomenon. Nevertheless, the electrophysiological experiment showed that the activity of single neurons in the NAc (the target for VTA dopamine release) tracked this devaluation. The degree of devaluation was associated with a shift toward negative affect, and this shift predicted the rapidity with which rats would seek and take drug. Together, these data integrate several distinct theories of drug addiction, provide a behavioral model for the investigation of novel drug therapeutics to combat addiction, and reveal new insight on the solution to a nearly 40 year old paradox.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5113], "author_name_tesi": "Twining, Robert Chiampi", "last_name_ssi": "Twining", "middle_name_ssi": "Chiampi", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson", "Ralph Norgren", "Kevin Douglas Alloway", "Joan S Long", "Regina M Carelli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Sue Grigson, Committee Chair", "Ralph Norgren, Committee Member", "Kevin Douglas Alloway, Committee Member", "Joan S Long, Committee Member", "Regina M Carelli, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["reward", "heroin", "drug abuse", "operant learning", "conditioned taste aversion", "contrast effects", "cocaine", "electrophysiology", "self-administration", "accumbens", "striatum"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "JC Virus Early Proteins Regulate RB-E2F Complexes and Promote Progression of Cells into S Phase.", "id": "6875", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5647", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "JC virus (JCV), a human virus closely related to Simian virus 40 (SV40), infects ~80% of the world population. In certain immunocompromised individuals an asymptomatic infection may lead to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease to which ~5% of AIDS patients succumb. As a member of the Polyomaviridae family, JCV readily causes tumors in experimental lab animals; recent reports associate JCV with certain human cancers. The 5 JCV early proteins TAg, tAg, T&#8242;135, T&#8242;136 and T&#8242;165 contribute to transformation of non-permissive cells, and to viral replication in permissive cell types. These 2 activities are linked to the ability of DNA tumor viruses to deregulate cell cycle progression. The tumor proteins of this group of viruses override normal Go/G1 to S phase transition by binding to members of the retinoblastoma (RB) family of tumor suppressors through their LXCXE domain, and then causing the release of members of the E2F family of transcription factors via the co-chaperone function of their J domain. TAg and T&#8242; proteins share their N-terminal 132 amino acids sequence, which includes these 2 domains. The work herein characterized the role of JCV TAg and T&#8242; proteins in disrupting RB-E2F complexes and causing the release of E2F-1 and E2F-4, subsequently leading to the progression of cells into S phase of the cell cycle. By constructing appropriate mutants, we demonstrate that the LXCXE and J domains present in JCV TAg and T&#8242; proteins are required for interactions with the RB family members and the release of both E2F proteins. All 4 viral proteins bind to the hypo-phosphorylated forms of p107 and p130, while causing dephosphorylation and/or degradation of the hyper-phosphorylated forms of these two proteins. Further, this study also identifies the theronine 125 residue in TAg and T&#8242; proteins as being critical for TAg stability, interaction with RB family members, induction of cell cycle progression, anchorage independent growth and viral replication. In summary, these studies contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which JCV TAg and T&#8242; proteins promote cellular transformation and/or viral replication in cells.

There is substantial agreement that better water institutions are essential for effectively and efficiently addressing increased water scarcity associated with population growth and climate change. But welfare gains from institutional reforms will be overestimated if the inefficient status-quo is compared against \u201cideal\u201d but implausible allocations. Non-cooperative bargaining theory can predict feasible welfare gains from reforms but the literature has not yet explored basin structures where inflexibility of existing agreements results in a deadweight loss. A case in point is the institution of Interstate River Compact in the United States. Recent renegotiations suggest that reconsidering compact allocations can be an effective adaptation response to water scarcity. This essay develops a non-cooperative bargaining framework to formalize interstate river compact renegotiations. Equilibrium outcomes from interstate renegotiations followed by intrastate renegotiations among economic sectors place bounds on feasible welfare gains from reforms. Closed-form solutions are applied to a case study of Rio Grande Compact. Comparison between the non-cooperative equilibrium allocation and the optimal allocation indicates that non-cooperative bargaining can achieve allocative efficiency in the basin. However, the distribution of resulting gains depends on the bargaining power of players. This bargaining power is positively related to status-quo allocation, population, area under irrigated agriculture, efficiency of water-use and the degree of aversion to side payments. \nThe second and the third essay in this thesis focus on India\u2019s GHG abatement policy, which is currently heavily skewed towards non-market instruments. Policymakers have started experimenting with theoretically efficient and cost-effective market-based instruments (MBIs) which are likely to play a larger role in the future. But there is little research on intergenerational welfare consequences of using MBIs in India. The second essay, titled India\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Abatement Policies \u2013 Considering the Case for Market Based Instruments, studies long-term intergenerational welfare consequences in a hypothetical scenario where India had chosen a carbon tax or an emission trading scheme to achieve its Paris Agreement\u2019s CO2 emission targets. This scenario is modeled using a dynamic perfect-foresight Overlapping Generations (OLG) model with a revenue-neutral price instrument and a quantity instrument. Revenue is recycled through changes in consumption, labor income or capital income tax. Role of modeling assumptions is highlighted by comparing OLG model results with an Infinitely Lived Agent (ILA) approach. Results suggest that the burden of a market-based policy on existing generations is small but welfare of future generations is reduced by 4-5 percent when positive environmental benefits are not taken into account. With environmental benefits, costs of policy on future generations are significantly reduced, even leading to net positive incidence in one scenario.\nThe carbon tax policy studied in Essay two is an efficient and cost-effective way to achieve Paris Agreement targets for India. But the distributional incidence of an MBIs policy may fall unfairly on vulnerable population groups when relative prices of energy goods increase. A desirable MBIs policy must then balance emissions reduction goal against developmental objectives and protect vulnerable population from not only climate change but also adverse policy impacts. The third essay, titled India\u2019s Greenhouse Gas Abatement Policies \u2013 Distributional Implications of a Carbon Tax, extends the results from the macroeconomic CGE model of Essay two to estimate initial distributional incidence of a carbon tax. This analysis is undertaken through a microsimulation model which uses household level consumption and income data along with the CGE model outputs. Results suggest that the incidence on vulnerable socio-economic groups, identified as lower income quintile households, disadvantaged caste groups and rural households, can be reduced by using a suitable revenue recycling mechanism. In particular, revenue recycling through reductions in labor income tax is a progressive policy as the incidence is lower on vulnerable socio-economic groups. Revenue recycling through reductions in capital income tax has a fairly equal incidence across socio-economic groups. Consumption tax reductions is the worst revenue recycling mechanism as it fails to achieve double dividends and the incidence is large across all socio-economic groups.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15148], "author_name_tesi": "Tyagi, Ashish ", "last_name_ssi": "Tyagi", "first_name_ssi": "Ashish", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle", "James Samuel Shortle", "David Gerard Abler", "Karen Ann Fisher-Vanden", "Mort D Webster", "Stephan J Goetz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle, Dissertation Advisor", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Chair", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Fisher-Vanden, Committee Member", "Mort D Webster, Outside Member", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Water Economics", "Institutional Economics", "Climate Change", "Computable General Equilibrium Models", "India"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Augmenting the bootstrap to analyze high-dimensional genomic data\n", "id": "8890", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5881", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The data produced by contemporary high-throughput genomic techniques are often high dimensional and undersampled.

The differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors into mature oligodendrocytes is a complex process that involves cell cycle exit and the coordinated expression of genes required for myelination.  While both extrinsic and intrinsic factors have been identified that orchestrate the differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes, little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways that control the overall commitment to differentiate. \n Here, we provide evidence that activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is essential for oligodendrocyte differentiation.  Specifically, mTOR regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation at the late progenitor to immature oligodendrocyte transition as assessed by the expression of stage specific antigens and myelin proteins including myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP).  Furthermore, phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser 2448 correlates with myelination in the subcortical white matter of the developing brain.\nWe further demonstrate that mTOR exerts its effects on oligodendrocyte differentiation through two distinct signaling complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, defined by the presence of the adaptor proteins raptor and rictor respectively.  Disruption of TOR complex formation via siRNA mediated knockdown of raptor or rictor significantly reduced myelin protein expression in vitro.  Investigation of mTORC1 and mTORC2 targets revealed differential phosphorylation during oligodendrocyte differentiation. Specifically, mTORC1 targets p70S6K1 and 4E-BP are phosphorylated during the initial phase of differentiation, while phosphorylation of the mTORC2 target Akt appears early but is sustained throughout differentiation. Finally, disruption of p70S6K1 reduces myelin protein expression suggesting that mTORC1 functions are mediated at least in part by p70S6K1. Taken together these data define mTOR signaling as an essential mediator of oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6485], "author_name_tesi": "Tyler, William Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Tyler", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Teresa L Wood", "Sarah Bronson", "David A Antonetti", "Steven W Levison", "David J Carey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Teresa L Wood, Committee Chair", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Chair", "David A Antonetti, Committee Member", "Steven W Levison, Committee Member", "David J Carey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["oligodendrocyte", "differentiation", "mtor", "rapamycin", "progenitor", "myelin"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "EXPLORING CATALYTIC ACTIVE SITES: INVESTIGATIONS OF ACTIVATED\nOXYGEN SPECIES AND SUPERATOMIC MIMICS IN THE GAS-PHASE\n\n\n", "id": "12623", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1733", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The following dissertation presents mass spectrometric and theoretical investigations of metal oxide cationic clusters reacting with various molecules of interest. Gas-phase clusters model catalytic active sites, the following studies determine the molecular level interactions occurring in catalytic mechanisms. There is a focus on investigating various forms of activated oxygen species as well as identifying similarities in reactivity between ions of isovalent character.\nInvestigations of titanium oxide cationic clusters utilize a guided ion beam mass spectrometer to determine if pronounced reactivity occurs upon the introduction of CO, C2H2, C2H4, and C\u00ac3H6. Ti2O4+ and to a lesser extent TiO2+, are identified to preferentially transfer oxygen to the molecules of interest. Density functional calculations determine an oxygen centered radical located within the Ti2O4+ cluster to be responsible for the observed oxygen transfer. \nWith the goal of identifying other forms of activated oxygen in mind, additional mass spectrometric and theoretical studies of ZrxO2x+1+ (x = 1-3) clusters are performed. Calculations determine the cluster structures containing two oxygen atoms sharing a spin unpaired electron known as a superoxide (O2-). Experiment and theory provide evidence that the size of the cluster has marked influence over the reactivity properties towards C3H6, C4H6, and C2H2. In particular, Zr2O5+ is highly reactive for the oxidation of the three hydrocarbons while ZrO3+ only presents substantial reactivity towards butadiene. In addition, Zr3O7+ primarily associates the reactants, revealing only minor oxidation channels.\nReplacements are sought for expensive group 10 metals in catalytic applications. A study is presented comparing the reactivity between Pd+ and the isovalent ion ZrO+ utilizing both experimental and theoretical means. The findings reveal common reactivity for the ions upon introduction of ethane and propane. The primary reaction mechanism observed is C\u2014C cracking while hydrogen abstraction is observed in appreciable quantities for both ions. It is proposed that the similar reactivity is due to ZrO+ having molecular orbitals with 4d components that participate in the reaction in a similar way as the 4d orbitals of Pd+.\nFurther investigations of isovalent ions are performed to extend the concept of superatomic mimics to systems of varied composition and larger size. This study investigates the reactivity of C2H4 and CO with the pairs NiO+/TiO2+ and PdO+/ZrO2+. A primary oxidation channel is observed for interaction of C2H4 with both pairs creating acetaldehyde as the most energetically favorable product while all species exhibit limited oxygen transfer to CO. These investigations provide several examples in which the reactivity of early transition metal species have been modified through the addition of a nonmetallic component and present similar characteristics to group 10 species.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1719], "author_name_tesi": "Tyo, Eric Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Tyo", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Ayusman Sen", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "Robert John Santoro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Chair", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["clusters", "superatom", "catalysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Advanced multi-dimensional deterministic transport computational capability for safery analysis of pebble-bed reactors\n\n", "id": "7809", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "746", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A coupled neutron transport thermal-hydraulics code system with both diffusion and transport theory capabilities is presented. At the heart of the coupled code is a powerful neutronics solver, based on a neutron transport theory approach, powered by the time-dependent extension of the well known DORT code, DORT-TD. DORT-TD uses a fully implicit time integration scheme and is coupled via a general interface to the thermal-hydraulics code THERMIX-DIREKT, an HTR-specific two dimensional core thermal-hydraulics code. Feedback is accounted for by interpolating multigroup cross sections from pre-generated libraries which are structured for user specified discrete sets of thermal-hydraulic parameters e.g. fuel and moderator temperatures. The coupled code system is applied to two HTGR designs, the PBMR 400MW and the PBMR 268MW. Steady-state and several design basis transients are modeled in an effort to discern with the adequacy of using neutron diffusion theory as against the more accurate but yet computationally expensive neutron transport theory. It turns out that there are small but significant differences in the results from using either of the two theories. It is concluded that diffusion theory can be used with a higher degree of confidence in the PBMR as long as more than two energy groups are used and that the result must be checked against lower order transport solution, especially for safety analysis purposes. The end product of this thesis is a high fidelity, state-of-the-art computer code system, with multiple capabilities to analyze all PBMR safety related transients in an accurate and efficient manner.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [739], "author_name_tesi": "Tyobeka, Bismark Mzubanzi", "last_name_ssi": "Tyobeka", "middle_name_ssi": "Mzubanzi", "first_name_ssi": "Bismark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Yousry Azmy, Ph D", "Robert Edwards, Ph D", "Michael Adebola Adewumi", "Andreas Pautz, Ph D", "Frederik Reitsma"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Chair", "Yousry Azmy, Ph D, Committee Member", "Robert Edwards, Ph D, Committee Member", "Michael Adebola Adewumi, Committee Member", "Andreas Pautz, Ph D, Committee Member", "Frederik Reitsma, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DORT-TD", "THERMIX", "transport theory", "diffusion theory", "safety analysis", "control rods", "PBMR", "transients"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Characterizing the Network Structure of Headwater Riparian Wetlands in yhe Ridge and Valley Region, Pennsylvania", "id": "24934", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11124", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation aims to illuminate the cumulative impact of anthropogenic disturbances on the collective capacity of wetland functions.  Changes to wetland hydrologic regime and subsequent connectivity in response to landscape disturbances are poorly understood. However, studies have shown that anthropogenic disturbances have decreased ecosystem services in regional watersheds leading to lower water quality conditions.  Considering the multi-scale impacts to wetland hydrology in the context of connectivity can further the understanding of important and fundamental interactions of the terrestrial and aquatic realms that contribute to water quality. This work provides a framework for an integrated ecological assessment that can be used to better manage wetland-derived functions and ecosystem services. Chapter 1 provides a conceptual framework for considering wetlands and their aquatic and terrestrial linkages, and outlines the overall research objectives.  \nHydrologic responses of 10 wetlands classified by disturbance level (highly disturbed and least disturbed or reference standard condition) were examined in Chapter 2.  Hydrologic regime variation across the two disturbance groups was much greater than the variation within each group.  This suggests that disturbance overrides hydrologic characterization by hydrogeomorphic subclass for riverine upper perennial wetlands.  For all sites, percent saturation ranged from 0 - 100% during the growing season.  For reference standard sites, percent saturation ranged from 58 - 100%.  Highly disturbed sites, which each had a unique package of perturbations, had a larger variation in percent saturation both over the entire study period (0 - 78%) and within a single growing season (3 - 79%).   All wetland hydrologic regime characteristics were strongly correlated with disturbance score.  However, when examined individually, no one landscape, buffer zone, or site level feature could explain the variability in all wetland hydrologic regime characteristics.  Hydrologic regime was used to infer hydrologic flow paths and resultant hydrologic connections between wetlands, streams and terrestrial upland.  \nWetland and stream inventories in central Pennsylvania were enhanced and wetland condition was documented in Chapter 3.  Wetland inventories were enhanced by field observations and condition was assessed using Level 1 and Level 2 assessment tools.  Fifty-seven new wetlands totaling 23 ha (57 ac) and three National Wetland Inventory (NWI) wetland extensions equaling 5 ha (12 ac) were added to the Upper Shaver Creek wetland inventory.  The new inventory nearly doubled the existing wetland area for headwater riparian wetlands within Upper Shaver Creek watershed. The stream length for the newly inventoried segments equaled 35 km adding nearly one-third more of stream length to the watershed inventory.  Level 1 assessment revealed that one-third of the wetland resource in Upper Shaver Creek was rated in the highest or high category of ecological condition and 17% were in lowest category.  Wetland buffers, which are known for maintaining quality and reducing landscape scale impact, were discovered to be narrower in the riparian zones that were most impacted by agricultural uses.  The importance of a strong buffer was evidenced by the fact that wetlands with < 5% invasive species cover had the highest range of buffer scores.  Furthermore, median buffer score decreased as invasive species cover increased.   Finally, Level 2 assessment methods revealed wetland condition scores that ranged from severely disturbed (condition score = 7.5) to high ecological integrity (condition score = 99.9), with a mean score in the lower range of the high condition category (M = 59.0, SD = 27.4).  The median rapid assessment score for wetlands with 0-5% invasive species cover was much higher than for all other invasive species cover categories.  This study revealed that land use in the immediate surrounding area (buffer zone) was more important to reducing the factors contributing to the spread of invasive species than land use at the landscape scale.  \nFinally, a stream-riparian wetland-terrestrial network is assembled using a graph theoretical approach in Chapter 4.  This approach presents a framework for connectivity assessments that integrate terrestrial, aquatic and riparian wetland landscapes to rank riparian wetlands by positional importance in network flow. Nodes and edges create the network structure. Stream reaches that extend out to the riparian landscape became nodes connected by confluences as edges. Nodes were weighted by the amount of wetland contained, the quality of those wetlands, and the amount of agricultural land use within its contributing area.  Local cumulative wetland influence was calculated by weighted in-degree. Weighted betweenness centrality was calculated and illustrated the places in the landscape that were critical to network flow.  Node importance metrics such as the attribute value of the focal node showed that 15 out of the 214 nodes in the network carried 40% of all the attribute weight.  Another node importance metric, integral index of connectivity, was used along with component analysis to quantify the capacity and opportunity of the stream landscape to perform biogeochemical cycling functions.  The graph theoretical approach to model the positional influence of riparian wetland functions on watershed water quality and to assess the cumulative impact of riparian wetland loss has potential to become a productive way to gain further understanding of these complex systems.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10690], "author_name_tesi": "Tyrna, Abbey Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Tyrna", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Abbey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert P Brooks", "Denice Heller Wardrop", "Erica A H Smithwick", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert P Brooks, Dissertation Advisor", "Denice Heller Wardrop, Committee Member", "Erica A H Smithwick, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wetlands", "hydrology", "land use disturbance", "graph theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Heat Abatement Techniques in Dairy Housing in the Northeast\n", "id": "9085", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3044", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The average annual milk production per cow has increased by 424% since the 1940\u2019s.

Two, what properties do organizational information technologies exhibit as facilitators of cross-boundary communication?  I am motivated to pursue these questions because information technologies are central to modern organizational life, yet effective design and implementation remains a significant organizational challenge.  The centrality of information technology to organizational life is particularly evident in the public safety domain where public safety agencies are struggling to overcome a high degree of institutionalized segregation of information systems.  In order to more effectively design, build, and implement organizational information systems, it is critical that we develop a better understanding of how organizational life shapes, and is shaped by, the organization\u2019s technologies.  \n\tThis research makes use of multiple qualitative methods.  Case studies of the Automated Regional Justice Information System and the Pennsylvania Justice Network provide micro-level detail.  Secondary data situates the case studies in a broader institutional context.  Analytic induction was used to test hypotheses across the cases.  Two findings emerged from the analysis.  One, the features and configurations of organizational ICT reflect the identities of the organizations that build and implement them.  Two, the specific boundary-spanning properties organizational information technologies exhibit are linked to the nature of the boundaries spanned.\n\tThree implications emerge from the findings presented in this dissertation.  One, the influence of organizational identity on organizational information technologies means that attempts to integrate various IJIS on a large scale (e.g., national or global) will prove very difficult.  Two, the degree to which an information technology is successfully implemented in an organization is in part determined by the degree to which the design aligns with the organization\u2019s identity.

Recently, some North American agencies have invested substantial time, effort, and resources to eradicate exotic salmonids due to their documented or presumed negative effects on native species.  Naturalized Brown Trout Salmo trutta populations have been established by historical and ongoing intentional introductions throughout Pennsylvania.  Beyond potentially displacing Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis, it was unknown if naturalized Brown Trout detrimentally affect other Pennsylvania aquatic organisms and receiving food chains prior to this study.  \nSympatric Brook and Brown Trout effects on benthic food chains were compared in two Pennsylvania headwater streams (Lingle Run and Tomtit Run) during 2003 and 2004 summers with enclosure experiments and analysis of ambient trout stomach contents.  Brook and Brown Trout effects on densities of two predaceous insect families (Cordulegastridae; Rhyachophilidae) were marginally different in experimental enclosures as inferred with a predator impact index: the remaining 26 benthic families responded similarly between the trout species.  Furthermore, analysis of captured Brook and Brown Trout stomach contents suggested that Brown Trout had modest effects on ambient headwater communities relative to the sympatric Brook Trout populations.  \nBrook and Brown Trout were top-level keystone species that caused similar precipitous changes in experimental channel food chains in both streams.  Most previous stream predator studies reported predator effects on tri-level food chains with algae as a basal resource: predators in these studies usually indirectly increased algal biomass by suppressing herbivore abundance or feeding activities.  Trout effects on Lingle and Tomtit Run food chains were different than those reported from other stream predator studies, possibly because these food chains were characterized by five trophic levels and driven by allochthonous inputs.  Results of this study suggested that trout can have strong negative effects on tertiary consumers (e.g., crayfish Cambarus bartonii, northern two-lined salamander Eurycea bislineata) that indirectly increase predaceous insect abundance and/or biomass.  Unexpectedly, the increase of predaceous insects did not suppress primary consumer abundances; conversely, detritivorous and herbivorous insects were more abundant in trout treatments than in controls.  These results suggested that primary consumers responded more positively to the lack of tertiary consumers as compared to any negative response to comparatively abundant predaceous insects.  Primary consumers were more abundant in trout treatments in both streams, and in one stream (Lingle Run), abundant detritivores increased leaf processing rates relative to controls: all other published studies regarding predatory fish in streams have reported the opposite effect of increased algae or detritus in the presence of top-level predatory fish.  Mechanisms that produced these counterintuitive results were not tested and thus deserve further study. \nLarge Brown Trout are reportedly primarily piscivorous whereas Brook Trout feed primarily on relatively small invertebrates.  Taxa consumed by free-roaming Brook and Brown Trout were similar in both streams throughout both years.  Although Brown Trout were on average, significantly larger than Brook Trout in both streams, the average prey size and average total mass of stomach contents were significantly greater (P < 0.001) in Brook than Brown Trout stomachs.   Based on stomach contents analysis and Brook and Brown trout densities, the sympatric trout populations had similar predatory effects on benthic food chains in Lingle Run.  Brook Trout were more abundant than Brown Trout in Tomtit Run, which at the population level, yielded a substantially greater impact of Brook than Brown Trout on benthic organisms.  \nIntroduced trout have had dramatic negative effects on receiving communities and ecosystems.  This study did not provide evidence that naturalized Brown Trout had negative predatory effects on Lingle and Tomtit Run benthic food chains relative to native Brook Trout; however, interactions between the trout species likely have mediating influences on their roles as top-level predators and deserve further study.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1014], "author_name_tesi": "Tzilkowski, Caleb J", "last_name_ssi": "Tzilkowski", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Caleb", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr.", "C Paola Ferreri", "Hunter J Carrick", "Eric S Post"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr., Committee Chair", "C Paola Ferreri, Committee Member", "Hunter J Carrick, Committee Member", "Eric S Post, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["food chains", "indigenous species", "introduced species", "streams", "predator-prey interactions", "trophic cascade"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Watershed scale controls on urea transport in a coastal plain river network", "id": "17392", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7171", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Increasing nutrient loads delivered from the landscape to coastal ecosystems has widely been recognized as a major contributor to coastal eutrophication and as a driver of the escalation of harmful algal blooms (HABs).  Urea, a form of organic nitrogen, is a common nutrient found in fertilizers, manures, and human waste, and is gaining recognition as a preferred nutrient for the development of toxic HABs. While several studies have documented elevated urea, concentrations in tributaries draining the Delmarva Peninsula and within the Chesapeake Bay, little is known about the key controls that influence urea delivery from the landscape to surface waters. Here, in attempt to address the need to better understand urea fate and transport, land management and hydrologic controls on in-stream urea, specifically urea-nitrogen (urea-N), concentrations were investigated in the Manokin River. The Manokin River is a Coastal Plain watershed (244 km2) on the Delmarva Peninsula that drains directly to the Chesapeake Bay and is characterized by rural development coupled with intensive agriculture, particularly poultry production. Monthly synoptic sampling during baseflow conditions from March 2010 to June 2011 was conducted throughout the watershed in order to represent the variety of potential point and non-point sources of urea-N. Sampling was also conducted during stormflow conditions from August 2010 to August 2011 using time-weighted automated (SIGMA) samplers at select sites within the watershed. \nTemporal baseflow trends illustrate higher average urea-N concentrations through the summer months (0.043 mg L-1) and generally lower (0.020 mg L-1) concentrations during the winter months. Spatially, mean urea-N concentrations in the agricultural ditches were significantly higher than all other sampling locations, including groundwater, surface water, and wastewater treatment plant effluent, suggesting ditch networks may be \u2018hotspots\u2019 for urea-N within the watershed. Mean urea-N concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) lower (R2 = 65.4%) in agriculturally dominated watersheds and significantly (R2 = 35.8%) higher in watersheds draining greater proportions of wetlands. Urea-N concentrations in wetland dominated headwaters were significantly correlated with water temperature (R2 = 58.9%), dissolved organic matter (R2 = 75.2%), and dissolved organic carbon to dissolved organic nitrogen (DOC:DON) ratios (R2 = 36.6%). Based on these correlations and stream channel and riparian zone characteristics, in-situ production of urea-N through bacterial decomposition of organic matter and phytoplankton and photochemical breakdown of organic matter was a significant source of urea-N at baseflow. Although baseflow urea-N was not influenced by the presence of poultry agriculture, excess nutrient inputs via litter application may indirectly support in-situ urea-N production in ditches. \nStormflow was found to be the predominant urea-N delivery mechanism to downstream coastal waters, as urea-N concentrations typically increased 3 to 9 times above baseflow concentrations during storms at most sites. Spatially, drainage ditches tended to have the highest mean stormflow urea-N concentrations than all other sites monitored during events.  Dry antecedent conditions and low water tables led to greater changes in urea-N concentrations and higher event mean urea-N concentrations. Storms with high rainfall intensity also produced higher event mean urea-N concentrations, possibly due to rapid shallow lateral flow. Flow pathways of urea-N were estimated using hysteresis trends in urea-N concentrations and hydrograph separation. Trends suggest that urea-N typically moved through quicker flow pathways, including subsurface lateral flow rather than slower flow pathways (e.g., groundwater). Based on the similar responses between urea-N and nitrate during events following dry antecedent conditions, agricultural sources of urea-N may be important. Additionally, in situ production of urea-N in stagnant ditch environments during baseflow conditions could contribute to observed peaks in urea-N during stormflow conditions. Annual urea-N loads for a sub-basin in the Manokin River watershed were estimated using USGS Load Estimator software (LOADEST). The cumulative estimated load of urea-N for January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011 was 109 kg of urea-N. Seasonally, over the two year time period, spring urea-N loads were significantly higher than any other season, representing 51.2% of the total delivered load. During this same two year time period, stormflow represented approximately 18% of the time and delivered 55% of the urea-N load. Although most of the annual delivery of urea-N to the coastal zone occurred during the spring, one intense event in August of 2011 delivered 13.6% of the two-year total load. Following this late summer storm, urea-N concentrations in tidal rivers near the Chesapeake Bay increased above levels known to stimulate harmful algal blooms, highlighting the importance of stormflow in urea-N delivery through the surface water network. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7157], "author_name_tesi": "Tzilkowski, Sarah Suzanne", "last_name_ssi": "Tzilkowski", "middle_name_ssi": "Suzanne", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Weeks Boyer", "Anthony Buda", "Michael Gooseff", "Matt Richard Marshall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Weeks Boyer, Thesis Advisor", "Anthony Buda, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Gooseff, Thesis Advisor", "Matt Richard Marshall, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["urea", "hydrology", "nitrogen", "stormflow", "water quality", "nutrient loading", "dissolved organic nitrogen", "Chesapeake Bay"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Modeling Timber and Non-timber Trade-offs in Spatially-explicit Forest Planning\n\n\n\n", "id": "6653", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5598", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Forest management is inherently a multiple-objective decision making process.  Timber production, recreation, wildlife habitat and watershed protection are some of the many uses of forests.  Providing the public with an optimal bundle of timber and non-timber benefits is challenging because many of these benefits conflict.  Modeling the conflicting objectives, quantifying the trade-offs between them, and identifying efficient management alternatives can facilitate consensus between the stakeholders that represent the various forest uses.  Spatially-explicit harvest scheduling provides an excellent modeling environment for such analyses.\n\nThis work evaluates several existing and one proposed multi-criteria mathematical programming techniques as applied to a two-, then to a three-objective spatially-explicit forest planning problem.  The objectives of these models were (1) to maximize the net revenues of the forest, (2) to maximize the minimum amount of mature forest habitat in large patches that evolve across the landscape and over time given various harvest schedules, and (3), in the three-objective model, to minimize the perimeter of these patches.  The comparison criteria were the number of efficient alternatives found, the time to find them, the ability of the user to filter the alternatives, and the potential of the techniques to handle n-objective problems.  In both the two- and the three-objective case, the proposed Alpha-Delta and the traditional Weighted Method showed promising computational performance.  It is recommended that these two methods should be employed in concert to make full use of their respective advantages.\n\nFormulating the perimeter-minimizing criterion itself was the second objective of this study.  Two 0-1 programming formulations are introduced that allow the forest planner to increase the amount of interior habitat relative to edge habitat by minimizing the boundary of the mature forest patches.  Both formulations improved the shape of the patches and resulted in fewer and larger patches with more temporal overlap between them.\n\nFinally, a procedure is introduced that strengthens the area-based adjacency constraints that restrict the size of harvest openings in spatial forest planning models.  The results from test runs suggest, however, that the proposed, theoretically \u201cbetter\u201d mathematical programming formulation does not necessarily lead to shorter solution times.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5589], "author_name_tesi": "T\u00f3th, S\u00e1ndor Ferenc", "last_name_ssi": "T\u00f3th", "middle_name_ssi": "Ferenc", "first_name_ssi": "S\u00e1ndor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marc Eric Mcdill", "Wayne Lawrence Myers", "Terry Paul Harrison", "Jose Antonio Ventura", "Arunachalam Ravindran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marc Eric Mcdill, Committee Chair", "Wayne Lawrence Myers, Committee Member", "Terry Paul Harrison, Committee Member", "Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Member", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["spatially-explicit harvest scheduling", "adjacency constraints", "spatial optimization", "forest management", "integer programming", "efficient frontier", "landscape modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Maenads: More than Greece's Good-Time Girls: An Examination in Athenian Image, Text, and Historical Evidence\n", "id": "9251", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3524", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThis dissertation is the only work to date that examines the evidence for maenadism from evidence on vases, on inscriptions and within tragedy and from historical writers in one dissertation.  This dissertation deals with the assertion that the alteration of maenadism in its various forms occurs over time and can be perceived in literary and material form. In addition, the change of attitude toward maenadism (as demonstrated on vases and in literature) in antiquity (especially from the Classical age into the Hellenistic age) demonstrates a heightened sense of ancient \u201curgency\u201d in acknowledging the \u201cover-domestication\u201d of women and subsequently a heightened danger of \u201cmaddened\u201d women to the polis in general. In observing current concerns regarding, 1) mythological connections with \u201cevidence\u201d of maenad ritual as interpreted from ancient literature (both epic and tragedy as well as from ancient historians), as they relate thereto, and 2) the historical validity of maenadism (and interpretations thereof) from inscription evidence, one is confronted with yet a third element: the continuity and/or change of these elements as they relate to each other over time and sometimes space.  In so approaching maenadism, it is asserted that a more comprehensive yet broader understanding of maenadism can be reached. \n The above issues will be approached with the ultimate notion in mind that mythical maenadism, a historical mechanism of Greek intellects and artists, perpetuated, or echoed a sense of \u201cwarning\u201d to the polis to guard one\u2019s precious instincts (the balance between the wild self and the civilized self) and to \u201cadhere\u201d specifically to the dangerous condition of the over-domestication (as an effect of an overly patriarchal legal system) of women within the polis.  In \u201cmythical ritual,\u201d as for example, in the Bacchae by Euripides, the urgency of the warning seems to have reached its highest point during the fifth and fourth centuries BCE.  The \u201cmaenadic metaphor\u201d is also to be found in the dramatic works of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides.  \nEvidence from inscriptions supports the existence of \u201creal maenad\u201d activity in the third and second centuries BCE.   This dissertation highlights the high status of the maenads as tragic figures, as time honored, and as important to the Athenians. There is an increase seen in \u201creal\u201d (material) evidence of maenadism that coincides with the decrease in the marginality of women\u2019s appearance in public spheres into the Hellenistic age.  From inscriptions describing the penalties to be paid for not attending meetings, and for not joining the dance on the hill, more than social status is indicated.  It seems that a particular economic status of the well-born and presumably citizen women who participated in maenadism in ancient Greece was required. This is contrary to the images we have of wild women, free and unrestricted, that is seen on vases, but is truer to the image of the ancient Greek historians who implied that maenads were well-respected citizen women who were socially sanctioned to perform the important rites of Dionysos. \n  In so far as this dissertation represents a serious attempt to compile the extant scholarship surrounding the concept of maenadism (as well as to assert my theory on the ancient message of the dangers of over-domestication), it should be noted that my theoretical hypothesis is based on evidence that is only available materially. Of course, I do not presume to generalize the hypothesized trend as having been purposeful by Homer, the tragedians, ancient historians, the Greek population, or the authors who have wrestled with the meaning of the maenad in myth, ritual and history in modern times. \n              Status was important, and marriage was a major cause of inquiry by the tragedians.  Historians often described matrons and maidens in terms of distinct differences regarding their duties to the god. In tragedy, events surrounding marriage (or lack thereof) were events that \u201ccaused\u201d the maenadic metaphor to occur. In the case of Andromache, for example, it is the \u201cundoing\u201d of the ritual of marriage and the negation of her role as wife which brings on madness, as well as maenadic behavior, and causes her to abandon her domestic space.  This dissertation highlights the principal maenadic episodes and maenadic behavior in tragedy, but also demonstrates the reason for female frenzied behavior as exemplified in tragedy, specifically in Antigone\u2019s behavior in Euripides\u2019 Phoenician Women as she calls herself a \u201cmaenad of the dead\u201d (Phoenician Women, 1485-92). In this case, as well as in Sophocles\u2019 Antigone,  the act of a \u201cwedding in reverse\u201d is not recalled as in Andromache, rather it is enacted in a bridal-funereal journey to meet her dead kin.  Many tragic female characters  are compared to maenads in a relationship of the act of acting like a maenad (maenadism), thus resulting in negations of/to marriage, in what is determined as imagined by the Greeks from myth through tragedy.\nIn these pages, I attempt to untangle the paradigm of tragic women\u2019s participation in the real as opposed to mythological maenadic metaphor.  The trend that the boundary between real and imagined or mythological maenadism becomes more blurred over time becomes clear in my examination of Attic black and red figure vases from the Early Classical period into the Hellenistic period. I attempt to re-direct (in my method) the current scholarly trends in Art History and the Classics that merely support ancient texts with matching images on vases. This is a superficial modern scholarly construct of ancient society. To be more plain, we must acknowledge that vase painters did more with images than just illustrate plays and the writings of historians (or provide illustrative accompaniment to existing modern theories regarding significant queries into antiquity such as gender relations). Their role in Greek culture is far more complex and refuses to be \u201cboxed\u201d into categories of modern convenience.  \nQuantitative, as well as qualitative, study of a control group of vases provided me with a good sample of various ancient vases with images of maenads. The collection of vases in the British Museum is one of the best in the world and I was fortunate to have been able to perform original research there. I observed and recorded data for 177 images of maenads on vases out of over 6000 vases all together. The images were studied, categorized and the data was made into graphs and charts. The important information was shape and function, period, style and other characters present. Patterns emerged, and alongside the trends that emerged in the study of maenads in inscriptions and maenadic behavior in tragedy, even more issues arose. The general trend for vases follows that of the tragedies; that over time, Dionysus becomes less important to the image and function of the image of the maenad on the vase. However, more important than these, are the observations that emerged by examining the trends in all fields, and in particular, the separate development that occurred around approximately 460-470 BCE in regards to the issue of violent maenads on vases and comparing it to that issue in tragedy. \nTo summarize my findings: there are more amphorae (wine shapes) of the older black figure period which have maenads accompanied by Dionysus, featured on \u201cheroic vases\u201d (vases with heroic scenes), and show Dionysus as a zoanon figure (plank-like and made of wood). I perceive this effort to transmit the message of the maenad as something that was socially sanctioned in the role as servants to the god until around 490-470 BCE. Possibly this phenomenon made maenads more \u201cmythological\u201d as opposed to \u201creal\u201d.  With time, however, more images of maenads appear on hydria and \u201cother\u201d (non-wine or specifically water shapes) shapes more frequently and the images of the maenads increasingly seem to resemble regular women.  This is observed as they have fewer and fewer maenad \u201cfeatures\u201d such as the thyrsus, snakes, deer, cubs, torches, etc. than the older vase images and happens more frequently after 460 BCE.  \nMy dissertation owes much to the theories by Seaford and Schlesier with regards to maenadism and tragedy. It challenges and celebrates the works of scholars such as Albert Henrichs, E. R. Dodds and A. Rapp on maenadism (mainly from epigraphs and ancient  historians). Finally, it demonstrates a unique and original method of quantifying images of maenads on ancient Greek vases.          \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3506], "author_name_tesi": "Ubbels, Krista Marie ", "last_name_ssi": "Ubbels", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie ", "first_name_ssi": "Krista", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Walters", "Brian A Curran", "Elizabeth Bradford Smith", "Dennis Schmidt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Walters, Committee Chair", "Brian A Curran, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Bradford Smith, Committee Member", "Dennis Schmidt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["maenads"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Health Insurance Trajectories Following Unemployment: Implications for Implementation and Evaluation of the Affordable Care Act\n", "id": "22811", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10346", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA) expands current public and private sources of health insurance coverage, while also creating new insurance marketplaces.

This dissertation examines the risk of unemployment among workers with ESI, prior to health reform, and studies the nature and timing of health insurance transitions triggered by unemployment.\n\nUsing the 2004 and 2008 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation, I undertake three related analyses to assess the potential demand for coverage into the marketplaces due to unemployment-related transitions.

The most commonly analyzed light elements are boron, lithium, and nitrogen; but several other elements can also be analyzed. NDP method is based on the energy measurements of the charged particles escaping from the surface of the sample material. Energy measurements are mostly performed by using semiconductor detectors. By using the stopping power of the sample material, depth profile of the analyzed element can be obtained by making a linear transformation of the measured energy spectrum. A few micrometer of the material can be analyzed nondestructively, and on the order of 10 nm depth resolution can be obtained depending on the material type with NDP method.   \nIn this study, Intel-SEA2 borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) sample was experimentally analyzed at Pennsylvania State University Neutron Depth Profiling (PSU-NDP) Facility and National Institute of Standard Technology Cold Neutron Depth Profiling (NIST-Cold NDP) Facility to calculate the 10B depth profile inside of the material. NDP measurements were obtained by using only silicon PIN Photodiode detector at PSU-NDP facility, and by using both silicon PIN Photodiode and surface barrier detector at NIST-Cold NDP facility.  \nPSU-NDP Facility is a part of Radiation Science and Engineering Center (RSEC) of Penn State University. In this facility, NDP experiments suffered from some specific problems. These were mainly signal noise due most likely to ground loop formation on the experimental setup and gamma content of the neutron beam. As a consequence of these problems, the measured energy spectrum of reaction products obtained from BPSG sample at PSU-NDP facility were not satisfactory enough to analyze the 10B depth profile. Therefore, NDP experiments were repeated at NIST-Cold NDP Facility. In this facility, the gamma content of the neutron beam is much less than the one at PSU-NDP facility, and also there is no signal noise problem on the experimental setup. Therefore, better results were obtained from the NDP measurements of the BPSG sample. The thickness of the BPSG layer inside of the sample was calculated as 858 nm with surface barrier detector and 866 nm with silicon PIN Photodiode detector. Energy and concentration calibrations were made by using NIST standard reference samples.\nTo verify the experimental results, NDP measurements performed at PSU-NDP facility with Intel SEA2 BPSG sample were simulated by using Geant4 code. Simulation was performed at LION-XO PC cluster of Penn State University (PSU) at 15 different computer nodes. In the simulation model, it was assumed that the thickness of the BPSG layer in the silicon wafer was the measured value, which is 858 nm, by using Tennelec surface barrier detector at NIST-Cold NDP Facility. Geant4 code was very successful to predict the 1472 and 1776 keV alpha peaks in the measured energy spectrum. The net area difference between the measured and predicted alpha peaks was less than 1%. It was also successful for 1013 keV lithium peak, but not for 840 keV lithium peak. Net area difference for that peak between the measured and predicted spectra was calculated as 36%. The problem might be the cross section data set used by the code to simulate the lithium ion transport in the silicon material. Since depth profiling calculation was made by using the 1472 keV alpha peak and it was well predicted by the Geant4 code, predicted depth profile perfectly fits to the measured one.

The PSBR is a part of the Radiation Science and Engineering Facility (RSEC) and is a TRIGA MARK III type research reactor with a movable core placed in a large pool and is capable to produce 1MW output. This reactor is a pool-type reactor with pulsing capability up to 2000 MW for 10-20 msec. There are seven beam ports currently installed to the reactor. The PSBR\u2019s existing core design limits the experimental capability of the facility, as only two of the seven available neutron beam ports are usable. \nModeling of the new PSBR design was accomplished by completing neutronic and thermal-hydraulics analyses by using MCNP5, ANSYS Fluent, Gambit, TRIGSIMS, MURE, and Burned Coupled MCNP simulation tool. The finalized design features an optimized result in light of the data obtained from neutronic and thermal-hydraulics analyses as well as geometrical constraints. A new core-moderator assembly was introduced to overcome the limitations of the existing PSBR design, specifically maximizing number of available neutron beam ports and mitigating the hydrogen gamma contamination of the neutron beam channeled in the beam ports. A crescent-shaped moderator is favored in the new PSBR design since it enables simultaneous use of five new neutron beam ports in the facility. Furthermore, the crescent shape sanctions a coupling of the core and moderator, which reduces the hydrogen gamma contamination significantly in the new beam ports. A coupled MURE and MCNP5 code optimization analysis was performed to calculate the optimum design parameters for the new PSBR. The optimum dimensions of the crescent-shaped moderator tank were calculated as 76.2 cm in radius and 48.2 cm in height. All new beam ports were directed to the core center and the optimum distance between the reactor core face and each new beam port was calculated. At optimum distance, which varied between 10 cm and 18 cm for individual beam ports, maximum thermal neutron beam with suppressed fast neutron and gamma components were realized. \nThermal-hydraulics analysis of the new design was achieved using ANSYS Fluent CFD code. In the current form, the PSBR is cooled by natural convection of the pool water. The driving force for the natural circulation of the fluid is the heat generation within the fuel rods. The convective heat data was generated at the reactor\u2019s different operating powers by using TRIGSIMS, the fuel management code of the PSBR core. In the CFD modeling, the amount of heat generated by the fuel is assumed to be transferred totally into the coolant. Therefore, the surface heat flux is applied to the fuel cladding outer surface by considering the depleted fuel composition of each individual fuel rod under a  reference core loading condition defined as; 53H at 1MW full power. In order to model the entire PSBR reactor, fine mesh discretization was achieved with 22 millions structured and unstructured computational meshes. The conductive heat transfer inside the fuel rods was ignored in order to decrease the computational mesh requirement. Since the PSBR core operates in the subcooled nucleate boiling region, the CFD simulation of new PSBR design was completed utilizing an Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase flow formulation and RPI wall boiling model. The simulation results showed that the new moderator tank geometry results in secondary flow entering into the core due to decrease in the cross-flow area.  Notably, the radial flow improves the local heat transfer conditions by providing radial-mixing in the core. Bubble nucleation occurs on the heated fuel rods but bubbles are collapsing in the subcooled fluid. Furthermore, the bulk fluid properties are not affected by the bubble formation. Yet, subcooled boiling enhances the heat transfer on the fuel rods. The CFD predicted bulk fluid temperature in the hot channel of new reactor core was 11 oC higher than the measured bulk fluid temperature in the hot channel of existing reactor core. The maximum bulk fluid temperature in the hot channel is estimated as 88 oC by the CFD model, which is less than the saturation temperature of water coolant at reactor\u2019s operating conditions. In addition, the CFD predicted maximum clad outer surface temperature and calculated maximum fuel temperature in the new PSBR core are estimated as 175 oC and 482 oC, respectively. These temperatures are well below the safety limits of the PSBR. \nFive neutron beam ports are designed for the new reactor. Four new experimental techniques and facilities are added to the existing Neutron Imaging (NI) and Neutron Transmission facilities in the new beam hall. Triple-Axis Spectrometer (TAS), Conventional and Time-of-Flight (TOF) Neutron Depth Profiling (NDP), Neutron Powder Diffraction (NPD), and Prompt Gamma Activation Analysis (PGAA) are the proposed new techniques. The geometrical configuration, filter and collimator system designs of each neutron beam ports are selected based on the requirements of the experimental facilities. A cold neutron beam port which utilizes cold neutrons from three curved guide tubes is considered. Therefore, there will be seven neutron beams available in the new facility. The neutronic analyses of the new beam port designs were achieved by using MCNP5 code and Burned Coupled Simulation Tool for the PSBR. The MCNP simulation results showed that thermal neutron flux was increased by a factor of minimum 1.23 times and maximum 2.68 times in the new beam port compared to the existing BP4 design. Besides total gamma dose was decreased by a factor of 100 in the new neutron beam facility. Therefore, this study assures both the thermal-hydraulics safety and neutronics performance improvements in the new PSBR design.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8299], "author_name_tesi": "Ucar, Dundar ", "last_name_ssi": "Ucar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dundar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu", "Kenan Unlu", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Thomas Fu Yuan Lin", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Chair", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Maria Nikolova Avramova, Committee Member", "Thomas Fu Yuan Lin, Committee Member", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PSBR", "Breazeale", "TRIGA", "Neutronic", "Thermal", "Hydraulics", "MCNP", "ANSYS", "Fluent", "Analysis", "Design", "Cold", "Neutron", "Beam Port", "CFD"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Effect Of Crystal Structure on The Morphology Of Marine Aerosol And Design Of TPD Spectrometer for UHV Chamber", "id": "21275", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9603", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Aerosol particles are ubiquitous in the atmosphere and have consequences for the climate, environment, and human health.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate gd T cell development and tissue distribution. In wild type mice, Vg3+ T cells are exclusively found in the skin. However, in the absence of Vg3+ T cells, other subsets of gd T cells can substitute as skin gd T cells. Previous studies found that the development of substitute skin \u00a3^\u00a3_ T cells vary among different genetic backgrounds.  Substitute skin \u0192\u00d7\u0192\u00d4 T cells were found in both C\u0192\u00d71 and V\u0192\u00d73 knockout mice of C57Bl/6 but not 129/svj background.  Similarly, transgenic V\u0192\u00d72+ \u0192\u00d7\u0192\u00d4 T cells were found in the skin of TCRV\u00a3^2TgCg1-/- mice of C57Bl/6 but not 129/svj background.  The transgenic skin \u0192\u00d7\u0192\u00d4 T cells expressed Vg2 along with endogenous Vd7. As the V\u00a3_7 gene is present in the 129/svj genome it is unclear why it is not expressed on the 129/svj skin.  Our analysis found that this is, at least in part, due to reduced rearrangement of TCRV\u00a3_7 gene in the 129svj strain.  Furthermore, We found that recombination signal sequences (RSS) of the V\u00a3_7 gene is different between the C57Bl/B6 and 129/svj strains. The V\u00a3_7 RSS of 129/svj strain is identical to those of the other V\u00a3 genes of its family although the V\u00a3_7 RSS of B6 strain is unique in itself, suggesting that the recombination signal sequence might be responsible for the reduced V\u00a3_7 gene usage in TCR\u00a3_ gene assembly in the 129svj background.\nThere is a possibility that the non expression of V\u00a3_7 in129/svj is due to the lack of a selection ligand. In order to investigate this possibility we have developed a reporter V\u00a3^2V\u00a3_7+ T cell-line. This V\u00a3^2V\u00a3_7+ reporter T cell-line has a construct containing the lac-Z gene under the control of the IL-2 promoter. Upon activation of the V\u00a3^2V\u00a3_7 TCR, NFAT should bind to the IL-2 promoter and lac-Z should be produced.  Preliminary results show that the V\u00a3^2V\u00a3_7 reporter T cell line functions accordingly and can be applied in V\u00a3^2V\u00a3_7 ligand detection assays on C57Bl/6 and 129/svj mice. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6363], "author_name_tesi": "Uche, Uzodinma Nnaemeka", "last_name_ssi": "Uche", "middle_name_ssi": "Nnaemeka", "first_name_ssi": "Uzodinma", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Na Xiong", "Avery August", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Na Xiong, Thesis Advisor", "Avery August, Thesis Advisor", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["\u00a3^\u00a3_ T CELL", "RSS", "Rearrangement", "Vg2", "Vd7", "C57Bl/6", "129/svj", "T cell Receptor", "BWZ", "Reporter Cell Line"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Economic Modeling of the Energy Management System for a Battery-solar Building-integrated Microgrid: A Comparison Between Lead-acid and Lithium Ion Battery Systems", "id": "22780", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9998", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present-day commercial building sector is characterized by high expenditure on electricity as\na source of energy, and an accompanying increase in greenhouse gas emissions.

Hence, articulating the mechanism of technological adoption and diffusion has been of special interest to development economists.  The Green Revolution as a case in point has been the subject of many studies since it necessitated a drastic change in production practices by farmers.  The change led by the Green Revolution generated a great deal of \u201clearning\u201d opportunities in the production of High Yielding Varieties (HYV).\n\nLearning is a dynamic process spanning the adoption of technologies to the realization of their yield potentials.  Capturing such a dynamic process is a crucial issue.  Learning is generally regarded as an increase in the stock of knowledge and skills in production processes that are associated with new technologies.  In the economics literature, productivity improvement is assumed to reflect learning, and it is often indicated by output or profit increase, or cost reduction.\n\nThis study employs efficiency measurement in connection with production frontier analysis as a gauge of individual learning in the case of HYV castor production in Aurepalle village, India over the period 1975 to 1984.  Specifically, we investigate a) whether learning, as well as other determinants, impact the technical efficiency in production and b) the existence of systematic patterns in learning-from-others.\n\nFirst, estimation of the stochastic frontier production function yields technical inefficiencies of individual farms.  Then, inefficiency is regressed on its potential determinants, which include variables representing learning, i.e. experiences, where the coefficients of the learning terms indicate learning impacts on inefficiency reduction.  Among the potential determinants, human capital-related variables, such as schooling, experiences, and age, are of special interest to ascertain how much they contribute to the efficiency gain. Three models are specified to reflect the impact of learning-from-others, especially learning within a reference group, which is defined based on similar farm-size, similar household size, and caste rank.\n\nOne of the major motivations characterizing learning in a framework of the stochastic frontier analysis is to achieve a careful measurement of learning.  There exists a body of individual learning literature capturing learning through the effects of experiences with new technologies on outputs (or profits).  However, this approach is not capable of distinguishing changes in outputs (or profits) driven by technological changes as opposed to those driven by learning.  On the other hand, the stochastic frontier approach enables the separation of productivity gains led by the technological progress from efficiency gains through learning of the technology.  This separation is crucial when impacts of technological changes on production processes are substantial.\n\nThe learning-by-doing effect is robust, but modest.  The learning-from-others\u2019 effect varies across the reference group models, indicating the importance of farmers\u2019 learning opportunities.  The learning-from-others is statistically significant only when learning from others within the same household size.  The result suggests that learning randomly from neighbors may not guarantee efficiency gains since farms cannot simply imitate neighbors\u2019 experiences to enhance efficiency. The results further imply that technological dissemination is better targeted to the reference group level rather than at the village level.  This study finds that the potential reference group can be based on household size.\n\nFarm size and household size dominate the effects of efficiency enhancement with respect to magnitude and significance, which, in addition to the result of scale elasticities, implies that scale economies play an important role in castor production, especially in HYV production.  Age is another efficiency-enhancing factor although its significance is not robust across the models.  The dependency ratio, on the contrary, has a consistent and negative impact on efficiency levels.   Education is also confirmed to enhance efficiency.  This result highlights the importance of investing in children\u2019s schooling and providing quality education.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6347], "author_name_tesi": "Ueda, Takeshi ", "last_name_ssi": "Ueda", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Takeshi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis", "Bee Yan Roberts", "Darren L Frechette", "Spiro E Stefanou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis, Committee Member", "Bee Yan Roberts, Committee Member", "Darren L Frechette, Committee Member", "Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["technological change", "high-yielding varieties", "green revolution", "leanring-from-others", "technical efficiency", "learning-by-doing", "Stochastic frontier analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "COOPERATIVE MAGNETIC RELAXATION IN GEOMETRICALLY FRUSTRATED RARE-EARTH PYROCHLORES", "id": "7476", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "680", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We report thermodynamic measurements on the cooperative paramagnet Tb2Ti2O7 and the stuffed spin ices Ho2(HoxTi2-x)O7-x/2 and Dy2(DyxTi2-x)O7-x/2, where 0 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.67.

These patterns were subsequently used to control the matrix grain growth evolution and single crystal development in BaTiO3.  It was shown that the growth kinetics can be controlled by a small initial grain size, atmosphere conditions, and the introduction of a dopant at selective areas / interfaces.  By using a PO2 of 1x10-5 atm during high temperature heat treatment, the matrix coarsening has been limited (to roughly 2 times the initial grain size), while retaining single crystal boundary motion up to 0.5 mm during growth for dwell times up to 9 h at 1300oC.

Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to identify regions of neural activation during a working memory task that correlate with emotion. Findings did not demonstrate a direct relationship between microstructural tract integrity and emotion, but instead psychosocial variables moderated a relationship with negative emotion. Working memory was correlated with negative emotion but not positive emotion.

Using molecular-beam epitaxy, these difficulties have been overcome and the adsorption-controlled growth of expitaxial EuO films on single crystalline (110) YAlO3 substrates has been demonstrated. The optimal substrate temperature and oxygen background partial pressure for the growth of high quality EuO have been determined to be 590 \u00b0C and 1\u00d710-9 torr, respectively.

In an MEC, a biological anode populated with microbes, capable of oxidizing organic compounds and generating an electrical current, is paired with a conductive, hydrogen-evolving cathode. Wastewater composition and concentration can vary significantly between sources, which influences organic treatment, gas production, and current generation in MECs. Inexpensive, miniature MECs (5 mL) have been previously used to examine MEC performance with different industrial effluents, but they have not been compared with more widely used reactor designs. In this study, mini MECs and larger cube MECs (32 mL) were compared with industrial (IW), domestic (DW), fermentation (FE), and synthetic (AC) effluents to better understand how performance corresponds between these reactor designs.\n\nBefore MEC treatment, the IW, DW, FE and AC samples contained 450-4500 mg/L of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 230-800 mg/L of biological oxygen demand (BOD). 66-92% of COD was removed in MECs for all samples, with higher average current density observed with the AC and FE samples (2.25-6.72 A/m2), which were buffered, than the IW and DW samples (0.64-1.93 A/m2). COD removal and coulombic efficiency (CE) correlated well between mini and cube MECs. Total charge (normalized to the reactor liquid volume) and the rate of current generation were similar between mini and cube MECs fed well-buffered samples (AC and FE), but significantly different for industrial and domestic effluents (IW and DW). Mini MECs were found to suitably represent cube MEC treatment performance and are useful for screening real wastewaters for potential larger scale MEC treatment.\n\nDifferent acclimation procedures were also investigated with cube and mini MECs to determine the influence on current generation, organic removal, and gas recovery with fermentation effluent as substrate. Pre-acclimating MEC biofilms with domestic wastewater or acetate medium prior to treating fermentation effluent slightly improved COD removal (3-5%), compared to non-pre-acclimated reactors, but gas production and current generation were unchanged by the acclimation method. Differences in protein removal were relatively small between acclimation methods in mini MECS (<5%), with no difference measured in cube MECs. Although pre-acclimation improved treatment in both mini and cube MECs, the difference in COD treatment, current generation, and protein removal was more significant between mini and cube MECs than acclimation methods. These results suggest that acclimation method has a relatively small influence on MEC performance and acetate addition may not be necessary to develop a robust electrically active biofilm.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9765], "author_name_tesi": "Ullery, Mark Linden", "last_name_ssi": "Ullery", "middle_name_ssi": "Linden", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microbial Electrolysis Cells", "Wastewater treatment", "Bio-hydrogen production", "Mini MECs", "Industrial wastewater", "Energy recovery"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Microstructure evolution of zirconium carbide irradiated by ions", "id": "23638", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10820", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ZrC is a candidate material for use in Generation IV high-temperature, gas-cooled reactor TRISO coated fuel particles, so it is important to understand its behavior under irradiation.  The microstructural evolution of ZrC$_x$ under irradiation was studied in situ using the Intermediate Voltage Electron Microscope (IVEM) at Argonne National Laboratory.  Experiments were performed in which the sample stoichiometry and irradiation temperature were systematically varied.  In situ experiments made it possible to continuously follow the microstructure during irradiation using diffraction contrast imaging.  Images and diffraction patterns were methodically recorded at chosen dose points.  Experiments centered on the irradiation of ZrC$_{0.8}$ and ZrC$_{0.9}$ with 1 MeV Kr ions at temperatures ranging from 20 - 1073 K  up to 10 dpa.\n\nInitial damage developed as 2 - 4 nm diameter black-dot defects after a threshold dose of approximately 0.1 - 0.5 dpa. As the irradiation temperature increased, the threshold dose for visible defect formation decreased.  The density and size of defects increased with additional dose and the density of defects ranged on the order of $10^{22}$ - $10^{23}$ m$^{-3}$ for all experiments.  The defect diameter also increased with irradiation temperature, with average defect diameters at 3 dpa ranging from approximately 4 nm at 673 K to 8 nm at 1073 K.  No long-range migration of the visible defects or dynamic defect creation and elimination were observed during irradiation, but agglomeration of small defects into loops occurred at 1073 K and resulted in an overall coarsening of the microstructure.  The irradiated microstructure was found to not be strongly dependent on the stoichiometry as results for the two stoichiometries studied were nearly identical.  No irradiation induced amorphization was observed, even after 5 dpa at 20 K and 10 dpa at 50 K.  At the higher temperature (873 K and above), the irradiated microstructure varied with sample thickness and showed a defect-denuded zone in the thin area near the edge.\n\nA one-dimensional cluster dynamics rate theory model that only considered the creation and mobility of point defects and their agglomeration into defect clusters was solved and compared with the experimental results.  General trends from the simulation results matched the experimental observations: a threshold dose was predicted by the calculation, loop diameter was predicted to increases with dose and temperature, and loop density increased with dose and decreased with temperature, as observed.  The spatial distribution showed lower loop size and density near the surface.
