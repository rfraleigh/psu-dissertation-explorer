[{"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "SCHOOLS AND PARENTS ACTIVELY REACHING KIDS FOR LITERACY EVERYDAY (SPARKLE):  PROMOTING POSITIVE PARENTAL SELF PERCEPTIONS THROUGH THE USE OF INTERACTIVE STORYBOOK TECHNIQUES", "id": "6932", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4250", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\tWith the current federal educational legislation, No Child Left Behind (NCLB), state and local school districts are required to pass criterion in up to 40 different areas.  Reading and mathematics are receiving major emphasis regarding prescribed levels of competency as measured by standardized test scores.  As schools strive to meet the prescribed test score percentages in these two areas, schools are looking for analogous and complementary ways of producing positive academic achievement.  Parent involvement again comes to the focal point in the educational arena.  As was believed in the sixties, seventies, eighties, and nineties, parental involvement produces positive academic achievement in the child.\n\tSometimes though, it is difficult for parents to be actively involved in their child\u2019s education due to external and internal barriers.  External barriers may include different goals set by the school and the parent. Language differences may also play a major role in preventing active involvement.  Time constraints set by the parents\u2019 work place may cause the parent to be unavailable during school hours.  Lack of transportation to attend various functions at the school can be a major factor in parents\u2019 involvement.  Other family commitments such as elder care, babysitting, or sibling activities are also external barriers that prevent parent involvement.\n\tInternal barriers, personal psychological barriers, also prohibit parents from becoming involved in their child\u2019s education.  Parents\u2019 personal school experiences can influence a parent\u2019s involvement level.  If a parent had a negative school experience as a child, that may influence the parent\u2019s level of involvement.  The parents\u2019 perceptions of their responsibility toward educating their child can influence the amount of involvement.  If a parent believes it is the school\u2019s responsibility to educate the child, then the parent may take a much less active role in their child\u2019s education. The parents\u2019 perceptions as to their capability to affect change with their child can influence their involvement level.   If a parent does not feel qualified, or lacks the skills needed to help their child, then that parent may not be actively involved in their child\u2019s education.  \n\tThe purpose of this research study was to develop and evaluate an intervention program designed to increase parent involvement through the use of interactive storybook read aloud techniques.  The Schools and Parents Actively Reaching Kids for Literacy Everyday (SPARKLE) program utilized these interactive techniques, along with support as the techniques were applied to target internal barriers to involvement.  An underlying purpose was to develop a caring, trusting, and respectful program to help parents perceive themselves as capable and responsible in order for them to be actively involved in their child\u2019s education.  \n\tA mixed methods research design incorporating a randomly assigned sample was used to answer the following research questions.  First, in what ways does an intervention program based on skill development in questioning and interactive techniques used during storybook read aloud sessions affect parental belief, attitudes, and perceptions?  Specifically,  in what ways does this intervention affect a parent\u2019s affective memory perceptions (AMP), capability perceptions (CP), responsibility perceptions (RP), capability perceptions for literacy (CPL) and responsibility perceptions for literacy (RPL)?  Second, does an intervention based on skill development in questioning and interaction techniques used during storybook read aloud sessions provide parents with new skills to use during and following the intervention?  Third, how does an intervention based on skill development in questioning and interaction techniques used during storybook read aloud sessions change parents\u2019 beliefs and attitudes about the importance of reading aloud, children\u2019s learning, our school, and education in general?\n\tThe data collection process included formative data collection methods as well as summative data collection methods.  The Beliefs and Attitudes Instrument (BAI) was given as a pre-post test quantitative measure.  Summative data were collected through the BAI,   focus group meeting, and the Parent Improvement Instrument (PII).  From a qualitative stance, data were generated formatively with open ended discussions during the parent discussion groups, audio/video taping the parent-child reading sessions, coding of reading sessions and journal writing.  The formative and summative data were analyzed and interpreted to provide answers to the research questions.\n\tThe parents were randomly placed into two groups:  treatment or comparison group.  The treatment group participated in the intervention program during the first four week session, while the comparison group participated in the intervention program during the second four week session.  There were a total of 14 parent participants.  The treatment group consisted of 8 parents while the comparison group consisted of 6 parents.\n\tThe weekly one hour sessions provided parents with a storybook to read.  The parents worked as a group to develop questions to use with their child while they read.  The parents then paired up with their child to read and discuss the story.  Finally, parents returned to the group to discuss their thoughts, perceptions, and impressions of the read aloud sessions. \n\tStory question development was guided by three main objectives.  First, what important ideas did the parents want their child to get from reading the book, such as the themes, vocabulary, or special phrases.  Second, questions were developed to stimulate discussion such as recall, prediction, or making connections between the text and the child\u2019s personal experiences.  Finally, questions were developed to find ways to revisit the book with the child such as extension activities or rereading.  The questions developed by the parent group were typed onto 3 X5 cards and placed inside the book to use with the children at home.  \n\tThe qualitative and quantitative data collected from the BAI, PII, focus group, journals, interviews, and discussion groups revealed these parents valued several aspects of the SPARKLE program.  First, the program provided the parents with a context in which to see their child\u2019s ability to learn.  This insight provided the parent with a new image of their child as being able to learn.  Along with the new context the read aloud sessions provided, the parents also valued the affective side of the read aloud session.  Parents discussed the importance of setting aside time to spend with their child reading and related this back to their own childhood memories of reading with their parents.  \n\tSecond, the treatment group of parents found value in participating in the parent discussion group format.  They continued the use of this discussion group technique with eight other texts after the initial four week period.  This is evidence of their commitment and value placed on the group format.  \n\tThird, the parents also found the variety of the texts used in SPARKLE provided their children with a wider range of reading material.  They felt this exposure to different types of text was important for their child to experience and enjoy.  \n\tThe data collected from the BAI suggested these two groups of parents perceived themselves to be active, responsible, and capable parents.  The treatment group of parents in particular indicated a change in their responsibility perception levels in regards to the importance of talking with other parents and recognizing their child as a reader.  This group of parents also revealed a change in their capability perception levels in identifying their attempts to work with their child as successful.  They also expressed an increase in their capability perceptions of their skills in finding the themes and vocabulary in storybooks.  This is a significant finding since the SPARKLE program directly targeted theme and vocabulary question development.  This finding was also collaborated through the analysis of the focus group transcription coding and in the analysis of the journal entries.  \n\tData collected from the PII suggested these parents found three areas of improvement in their capability and responsibility perceptions for literacy.  First, the parents believed their capabilities to make reading fun and to use reading to learn new things was improved.  Second, the parents believed their responsibility to help their child read and to use literacy daily had improved.  Third, the parents believed their capabilities to motivate and make connections between school and the child\u2019s interests had improved.  \n\tTo conclude, these findings suggest these two groups of parents were able to find value in their participation in the SPARKLE program.  The findings suggest that the program was able to provide a different and effective context in which the parents were able to witness their children as able learners as well as providing a positive context in which the affective side of the read aloud could be experienced between parent and child.  Moreover, the parent discussion group format proved to be a valuable tool for the parents.  The variety of text was also seen as a positive component of the program by these parents.  Continued use of the SPARKLE program with a larger parent sample and alternative scheduling is recommended.  Further research on this program may provide additional insight into how schools can address internal and external barriers to produce more parent involvement in education, more positive parental perceptions, and more effective parental teaching of their children from the start of their school careers.  .  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4222], "author_name_tesi": "Nell, Marcia Lyn", "last_name_ssi": "Nell", "middle_name_ssi": "Lyn", "first_name_ssi": "Marcia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson", "Patrick Willard Shannon", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Debra M Freedman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson, Committee Chair", "Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Debra M Freedman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["parent involvement", "family literacy", "reading alouds", "emergent literacy", "interacitve reading", "parental capabilities", "parental responsibilities", "parental efficacy", "parental rrole construction"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "VENULAR CONTROL OF CAPILLARY PERFUSION\nIN THE PRESENCE OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS", "id": "6215", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3650", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-01-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to investigate and counteract dysfunctional control of capillary flow in hypercholesterolemia and diabetes.  Capillary flow is controlled by arteriolar tone, which in turn is influenced by mediators released from closely paired venules in a mechanism that involves nitric oxide (NO).  However, venular control of capillary flow is altered with the cardiovascular risk factors hypercholesterolemia and diabetes.\n\nIn our experiments involving the microcirculation of the rat mesentery, the arteriolar pathway leading to the capillary was videotaped to measure the percent of the surrounding area (within 15 microns) that was occupied by a venule (% pairing). Capillary velocity was measured using an optical Doppler velocimeter. A positive correlation between capillary velocity and % pairing observed in normal rats was not observed during NO synthase inhibition, or in either hypercholesterolemic or diabetic rats.  However, positive correlations between the two parameters were found in hypercholesterolemia when the rats were given drinking water supplementation of L-arginine or an injection of anti-neutrophil serum. In diabetic rats, venular control of capillary perfusion was restored by treatment with fucoidan, which inhibits venular leukocyte adhesion. These results indicate that dysfunctional venular control of capillary perfusion in both hypercholesterolemia and diabetes may be a consequence of a neutrophil-mediated deficiency of NO. We also found that % pairing levels in diabetic rats decreased approximately 50% in comparison to normal rats, which might also contribute to inadequate control of capillary perfusion in diabetes. \n\nIn our method of calculating the parameter % pairing, we assumed that 15 microns gives an adequate measure of the extent of arterio-venular communication capability. This distance might not be appropriate for all mediators and situations. Also, the current method of calculation is not based on a diffusion equation, although we assume that communication between the arteriole and venule will involve diffusion of some mediator. In order to address these concerns, we developed an additional pairing parameter, based on a mathematical model of diffusion between a venule and an arteriole, solved by finite element analysis. Comparisons show that the results of our study are similar whether using the diffusional pairing parameter or the % pairing based on area.\n\nArteriolar tone is partially controlled by diffusing mediators released by closely paired venules, and is reported to depend on venular shear and venular leukocyte adherence.  Arteriolar and venular wall concentrations of NO were measured in control and diabetic rat mesentery with fluorescent diaminofluorescein-2-diacetate (DAF-2-DA); tissue NO was measured with DAF-2.  Microvascular NO in diabetic rats was found to be significantly lower (< 50%) than in controls.  In normal rats, arteriolar NO demonstrated a positive correlation with venular NO and measurements of venular shear, and a negative correlation with measurements of venular leukocyte adherence. Diabetes eliminated all these correlations. No correlation was present between arteriolar NO and arteriolar shear in either normal or diabetic rats. These results indicate that arteriolar NO is enhanced by venular shear in normal but not in diabetic rats and this might contribute to dysfunctional venular control of capillary perfusion in diabetes. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3630], "author_name_tesi": "Nellore, Kavitha ", "last_name_ssi": "Nellore", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kavitha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Norman R Harris", "Peter J Butler", "David A Antonetti", "Herbert Herling Lipowsky"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Norman R Harris, Committee Chair", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "David A Antonetti, Committee Member", "Herbert Herling Lipowsky, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nitric Oxide", "Diabetes", "Hypercholesterolemia", "Microcirculation", "Arterio-Venular Communication", "Capillary flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "SUPPRESSION OF egl-13 SOX DOMAIN MUTANTS REVEALS A NOVEL FUNCTION FOR SOME MEIOTIC GENES", "id": "7181", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "725", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The gene egl-13 is needed for the proper development of the C. elegans uterine seam cell, an essential component of the egg-laying apparatus.  In order to determine what other genes may be required for uterine seam cell development, a suppressor screen was performed, and two suppressors, him-8 and ku376 were discovered.  I have characterized the genetic behavior of these two suppressors to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of their action.  Only mutations within the C2H2 zinc fingers of him-8 are able to suppress the egg-laying and connection-of-gonad defects of egl-13 non-null mutants.  I have found that wild-type HIM-8 acts in a semi-dominant fashion either upstream of or parallel to egl-13 in an antagonistic manner.  The genetic behaviors of him-8 in suppression are different than its previously characterized genetic behavior in meiosis.  I have shown that him-8 functions outside of the germ line and independently of its role in meiosis, revealing a novel function for him-8.  Also, egl-13 may not be the only target of the him-8 suppressive function, as I have shown that some pop-1 defects can also be suppressed. ku376 also suppresses the defects of non-null egl-13 mutants, acting in a semi-dominant fashion.  Whereas him-8 mutants also have a high-incidence-of-males phenotype, ku376 has no phenotype on its own.  I have mapped the ku376 locus to the far left end of the fourth chromosome and have identified two candidate genes, but the molecular identity of ku376 remains unknown.  While we do not know if ku376 plays any role in meiosis, I have shown that suppression of egl-13 defects can be effected by mutations in other meiotic genes beside him-8, suggested a broader role for meiotic C2H2 zinc finger proteins outside of meiosis.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [719], "author_name_tesi": "Nelms, Brian Lewis", "last_name_ssi": "Nelms", "middle_name_ssi": "Lewis", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Pamela J Mitchell", "David Scott Gilmour", "Richard W Ordway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Chair", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Member", "Pamela J Mitchell, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["C. elegans", "egl-13", "him-8", "uterine", "development"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "MONTE CARLO METHODS FOR NEUTRON TRANSPORT ON GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNITS USING CUDA\n\n\n\n", "id": "10202", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "129", "abstract_tesi": "This work examined the feasibility of utilizing Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate Monte Carlo neutron transport problems.  These GPUs use many parallel processors to perform the complex calculations necessary to create three-dimensional images at fast enough rates for the video game industry.  In 2006 NVIDIA released a programming framework (called CUDA) that allows developers to easily program for the many cores provided by GPUs for general purpose programs.  Initial assessments have suggested that the MC algorithm may not be able to fully utilize the GPU constraints.  These constraints include the fact that MC codes are highly dependent on branch statements (IF, ELSE, FOR, and WHILE) which can have a large impact on GPU performance.  \nIn this work, a Monte Carlo neutron transport code was written from scratch to be run on both the x86 CPU platform and the GPU CUDA platform to understand the type of performance that can be gained by utilizing GPUs.\nAfter optimizing the code to run on the GPU, a speedup of nearly 21x was found when using only single-precision floating point math.  This can be further increased with no additional effort if accuracy is sacrificed for speed: using a compiler flag, the speedup was increased to nearly 24x.  Further, if double-precision floating point math is desired for neutron tracking through the geometry, a speedup of 11x was found.\nWhile the GPUs have proven to be useful, they are not without limitations.  The following are such limitations: the maximum memory currently available on a single GPU is 4GB; the GPU RAM does not provide error-checking and correction; and the optimization required to decrease GPU runtime can lead to code that is not readable by those who are not the original developers.  \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [128], "author_name_tesi": "Nelson, Adam Gregory", "last_name_ssi": "Nelson", "middle_name_ssi": "Gregory", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Maria Nikolova Avramova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Thesis Advisor", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Thesis Advisor", "Maria Nikolova Avramova, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["gpu", "neutron transport", "gp-gpu", "monte carlo", "cuda"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Insights into the Mechanism of Action of 13-cis Retinoic Acid in Suppressing Sebaceous Gland Function\n\n", "id": "7530", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "287", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nearly 40-50 million people of all races and ages in the United States have acne, making it the most common skin disease. Although acne is not a serious health threat, severe acne can lead to disfiguring, permanent scarring; increased anxiety; and depression. Isotretinoin (13-cis Retinoic Acid) is the most potent agent that affects each of the pathogenic features of acne: 1) follicular hyperkeratinization, 2) the activity of Propionibacterium acnes, 3) inflammation and 4) increased sebum production.\nIsotretinoin has been on the market since 1982 and even though it has been prescribed for 25 years, extensive studies into its molecular mechanism of action in human skin and sebaceous glands have not been done. Since isotretinoin is a teratogen, there is a clear need for safe and effective alternative therapeutic agents. The studies undertaken in this thesis were designed to increase our understanding of the effects of 13-cis RA on the sebaceous gland and its mechanism of action in sebum suppression. \nIt is well established that isotretinoin drastically reduces the size and lipid secretion of sebaceous glands.  We hypothesized that isotretinoin decreases the size of the sebaceous gland by inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis and that sebum suppression is most likely an indirect result of the reduced size of the sebaceous gland.\nOur studies show that 13-cis RA, unlike 9-cis RA or ATRA, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in SEB-1 sebocytes. Its ability to induce apoptosis is not inhibited in the presence of functional retinoic acid receptor (RAR) pan antagonist AGN 193198, suggesting an RAR-independent mechanism of apoptosis. Gene expression analysis was performed in cultured SEB-1 sebocytes that were treated with 13-cis RA and in biopsies of skin taken from patients that were treated for one week with isotretinoin. These data indicate that 13-cis RA increases expression of neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) and Tumor Necrosis Factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL). In turn, we report that both NGAL and TRAIL induce apoptosis within SEB-1 sebocytes and, as such, are potential mediators of 13-cis RA induced apoptosis in human sebocytes.   \nThese studies into the mechanism of action of 13-cis RA in sebaceous glands suggest that 13-cis RA mediates its sebosuppressive effect through preferential induction of apoptosis in sebaceous glands. Furthermore, these data provide a rationale for drug discovery of alternative agents that are capable of selectively inducing apoptosis in sebaceous glands as a treatment for severe acne. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [284], "author_name_tesi": "Nelson, Amanda Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Nelson", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Diane M Thiboutot", "Gary Alan Clawson", "Mark Kester, Ph D", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Jong Kak Yun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Diane M Thiboutot, Committee Chair", "Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Member", "Mark Kester, Ph D, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["skin", "retinoin", "acne"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "ATTENTION TO GENDER STEREOTYPIC EXPRESSIONS OF THREAT: THE INTERACTIVE NATURE OF GENDER AND FACIAL MATURITY\n", "id": "12244", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "172", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current thesis examines whether attention to threatening facial expressions is moderated by\nface gender (Study 1), whether this effect is driven by gender categorization (Study 2a) or\ngender-related appearance (Study 2b), and whether attentional biases to gender-expression pairs\nare influenced by implicit gender stereotypes (Study 4).

The notorious 1918 pandemic of \u2018Spanish flu\u2019 was associated with 20-50 million deaths worldwide and is considered one of the most devastating single disease outbreaks in history.  Despite intensive year-round sequencing and antigenic characterization of global influenza A viruses, major aspects of influenza A virus evolution and epidemiology remain poorly understood.  In particular, the dominant model of influenza A virus evolution by long-term \u2018antigenic drift\u2019, while clearly of great importance for viral escape of host antibodies, inadequately explains important epidemic dynamics.  Significantly, neither the distinct winter seasonality of the influenza A virus, nor the sudden emergence of major antigenic variants are fully accounted for on the basis of antigenic drift alone.  \n\nThrough phylogenetic analysis of whole-genome influenza viruses sampled intensively over multiple discrete spatial-temporal scales, the studies in this thesis reveal evolutionary dynamics that have been previously obscured by spatially limited sampling and sequencing of the HA1 domain in isolation. Most notably, although strong immune selection periodically limits genetic diversity through antigenic drift, multiple diverse viral lineages typically co-circulate globally and are introduced into a given locality during an epidemic.  This genetic diversity co-circulates over the course of an epidemic, allowing for frequent genomic \u2018reassortment\u2019 and greatly complicating patterns of spatial-temporal dissemination.  The process of reassortment is capable of situating antigenic novelty within a more compatible viral genome, rapidly producing influenza viruses of greater overall fitness that occasionally are associated with major epidemics.  In addition, extensive global migration results in complex global networks between viral populations from different geo-climatic regions, and these networks appear to be critical for the continual survival of the virus and \u2018re-seeding\u2019 of local epidemics.  Further understanding of this intricate global ecology is central to understanding the evolution of the influenza A virus, and will require surveillance to be substantially increased in important under-sampled regions such as South-East Asia.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4122], "author_name_tesi": "Nelson, Martha Irene", "last_name_ssi": "Nelson", "middle_name_ssi": "Irene", "first_name_ssi": "Martha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew George Stephenson", "Edward C Holmes", "Reka Z Albert", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Chair", "Edward C Holmes, Committee Member", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["influenza virus", "phylogenetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Public Opinion on the Disproportionate Representation of Blacks and Hispanics in the Criminal Justice System\n", "id": "11819", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4363", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While there has been a significant amount of empirical attention dedicated to examining both the disproportionate representation of racial/ethnic minorities in the criminal justice system and public opinion on criminal justice issues, no study has yet to examine public perceptions as to why Blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system.

Most prevention strategies utilize socioecological models to design interventions that contextualize obesity-related risk behaviors. Behavior change models, such as the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), are often used to characterize the pathways by which changes occur within these socioecological frameworks. SCT proposes that individual- and environmental-level variables within different socioecological contexts mediate changes in actual behaviors. \n\nPeer-led nutrition education is one novel prevention strategy utilized to modify behaviors through increases in individual-level mediators, such as social support and social norms related to living a healthy lifestyle. Limited studies have used peer-based intervention strategies to reduce risky eating behaviors in adolescence. Peer-led culinary nutrition education serves as one innovative avenue for teaching youth how to apply nutrition education to experiment with foods. There has been a demand to resurrect culinary nutrition education programs for school-aged children, because lack of culinary skills has been associated with poorer dietary habits. Future research needs to test the effectiveness of peer-led approaches to culinary nutrition education on behavior change among children and adolescents. \n\nThis research project was conducted to develop and evaluate the feasibility of designing three culinary nutrition education lessons that effectively impact SCT mediators of behavior change among adolescents. This project also sought to validate a SCT tool for adolescents and parents that may be used to assess changes in SCT mediators among adolescents and their parents in future peer-led nutrition education lessons aimed at implementing the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010. The validated lessons and psychometric tools will be used in a future peer-led nutrition education program to understand if novel peer-led programs can modify obesity-related risk behaviors in adolescence.\n\nIn the first part of this research project, culinary nutrition education lessons were pilot tested in two studies. In the first pilot study, early adolescent youth (ages 11-14 years) were recruited to participate in a 2-hour Family Menu Planning lesson. In the second pilot study, youth were recruited to participate in two, 2-hour mechanical and perceptual culinary skills lessons, Culinary Skills and Culinary Skills In Action. In both pilot studies, participants were asked to participate in each 2-hour lesson, followed by a 1-hour focus group. Content validity analyses were conducted to assess internal validity prior to pilot testing. Process evaluation tools were used to measure feasibility of conducting the lessons in an after-school setting. Focus groups captured data for assessments of formative outcomes and self-reported behavior change mediators.\n\nEight adolescent females participated in the pilot testing of all three lessons. Participants were all Caucasian and either enrolled in the sixth or seventh grades. \nContent validity analyses revealed that all three lessons were valid for achieving key lesson objectives. Process analyses from the pilot studies indicated that it was feasible to deliver each lesson to early adolescent children in an after-school setting. Observers from the research team rated that students were highly engaged in all three lessons and that most learning objective tasks were executed \u201cwell\u201d by the instructor. All tasks rated as \u201cnot completed well\u201d by observers in the Culinary Skills and Culinary Skills In Action lessons were related to time constraints.\n\nFormative data from focus groups revealed that students were highly satisfied with all three lessons. Most participants would have been more satisfied, if the lessons would have had more visual learning aids, hands-on activities and opportunities for participants to teach their peers. All three lessons impacted self-reported heightened self-efficacy, social support and outcome expectations related to both family menu planning and mechanical and perceptual culinary concepts. In summary, results from the first part of this research project suggest that it is feasible to deliver culinary skills lessons that effectively impact mediators of behavior change in early adolescent youth. These results warrant the use of these lessons in a future peer-led culinary nutrition education program for adolescents. \n\nThe second part of this research involved validating the effectiveness of SCT tools for assessing changes in SCT mediators among adolescents and their parents. Early adolescent children, between the ages of 11-14 years, and their parents were recruited to participate in a pilot study for instrument testing. Parents-child dyads were asked to complete SCT questionnaires at two time points within one week. Time 1 responses were used to assess the internal consistency of scales for each SCT mediator on the parent and adolescent questionnaires. Scales with Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 values  \u22650.70 were considered internally consistent. For all scales with Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 >0.70, item-total analyses were used to remove individual items from scales, if item deletion resulted in higher \u03b1 values. Test-retest reliability analyses between Time 1 and Time 2 were conducted for each SCT mediator with Spearman correlations.\n\nA total of 42 parent-child dyads completed SCT questionnaires at Time 1, and 36 pairs completed questionnaires at Time 2. Youth had a mean\u00b1SD age of 12.3\u00b10.6 years and were enrolled in the seventh grade. A majority of participants were female (n=31, 73.8%) and Caucasian (n=32, 76.2%). The mean\u00b1SD age of parents was 48.3\u00b15.1. Parents were mostly female (n=30, 71.4%) and Caucasian (n=29, 69.0%), had either a 4-year college degree (n=21, 50.0%) or master\u2019s degree (n=12, 28.6%) and possessed mid-high household incomes (n=32, 76.2%).\n\nCronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficient for most scales on both the adolescent and parent SCT questionnaires were \u22650.70, suggesting internal consistency of questionnaires. Self-regulation related to Balancing calories to manage weight had low-to-moderate internal consistency for both the parent and adolescent SCT questionnaires. Item-deletion analysis revealed that dropping items related to more restrictive weight management behaviors increased the internal consistency of both questionnaires. Test-retest reliability analysis revealed that both instruments possessed high internal reliability between study time points. Time 1 and time 2 responses were highly correlated, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.40 to 0.97 for both questionnaires. Results from the second part of this research suggest that the SCT tools may be useful for assessing changes in SCT mediators among adolescents and their parents who participate in a future peer-led culinary nutrition education program, aimed at promoting the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010. \n\nIn summary, it is feasible to deliver culinary nutrition education lessons that effectively impact SCT mediators among early adolescent youth. Furthermore, the SCT instruments may be useful for assessing changes in SCT mediators over time in future nutrition education programs. Future use of these lessons in a peer-led format may provide a developmentally relevant strategy for teaching youth the basic skills they need to select, handle and prepare food in the current food environment.

A vital component of many metabolic pathways, an inverse causal relationship of Se with inflammatory diseases, including cancers, and infections has been suggested. While deficiency is frequently the center of discussion, some studies have emphasized the importance of different Se levels in disease regulation, establishing the true physiological significance of this element. The metabolic action of Se is seen through selenoproteins, which are synthesized by a complex mechanism. With over 25 identified selenoproteins, the health implications of these proteins are seen in their ability to decrease oxidative stress and inflammation. The study presented here aims to understand the anti-inflammatory effects of Se. \n\nUsing a combination of ex-vivo and in-vitro macrophage models, the anti-inflammatory benefits of Se were investigated using a bacterial endotoxin, LPS, and Th-2 cytokine, IL-4, treated murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM). Previous studies have shown that Se supplementation of macrophages led to a decrease in LPS-induced expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), a prototypical marker of classical (M1) macrophage activation. In the current study, IL-4 treated macrophages supplemented with 100 nM Se significantly increased the expression of alternatively activated macrophage (M2) markers, Arg-I, Ym1, and Fizz1. Se treatment also increased the enzymatic activity of Arg-I. Conversely, expression of classically activated macrophage (M1) markers, TNF\u03b1, iNOS, and IL1\u03b2, were significantly decreased in LPS treated macrophages cultured in 100 nM Se and IL-4, suggesting a synergistic effect of Se and IL-4. Interestingly, studies utilizing Trspfl/flCreLysM KO mice macrophages, characterized by a total loss of selenoprotein expression, or those lacking GPX1, a highly expressed selenoprotein, showed a complete abrogation of Arg-I activity, even under high Se (250nM) conditions, demonstrating the importance of selenoproteins for alternative macrophage activation, leading to attenuated inflammation. \n\nTo effectively translate these findings into an in-vivo model, a gastrointestinal helminthic parasite model was used. The helminthic parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) is a short-lived murine parasite that migrates from the skin via the lungs to the small intestines, before clearance 14 days after infection. Mice infected with Nb and supplemented with Se significantly increased the expression of the M2 markers Arg-I, Ym1, and Fizz1 in the small intestines, while decreasing the presence of intestinal worms and fecal eggs. To implicate macrophage-specific selenoproteins in resolution of the infection, Se supplemented Trspfl/flCreWT and Trspfl/flCreLysM mice were infected and compared. Results showed a complete abrogation of M2 marker expression with a significant increase in intestinal worms and fecal eggs in the Trsp KO mice, even in the presence of Se supplementation. Moreover, inhibition of the COX pathway using indomethacin, a non-specific COX inhibitor, stunted the expression of M2 markers despite high Se levels. Intriguingly, treatment of Nb-infected Se deficient mice with 15d-PGJ2, an anti-inflammatory prostaglandin metabolite of the COX pathway enhanced by dietary Se, partially recapitulated the effect of Se deficiency.\n\nTaken together, the experiments conducted in this dissertation suggest that optimal Se status, in the form of selenoproteins, is critical to shunt macrophage activation towards an M2 phenotype that promotes enhanced clearance of gastrointestinal parasites.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8285], "author_name_tesi": "Nelson, Shakira Melissa", "last_name_ssi": "Nelson", "middle_name_ssi": "Melissa", "first_name_ssi": "Shakira", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Pamela Hankey Giblin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Chair", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Selenium", "macrophages", "helminths", "PPARgamma", "NSAIDS", "small intestines", "Nippostrongylus brasiliensis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Balancing School Choice and Political Voice: An Analysis of the Legality of Public Charter Schools in New Orleans, Louisiana Under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act", "id": "23640", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10205", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Charter schools are a growing phenomenon in the United States. The once emerging educational reform has grown into the linchpin reform in the United States. As charter schools, continue to grow in popularity as defined by states authorizing their operations, total schools operated and total number of students served, issues of race threaten to plague the advancement of the charter school movement. Charter schools are seen as a civil rights boon to minority parents; however, this research discusses how charter schools may run counter to historical narratives of civil rights. Through a Voting Rights Act analysis under Section 2 of the Act, the researcher determines that charter schools threaten the political participation and voice of racial minorities.\n     This study uses a statistical analysis embedded in a legal analysis of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to advance the argument that appointed charter school boards in New Orleans, Louisiana do not reflect the voting age population of the city. The study first examines case law to discover that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act could be used a viable argument against the establishment, maintenance and/or expansion of charter schools. After finding that case law may support claims against appointed charter school boards under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, the study uses a Fisher Exact Test of Independence to prove that appointed charter school boards in New Orleans result in less descriptive representation for Black parents. The resultant p-value (0.0019528) for combined appointed charter school boards is significant at the .01 significance level. As disaggregated by charter school management type, the p-values are significant for both appointed charter school boards that operate one charter school or several charter schools.\n     This study introduces a new discourse into the legality of the implementation of charter schools as well as the political and policy consequences of the implementation of charter schools. The study contributes to a broad array of literature on the subjects of the efficacy of appointed school boards to translate into representation for minorities and the legality of charter schools as related to the rights of minority parents. The results of this study are important as they introduce educational leaders, in their roles as educators, administrators or policymakers, to a counternarrative to theories of charter schools as a civil rights boon for minorities.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9892], "author_name_tesi": "Nelson, Steven Leonice", "last_name_ssi": "Nelson", "middle_name_ssi": "Leonice", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Erica Frankenberg", "Preston Green", "David Alexander Gamson", "Michael Barth Berkman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Erica Frankenberg, Dissertation Advisor", "Preston Green, Dissertation Advisor", "David Alexander Gamson, Committee Member", "Michael Barth Berkman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Charter Schools", "School Reform", "Voting Rights", "Minority Students", "School Boards", "Representation", "Appointed School Boards"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Two-plume Dynamics beneath the East African Rift System: a Geochemical Perspective\n\n\n", "id": "10184", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6537", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation presents new geochemical data investigating the origin of the chemically dissimilar Kenya and Afar mantle plumes and the contributions of these plumes to volcanism beneath Ethiopia. This study focuses primarily on mafic lavas from three localities on the poorly characterized eastern Ethiopian plateau but also includes lavas from the northwest Ethiopian plateau as well as Re-Os isotopic data from various key locations throughout the East Africa Rift System. The location of the samples sites provides a framework for a spatial and temporal assessment of the influence the Afar and Kenya plumes have on volcanism. We are also able to evaluate the role of the lithospheric mantle including its contribution to melt production and its influence on upwelling mantle plume material. Expansion of the data set to include northwest Ethiopian plateau lavas and key volcanic sites throughout the region allow us to consider the origin of HIMU mantle component observed in Kenya plume lavas but absent from Afar plume products. \n\nGeochemical data demonstrate the sources contributing to volcanism on the eastern Ethiopian plateau vary over space and time. Northernmost Oligocene-Miocene lavas from Asbe Tefari are chemically similar to well characterized high-TiO2 Afar plume flood basalts from northwest Ethiopia. These lavas are chemically evolved and record contributions from the continental crust. Debre Sahil and Bale Mountains lavas are respectively located 85 km and 230 km to the southwest. Unlike Asbe Tefari basalts, Miocene Debre Sahil and Bale Mountains lavas are chemically similar to Kenya plume lavas produced in Turkana (northern Kenya). Pliocene-Recent Bale Mountains lavas do not resemble their Miocene predecessors but are compositionally similar to Quaternary lavas found within the Main Ethiopian Rift indicating a change in source beneath the Bale Mountains over time. Miocene-Recent alkaline lavas from Debre Sahil and Bale Mountains were derived near the base of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle and record its variable influence. In contrast, transitional Miocene lavas were generated with the asthenosphere and did not experience lithospheric contamination, thus recording Kenya plume compositions. \n\nThe Kenya and Afar mantle plumes are consistent isotopically with low 3He/4He HIMU and high 3He/4He \u201cC\u201d mantle components, respectively. Re-Os isotopic data demonstrate the Kenya plume is the product of mixing recycling ~ 2 Ga oceanic crust with typical enriched mantle plume material, producing 187Os/188Os = 0.1450-0.1483 similar to other global HIMU OIB. The Afar plume has typical enriched plume values (187Os/188Os = 0.1239-0.1311). Sr-Nd-Pb isotopic data from eastern plateau lava are consistent with major and trace element geochemical data. Asbe Tefari record \u201cC\u201d like Afar contributions. Miocene Debre Sahil and Bale Mountain lavas have a HIMU-flavor, though transitional Bale Mountains lavas display a more dilute signature due to chemical heterogeneities within the Kenya plume or mixing with Afar plume material prior to eruption. Pliocene-Recent Bale Mountains lavas record Afar contributions consistent with Main Ethiopian Rift lavas. Hf isotopic data demonstrate HIMU-Kenya plume lavas likely incorporated a recycled oceanic crust while lavas with Afar plume signature have signatures consistent with peridotite melting. Transitional Bale Mountains lavas and high-TiO2 lavas from northwest Ethiopia have high-Ni olivine, indicative of pyroxenite melting. In contrast, alkaline HIMU-flavored lavas Debre Sahil, Bale Mountains, and Turkana have low-Ni olivine. We suggest that recycled oceanic crust is present in both Afar and Kenya plumes. The thick lithosphere beneath the Ethiopian plateau promotes the reaction between eclogite melt and peridotite solid to form pyroxenite while thin lithosphere beneath Turkana allows peridotite to melt and mix with eclogite melt instead of forming pyroxenite. Pyroxenite melts will record isotopic signatures similar to the parent peridotite while eclogite-peridotite melt mixes will have a stronger recycled (HIMU) component.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6536], "author_name_tesi": "Nelson, Wendy Rae", "last_name_ssi": "Nelson", "middle_name_ssi": "Rae", "first_name_ssi": "Wendy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tanya Furman", "Tanya Furman", "Maureen Feineman", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tanya Furman, Dissertation Advisor", "Tanya Furman, Committee Chair", "Maureen Feineman, Committee Member", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HIMU", "mantle plume", "Afar", "East African Rift", "basalt"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Settlement and Population at Piedras Negras, Guatemala\n", "id": "6547", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6959", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tMy dissertation examines the relationship between settlement and population at Piedras Negras, Guatemala. This Classic Maya center developed from a small village into a major polity over the course of a thousand years. Excavations from within the site conducted by the University of Pennsylvania (1931-1937) and the Projecto Piedras Negras (1997-2000, 2004) have greatly expanded our knowledge of the center and its surrounding areas.\n\tMapping crews have discovered over 500 structures in the site core, and an additional 250 structures within two kilometers of the center. Numerous test pits were placed throughout epicentral Piedras Negras to define the chronology of the center and to better understand its change and development over time. In addition, several patio groups were completely excavated to understand their development through time.\n\tA model of population change and center development can be derived from the information collected via excavations. Epicentral Piedras Negras had a very low population during most of its existence which only peaked to a maximum of 2600 inhabitants during the Chacalhaaz ceramic phase (AD 750-825). During this same period, the polity of Piedras Negras had a maximum population of 50,000 people with a density of 15 people per square kilometer. \n\tAgricultural practices based on a medium fallow system could have supported the inhabitants of Piedras Negras (the center) without the use of any intensive agricultural features due to its low population. The lack of agricultural terracing generally supports this conclusion. \n\tA study of the remains of patio groups indicates that there are differences in the material culture between epicentral patio groups (or the remains of households) and differences between rural patio groups and epicentral patio groups. These differences suggest that differential access to material goods occurred within the social structure of the ancient center.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6956], "author_name_tesi": "Nelson, Zachary ", "last_name_ssi": "Nelson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zachary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Lee Webster", "Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Matthew Bennett Restall", "Stephen Houston", "William Sanders"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Lee Webster, Committee Chair", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Member", "Matthew Bennett Restall, Committee Member", "Stephen Houston, Committee Member", "William Sanders, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Settlement", "Population", "Maya", "Guatemala", "Piedras Negras", "Urbanism"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Berlioz's National Monumentalism: Expanding the Soft Power Paradigm", "id": "15262stn2", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15262", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent interpretations of Berlioz\u2019s \u201cpolitical\u201d compositions typically cast him as a liberal republican (Barzun 2003) or as a Bonapartist (Rushton 2003). While useful, these assessments complicate ideas about his political orientation. Determining Berlioz\u2019s position on the political spectrum is less important than engaging with the effects of his music as statements of French grandeur, in which he exemplifies multiple political persuasions simultaneously. For example, Berlioz\u2019s 1830 arrangement of Rouget de Lisle\u2019s La Marseillaise, the 1835 cantata on the death of Napoleon, Le cinq mai, and the 1855 exaltation of Emperor Louis-Napoleon (Napoleon III), L\u2019Imperiale, show a clear contrast in purpose. Works in the \u201carchitectural\u201d or \u201cmonumental\u201d style, described by MacDonald (1982), Cairns (2000), and Locke (2000), which include the 1837 Grande messe des morts (or Requiem), the 1840 Symphonie fun\u00e8bre et triomphale, the 1849 Te Deum, and L\u2019Imperiale, fulfill Bloom\u2019s (1998) description of Berlioz\u2019s reputation \u201cas a patriotic composer with a penchant and talent for the musically grandiose.\u201d To these architectural works, I apply the term \u201cnational monumentalism,\u201d conceived by Therborn to classify grand architecture in nineteenth-century European capital cities as symbols of political power. By technique of orchestration, ensemble size, performance space, or grandeur of occasion, music in the national monumentalist style exalts the state, monarch, or citizenry in times of war, mourning, or celebration. For example, the sixteen timpani in the Requiem\u2019s \u201cTuba Mirum\u201d evoke the horror of the Day of Judgment, but they and similar instances of \u201cmonumental\u201d orchestration also elevate the French nation, its citizens, or its government.\n\nHowever, to say that there are \u201cpolitical\u201d compositions in Berlioz\u2019s \u0153uvre is not enough.  The modern political paradigm of soft power allows us to examine Berlioz\u2019s political works without the problem of having to classify his ideology. Scholars describe a soft power \u201cumbrella,\u201d under which resides the hierarchy of \u201cpublic diplomacy,\u201d \u201ccultural diplomacy,\u201d \u201carts diplomacy,\u201d and, finally, \u201corchestral diplomacy.\u201d While soft power is typically exercised on citizens from foreign nations, I suggest that national monumentalism fits within the \u201cumbrella\u201d as a lateral extension of arts diplomacy. Thus, I argue that Berlioz\u2019s two \u201cmonumental\u201d Latin works, the Grande messe des morts and the Te Deum, operate as soft power, and engage both foreign and domestic publics. Not solely the funeral music for the Comte de Damr\u00e9mont, the Grande messe des morts represents the most volcanic example of the Minister Gasparin\u2019s desire to restore French ceremonial music to its previous heights of prestige. Similarly, the Te Deum, though not commissioned on behalf of Emperor Napoleon III, engages with a foreign public in the opening and closing ceremonies at the French Exposition Universelle of 1855, which displayed France\u2019s modern mechanized achievements to dignitaries from all over the world. In viewing Berlioz\u2019s grandiose compositional achievements through the lenses of national monumentalism and soft power, we can interpret these political works as an exaltation of the French nation to its citizens both at home and abroad, using them as a barometer for French culture, changes in attitude, and patriotism. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16769], "author_name_tesi": "Nemeth, Samuel Tyler", "last_name_ssi": "Nemeth", "middle_name_ssi": "Tyler", "first_name_ssi": "Samuel", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Musicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark C.

He is often compared to King Kamehameha I.  The significance of the contrast in these two figures is critical in understanding Kahanamoku.

Kamehameha\u2019s reign marked the beginning of the end of native Hawaiian sovereign rule.  Conversely, Kahanamoku became a popular yet mythical king of a vanquished race who symbolized a new Hawaiian identity.  As a result, Duke Kahanamoku\u2019s life represents more than great athletic achievements and heroic feats that allowed him to become a legendary figure in Hawai`i.  Kahanamoku became the link between the old and the new images of Hawaiian culture.

In his lifetime, Hawai\u2019i moved from an independent monarchy to full statehood in the United States of America.  During Kahanamoku\u2019s era Hawaiian traditions, banned under the puritanical influence of nineteenth-century missionaries, were rediscovered and used as marketing tools to advertise a new Hawaiian culture.  The concept of being Hawaiian moved from a standard of bloodlines to one of geographical citizenship.  Kahanamoku was instrumental in all of these developments, whether by intention or by default.  He symbolized the new Hawai`i, and yet he was at the same time a vivid reminder of the old dying breed of pureblooded Hawaiians.\nKahanamoku\u2019s life reflects so much of the cultural changes occurring in Hawai`i that a study of him reveals much of the cultural, racial, political and economic battles that have served to create the Hawai`i, that many now embrace as a tropical paradise and playground.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2622], "author_name_tesi": "Nendel, James Dean", "last_name_ssi": "Nendel", "middle_name_ssi": "Dean", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Dyreson", "Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Arlene Thompson", "Doug Anderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Dyreson, Committee Chair", "Robert Scott Kretchmar, Committee Member", "Arlene Thompson, Committee Member", "Doug Anderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Olympics", "Swimming", "History", "Sport", "Hawaiian Values", "Hollywood", "Hawaii"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Efficacy of a Freshman Outdoor Orientation Program on Student Transition to University Life", "id": "0z708w40c", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11175", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Outdoor Orientation Programs (OOPs) have become a staple at many universities for first year students to assist with the transition to college life.

Many of these microscopic structures found their places in important commercial applications, while research is going on toward finding materials with even smaller length scales. The thermal loads imposed on these devices and structures create a major obstacle toward their applicability. This challenge is driving a renewed interest among researchers from various disciplines, toward the topic of thermal management. The interest in the topic of thermal transport served as the motivation for the work performed in the dissertation. More specifically, the following topics were investigated:\n\n\begin{itemize}\n\nitem {\bf Transport in One-Dimensional Nonlinear Systems:} Thermal transport in materials can be explained in terms of the motion of the heat carriers at the microscopic level, with the heat carriers typically being electrons, phonons, atoms, or molecules. However, an important and surprising situation emerges in some low dimensional model systems; the thermal conductivity diverges with system size. It was shown (Toda, 1979) that nonlinearity has an important effect in the heat transport in low dimensional systems. We investigate the transport of energy in a nonlinear one-dimensional chain. We show the spontaneous generation of solitons with the application of forcing functions at the end of the chain and study the different properties of the solitons generated in the chain.\n\nitem {\bf Transport in FLuids \textemdash Study of Pair Distribution Function:} Thermal transport in fluids is also diffusive in nature. The transport of heat depends on the distribution of particles in the fluid. It is well known that the two-particle distribution function can describe most of the thermodynamic properties for classical fluids in thermal equilibrium. We review the approximate integral equation theories (Percus-Yevick, Hypernetted chain approximation) to obtain the pair distribution function of classical fluids. We find that these methods are highly dependent on the choice of the thermodynamic parameters of the fluid. We solve several Lennard-Jones fluid systems with different density and temperature values and prepare a density-temperature compressibility diagram. This diagram shows the region of applicability of these theories and helps us obtain the pair distribution function for a Lennard-Jones fluid with known thermodynamic parameters. We also suggest a modification of the integral-equation theories to obtain the pair distribution functions of quantum fluids. We show how the knowledge of pair distribution function can be used to obtain various thermodynamic properties of the quantum fluid helium-4.\n\nitem {\bf Thermal Transport Across Interfaces:} When thermal energy is transported from one material to another, there is a discontinuity in temperature at the interface between them. This thermal boundary resistance is known as Kapitza resistance. The scattering of phonons at interfaces is one of the main reasons behind the presence of thermal boundary resistance. We explore the scattering of acoustic waves at several solid-solid interfaces using lattice dynamical methods. We consider the interfaces formed between two similar lattices with different lattice parameters. The different lattices considered are given by: one-dimensional harmonic chain, two-dimensional rhombic lattice, two-dimensional square-lattice and three-dimensional FCC lattice, respectively. We derive matrix equations to obtain the reflection and transmission coefficients for an acoustic wave incident on the interface. These coefficients can reproduce the familiar expressions in the continuum limit and are consistent with the conservation relations. \n\nWe discuss a method to obtain the thermal boundary resistance for neutral solid-fluid interfaces. The acoustic mismatch theory works poorly for solid-fluid interfaces. One reason is that this theory only includes the long wavelength acoustic phonons. Transverse sound waves are shown to exist in fluids, although the waves are highly damped and totally diffusive at long wavelength. These damped waves can diffuse through interfaces and they can carry heat away from the interface. Hence the transverse sound waves can still play a role in the thermal boundary resistance. Our theory includes all the phonon modes in the solid and all the sound modes in the fluid, in the calculation of the thermal boundary resistance. We provide an application of the method to obtain the thermal boundary resistance at the interface between solid Argon and liquid Neon. Our method yields the value for Kapitza conductance for solid Argon-fluid Neon interface to be $0.0374$GW/Km$^2$.\n\nend{itemize}\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5851], "author_name_tesi": "Neogi, Sanghamitra ", "last_name_ssi": "Neogi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sanghamitra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gerald Dennis Mahan", "Gerald Dennis Mahan", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Jun Zhu", "John V Badding"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gerald Dennis Mahan, Dissertation Advisor", "Gerald Dennis Mahan, Committee Chair", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Jun Zhu, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Solitons", "one-dimensional lattice", "pair distribution function", "Kapitza resistance at interfaces"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Influence of Pre-process Work Hardening of Nickel Encapsulated Hexagonal Boron Nitride Powders on Cold Spray Coatings ", "id": "22733", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10203", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Unlike conventional coating methods typically performed at high temperatures, cold spray is a low temperature process to apply coatings on different surfaces. This method introduces a unique opportunity to deposit materials that are sensitive to high temperatures, such as self-lubricating coatings. Current research studies on cold spray coatings focus primarily on the deposition of pure metal or metallic alloy particles. In this study, the performance of composite self-lubricating particles of Hexagonal-Boron-Nitride encapsulated with nickel (hBN-Ni), and deposited onto aluminum 6061 substrates was examined. Such coated substrates showed great improvement in wear resistance and reduction of surface friction. Moreover, unexpectedly high bond strength was achieved, which was close to that of standard high strength epoxies. The exact reason for this high bond strength was not understood at the beginning. Based on the present findings, and comparing to cold sprayed layers of composite nickel-nickel (nickel particles encapsulated with nickel; Ni-Ni), a hypothesis for the bonding mechanism of hBN-Ni particles to aluminum was developed. This hypothesis relates the high bond strength between the coating and substrate to the initial ductility and work hardening of the particles through plastic deformation during cold spray. To prove the hypothesis, a set of parametric studies was performed in which the initial hardness of hBN-Ni particles before coating was changed by ball milling, through work hardening of the nickel encapsulation, as well as reducing the amount of air pockets that were introduced in the particle agglomerates during nickel encapsulation. For this, hBN-Ni powder was low- and high-energy ball milled at different durations. The resulting materials were cold sprayed onto aluminum 6061 substrates using nitrogen and helium as carrier gas. The test results showed that, by increasing the initial hardness of the milled particles, the coating thickness was reduced. Image analysis of coating layer cross sections indicates that unaltered particles were flattened more than the milled ones. That is, the aspect ratio of particles in sprayed layers was reduced when the milling time was increased. Furthermore, larger amounts of pores and segregations resulted between the particles in the coating layers. When bond strength tests were performed for the samples coated with unaltered particles, failure mostly occurred at the interface between the coating and aluminum 6061 (adhesion failure). However, for coated samples with milled particles, bonds failed within the coating layers (cohesion failure). Examining the hardness of the coating layers, perpendicular to the sample\u2019s cross sections, showed that unaltered particles were generally more hardened than milled particles, as a result of plastic deformation during cold spray. These results indicated that increasing the initial hardness with ball milling reduced the deformability of the particles, which in turn, resulted in poor interlocking between the particles in the coating layers.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9890], "author_name_tesi": "Neshastehriz, Maryam ", "last_name_ssi": "Neshastehriz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Maryam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ivica Smid", "Albert Eliot Segall", "Albert Eliot Segall", "Reginald Felix Hamilton", "Todd Palmer", "Timothy John Eden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ivica Smid, Dissertation Advisor", "Albert Eliot Segall, Dissertation Advisor", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Chair", "Reginald Felix Hamilton, Committee Member", "Todd Palmer, Committee Member", "Timothy John Eden, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cold Spray", "Self-lubricating Coating", "Composite Coating Material", "Ball milling", "Hardness", "Work hardening", "Bond Strength"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Dynamic and Differential Games in Electric Power Markets\n", "id": "21352", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10006", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the last two decades, the electricity industry has shifted from regulation of monopolistic and centralized utilities towards deregulation and promoted competition. With increased competition in electric power markets, system operators are recognizing their pivotal role in ensuring the efficient operation of the electric grid and the maximization of social welfare.\n\nIn this research, we introduce a model of dynamic spatial network equilibrium among consumers, system operators and electricity generators as the solution of a dynamic Stackelberg game. In that game, generators form an oligopoly and act as Cournot-Nash competitors who non-cooperatively maximize their own profits. The market monitor attempts to increase social welfare by intelligently employing equilibrium congestion pricing anticipating the actions of generators. The market monitor influences the generators by charging network access fees that influence power flows towards a perfectly competitive scenario. Our approach anticipates un- competitive behavior and minimizes the impacts upon society. The resulting game is modeled as a Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC). We present an illustrative example as well as a stylized 15-node network of the Western European electric grid.\u2028\n\nWe also introduce two unique differential oligopolistic games with excess demand and sticky price dynamics for feedback Nash equilibria applied to electric power markets. The resulting differential Nash games can be reformulated into a standard linear quadratic differential game framework. The linear quadratic differential games can then be solved using optimal feedback control by subse- quently solving a system of coupled algebraic feedback Nash Riccati equations. We introduce a computable algorithm to solve the feedback Nash equilibria of the differential games. The solution of a 28 market, 96 player differential game is presented using the proposed numerical algorithm.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9717], "author_name_tesi": "Neto, Pedro Amaral", "last_name_ssi": "Neto", "middle_name_ssi": "Amaral", "first_name_ssi": "Pedro", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Terry Lee Friesz", "Terry Lee Friesz", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Tao Yao", "Seth Adam Blumsack"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Terry Lee Friesz, Dissertation Advisor", "Terry Lee Friesz, Committee Chair", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "Seth Adam Blumsack, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Game Theory", "Electric Power Markets", "Dynamic Games", "Differential Games", "Optimal Feedback Control", "Complementarity"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Alkali-Silica Reaction in Alkali-Activated Fly Ash Concrete", "id": "28855", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12296", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The global concrete production has grown considerably over the last decades in line with the population growth, industrialization of developing countries, and the need for more infrastructures. In addition to replacing the natural environment by roads and buildings, carbon dioxide emission and depletion of natural resources for manufacturing portland cement, for example, are of major concern. The best approach to minimize the environmental impacts caused by the concrete industry is to build structures that are durable. Another valuable strategy is to manufacture concrete by using industrial by products, such as fly ash, which may fully replace portland cement. The combination of the two approaches is ideal and even more promising towards making concrete a more sustainable man-made material.\n\tThis research investigates the risk of alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in alkali-activated fly ash concrete. ASR is a major deterioration mechanism, which shortens the service life of concrete structures. It involves a reaction between metastable (e.g. poorly crystalized) forms of silica in aggregates and the highly alkaline pore solution of concrete. The product of this reaction is formation of an expansive ASR gel, which cracks and damages the concrete structure. Alkali-activated fly ash (AAFA) belongs to a new generation of green concrete binders that fully replace the ordinary portland cement.  AAFA binders require a highly alkaline solution to promote hydration of fly ash and strength development, which raises the concern for ASR. \n\tIn this research, the concrete prism test (ASTM C1293) was used to evaluate the ASR risk of two structural grade AAFA concretes. Despite their initially high pH and presence of highly reactive aggregate, ASTM C1293 results showed absence of deleterious expansion in these two AAFA concrete mixtures (FA1 and FA2). On the other hand, the control (i.e. OPC-based) mixture, proportioned with the same amount of reactive aggregate, exceeded the expansion threshold early during the test. SEM micrographs were used to assess the extent of aggregate deterioration and ASR gel formation in the tree mixes. The SEM micrographs reveal that aggregates in FA1 concrete were more preserved than in FA2, where very little ASR gel was detected. Moreover, EDS quantitative analysis detected increased amount of alkalis in residual aggregates with concentrations similar to that found in ASR gel formed in OPC concrete. To understand the mechanism leading to absence of ASR expansion, even though there is aggregate deterioration, microstructural investigation (MIP) and pore solution analysis were performed in AAFA pastes to test four proposed hypotheses. The results suggest that pH drop and abundance of dissolved aluminum decreases the alkaline attack to the aggregates in FA1, while the insufficient calcium prevents polymerization of dissolved silica from aggregates in FA2. In comparison to OPC paste, AAFA pastes had similar or larger porosity and average pore size, despite their significantly lower ASR activity. This rules out a hypothesis that ASR is mitigated in AAFA concrete because of its low permeability. In summary, the mechanisms responsible for absence of ASR in AAFA concretes were (1) pH drop, (2) high concentration of dissolved aluminum, and (3) low concentrations of calcium in the pore solution.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11676], "author_name_tesi": "Neves, Juliana Moraes", "last_name_ssi": "Neves", "middle_name_ssi": "Moraes", "first_name_ssi": "Juliana", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farshad Rajabipour"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farshad Rajabipour, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Alkali-silica reaction", "alkali-activated", "fly ash", "pore solution"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Development of Guidelines for Erection Procedures for Horizontally Curved Steel I-Girder Bridges Through Analysis of a Parametric Group of Bridges\n", "id": "9253", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1473", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A three dimensional finite element modeling technique was compared to field test results obtained from a horizontally curved steel I-girder bridge during construction.

Spurning what had until then been called Negro Literature, writers of the Black Arts movement asserted the primacy of oral traditions and derided written forms as derivative and inauthentic for their reliance upon Eurocentric models. But rather than abandon literary pursuits, they instead dramatically re-imagined the scope of literature so as to accommodate the aesthetic values and ritual forms of everyday black speech and to aspire in writing to the expressive heights of black music. Ma Rainey, Billie Holiday, Thelonious Monk, and John Coltrane set for them a precedent of uncompromising artists whose seemingly effortless blend of vanguard style and popular appeal was highly influential upon Black Arts writers\u2019 pursuit of a politics and aesthetics at once capable of envisioning radical change and galvanizing broad-based support. By the end of the 1960s, poets were dedicating work to, writing praise-songs for, and composing in the spirit of jazz musicians on an unprecedented scale. \n     Although theorists of the movement advocated a new literary ethos based on avant-garde jazz performance, the work that most closely adheres to this vision is often overlooked by critics. Either because recordings frustrate the methodologies of literary studies or because the cultural nationalism that motivated these experiments has been seen to abandon art for sloganeering, collaborations between writers and musicians are underrepresented in the historical record. Amiri Baraka\u2019s early work with the New York Art Quartet, Sonny Murray, and Sun Ra have received some attention, but his transition from sideman to session leader on albums like Black & Beautiful / Soul & Madness (1968) and It\u2019s Nation Time (1972) falls outside extant considerations of jazz-text. Similarly, Gil Scott-Heron may have been the ideal revolutionary artist according to poet and critic Larry Neal\u2019s criteria, but his work has received precious little attention; mine is among the first extensive considerations of his contributions to the formal experimentation and populist appeal of the Black Arts movement. These works, I argue, leverage orality\u2019s social efficacy but do so without compromising their claims to textual authority.\n     In effect, the interplay between jazz and poetry demonstrates that Black Arts innovations were just then cresting in the mid-1970s, even if the movement\u2019s nationalist momentum had largely collapsed. It wasn\u2019t until 1974 that Jayne Cortez, the poet who has perhaps done the most with jazz arrangements of her work, released her first album, Celebrations and Solitudes; by 1977, Ntozake Shange\u2019s choreopoem, for colored girls\u2026 had hit the Broadway stage. Not only did Baraka, Scott-Heron, Cortez, and Shange continue prolific careers throughout the 1980s and 90s, but their pioneering work with hybrid forms also enlisted new writers in the struggle to reconcile oral and literary traditions. In particular, Nathaniel Mackey\u2019s genre-defiant serial writing demonstrates that the fulfillment of jazz\u2019s experimental imperative is yet to come.\n     The supposed decline in the mid-70s of the Black Arts movement and its musical analogue, free jazz, coincides with the emergence of hip-hop, on one hand, and a critical shift toward the African American novel on the other. Black Arts writers were an undeniable influence upon subsequent artists, nonetheless these poets did not cede their vanguard position so easily. I argue, rather, that Black Arts writers and avant-garde improvisers\u2019 shared skepticism toward genre-labels like poetry or jazz remains a relevant critique of the commercial appropriation of the black experimental tradition. My project contributes an alternative narrative that resituates black poetry\u2019s kinship with jazz as an on-going site of contemporary innovation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7722], "author_name_tesi": "New, Michael John", "last_name_ssi": "New", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aldon Lynn Nielsen", "Linda Furgerson Selzer", "Iyunolu Folayan Osagie", "Jonathan Paul Eburne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aldon Lynn Nielsen, Dissertation Advisor", "Linda Furgerson Selzer, Committee Member", "Iyunolu Folayan Osagie, Committee Member", "Jonathan Paul Eburne, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["American literature", "African American literature", "American poetry", "contemporary poetry", "jazz poetry", "hip hop", "multimedia poetry"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "World Bank Rhetoric: Consuming the Suffering of Others\n", "id": "7439", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4185", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I examine the affective responses of contemporary students to rhetoric circulating around several geographically disparate humanitarian crises.  I bring together the related strands of globalization/internationalization issues, economics and humanitarian concerns, and composition studies in my case for a World Bank Rhetoric.

What impact on the affective shaping of student identities do these narratives have?  And how can rhetoric and composition teachers better pedagogically address affect and rhetoric together?  \nWorld Bank Rhetoric (WBR) is the broad answer I give for how to approach these questions.  WBR brings together three terms that juxtapose issues of globalization, economics, language-use, and identity.  I examined the Web sites and mailed requests of Doctors Without Borders, Oxfam, Compassion International, DATA, and other organizations.  My study suggests that for humanitarian aid rhetoric, instead of using compassion to increase how closely a person identifies with the suffering of others, alternate goals can create appropriate responses to suffering.  Aid organizations create specific brand images and experiences for donors/customers.  These brands can shape the relationships between donors and recipients.  For my students, distant suffering is experienced as something to consume.  The act of consumption shapes them, and the choice to read about suffering can feel like an ethical decision.  The main object of consumption is not the suffering of others, but is a particular experience.  The feelings, knowledge, and changes that go along with reading or hearing a narrative about a refugee crisis thousands of miles away are the things taken in.  In this scenario, the form of consumption becomes vital.  In addition, composition teachers should emphasize critical feeling rather than just critical thinking.  Critical feeling provides a different starting point than critical thinking for studying various influences on student values.  Critical feeling also emphasizes the overdetermined, highly contextual, and felt nature of argument.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4159], "author_name_tesi": "Newcomb, Matthew J", "last_name_ssi": "Newcomb", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John L Selzer", "Jeffrey Nealon", "Rosa A Eberly", "Stephen Howard Browne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John L Selzer, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Nealon, Committee Member", "Rosa A Eberly, Committee Member", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["composition", "msf", "oxfam", "suffering", "humanitarian aid", "critical feeling", "rhetoric", "world bank", "consumption", "rwanda", "korea", "AIDS", "affect", "compassion"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Effective and low-cost treatment of acid mine drainage using chitin as a fractional amendment to compost\n", "id": "9523", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "973", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work presents the suitability of a mixture of two abundant, sustainable waste products of industry to support the remediation of acid mine drainage (AMD), an environmental pollutant that plagues mining areas all over the world.  Low-maintenance, passive treatment systems hold the most promise for remediating AMD at a low cost relative to other treatment options.  The choice of substrate in these systems is very important for successful remediation.  Recently, our laboratory has shown that crab-shell chitin, a waste product of the shellfish industry, is capable of neutralizing acidity, reducing sulfate, and thoroughly removing aluminum, iron, manganese, and zinc from AMD.  Despite its remarkable effectiveness, the relatively high cost of crab-shell chitin ($0.60/lb) compared to the leading substrate, spent mushroom compost substrate (SMS; $0.025/lb), may preclude its use in many systems.  To facilitate the development of an effective but cost-efficient approach for AMD remediation, crab-shell chitin was used as a fractional amendment to SMS in this study.\n\nTwo batch tests and a continuous-flow column test were used to evaluate different chitin-SMS mixtures for their ability to support AMD treatment.  Natural AMD containing aluminum, iron, manganese, and zinc was used in these experiments, and aqueous samples were collected regularly for water quality analysis.  In the batch tests, substrates containing only 5% chitin successfully generated alkalinity and partially removed metals from AMD.  In the column experiment, the treatment capacity (as L AMD treated per kg of substrate used) for four different substrate mixtures was determined.  Treatment capacities were:  36.7 L/kg for 10% limestone + 90% SMS; 40.1 L/kg for 5% chitin + 95% SMS; 162 L/kg for 50% chitin + 50% SMS; and 428 L/kg for 100% chitin.  The associated substrate costs per 1000 L of AMD treated are:   $1.38/1000 L, $2.95/1000 L, $4.25/1000 L, and $3.09/1000 L, respectively.  These results suggest that a small fraction of chitin (5%) does not provide a significant benefit over traditional limestone and compost substrates, but that larger fractions of chitin (50-100%) are significantly more efficient than traditional SMS substrates, especially for the removal of metals. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [965], "author_name_tesi": "Newcombe, Caroline ", "last_name_ssi": "Newcombe", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Caroline", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rachel Alice Brennan", "Rachel Alice Brennan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rachel Alice Brennan, Thesis Advisor", "Rachel Alice Brennan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["spent mushroom compost", "chitin", "acid mine drainage", "remediation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "An Exploratory Study of Competencies of Appreciative Inquiry Practitioners: Discovery", "id": "10887", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4251", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since virtually no research exists on the competencies required to be a qualified appreciative inquiry (AI) practitioner, this study\u2019s purpose was to identify the competencies necessary for successful AI practice (Bushe & Marshak, 2009).

Bridge crossings in this region are experiencing extensive sediment aggradation in the bridge waterways, which becomes a challenge for long-term maintenance.  Current dredging mitigation practices play a role in prolonging the aggradation problems at many of the bridge crossings.  The presented research identifies a more effective approach to maintaining stream channels at bridge crossings by (1) testing mitigation methods with physical models, (2) determining appropriate mathematical sediment transport analyses to aid decision-making during the design process, and (3) applying an adaptive management framework as adaptive management experiments.  The mathematical sediment transport analyses; shear stress analysis, analytical stable channel design, and sediment transport modeling, all yield similar results with respect to ranking channel slope and width modifications and low chord bridge configurations according to their effects on the sediment transport characteristics. Shear stress analysis is recommended as the simplest tool in terms of time, data, and expertise for including a preliminary assessment of sediment transport characteristics in the decision-making process for bridge and channel maintenance design. The physical modeling of mitigation measures is approached as adaptive management experiments, and demonstrates that this approach results in fast and efficient learning about channel response to mitigation methods without posing an unacceptable level of risk that would be associated with field-scale adaptive management experiments. The adaptive management approach is shown to be an effective method for dealing with the uncertainty that exists in stream channel response to mitigation methods and leads to the identification of needed directions for further research on stream channel mitigation measures.  While the general approaches that are applied in this research are focused on the sediment aggradation problems specific to the Northern Tier region, the methods can be applied to other regions as well as other sediment concerns at bridge crossings. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3030], "author_name_tesi": "Newlin, Jessica Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Newlin", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peggy Ann Johnson", "Arthur Carl Miller", "Patrick M Reed", "Rudy L Slingerland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Chair", "Arthur Carl Miller, Committee Member", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Member", "Rudy L Slingerland, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adaptive management", "channel modification", "physical modeling", "instream structures", "sediment aggradation", "bridge waterways"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Ankle bracing and its effects on dynamic balance and functional performance measures in a Reserve Officers' Training Corp", "id": "14123tmn5003", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14123", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Musculoskeletal injuries sustained during physical training and sports-related activities are the greatest threat to military force readiness.

It was concluded in the literature that ankle braces, used in healthy physically active populations, have little statistical impact on balance and functional performance measures.  The second chapter of this dissertation focused on reviewing how ankle braces effect performance measures in military specific populations.  At this point, only one study has specifically evaluated how these devices affect performance measures, and the remaining studies focused only on the reduction of ankle injuries.  Due to the lack of literature available, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of ankle braces on dynamic balance and three functional performance measures in a Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps.  This randomized crossover study indicated significant results in which ankle braces do create negative effects for balance reach distances, max jump height, max jump distance, and obstacle course completion time.  This is the first study to evaluate ankle braces in a military sample while wearing battle dress uniform, combat boots, and a loaded rucksack.

The advent of steel and the demand for longer spans under higher loads spurred the development of many new bridge designs. Out of this innovative time period, a wide range of historic through-truss bridges were developed and constructed. These bridges, now well beyond their design life, are being evaluated for capacity; many being demolished, few being rehabilitated. The evaluation process requires the estimation of the complex dynamic behavior of historic through-truss bridges under traffic loading. Structural engineers often evaluate complex dynamic behavior with the use of a dynamic load factor (DLF), which enables the enveloping of dynamic response values by scaling the maximum static response. For this reason the current study set out to evaluate the magnitude, distribution, and influential variables of DLF for historic through-truss bridges. This was accomplished through a combination of field evaluation of existing specimens, and digital signal processing; to produce both the maximum static and dynamic response values for instrumented bridge members for each traffic event. Scatter plots, correlation coefficients, and histograms were then created to evaluate DLF magnitude, distribution, and correlations with test variables. Correlations and trends were investigated between DLF magnitude and: maximum static strain, vehicle speed, vehicle static weight, and bridge span. The most influential variable on the magnitude of DLF was determined to be member peak static strain.  The present study concludes that historic through-truss bridges exhibit DLFs with magnitudes higher than contemporary slab on girder bridge types.

This study was conducted in two phases; the first phase consisted of a pilot study utilizing focus group and anonymous pen and paper survey.  This pilot study was conducted to explore the socio-cultural and contextual factors associated with HIV risk behavior among a sample of 10 unmarried, college-educated African-American women between the ages of 25-34 through focus group discussion.  The second purpose of the pilot study was to test the use of a survey designed for use with low-income young African-American women on a college-educated, age 25-34 population.  Through analysis of focus group responses four themes emerged.  Using the PEN-3 Cultural Model the positive, existential (unique), and negative influences of the following themes were reported: Limited pool of available male partners, Pressure to get married, Feelings of competition among women for male partners, and Men\u2019s negotiating power in relationships.  \nThe second phase consisted of a study utilizing a national internet-based survey sample for quantitative analyses to generate findings that resulted in a new scale that can be used to measure perceptions of limited partner availability (Perceived Partner Availability Scale) as experienced by unmarried, college-educated African-American women.   Pearson correlations were used to investigate associations between perceptions of limited partner availability and condom use and sexual risk behavior.  A Hierarchical Logistic Regression model was used to identify variables that may predict non-condom use in college-educated African-American women ages 25-34.

Such an undertaking is difficult, as park systems are dynamic and elaborate. To better understand park systems, spatial and temporal dynamics of visitor use and flow is paramount. The purpose of this dissertation was to understand the spatial and temporal dynamics of visitor experience in Grand Teton National Park.  Data for these studies were collected within the Moose-Wilson Corridor of Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming in the summers of 2014 and 2015. Concepts and methods related to spatial-temporal dynamics of visitor experience in parks and protected areas are introduced in the first chapter. The results are presented in chapters 2 through 4, which were written as stand-alone manuscripts, and then summarized in chapter 5.\n\nChapter 2 investigated the relationship of visitor motivations and their travel behaviors within a trail system in Grand Teton National Park. Results indicated that there are six different motivation groups hiking within the trail system. Significant differences were found among different visitor characteristic variables of the six motivation groups. There were also differences in where the groups traveled within the trail system.\n\nChapter 3 analyzed the spatial-temporal components of visitors stopping behavior along the Moose-Wilson Road. Significant spatial-temporal patterns were identified. Additionally, local and non-local residents were different in their stopping behaviors along the road. Local residents tended to stop in park-maintained parking lots, whereas non-local residents tended to stop along the road, as well as in park-maintained parking lots.\n\nChapter 4 examined visitor preferences in regards to traffic flow and wait time at various locations within the Moose-Wilson Corridor. Results showed that the most important variable to visitors was parking availability, followed by traffic volume, wait time at the entrance, and average speed limit. Results also indicated that residency (local or non-local resident), mode of transportation (in a vehicle or hiking), and age significantly influenced visitor preference.\n\nOverall, findings indicate visitor motivations, spatial-temporal dynamics, visitor characteristics, and visitor preference are vital to informing management strategies that provide for optimal visitor experiences.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11805], "author_name_tesi": "Newton, Jennifer Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Newton", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter B Newman", "Brendan Derrick Taff", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Douglas Alan Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter B Newman, Dissertation Advisor", "Brendan Derrick Taff, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Justin Mowen, Committee Member", "Douglas Alan Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["National Parks", "GPS", "visitor use", "transportation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "TRACE/PARCS ASSESSMENT BASED ON PEACH BOTTOM TURBINE TRIP AND LOW FLOW STABILITY TESTS\n", "id": "9150", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "788", "abstract_tesi": "The simulation of the nuclear reactor core behavior and plant dynamics as well as their mutual interactions has a significant impact on the design and operation, safety and economics of nuclear power plants.\nThe U.

Multidimensional time dependent power distributions are required for accurate simulation and the PARCS (Purdue Advanced Reactor Core Simulator) multi-dimensional reactor kinetics code has been coupled to TRACE to provide accurate simulation capabilities of some reactor transient or accident scenarios. TRACE/PARCS has been previously validated for Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) transient analysis using the OECD/NEA Main Steam Line Break (MSLB) Benchmark. \nDuring the last decade the OECD/NEA has sponsored the Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) Turbine Trip (TT) Benchmark, designed to provide a validation basis for the new generation best estimate codes - coupled three-dimensional (3D) kinetics system thermal-hydraulic codes. \nThe objectives of this thesis are focused on the assessment of TRACE/PARCS for BWR transient analysis. In this case the BWR TT benchmark problem and Low Flow Stability Tests are appropriate to assess the accuracy of TRACE/PARCS for BWR analysis. The problems exhibit significant space/time flux variations and are based on the measurement of plant data during the transients. These are the Peach Bottom 2 (PB2) Turbine Trip (TT) experiment and Low Flow Stability tests performed in 1977. The analyses of both the Peach Bottom Turbine Trip 2 experiment and the Low Flow Stability tests using TRACE/PARCS showed that calculation results agree reasonably well with both initial steady-state and transient measured data for each test.

While a variety of correlations for the lift coefficient can be found in the open literature, most of those were derived from experiments conducted at low vapor (gas) phase fractions and are not applicable to the flow conditions existing in the BWRs. Therefore, it is important to extend validity of the current correlations for the lift coefficients to higher void (gas) phase fractions. After investigating the underlying physics and analyzing a large amount of experimental data, an improved model for lift force at different void fraction levels, including large bubbles and slug flow regime, is proposed. The model is implemented in STAR-CD and validated.\nThe validation of the models is performed against five different experiments, characterized by different geometries at different boundary conditions. Comparison with the already existing models in STAR-CD code is performed and it is found that the newly integrated force models for drag and lift forces leads to more accurate void distribution predictions. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12772], "author_name_tesi": "Neykov, Boyan S", "last_name_ssi": "Neykov", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Boyan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maria Avramova", "Kostadin Ivanov", "John Cimbala", "John Mahaffy", "Robert Kunz", "Emilian Popov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maria Avramova, Committee Chair", "Kostadin Ivanov, Committee Chair", "John Cimbala, Committee Member", "John Mahaffy, Committee Member", "Robert Kunz, Committee Member", "Emilian Popov, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CFD", "two phase flow", "heat transfer", "boiling"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "\"Una ret\u00f3rica del disimulo: Discurso period\u00edstico y memoria de los 70 en la narrativa de Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez\" / \"A Rhetoric of (Dis)Simulation: Journalistic Discourse and Memory of the 70s in Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez's Narrative\"", "id": "14496", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "7195", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this dissertation is to show that Argentinean journalist and writer Tom\u00e1s Eloy Mart\u00ednez (1934-2010) seeks to bring to the fore, in a dissimulated way, the discourse of the 1970s guerrilla group Montoneros, therefore recovering utopia in the era of the so called \u201cend of history.\u201d The corpus includes three novels that I consider a trilogy: La novela de Per\u00f3n (The Per\u00f3n Novel, 1985), Santa Evita (1995), and El cantor de tango (The Tango Singer, 2004).\n\nI argue that all of these novels are rewritings of a New Journalism narration by Peronist guerilla group Montoneros about the kidnapping, summary trial, and execution of former dictator Pedro Eugenio Aramburu.

It has also been widely exploited to produce value-added products such as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, food flavorings and fine chemicals. Knowledge gained from genome sequencing and functional annotations, as well as advances in genetic engineering techniques, enable us to re-code the genetic blueprint of a microbial cell to endow them with new functions such as a non-native metabolic pathway that make a specific biochemical. As the cells are often not optimized to synthesize the target product, significant rewiring of their metabolic networks is required to re-apportion carbon flux towards the target product. This should be performed with careful consideration of cellular protein resource allocation as well as energy and redox balance. However, the task is often complicated by the intricate interplay of the cellular gene-protein-reaction network. \n\nIn this dissertation, we aim to address several challenges in designing and engineering metabolic pathways by combining techniques in computational biology, metabolic engineering, and synthetic biology. Each project relies extensively on optimization-based computational design, from genetic constructs to pathways and finally the entire metabolic network, to achieve the associated metabolic engineering objectives. In Chapter 1, we review the state-of-the-art metabolic engineering and synthetic biology tools for pathway and strain design. These tools lay the foundation for the development of the subsequent chapters, which deal in-depth with specific challenges in metabolic pathway design and strain optimization. \n\nOne of the key challenges in metabolic engineering is to ensure a consistent supply of cofactor, which is often shared across over 100 reactions in a cell, to the desirable biosynthesis reactions. In Chapter 2, we describe the design and optimization of a synthetic metabolic pathway in E. coli to improve the availability of an essential redox cofactor NADPH. The synthetic metabolic pathway was derived from the highly active Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway of another prokaryote Zymomonas mobilis. Upon optimizing the expression of the multi-enzyme pathway, we obtained strains with improved NADPH production when compared to the wild-type strain. In addition to NADPH production, the ED pathway also simultaneously generates pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phopshate, which are the precursors for the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated that combination of the synthetic ED pathway and the MEP pathway improved the production of an NADPH-dependent terpenoid by up to 97%.  \n\nMotivated by the intriguing roles that glycolytic pathways play in a cell and the effects of their perturbation, in Chapter 3, we switch focus to uncover the reason why specific glycolytic pathways prevail in nature despite the presence of alternatives. Although the ED pathway and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) glycolytic pathways both convert glucose to pyruvate, they take different routes with different intermediates and yield one or two moles of ATP per mole of glucose. Theoretically, one could construct a thermodynamically feasible (i.e., \u0394rG\u00b0 < 0) glucose utilization pathway to pyruvate with up to five moles of ATP production. This raises the question as to why nature preferably employs either EMP or ED glycolysis in spite of the potential availability of pathways with improved energy yield. By computationally designing and assessing over 10,000 possible routes between glucose and pyruvate, we attempt to decipher the designing principles of the natural glycolytic pathways. The computational pipeline developed in this case study for pathway design and analysis can be applied to other important bioconversion pathways.\n\nWhile the earlier chapters delve on the design and optimization of a pathway for redox and energy cofactors supply, generally the entire metabolic network of a microbial cell has to be rewired to drive sufficient carbon flux towards the production pathway and prevent the formation of competing by-products. Using the optimization-based strain design procedure OptForce (in Chapter 4), we combed the entire genome-scale metabolic network to pinpoint genetic interventions including up-regulation, down-regulation and knockout that could lead to the overproduction of the target biochemicals in yeast and cyanobacteria. We further demonstrated that our computational approach not only identified genetic manipulation strategies that recapitulate experimental results but also suggested novel interventions that improve experimental yields. In Chapter 5, we conclude the dissertation by summarizing current metabolic engineering efforts and discussing the remaining challenges as well as our future perspectives on the development of microbial cell factories. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15489], "author_name_tesi": "Ng, Chiam Yu", "last_name_ssi": "Ng", "middle_name_ssi": "Yu", "first_name_ssi": "Chiam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Costas D.

Despite more than a decade old call for more research on the effectiveness of inter-organizational networks in the nonprofit context, to date limited work has been done.  The objective of this dissertation is to develop a theory that provides a better understanding of organizational and network effectiveness in the humanitarian relief field.  The study deals with two broad research questions. The first research question focuses on the relationship between network structural characteristics and network effectiveness.  The second research question concerns organizational effectiveness and focuses on the relationship between organizational internal characteristics (and especially the availability of information technology), ego-network characteristics, network structural characteristics and effectiveness.  To answer these research questions, I used a multi-method research design that applies social network analytic techniques in combination with statistical analyses (correlation and regression) and content analysis to analyze data collected through multiple sources including a web-based survey, semi-structured interviews, and database search. At the network level of analysis, my findings extend a previous model for assessing network effectiveness in the humanitarian relief field.

However, security requirements of an application impose some limitations\nand typically have a significant impact on the performance of the application.\nIn this thesis, we address security issues in distributed database systems,\npropose solutions to impose security in underlying platforms, and study the\nperformance implications of our proposed solutions. The objective is to design\nefficient solutions for distributed database systems that satisfy security\nrequirements while offering acceptable performance.\n\nWe consider three database paradigms: multilevel databases, replicated\ndatabases, and multidatabases. Each paradigm has its own unique security\nrequirements. In a multilevel database, every component of the database is run\nunder a multilevel security policy. Any accesses to the database must be free\nof potential covert channels. In this work, a multilevel log manager is\ndesigned and implemented to support logging of multiple security levels. The\ndesign uses a round-robin approach to log transaction activities of each\nsecurity level. The design is channel-free and also offers good performance.\n\nMaintaining the consistency of a common security policy in a distributed\nenvironment can be modeled as a replicated database. Strong consistency such as\none-copy serializability is required since any inconsistency including transient\ninconsistency may lead to a security violation. Invalidation-based consistency\nprotocol proposed in this thesis satisfies one-copy serializability and performs\nbetter than update-based protocols.\n\nHeterogeneity and local autonomy are main characteristics of multidatabases.\nSummary Schemas Model (SSM) is an adjunct to a multidatabase. It helps resolve\nname and semantic heterogeneity in the multidatabase by defining access terms\nas hypernyms or hyponyms from data names of underlying local databases. As a\nresult, accessing heterogenous data in multidatabases via access terms defined\nin the SSM is simple and efficient. However, those terms are publicly\naccessible and unprotected. Thus, an SSM authorization model is presented. The\nmodel restricts access to SSM access terms according to global roles defined\nat multidatabase level. Consequently, unauthorized accesses are rejected before\nthey reach local databases. This reduces the network traffic, decreases the\nworkload at database servers, and hence offers higher performance.\n\nIn conclusion, we present three topics to illustrate that, even under security\nrequirements of database systems, the underlying environments are able to\nexhibit good performance. We believe that the ideas presented here will\ncontribute to the design of secure and efficient database environments.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5987], "author_name_tesi": "Ngamsuriyaroj, Sudsanguan ", "last_name_ssi": "Ngamsuriyaroj", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sudsanguan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Joseph Hannan", "John Metzner", "Thomas F Keefe", "Ali R Hurson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Joseph Hannan, Committee Member", "John Metzner, Committee Member", "Thomas F Keefe, Committee Chair", "Ali R Hurson, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multidatabases", "Consistency", "Log Management", "Multilevel Security", "Security Policy", "Performance", "Database Systems", "Security"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Examination and improvement of the SHEM energy group structure for HTR and deep burn HTR design and analysis", "id": "15430", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7664", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to study and improve the SHEM energy group structures (281 and 361) and General Atomics-193 energy group structure utilizing the more systematic, consistent, and sophisticated energy group selection method referred to as contributon and point-wise cross-section driven (CPXSD) method.

Teaching tensions are conceptualized as a three-tier framework. At the first level, tensions may arise in the selection and application of pedagogies associated with critical and new/21st century literacies. At the second level, tensions exist within debates about the extent to which media literacy is conceptualized as a core subject itself in contrast to a process for learning core subjects. The third level of tensions involves diverse stakeholders including individuals who are connected to university teacher education programs, teacher professional organizations (e.g., NCATE, IRA, NBPTS), K-12 teachers, the media industry, media watchdog/activist organizations, and government/policies. Depending upon the specific issues involved, these stakeholders may either compete against each other, pushing media literacy education in opposing directions, or complement each other, exerting a unified influence on media literacy teacher education.  \n\nThe study employs a case study methodology to research the teaching tensions facing a media literacy teacher educator in a Masters\u2019 level literacy education course. The media literacy course that was examined in this study includes a teacher educator and in-service teachers and graduate education students (N=24) matriculating at a university on the East Coast. An exploratory triangulation design utilizes three pre-course data sources: the teacher educator\u2019s published research, a course syllabus, and a survey administered by the researcher to gauge teacher student levels of media literacy knowledge. The design also incorporates the following data collected during the media literacy education course: interviews, class observations, and teacher student artifacts. \n\nFindings of this study show that: (1) the media literacy teacher educator focuses more heavily on critical and socio-cultural practice-based media literacy pedagogy as opposed to new/21st century literacies and skills-based pedagogy, (2) the media literacy teacher educator focuses more on media literacy pedagogy as a process as opposed to content, particularly in the latter part of the course, and (3) the teacher educator draws pedagogical cues from media watchdog/activist organizations as opposed to the media industry, and responds to pressures from teacher professional organizations.

In the United States, there are approximately 250,000 to 300,000 new cases of HBV infections annually, and roughly 1.25 million chronic carriers of HBV.  Globally, it is estimated that 350 million individuals are chronically infected with HBV and that one million people die annually from chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma induced by HBV.  HBV belongs to the family of Hepadnaviridae, which are small enveloped viruses, with a partially double-stranded, relaxed-circular (RC) DNA genome.  The hepadnaviruses are classified as para-retroviruses because they replicate this DNA genome through reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate, the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA).  \nIn the cytoplasm of the hepatocyte, pgRNA is selectively packaged along with the virally encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) into HBV nucleocapsids.  The encapsidation of pgRNA requires the recognition and binding of RT to a stem-loop structure located at the 5\u2019 end of the pgRNA called epsilon (\u00e5).  The formation of the RT-\u00e5 ribonucleoprotein complex triggers viral assembly and leads to the specific incorporation of both the pgRNA and RT into replication-competent nucleocapsids where reverse transcription takes to form the mature RC DNA genome.    \n For a long time, it was thought that the adaptive and innate immune responses were primarily responsible for providing protection against viral pathogens.  However, during mammalian evolution, a variety of mechanisms have arisen to rid the host of viral infectious agents.  It is becoming increasingly clear that dominant inhibitory cellular factors can also have an important role in controlling host susceptibility.  Recent studies have established that the APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases represent a major defense barrier against a wide range of viruses.\n APOBEC3 is a member of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases that also includes APOBEC1, -2, and the activation induced deaminase.  In humans, the APOBEC3 subfamily has been expanded to include seven members, APOBEC3A to H, which lies in tandem on chromosome 22.  Recently, the cellular protein APOBEC3G (A3G) was shown to inhibit the infectivity of Vif-deficient HIV-1.  A3G packaged into the viral particle mediated deamination of dC residues in the nascent minus-strand DNA during reverse transcription of the HIV-1 genome.  As a result of this deamination, G-to-A hypermutation of the plus-strand DNA could occur, resulting in an increased proportion of non-infectious virus.  Alternatively, the uracil-containing DNA may prevent accumulation of reverse transcripts, either by triggering degradation by cellular DNA enzymes or by impairing viral protein synthesis.  The known specificity of A3G on single-stranded DNA suggested that it might inhibit any virus with a single-stranded DNA intermediate, such as the para-retrovirus HBV.  \n We showed that A3G, as well as several of the other APOBEC3 proteins, could inhibit HBV DNA replication by acting mainly at the DNA level, with only a minor effect on viral RNA packaging.  However, inhibition of HBV DNA synthesis was not by editing of the viral genome, but rather, the main mode of inhibition was via a deaminase-independent mechanism.  Although it is still poorly understood, the editing-independent mechanism of A3G seemed to target a very early stage during viral reverse transcription to block HBV DNA synthesis.  Furthermore, by using a native agarose gel electrophoresis assay that can specifically measure the levels of A3G incorporation into HBV nucleocapsids, we found that A3G was specifically packaged into replication-competent HBV nucleocapsids in a fashion that was dependent on both the viral RT and RNA packaging signal, \u00e5.  In contrast, A3G was not incorporated into empty capsids formed in the absence of RT or \u00e5.  We confirmed the interior localization of A3G by demonstrating that the packaged A3G was protected from protease digestion by the nucleocapsids.  Finally, we showed that A3G could bind RT specifically, in a RNA-independent manner, and provide evidence that the N-terminal domain of A3G was required for incorporation into HBV capsids. \n Current strategies for treating hepatitis B have focused on clearance of active HBV infection through suppression of viral replication by the use of RT inhibitors.  However, long-term treatment is required to maintain viral suppression, which often leads to the development of drug-resistant HBV variants that could render the drug ineffective.  The work in this thesis provides further insight into the mechanism of the deaminase-independent inhibition of HBV replication by A3G and the factors responsible for the incorporation of A3G into HBV nucleocapsids.  Detailed understanding of the inhibitory effects of A3G, and potentially other host factors, on HBV replication will help facilitate the development of novel anti-HBV drugs in the future.   \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1395], "author_name_tesi": "Nguyen, David H.", "last_name_ssi": "Nguyen", "middle_name_ssi": "H.", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jianming Hu", "John Warren Wills", "David Joseph Spector", "Harriet C Isom", "Ralph Lauren Keil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jianming Hu, Committee Chair", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Harriet C Isom, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["A3G", "HBV", "APOBEC3", "Reverse transcription", "Intrinsic immunity"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Effects of Discussion Constraints, Discourse Maps, and Interactive Intercultural Elaboration in Online Discussions on Students' Knowledge Construction, Critical Thinking, and Intercultural Sensitivity\n\n", "id": "10303", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2260", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research shows both benefits and challenges of online discussion as a collaborative learning activity. Online discussion is especially challenging for novice college students who have limited metacognitive skills as well as limited knowledge of the subject domain. With limited metacognitive skills, it can be challenging for novice students to engage in high-order cognitive activities and as a result, participate meaningfully in online discussions. In addition, in an online discussion with participants from different cultural backgrounds, the text-based nature of an online discussion medium and the cultural differences between participants may make it even more difficult to establish common ground and shared understanding than in an online discussion with participants from the same culture, especially if the participants do not have any or only have little experience with cross-cultural interaction.<br><br>\nTherefore, the discussion board system in this study was designed with cognition-supported features (which combine a constraint-based discussion feature using a discourse structure with an automatically generated discourse map) and interactive intercultural elaboration features to address these issues. The study assessed the quantitative effects of these features on knowledge construction, critical thinking and intercultural sensitivity. In addition, the study also examined if prior knowledge and experience in the subject domain, prior experience in online discussions, or prior cross-cultural experience affected those results. Patterns of knowledge construction and critical thinking in four different types of online discussion boards were explored qualitatively by examining selected online discussion transcripts from eight weeks.<br><br>\nParticipants were 103 undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory-level psychology course at an Ivy League university in the northeastern United States who engaged in eight weekly online discussions in groups of eight students, each on a course-related topic. Students\u2019 knowledge construction in online discussions was examined using Gunawardena, Lowe, and Anderson (1997)\u2019s Interaction Analysis Model that includes five phases of knowledge construction; students\u2019 critical thinking in online discussions was examined using Newman, Webb, and Cochrane (1995)\u2019s critical thinking coding scheme with ten categories of critical thinking indicators.<br><br>\nThe results revealed that the cognition-supported features significantly helped learners in their knowledge construction and critical thinking in online discussion, although the effect was of greater magnitude for knowledge construction than for critical thinking. However, prior knowledge and experience in psychology and prior experience in online discussion did not influence the effectiveness of the cognition-supported features. Study results also indicated that the interactive intercultural elaboration features did not improve learners\u2019 intercultural sensitivity. Possible reasons for failing to show an effect of interactive intercultural elaboration features on students\u2019 intercultural sensitivity may have been the students\u2019 relatively high level of initial intercultural sensitivity and prior cross-cultural experience or students\u2019 imprecise use of the features.<br><br>\nResults from descriptive analysis of four discussions in Phase 3 of the study to compare argumentation and problem solving discussion frameworks used as discourse structures revealed that in terms of knowledge construction, argumentation-based discussions had more evidence of low-level knowledge construction Phase I (Sharing and Comparing) and Phase II (Discovery of Dissonance), while problem solving-based discussions had more high-level knowledge construction Phase III (Negotiation and Co-construction) and Phase IV (Testing and Modification) evidence. This might have been due to the more structured nature of the argumentation framework. For both discussion frameworks, the group who used the cognition-supported features first tended to have more occurrences of higher phases than the group who only used these features towards the end of the semester.<br><br>\nStudy findings also revealed the possible influence of a discussion topic\u2019s characteristics on students\u2019 knowledge construction and critical thinking when comparing different discussion board types. In terms of knowledge construction, a discussion with a focus on finding and solving problems and with cognition-supported features had most occurrences of high-level phases and had fewest occurrences of low-level Phase I (Sharing and Comparing) during the knowledge construction process, followed by a discussion with a lot of details given initially but without any special features. On the contrary, a discussion with both sets of features but with a focus on sharing personal experience and from the group with less experience with cognition-supported features had the fewest occurrences of high-level phases but most occurrences of low-level Phase I. In addition, descriptive analysis of different discussion board types in terms of critical thinking showed that the discussions from the group more experienced with cognition-supported features had more higher level critical thinking indicators in the following categories: critical assessment, justification, and linking.<br><br>\nThe positive study results enable one to conclude that the constraint-based discussion and discourse map features should be used in online discussion activities in college classrooms and extended use of these cognition-supported features may be beneficial for students. In addition, the level of structure in a discussion framework and the design of discussion topics should be considered in relation to the intended learning outcomes when designing online discussion activities using constraints. Lastly, the study may stimulate future research in facilitating cross-cultural interaction and intercultural learning in online discussion through the interactive intercultural elaboration process.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2241], "author_name_tesi": "Nguyen, Hien Thu", "last_name_ssi": "Nguyen", "middle_name_ssi": "Thu", "first_name_ssi": "Hien", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara L Grabowski", "Barbara L Grabowski", "Simon Richard Hooper", "Hoi Kin Suen", "Richard Francis Devon", "Priya Sharma"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara L Grabowski, Dissertation Advisor", "Barbara L Grabowski, Committee Chair", "Simon Richard Hooper, Committee Member", "Hoi Kin Suen, Committee Member", "Richard Francis Devon, Committee Member", "Priya Sharma, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["critical thinking", "online discussion", "discourse structure", "discourse map", "constraint-based discussion", "interactive intercultural elaboration", "cultural words", "knowledge construction", "intercultural sensitivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Translational regulation of the human microsomal epoxide hydrolase (EPHX1) gene by upstream open reading frame peptides\n\n\n", "id": "12000", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2261", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Xenobiotic metabolism plays a crucial role in the body\u2019s defense against the potentially harmful and undesirable insults from exposure to environmental toxins. The significance of xenobiotic metabolism is manifested through a network of well-coordinated processes such as biotransformation, metabolism and/or detoxification of xenobiotics or foreign compounds. Among the various phase I and phase II enzymes that are involved in these processes, microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH, EPHX1) has gained considerable attention due to its dual role in both the detoxification and the bioactivation process of many epoxide intermediates. Ultimately, the balance between bioactivation and detoxification in xenobiotic metabolism determines the physiological outcome resulting from toxicant exposure. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling these reactive fates are complex and not well understood. The goal of this thesis research was to better elucidate the processes involved in regulating the xenobiotic metabolizing gene, mEH, with the particular focus of defining the regulatory role of upstream open reading frames as potential contributors to the translational control of this system. \n\nMicrosomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH, EPHX1) is an important biotransformation enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of many epoxide metabolites. EPHX1 substrates vary from the endogenous steroid epoxides, such as estroxide and androstene oxide, to the pro-carcinogenic epoxide intermediates such as benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-epoxide derived from the xenobiotic metabolism of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Previous studies from our laboratory suggested the involvement of post-transcriptional regulation in modulating EPHX1 expression, mediated by the presence of complex secondary structure and two upstream open reading frames (uORFs) within the 5\u2019-untranslated region (5\u2019-UTR) of an EPHX1 transcript variant termed E1-b\u2019. Utilizing a lentivirus-based transduction system to over-express the E1-b\u2019 transcript in mammalian cell lines, we found that the presence of E1-b\u2019 inhibits overall EPHX1 expression. E1-b\u2019 transcripts containing mutations of the respective uORFs\u2019 start codons were devoid of this inhibitory activity. The E1-b\u2019 transcript uORFs are predicted to code for short peptide sequences of 26 and 17 amino acids in length, respectively. We hypothesized that these peptides contribute regulatory function in EPHX1 expression. Synthetic 26 and 17 amino acid peptides were titrated into an in vitro transcription/translation system utilizing either rabbit reticulocyte lysate or wheat-germ extract programmed with the EPHX1 E1-b construct. The results obtained demonstrated that these peptides can inhibit the production of EPHX1 protein in both the mammalian and plant-derived systems. Transfection of these peptides into mammalian cell lines further confirmed their EPHX1-specific inhibitory effect.  In addition, kinetic analysis of mRNA stability indicated that the peptides do not modulate EPHX1 mRNA level.  These results suggest a unique role contributed by the generation of uORF peptides from the E1b\u2019- transcript and their function as translational regulators of human EPXH1 expression.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2242], "author_name_tesi": "Nguyen, Hong Loan ", "last_name_ssi": "Nguyen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hong Loan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Curtis John Omiecinski", "Curtis John Omiecinski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Curtis John Omiecinski, Thesis Advisor", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["translational regulation", "upstream open reading frame", "EPHX1", "microsomal epoxide hydrolase", "uORF peptides"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATING THE FUNCTION AND REGULATION OF PROSTATE APOPTOSIS RESPONSE-4 IN CANCER", "id": "13356jqn104", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13356", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cancer is a disease where normal cells proliferate uncontrollably, which can ultimately lead to significant morbidity and death. The aggressiveness and mortality of cancers vary by type: certain cancers respond well to treatment, such as pediatric leukemias, whereas pancreatic cancer and glioblastoma have a high mortality and low five-year survival. In an effort to improve current cancer therapies, I focus on elucidating the function and regulation of prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) in various cancers. Par-4 is a tumor-suppressor that has been shown to induce cancer cell selective apoptosis and to sensitize cancer cells to apoptotic stimuli, such as chemotherapeutics and radiation, and therefore has therapeutic potential. In the first part of this work, I focused on studying the effect of Par-4 on cell migration, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colon cancer cells. I found that ectopic expression of Par-4 inhibited both cell migration and cell invasion, while knocking down Par-4 promoted cell migration in SW480 and SW620 colon cancer cells. In addition, I found that Par-4 overexpression appeared to induce a mesenchymal-epithelial transition in SW620 cells. In the second part of this work, I sought to identify novel regulators of Par-4 and elucidate the mechanism of regulation. I identified Trim21 as a novel binding partner in colon cancer cells, and show that Trim21 overexpression in the presence of cisplatin downregulates Par-4 in colon and pancreatic cancer cell lines, and show that modulating levels of Trim21 and Par-4 affects the sensitivity of cancer cells to cisplatin. Finally, I demonstrate that Trim21 mRNA levels correlate with survival in pancreatic cancer patients, with lower Trim21 levels correlating with increased overall survival and disease-free survival and high Trim21 levels correlating with reduced disease-free survival. In the third part of this work, I sought to determine whether Par-4 could enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics and small molecule drugs. I chose to focus on glioma due to the lack of effective therapeutics.

The arrangement of microtubules is an important factor in neuronal polarity, as microtubules are used for long-range trafficking of vesicles and other cargo, cytoskeletal structure, and synaptic growth.  In vertebrate neurons, axonal microtubules are primarily plus-end-out, while dendritic microtubules have mixed polarity.  In contrast, Drosophila melanogaster has a simpler arrangement of neuronal microtubules.  In Drosophila neurons, microtubules have opposite orientation in axons and dendrites:  axons have microtubules with plus ends distal to the soma, while dendrites have minus ends distal to the cell body.  Due to this simplicity, Drosophila provides a good model for the study of neuronal microtubule polarity.\n\nThe commonly accepted model for how neuronal microtubules are organized is that microtubules are nucleated from the centrosome in the cell body, severed into small pieces, and transported down axons and dendrites via microtubule sliding.  Using Drosophila, this model was investigated in dendritic arborization neurons.  First, the role of the centrosome, an organelle that is the primary microtubule nucleator and organizer in dividing cells, was tested, since it is a key component of the microtubule sliding mechanism.  Immunostaining experiments showed that the centrosome was inactive in neurons compared to mitotic cells.  Additionally, the increase in microtubule nucleation after axon severing did not originate from the centriole, a core centrosomal component, and neither disruption nor ablation of the centriole yielded any changes in microtubule dynamics in the neuron.  Second, the existence of an axon initial segment in Drosophila was directly assayed.  Previous studies have found that the axon initial segment serves as a cue for axon recognition and sorting by molecular motors, and thus the axon initial segment could play a role in microtubule sliding.  However, although FRAP experiments confirm the presence of an ankyrin-based axon initial segment in Drosophila, disruption of this plasma membrane diffusion barrier did not change microtubule orientation in axons.\n\nSince the centrosome is not a major microtubule-organizing center in neurons, it stands to reason that local microtubule nucleation outside of the soma likely drives microtubule organization in neurons.  A likely candidate involved in this mechanism is gamma-tubulin, as it is the core nucleation protein that is essential for microtubule nucleation.  To examine the function of gamma-tubulin, microtubule dynamics were analyzed in gamma-tubulin mutants using the plus end-tracking protein EB1.  gamma-tubulin mutant animals displayed disrupted microtubule dynamics as well as altered microtubule orientation in axons and dendrites.  These results fit with the model of local microtubule nucleation, as mixed microtubule polarity would not be expected if microtubules were nucleated in the cell body.  Localization experiments further support the local microtubule nucleation model, as immunostaining and fluorescence localization experiments showed specific localization of gamma-tubulin in axons and dendrites, such as at dendrite branch points.  This local nucleation does not involve the Golgi, because Golgi disruption and localization experiments did not correspond to gamma-tubulin results.\n\tThe work presented here demonstrates that local microtubule nucleation is the predominant mechanism contributing to neuronal microtubule polarity in Drosophila.  This type of nucleation requires tight regulation of gamma-tubulin and is independent from the centrosome and the Golgi.  Future work elucidating the factors that localize and regulate gamma-tubulin will be crucial in determining how correct microtubule polarity is established and maintained in neurons.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9204], "author_name_tesi": "Nguyen, Michelle Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Nguyen", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melissa Rolls", "Melissa Rolls", "Wendy Hanna Rose", "Lorraine C Santy", "Graham Hugh Thomas", "Timothy J Jegla"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Melissa Rolls, Dissertation Advisor", "Melissa Rolls, Committee Chair", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member", "Lorraine C Santy, Committee Member", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Member", "Timothy J Jegla, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microtubules", "neuronal polarity", "Golgi", "axon initial segment", "Drosophila", "centrosome", "ankyrin"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "SOLID SOLUTIONS AND FUNCTIONALIZATION OF TRANSITION METAL DICHALCOGENIDES", "id": "14200mtn145", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14200", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation focuses on the chemistry of layered metal dichalcogenide solid solutions and explores the role that composition plays at the atomic level as well as at the bulk scale.

Water quality credit markets are more complex than the cap-and-trade markets that have proven highly successful in controlling air emissions due to the economic and technical challenges posed by nonpoint source emissions. The design of water quality credit markets necessitates significant departures from the design of classical textbook emissions markets. \n\nThe existing literature has focused on the optimal design of markets under the assumption of perfectly competitive market equilibrium. While important insights have been derived in the prior water quality market literature, the assumptions that the markets will be perfectly competitive and without transactions costs strongly depart from the realities of these systems. Water quality markets in the U.S. tend to be thin, unorganized, and populated by agents who have substantial uncertainty about market rules, market prices, and potential gains from trades. Furthermore, the unobservable and stochastic nature of nonpoint emissions implies high transactions costs for trading as well as for monitoring and enforcement. These characteristics imply that a perfectly competitive equilibrium is not a plausible condition to assume when evaluating water quality markets. In addition, experience with these markets to date is very limited, making robust ex post assessment impossible. \n\nThe broad objective of this research is to develop a better understanding of the equilibrium state of water quality markets. In particular, it is of interest to investigate the challenges posed when transitioning to the equilibrium state given uncertainties in design parameters and agents\u2019 interactions. A stochastic agent-based model is developed to examine bilateral negotiations between point and nonpoint source polluters in a partially capped water quality credit trading market. Agents in the market make participation, pricing and trading decisions under multiple sources of uncertainty. The introduction of these issues into water quality trading evaluation yields highly nonlinear, non-convex and stochastic topologies in the individual agents\u2019 decision spaces, their objective functions and the overall market level objective function. Finding a robust solution for this problem is a difficult task. By adapting the state-of-the-art Differential Evolution algorithm, this research seeks to identify \u201crobust\u201d market equilibria and their transient dynamics, given alternative specifications of trade ratios and environmental targets, the influence of transaction costs, as well as the inherent uncertainties and complexities in agents\u2019 interactions.\n\nThe results suggest that it is difficult to attain a \u201crobust\u201d market equilibrium when there are multiple sources of uncertainties, complex agent interactions and discrete costs. The high rate of failure by the market in converging to its \u201cbest known\u201d market equilibrium suggests that there is a distribution of market equilibria for given sets of trading rules and market structure, which implies that in designing markets for water quality trading, the planner cannot assume that the market will achieve the least cost solution to its problem. Moreover, market outcomes are state contingent because the initial tendencies of agents\u2019 behaviors in markets are shown to influence their ultimate performance. Transaction costs are found to reduce market efficiency, participation rates, the number of trades, and subsequently the proportion of abatement requirements achieved by trading. Increases in trade ratios put a negative impact on the above market efficiency measures. Tightening the environmental target, however, has mixed effects on market efficiency in the presence of transaction costs and different assumptions on cooperative behaviors among agents. In the absence of transaction costs, offers being initiated at random result in trades that are clustering near the receptor. When including transaction costs, a local clustering of trades resulting from initial random offers is observed. This supports the fact that spatial dependence of nonpoint emissions cannot be ignored when designing the market for water quality. \n\nOverall, the findings of this work should be viewed as a case study of water quality trading in bilateral negotiations. The poor performance of the market in this framework motivates future studies of more organized market structures, such as a clearinghouse, to investigate their efficiency. Furthermore, the presence of positive gains from trading over the Autarky case suggests that bilateral negotiation markets still perform relatively better than command-and-control policies.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4671], "author_name_tesi": "Nguyen, Nga Phuong ", "last_name_ssi": "Nguyen", "middle_name_ssi": "Phuong ", "first_name_ssi": "Nga", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle", "James Samuel Shortle", "Patrick M Reed", "Jill Leslie Findeis", "Edward C Jaenicke", "Thorsten Wagener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle, Dissertation Advisor", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Chair", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Chair", "Jill Leslie Findeis, Committee Member", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Member", "Thorsten Wagener, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Agent-based modeling", "Differential Evolution Algorithm", "Evolutionary Algorithms", "Water Quality Markets", "Bilateral Negotiations", "Point-Nonpoint trading", "Emissions Trading"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "FABRICATION AND OPTIMIZATION OF LIGHT CARRIER COLLECTION MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE USING LEAD SULFIDE QUANTUM DOTS AS LIGHT ABSORBER", "id": "23570", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10716", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Light and carrier collection management (LCCM) architecture for thin film photovoltaic and detector is among the latest attempts to enhance light absorption while maintaining the collection of charge carriers.

Interactions between CA molecules result in the formation of the mature capsid shell.  In this mature capsid the amino terminal end of the NTD forms a &#946;-hairpin that lines the wall of the central cavity of the six-membered rings.  Formation of the &#946;-hairpin is believed to control the ability of the capsid to assemble as mutations that prevent the anchoring of the hairpin to the NTD prevent core formation and inhibit infectivity.  We have determined several &#946;-hairpin mutations that compromise infectivity and this infectivity is restored through second-site suppressors found within the flexible loop region.  The flexible loop region, helices 4 through 6 and the connecting loops, has not been shown to be involved in any direct CA-CA contacts. This genetic study suggests the possibility that residues in the &#946;-hairpin and flexible loop region act in concert to control the ability of the CA protein to assemble during maturation. Alignment of NTD sequences from various alpha- and gammaretroviruses identified several conserved residues located within this loop region, including a number of charged amino acids.

This case study seeks to explore the following questions: 1) How are school success and school failure defined in this context over time? 2) What are the experiences of teachers at this \u201cfailing\u201d charter school? 3) How do teachers at this \u201cfailing\u201d charter school describe their workload and pressures? 4) How can lessons from these teachers\u2019 experiences be used to impact education reform? Through the use of teacher narratives and media narratives, this study documents the story of the NOECS from its founding in 2008 until its end in 2013, and shares the experiences of the teachers who worked there.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15187], "author_name_tesi": "Nguyen, Trung L", "last_name_ssi": "Nguyen", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Trung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Mary Collins", "Kathleen Mary Collins", "Patrick Willard Shannon", "Karen Eppley", "DAVID MCBRIDE"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Mary Collins, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathleen Mary Collins, Committee Chair", "Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Member", "Karen Eppley, Committee Member", "DAVID MCBRIDE, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hurricane Katrina", "Charter Schools", "New Orleans", "Privatization", "Neoliberal"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ABILITY-GROUPING AND SECONDARY STUDENT ATTRIBUTIONS OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE IN HONG KONG AND SHANGHAI", "id": "28806", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12416", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There are international differences in the degree to which students attribute their failures to internal factors or external factors.

The early stage of the disease is characterized by a polyclonal expansion of infected erythroid precursor cells, and the later stage is marked by the emergence of fully transformed cells in the spleen, blood, bone marrow and liver, leading to the development of erythroleukemia. Several loci have been identified in the early stages of erythroleukemia that are required for the expansion of infected progenitor cells, in particular W, Sl, f and Fv2. Fv2 has been shown to encode a naturally occurring, N-terminally truncated form of the Stk receptor tyrosine kinase (Sf-Stk). Previous findings have demonstrated that Sf-Stk provides signals necessary for the polycolonal expansion of infected cells. Here we propose to study the mechanism by which Sf-Stk relays signals for the expansion of Friend virus infected progenitor cells. \n  Previously, we demonstrated that the ability of Sf-Stk to participate in the transformation of Friend virus-infected cells requires the kinase activity and Grb2 binding site of Sf-Stk. In the first chapter, we show that Grb2 heterozygous mice exhibit decreased susceptibility to Friend erythroleukemia virus in vivo and that expansion of erythroid progenitors in response to infection requires the c-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. Furthermore, Gab2 is expressed in spleens of Friend virus infected mice, co-immunoprecipiates with Sf-Stk and is tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of Sf-Stk, which suggests that Gab2 is a downstream target of Sf-Stk. Using an in vitro colony assay, we find that a fusion protein, in which the docking site tyrosines in Sf-Stk are replaced by the coding sequence of Gab2, supports the growth of progenitors from mice lacking Sf-Stk, whereas a Sf-Stk/Gab1 fusion protein does not. Finally, mice with a targeted deletion in Gab2 are less susceptible to Friend erythroleukemia and the expansion of erythroid progenitor cells in response to infection can be rescued by expression of Gab2, but not Gab1. \n  To further investigate the signaling events downstream of the Sf-Stk/Grb2/Gab2 complex in the development of erythroleukemia in response to Friend virus infection, in the second chapter, we demonstrate that the recruitment and activation of Stat3 by Sf-stk is mediated by Gab2. We find that the Sf-Stk/Gab2 fusion protein, but not the Sf-Stk/Gab1 fusion protein, which fails to support hematopoietic transformation in this system, results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of, and interaction with, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). Our in vivo studies demostrate that Stat3 is tyrosine phosphorylated and interacts with Gab2 in splenocytes following injection of sensitive Balb/CJ mice with Friend Virus. Exogenous expression of dominant negative Stat3 in sensitive erythroblasts significantly inhibits BFU-E and CFU-E colony formation induced by Friend Virus. Furthermore, bone marrow cells from floxed-Stat3 mice fail to form Epo-independent colonies in response to Friend Virus infection following the retroviral introduction of Cre-recombinase into primary erythroblasts. Moreover, the Cre-flox/stat3 mice have decreased susceptibility to Friend erythroleukemia virus in vivo and exogenous expression of stat3 can rescue this response. In order to map the domains of Gab2 which are critical for the activation of Stat3 and the Epo-independent growth of Friend Virus infected cells, we utilized a series of Gab1/Gab2 chimeric molecules. Our data suggest that the region between Q120 and P358 of Gab2 is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. By scanning this region, we identified a Y194LHQ site, a potential Stat3 binding motif, in Gab2, but not in Gab1. The ability of Sf-Stk /Gab2 to recruit and activate Stat3, and support Epo-independent colony formation of primary erythroblasts in response to Friend Virus infection in vitro was abolished when Y194 was mutated to phenylalanine. In addition, mutation of this tyrosine in the context of wide type Gab2 abrogated its ability to rescue the defective response of Gab2-/- bone marrow to Friend Virus. \n  In the third chapter, we investigate the function of Src kinases in the course of Friend virus infection. Previous research demonstrated that v-Src causes erythroleukemia in mice.  Furthermore, growth factors can induce Stat3 in a Src family kinase (SFK)-dependent manner. Here we show that dominant negative c-Src significantly inhibits BFU-E and CFU-E colony formation induced by Friend Virus. In addition, the non-specific SFK inhibitor PP1 also abrogated Epo-independent colony formation. Moreover we found that the inhibition of Src family kinases by PP1 suppresses Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of Sf-Stk. Taken together, these data suggest that c-Src is downstream of Sf-Stk in Friend virus infected cells and that the ability of c-Src to promote Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to Friend virus is critical in the early stages of erythroblast transformation.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5991], "author_name_tesi": "Ni, Shuang ", "last_name_ssi": "Ni", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shuang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Robert Paulson", "Avery August", "Biao He", "Richard John Frisque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Chair", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Biao He, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Friend Virus", "Stat3", "Colony Assay"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE GAG TRINUCLEOTIDE-REPEAT POLYMORPHISM IN THE CATALYTIC SUBUNIT OF THE GLUTATHIONE BIOSYNTHETIC ENZYME, g-GLUTAMYLCYSTEINE LIGASE\n", "id": "11100", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5724", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Glutathione (GSH), the most abundant intracellular antioxidant, is proposed to prevent cancer through multiple biochemical pathways including carcinogen detoxification, scavenging and neutralizing free radicals, modulating gene expression and cell signaling. Low glutathione levels have been associated with higher risk for diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease, arthritis and diabetes. <FONT FACE=\"SYMBOL\">g</FONT>-glutamylcysteine ligase (GCL), the rate limiting enzyme for glutathione biosynthesis is made up of a catalytic subunit (GCLC) and a modifier subunit (GCLM). A guanine-adenine-guanine (GAG) trinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the 5\u2019 UTR of GCLC, the gene that codes for catalytic subunit, has been identified with five different alleles consisting of 4, 7, 8, 9 or 10 GAG repeats. The GAG polymorphism is associated with glutathione levels in certain cell lines and also with risk for diseases such as chronic beryllium diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and schizophrenia. In the present work, in vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to investigate if and how genetic variation (the GAG repeat polymorphism) in the GCL, the rate limiting enzyme for glutathione biosynthesis, affects glutathione levels in healthy adults and whether its effect on glutathione levels alters risk for cancer.\nIn the first study presented here, it was hypothesized that the GAG repeat polymorphism in GCLC is associated with altered GCL activity and blood GSH levels in vivo. Healthy adult individuals were genotyped for the GAG polymorphism in the GCLC gene and related phenotypes, blood GCLC protein levels, blood GCL activity and GSH levels were also determined. Among the three most prevalent genotypes i.e., GAG-7/7, GAG-7/9 and GAG-9/9, individuals with genotype GAG-9/9 had lower GSH levels compared to those with genotype GAG-7/9, lower GCL activity compared to those with genotype GAG-7/7 and lower GCLC protein levels compared to those with either genotypes GAG-7/7 and GAG-7/9. These findings suggest that the GAG repeat polymorphism contributes to lower blood GSH levels in GAG-9/9 individuals than GAG-7/7 individuals apparently due to a decrease in GCLC protein levels and hence GCL activity.\nThe specific impact of GAG repeat number on GCLC expression was investigated by in vitro transcription and in vitro translation assays. Through luciferase reporter assays of cell cultures and transcription and translation assays of cell free lysates, it was found that the GAG polymorphism in the GCLC 5\u2019-UTR affects the translation of the luciferase mRNA but not its transcription. With an increasing number of GAG repeats in the constructs, luciferase activity and protein levels reached maximal levels in GAG-8 or GAG-9 and then decreased with GAG-10. The finding that luciferase expression was greater in GAG-9 than in GAG-7 was in contrast to in vivo findings where higher blood GCLC protein levels and blood GCL activity were observed for genotype 7/7 compared to genotype 9/9. These observations are likely a result of differential regulation of glutathione levels in red blood cells, in which all of the phenotypes were measured in our in vivo study. \nBased on the functional consequences of the GAG repeat polymorphism in GCLC, we hypothesized that the GAG polymorphism is associated with risk for certain cancers. To test this hypothesis, individuals with cancers whose etiology is thought to be linked with oxidative stress i.e., lung, oral, colorectal and breast cancers and matched controls were genotyped for GAG repeats in GCLC. Statistical analyses showed that individuals with GAG-7/7 were at approximately 2-fold higher risk compared to those with GAG-9/9 for lung cancer (p=0.05) and oral cancer (p=0.03) but not for colorectal and breast cancers. Stratified analysis of lung cancer patients indicated that current smokers with GAG-7/7 were at significantly higher risk (p=0.01) but not ex-smokers or never smokers. These results are consistent with in vitro studies linking the genotype GAG-7/7 is associated with lower glutathione levels and higher risk for cancer. In addition these results highlight the importance of the GSH biosynthetic pathway in determining the risk for tobacco related cancers such as lung and oral cancers.\nOverall, findings from these studies suggest that genetic variation in the GSH biosynthetic pathway alters risk for cancer by contributing to different levels of GSH among individuals. Since GSH is involved in numerous biochemical functions of the cell, this genetic variation might also play a role in other diseases whose etiology is linked to GSH or oxidative stress. Furthermore, the GAG genotype information along with other polymorphisms and risk factors can be used as a genetic biomarker to identify individuals predisposed to diseases and toxicities that involve GSH metabolism or oxidative stress. \n \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5718], "author_name_tesi": "Nichenametla, Sailendra Nath", "last_name_ssi": "Nichenametla", "middle_name_ssi": "Nath", "first_name_ssi": "Sailendra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Peter Richie Jr.", "John Peter Richie Jr.", "Philip Lazarus", "Joshua Ethan Muscat", "Scot R Kimball", "Curtis John Omiecinski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Peter Richie Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "John Peter Richie Jr., Committee Chair", "Philip Lazarus, Committee Member", "Joshua Ethan Muscat, Committee Member", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cancer", "trinucleotide repeat polymorphisms", "Oxidative stress", "glutathione"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "AGRICULTURAL TRACTOR OVERTURN MITIGATION VIA AN OPERATOR ALERTING SYSTEM AND ACTIVE INTERVENTION", "id": "6966", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "995", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A system was developed to sense proximity to side overturn for an agricultural\ntractor.

Chapter 1 outlines the fundamentals of polymer chemistry in conjunction with the importance of polyphosphazene chemistry and its potential for biomedical applications. Chapter 6 illustrates additional possibilities and considerations for designing future polymers for tissue engineering scaffolds. \nChapter 2 discusses the design, synthesis, and characterization of new polyphosphazenes to determine their potential as scaffolds for ligament and tendon tissue engineering. The carboxylic acid moiety of the amino acids L-alanine and L-phenylalanine were protected with alkyl esters with increasing chain length from 5 to 8 carbon atoms. This combined the hydrolytic sensitivity of the amino acid ester polyphosphazenes with the elastomeric characteristics induced by the long chain alkoxy polyphosphazenes. Test side group substitution reactions were performed on the cyclic small molecule model, hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene (NPCl2)3, to determine if steric hindrance would inhibit the degree of chlorine replacement by the amino acid ester units. Counterpart polymers were then synthesized by replacement of the chlorine atoms in poly(dichlorophosphazene) (NPCl2)n by the same amino acid esters. The glass transition temperatures of the polymers decreased with increasing alkyl ester chain length, ranging from 11.6 to -24.2 \u00b0C. Polymer hydrolysis was studied for solid samples in deionized water at physiological temperature for 12 weeks. The starting pH was 6.3 and the final pH ranged between 5.2 and 6.8. Polymer film mass decreased between ~8.7 and 26 percent during the 12 week period, while the molecular weights decreased ~57 to 99 percent. \nChapter 3 describes the development of a possible polymer candidate that could potentially serve as a ligament or tendon tissue engineering scaffold by meeting the requirements of biodegradability, biocompatibility, and elasticity. In an attempt to meet these requirements novel citronellol-containing polyphosphazenes were synthesized, characterized, and crosslinked to generate elastomers. Citronellol was chosen as a side group due to its anti-inflammatory properties in addition to the presence of a double bond in its structure to permit polymer crosslinking. Alanine ethyl ester was chosen as a co-substituent to tune hydrolysis rates without severely affecting the glass transition temperatures of the final polymers. Hydrolysis of the uncrosslinked polymers in the form of films in deionized water at 37 \u00b0C showed between a ~8 to 16% mass loss and between a ~28 to 88% molecular weight decline over 12 weeks. Polymers were also crosslinked using UV radiation for increasing amounts of time. Preliminary mechanical testing of the homo-citronellol polymer indicated increasing modulus and decreasing tensile strength with increased crosslink density. \nChapter 4 outlines a different approach to attaching the anti-inflammatory molecule citronellol to the polyphosphazene backbone. By contrast, in this work citronellol, was used as an ester unit to the carboxylic acid moiety of the amino acids glycine, alanine, valine, and phenylalanine that were in turn linked to the polymer through the amino functionality. This method allowed the hydrolysis rate to be tuned via the steric hindrance generated by the amino acid ester while still providing two crosslinkable sites per repeat unit from the citronellol units. A hydrolysis study of the uncrosslinked polymers at physiological temperature showed between a 19.9 \u2013 28.8% mass loss and between a 80.4 \u2013 98.9% molecular weight decline after 12 weeks. The double bond in the citronellol structure also allowed polymer crosslinking by UV radiation to further tune the properties. Additionally, the mechanical properties of the alanine and phenylalanine citronellol polymers were studied as a function of crosslinking. \nIn chapter 5 the field of ethoxyphosphaze polymers is considered for their potential as biomedical materials. This was accomplished by determining the properties and hydrolytic characteristics of poly(diethoxyphosphazene) and related derivatives with both ethoxy and hydrophobic co-substitutent groups in a near 1:1 molar ratio. Co-substituents such as 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy, phenoxy, or p-methylphenoxy units were examined.  These hydrophobic co-substitutents serve as models for bioactive counterparts. The hydrolytic sensitivity of the ethoxyphosphazene units was so pronounced that even hydrophobic or bulky O-linked co-substitutents failed to counteract the hydrolysis behavior during a twelve-week hydrolysis study. This work illustrates a pathway for the development of a new class of useful bioerodible polymers.

This work is focused on identifying predictable properties of the low frequency (<100 Hz) noise field and improving the capabilities of hydroacoustic systems for sensing and monitoring geophysical, biologic, and anthropogenic activity. In this dissertation, three unique analyses of the properties of ambient noise are examined.\nFirst, the composition of an ambient noise field is assessed, by identifying sets of characteristic spectra. Three proposed methods for identifying these spectrum sets are: spectrum correlation matrix sorting, manual replica selection, and Principal Component Analysis. The characteristic spectra identified by each of these techniques are then used to reconstruct an approximation of the measured noise field. The accuracy of each of these methods for reconstructing the measured noise field is assessed by comparing the frequency correlation matrices of the measured and reconstructed noise fields, which characterize the dominant frequency behavior within a dataset, helping to identify the dominant source mechanisms.\nSecond, the wind-driven component of the acoustic spectrum below 20 Hz is compared across measurement locations in three different ocean basins. In a 1993 study by McCreery et al., the authors proposed that the spectrum of wind-driven noise below 5 Hz should follow a characteristic -23 dB/octave slope, which should be constant across all measurement locations, because of its purely geophysical driving mechanism. In testing this hypothesis, the current work identifies strong similarities between the spectra measured at various sites, though small, basin-dependent spectral features arise due to the local seafloor configuration.\nLastly, the angular dependence of the apparent sound speed measured by a receiver array is examined. For an array that is small relative to the source distance, the arrival angle and propagation speed of a signal can be computed by assuming that it can be approximated as a plane wave, and comparing the acoustic arrival time differences. In general, it is expected that the sound speed in water should be isotropic, ignoring any effects of local currents and refraction. However, if the sensor coordinates used to derive the arrival angle and sound speed are incorrect, the resulting sound speeds will strongly depend on the source arrival angle. The current work identifies the form of the angular sound speed dependence for incorrect sensor locations, which is subsequently used to estimate the correct distances between sensors in the array. This procedure is further developed to attempt to identify relative motion of the moored hydrophones within local tidal currents.\nThe data used in this study comes from three stations of the Comprehensive nuclear-Test Ban Treaty Organization\u2019s (CTBTO) hydroacoustic monitoring system. These stations have produced multi-year recordings of low frequency ambient noise in the ocean sound channel. While the primary role of these stations is to monitor the world\u2019s oceans for unsanctioned nuclear weapons testing, the resulting recordings provide an excellent data source for underwater acoustics research in the low frequency band.

Research suggests this may play a critical role in compulsive drug use and risk for relapse. We attempted to induce two different types of monetary reward devaluation in two studies of chronic cigarette smokers (Study 1: expectation to smoke, Study 2: monetary rewards viz-a-viz. cigarette rewards). Though this manipulation did not result as expected, we did observe predicted ventromedial striatal activation in response to reward in Study 1, and an unexpected increase in pre-SMA response to punishment in both studies. The latter effect was interpreted to represent the integration of negative feedback with the behavioral choice that incurred the loss. We were mainly interested in brain network changes involved in imbalanced reward processing and we utilized the recently developed beta series technique to compare connectivity between conditions. In Study 1, this revealed a main effect of time that was disparate from the univariate analysis and suggested that reward processing becomes more efficient with continued use (as evidenced by reduced univariate activation and increased connectivity with other regions). A time by outcome interaction between the bilateral ventromedial striatum was observed, such that connectivity was greater for pre-shift punishment trials and post-shift reward trials. One interpretation of this effect is that participants shifted their priority from avoiding punishment to pursuing reward over time.

This concern emerged in both national and transnational contexts when women of color and others began to critique the idea that women could act together on equal terms because they all experienced a similar form of oppression as women.  Women of color suggested instead, that in order to form non-colonizing relationships, feminists must recognize that the ways in which women understand their concerns as women are shaped by other factors such as race, class, nationality, and sexuality.  The question that feminists have sought to answer is how to recognize the diversity among women while at the same time not sacrificing the \u201cunity\u201d thought necessary for political action.    \nAttempts to answer this question have lead to an expansion of what I refer to as feminist \u201crhetorics of connection\u201d in both national and transnational contexts.  Rhetorics of connection most generally refer to the varying ways in which feminists use terms such as solidarity, sisterhood, unity, alliance, and coalition to describe the connections between women.  By emphasizing that these are rhetorics, I draw attention to the significance of the words used to describe connections and how the words are used, in what context and with what objectives.\nIn this dissertation, I explore the rhetorics of connection that emerge in the context of the United Nations Conferences on Women (Mexico City 1975, Copenhagen 1980, Nairobi 1985 and Beijing 1995) and more specifically the concurrent Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) fora.  These events provided a unique opportunity for women from different parts of the globe to come together to discuss issues of concern to women.  The significance of these events can be seen in the suggestion by numerous feminist activists and scholars that the conferences and fora led to the development of a truly international women\u2019s movement.  The creation of this movement is frequently described as a movement away from conflict amongst women, especially between Western and non-Western women, in Mexico City and Copenhagen to a respect for difference in Nairobi and Beijing.  \nIn the dissertation, I show, by employing the notion of the rhetorics of connection, that rather than simply moving from conflict to connection, there are multiple, sometimes competing rhetorics of connection employed by varying groups within the context of these events.  This project contributes to two important conversations in feminist scholarship. First, it adds to the existing historical work on the UN conferences, especially the NGO fora. While numerous participants recounted their experiences and provided analysis of the fora and conferences in a variety of publications including newspapers, magazines, newsletters as well as women\u2019s studies journals, few scholars have assessed the four UN conferences together as this project does (exceptions include Fraser 1987, Winslow 1995, Zinsser 2002, Antrobus 2004). More importantly, while many scholars have noted that the fora can be used to trace the changing ways in which women see their relationships with one another (Miles 1996, Desai 2002, Basu 2003, Moghadam 2005), little attention is paid to the language used to describe connection as well as the ways in which the context of the fora shapes the ways in which connection is understood. Secondly, this project contributes to the theoretical work on connection, most specifically discussions of solidarity.  It does so by providing concrete examples of how activists have, in practice, negotiated the question of how to have effective political action and still allow for the recognition of the multiple differences that exist between women.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1043], "author_name_tesi": "Nicklen, Challen Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Nicklen", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Challen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy S Love", "Lee Ann Banaszak", "John Philip Christman", "Melissa Wright", "Holloway Sparks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy S Love, Committee Chair", "Lee Ann Banaszak, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Melissa Wright, Committee Member", "Holloway Sparks, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["global feminism", "transnational feminism", "United Nations", "social movements"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Atlas and Key to the Hair of Terrestrial Pennsylvania Mammals", "id": "19761", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9560", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hair is considered one of the synapomorphies (shared derived characters) of extant mammals.\nKeys and atlases of mammal hairs can be useful for many purposes.

Computer architects are actively pursuing multi-core designs with billions of transistors on a single die. Integration at these levels has highlighted the criticality of the on-chip interconnects; global interconnect delays are dominating gate delays and affecting overall system performance. Packet-based Network-on-Chip (NoC) architectures are viewed as a possible solution to burgeoning global wiring delays in many-core chips, and have recently crystallized into a significant research domain. NoCs are steadily becoming the de facto interconnect solution in complex Systems-on-Chip (SoC), because of their scalability and optimized electrical properties. However, current research also indicates that the chip area and power budgets are increasingly being dominated by the interconnection network.\n\nUnlike traditional multi-computer macro-networks, on-chip networks instill a new flavor to communication research due to their inherently resource-constrained nature. Scarcity in the area and power budgets devoted to the interconnection fabric necessitates a re-interpretation of the networking paradigm. Furthermore, despite the lightweight character demanded of the NoC components, modern designs require ultra-low communication latencies in order to cope with inflating data bandwidths. These conflicting requirements transform the NoC design process into a grand challenge for the system designer. The work presented in this thesis aims to address these issues through a comprehensive and holistic exploration of the design space. To truly appreciate the nuances underlying the NoC realm, the design aspects of the on-chip network are viewed through a penta-faceted prism encompassing five major issues: (1) performance, (2) silicon area consumption, (3) power/energy efficiency, (4) reliability, and (5) variability. These five aspects serve as the fundamental design drivers and critical evaluation metrics in the quest for efficient NoC implementations.\n\nThe research described in this thesis explores the field by employing a two-pronged approach: (a) MICRO-architectural innovations within the major NoC components, and (b) MACRO-architectural choices aiming to seamlessly merge the interconnection backbone with the remaining system modules. These two research threads and the aforementioned five key metrics mount a holistic and in-depth attack on most issues surrounding the design of NoCs in multi-core architectures.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [919], "author_name_tesi": "Nicopoulos, Chrysostomos A.", "last_name_ssi": "Nicopoulos", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Chrysostomos", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das", "Mary Jane Irwin", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Paul S Weiss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chitaranjan Das, Committee Member", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Chair", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "Ram Mohan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Paul S Weiss, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Networks-on-Chip", "On-Chip Interconnects"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "The Force of Habit: Rhetoric, Repetition, and Identity From Darwin To Drugs", "id": "6655", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2536", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The trope of habit in Western culture has had an important tradition as a pedagogical strategy, a way of accounting for human behavior, and even as an explanation for the workings of natural and physical laws.  However, in its contemporary guise, habit has become what some scholars call a culturally dead metaphor: that is, while the word is still used, it conveys only a shade of its former cultural resonance and weight.  This project attempts to invigorate the concept of habit by turning to nineteenth and early twentieth century discourses of evolutionary biology and psychology (and the responses to these discourses), in which the concept of habit was both more vital and more richly nuanced.  Chapter One introduces the \u201cproblem\u201d of habit, including its relation to the rhetorical concept of ethos, and, by extension, ethics.  Chapter Two examines how Darwin treated habit as one of the forces that ordered the dizzying complexity of life; it also considers how Darwin himself predicts (via the concept of habit) some contemporary habits of reading Darwin, and provides Samuel Butler\u2019s response to Darwin as a counterexample of ways in which Darwin\u2019s work might be read.

Specifically, it looks at two aspects of audience activity: selectivity and involvement.  Drawing upon uses and gratifications theory, the study was designed to determine whether the concept of audience activity is still valid when applied to a new medium of mass communication.  The study also considers the motivation of users of the Web\u2014the purposes behind their choice of medium.\n\n\nAn online survey collected data from a volunteer sample of 288 Web users.  Survey questions were similar to those used in previous uses and gratifications studies of audience activity among television viewers.  \n\n\nFactor analysis of the online survey data indicated that Web users, like television viewers, exhibit two broad types of motivation: instrumental and ritualistic media consumption.   The study demonstrated that the level of audience activity is determined by the motivation of the user to access content.  Generally, a user with instrumental motivations wants to gain something from exposure to media content, while ritualistic users use media to escape or pass time. \n\n \nMultiple regression analysis of the hypotheses showed that instrumental Web users are somewhat selective before their time online, but so are ritualistic users\u2014a surprising finding, since one of the characteristics of a ritualistic media consumer is to use media to kill time, without paying particular attention to media content.  During Web use, instrumental users were found to be more selective, and to make an effort to gain information from the web pages they accessed.  The main difference between instrumental and ritualistic Web users is that instrumental users were also found to be more involved with content on the Web, both before and during their online sessions.

Mushroom farming and packing involve intense manual labor in all phases of production. Approximately 98% of the mushroom workers in southeast PA are Mexicans. Education and training of food handlers is needed to prevent foodborne illnesses since food handlers\u2019 mishandling has caused many outbreaks reported in the food industry. \nSometimes educational materials do not work because they are designed without examining the worksite social and environmental factors affecting the target audience. Educational materials based on application of theory-based models may address more effectively the cause of food safety problems. The Health Action Model (HAM) identifies five constructs or systems that represent conditions surrounding mushroom workers: Baseline food safety knowledge, normative system, motivational system, food safety/belief system, and appropriate working environment and conditions.  \nAn opportunity to test the HAM plus Expectancy Theory (HAM-ET) arose when the Pennsylvania mushroom industry requested a food safety education program to be implemented industry wide. For this thesis research, a food safety education program for the mushroom industry was developed and factors, such as ethnic background, motivation, and peer role models were evaluated to determine how they would affect food safety educational programs.\nThe first objective was to design and carry out a food safety needs assessment in the mushroom industry using the HAM as a framework. Some refinements of the motivational construct for its use in this research were made. All mushroom companies (packers, growers, or both) affiliated with the American Mushroom Institute were sent a fax explaining the project. Companies were contacted in the order derived from a randomized list to determine interest. Ultimately seven companies and its subsidiaries agreed to be part of the project. The information gathering process included an observation exercise and a focus group at each worksite (n=7) and 10-12 interviews/worksite (N=100 total).  Each method explored one or more systems of the model. The information was triangulated across the HAM and the findings were helpful to identify factors that should be taken into account in designing an educational intervention for the target audience. The needs assessment is reported in Chapter 2. \n\tAdditionally, no reports of an \u2018observation method\u2019 applicable to conducting a needs assessment for food safety training in a food production setting were found. To address this gap in methodology, we developed a \n\u2018Worker-Experience Protocol\u2019, in which a person, unconnected to either the regulatory system or the food company, served as a \u2018worker\u2019 as a way to make direct observations of company operations and worker behaviors. It was postulated that this protocol would provide valuable and unique information that would be useful in designing a food safety program. The effectiveness of this protocol is reported in Chapter 3.\nEvaluation of program impact is needed to show the worth of a program. The HAM model can also be helpful in the evaluation process considering that the literature indicates debate about the effectiveness of food safety training programs. The objectives in this part of the study were to develop, implement and evaluate a pilot food safety educational program for the mushroom industry target audience.\nBecause of mushroom production unit time constraints, four lesson modules, each 25-40 minutes long, were developed based on specific learning objectives derived from the needs assessment. Each lesson in the program included visual aids and a script outlining presentation content that addressed the learning objectives. Risk perception and principles of adult education were introduced through discussion topics, demonstrations, and hands-on activities. The impact of three independent variables was tested in the pilot test: (1) the effect of the food safety lessons themselves as knowledge score; (2) item 1 plus altering employee motivation through increasing expectancy (supervisors were to encourage and enforce the desired behaviors and were to also act as role models by practicing the behavior themselves thus increasing the expectancy) and increasing instrumentality (supervisors were to praise workers when they perform the desired behavior); and  (3) item 1 and 2 plus altering the employee motivational valence by examining the effect of a economic incentive  on the dependent variables (Actions), three different handwashing opportunities plus jewelry and hairnet usage. One observer collected the pre-post and delayed post intervention data to assess the effect of the food safety program on food safety behaviors change over the time. For comparison, a control group received no treatment. A pre-post knowledge test was given to each participating worker. Three months after the end of the waiting period, retrospective scripted interviews were conducted.\nBased on the findings of the current study, there was a significant knowledge increase after the intervention on workers who completed the program.  No effect of the monetary incentive was observed. Expectancy (as enforcement and role modeling) seems to be more effective in the mushroom industry. Instrumentality was not evident in supervisory actions as reported by both supervisors and workers. This observation may reflect the cultural expectations of the Hispanic workers when employed in a hierarchical unit. It was concluded that training must be followed by the involvement of the supervisory personnel to enforce behavioral rules. Ultimately, management support of the supervisory role will increase the success in any food safety program within the industry. \nBased on these findings the HAM model can be used as a guide to develop customized food safety educational materials at a variety of different settings and target audiences in food production facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5847], "author_name_tesi": "Nieto-Montenegro, Sergio ", "last_name_ssi": "Nieto-Montenegro", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sergio", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Juanita Lynne Brown", "Luke F Laborde", "Catherine Nettles Cutter", "Rama B Radhakrishna"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Juanita Lynne Brown, Committee Chair", "Luke F Laborde, Committee Member", "Catherine Nettles Cutter, Committee Member", "Rama B Radhakrishna, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mushroom", "Hispanic", "Handwashing", "Observation", "Theory", "Produce Safety", "Education", "Food Safety"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EVALUATING A SIMULATION GAME IN CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING EDUCATION:\nTHE VIRTUAL CONSTRUCTION SIMULATOR 3\n", "id": "11746", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1605", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Building construction processes are dynamic, complex, and subject to constant and unanticipated changes and delays. Learning to manage inherent construction process variability and its associated risks is challenging, especially at the undergraduate level when students typically have only limited practical construction management experience. The advances in computing technology have afforded novel approaches to teaching dynamic construction management concepts that could transform undergraduate learning. One such advance \u2013 educational simulation games \u2013 has shown great promise in teaching students construction process variability, allowing learners to react and respond to unanticipated construction events in a safe, simulated construction environment. To date, construction engineering undergraduate programs have not yet fully embraced the potential of simulation games and have fallen short when integrating this potentially transformative teaching approach into the classroom. In addition, a literature review yields a paucity of research on the simulation game development process and its effectiveness in construction engineering and management education. \nTo address these gaps, the present study explores simulation game applicability for construction engineering education and provides guidelines for the development of the next generation of simulation game learning tools. This study begins by explicating the simulation game attributes conducive to learning and motivation, and details the development process of the Virtual Construction Simulator 3 (VCS3) game to teach students the dynamic nature of construction project planning and management. The VCS3 incorporates project constraints and real-time feedback, and allows students to optimize for varying construction process strategies and observe results in real time. The underlying system dynamics model encapsulates the feedback loop between varying construction factors to simulate industry conditions and add to the content realism. \nThe pedagogical value of the VCS3 simulation game is estimated through a pre- and post-testing of 97 students in a third-year introductory course to building construction at Penn State. Findings indicate the value and the potential of the VCS3 simulation game to help students form a more holistic view of construction scheduling, and increase student interest and motivation in learning about construction processes; cost and time tradeoffs; and inherent management challenges. The VCS3 simulation also helped students to discern the differences between the as-planned and as-built construction schedules resulting from varying factors such as resource availability, weather and labor productivity. Goal-driven exploration and immediate feedback confirmed the value of the VCS3 simulation game to shift the student\u2019s role from passive to active learner complementing instructor feedback and creating opportunities to raise more questions and more robust in-class discussions.\nThe development of the computational simulation game model, along with the documented process and implementation findings further an understanding of the role of simulation games for construction engineering education; address the changing mode of learning for the current generation; and provide a basis for the promotion of the next generation of effective learning tools based on simulation games.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1588], "author_name_tesi": "Nikolic, Dragana ", "last_name_ssi": "Nikolic", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dragana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Messner", "John Messner", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba", "Jelena Srebric", "Loukas N Kalisperis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Messner, Dissertation Advisor", "John Messner, Committee Chair", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba, Committee Member", "Jelena Srebric, Committee Member", "Loukas N Kalisperis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["construction education", "construction planning", "simulation", "games"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Total Syntheses of the Marine Natural Products (\u2012)-nakadomarin A and (\u00b1)-cortistatin J via Iminium Ion Cyclizations", "id": "12703", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7035", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The total synthesis of the biologically active, marine alkaloid\n(\u2012)-nakadomarin A is discussed in Part I.

Despite the relative paucity of genes which encode G protein subunits in plant compared to animal genomes, analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice heterotrimeric G proteins mutants have revealed multiple and diverse roles for G proteins in plant physiology.  These functions include environmental and hormonal signaling, cell division, development, and stomatal aperture regulation.  The functions of heterotrimeric G proteins in Arabidopsis have been previously explored primarily via cell and molecular biology approaches with little emphasis on how G proteins contribute to whole plant water status and plant fitness.  This work in this thesis investigates G protein function at the whole-plant level in attempt to understand this missing component of our knowledge of G protein function in plants.\nChapters 1-3 are introductory chapters that explain in more depth the rational and organization of this thesis (Chapter 1) and review literature on the regulation of transpiration in Arabidopsis (Chapter 2) and G protein regulation of stomatal movements (Chapter 3).  Chapter 4 identifies the sole G&#945; subunit in Arabidopsis, GPA1, as a positive regulator of transpiration efficiency, despite stomatal ABA sensitivities of gpa1 mutants that would suggest the opposite.  GPA1 regulates transpiration efficiency in part via stomatal density control which modulates whole-leaf stomatal conductance.  Chapter 5 is my attempt at understanding the molecular mechanism behind GPA1 regulation of stomatal density and development, by exploring potential biochemical interactions between GPA1 and previously identified proteins which function in stomatal development. Chapter 6 addresses the question, how do G proteins contribute to plant fitness? This chapter identifies the gene which encodes the sole G&#946; subunit in Arabidopsis, AGB1, as a plasticity gene.  AGB1 regulates phenotypic plasticity, the ability for one genotype to display different phenotypes under different environmental conditions, in response to water availability for a number of fecundity-related traits.  Chapter 7 investigates whether G proteins also function in the regulation of cross-generational phenotypic plasticity, when the environment of the parent affects the phenotype of the offspring.  In this study I found significant genetic variation for cross-generational among G protein mutants and wild type plants and that gpa1 and agb1 mutants had reduced, if not abolished, cross-generational plasticity for these traits compared to wild type.  Chapter 8 discusses how this thesis contributes to plant biology and also suggests additional avenues of inquiry to further elucidate the results of the previous chapters. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5571], "author_name_tesi": "Nilson, Sarah Elisabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Nilson", "middle_name_ssi": "Elisabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Mary Assmann", "Sarah Mary Assmann", "Paula Mc Steen", "Andrew George Stephenson", "David Eissenstat"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Mary Assmann, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Chair", "Paula Mc Steen, Committee Member", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Member", "David Eissenstat, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transpiration efficiency", "Arabidopsis thaliana", "Heterotrimeric G proteins", "stomatal density", "phenotypic plasticity"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Multi-Criteria Optimization Model for a Four-Stage Multi-Product Supply Chain\n\n", "id": "10666", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1934", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this thesis is to develop a supply chain model that integrates several common supply chain modeling techniques into a realistic and comprehensive general model.  The model addresses production, transportation, and inventory decisions, which are often considered separately.  Supply chain modeling problems tend to be inherently multi-criteria problems in that the optimization of several objectives simultaneously is required in order to develop the most efficient supply chain.  In this thesis up to three criteria are considered simultaneously and are used to develop a multi-criteria optimization model.  The three criteria are profit, customer service, and inventory capital.  The solution to the model can be used as a supply chain management tool to determine the quantities and scheduling related to the production and distribution of products across a supply chain in order to best optimize the objectives.\n\nThe model developed is for a four-stage, centralized supply chain in which two products are being produced and distributed.  There are several suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, and retailers at each stage and each manufacturer has three production lines.  Two modes of transportation are available between each stage of the supply chain and a freight rate function is utilized.  The freight rate function follows an All-Units discount cost structure that depends on the weight of shipments and the transportation mode being used.  The demand at the retailers drives the supply chain and is deterministic and independent among the retailers.  The supply chain is modeled as a mixed integer linear program that is solved using GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System).  The multi-criteria model is solved using goal programming, a multi-criteria modeling technique that aims to minimize the total deviation of the objective values from their goals.  The problems are solved either as a preemptive goal program or non-preemptive goal program, depending on how the criteria preference information is specified.\n\t\nAn illustrative example is used to demonstrate the implementation of goal programming and the overall use of the model.  Two bi-criteria cases are modeled in which profit and customer service are maximized.  Additionally, a third case addresses changes in the solution when a third objective, the minimization of inventory capital, is added to the model.  The solutions to all three cases are compared and differences among preemptive and non-preemptive solutions are identified, as well as the differences between the bi-criteria and multi-criteria models.  The model not only incorporates several supply chain modeling techniques into a single model, it also addresses multiple criteria simultaneously in an attempt to develop a realistic supply chain model that can be used as a tool to improve supply chain efficiency.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1916], "author_name_tesi": "Niman, Emily ", "last_name_ssi": "Niman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Emily", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Ravindran", "Arunachalam Ravindran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Ravindran, Thesis Advisor", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["supply chain", "multi-criteria", "multicriteria", "optimization", "supply chain modeling", "multi-product", "supply chain management", "supply chain efficiency"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Architectural Considerations For Context Aware Applications In A Mobile Cloud Computing Environment", "id": "22431", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10344", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There have been significant recent changes in three areas related to mobile application technology: 1) Mobile devices have become more powerful and equipped with increasingly useful sensors; 2) Mobile device networks have improved in both bandwidth and reliability; and 3) New \u201capps\u201d and usage patterns have resulted in greater amounts of data that are closely linked to the user and the activities that they use their device for.\nA new class of applications such as Google Now[1], seek to behave as \u201cvirtual agents\u201d to assist the user based on a large variety of fused data.

Small diameter nanowires can act as model systems to study interesting phenomena such as tunneling that occur in the nanometer regime. Furthermore, technical challenges in fabricating nanoscale size devices from thin films have resulted in interest and research on nanowires. In this perspective, vertical integrated nanowire field effect transistors (VINFETs) fabricated from Si nanowires are promising devices that offer better control on device properties and push the transistor architecture into the third dimension potentially enabling ultra-high transistor density circuits. Transistors fabricated from Si/Si1-xGex nanowires have also been proposed that can have high carrier mobility. In addition, the Si and Si1-xGex nanowires have potential to be used in various applications such as sensing, thermoelectrics and solar cells. Despite having considerable potential, the understanding of the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism utilized to fabricate these wires is still rudimentary. Hence, the objective of this thesis is to understand the effects of nanoscale size and the role of catalyst that mediates the wire growth on the growth rate of Si and Si1-xGex nanowires and interfacial abruptness in Si/Si1-xGex axial heterostructure nanowires. \n\nInitially, the growth and structural properties of Si nanowires with tight diameter distribution grown from 10, 20 and 50 nm Au particles dispersed on a polymer-modified substrate was studied. A nanoparticle application process was developed to disperse Au particles on the substrate surface with negligible agglomeration and sufficient density. The growth temperature and SiH4 partial pressure were varied to optimize the growth conditions amenable to VLS growth with smooth wire morphology and negligible Si thin film deposition on wire sidewalls. The Si nanowire growth rate was studied as a function of growth time, temperature, SiH4 partial pressure and wire diameter and discussed in the context of the literature. The wire growth rate was found to increase with wire diameter in agreement with a size-related effect known as the Gibbs-Thomson effect. Subsequently, the effect of P and Sb doping on the growth rate and structural properties of Si nanowires was investigated. A reduction in wire growth rate was observed upon doping, which was pronounced in case of Sb doping, ascribable to P/Sb segregation at the vapor-liquid interface (catalyst surface) and the liquid-solid interface (growth front) that in turn reduces Si incorporation at these interfaces.\n\nThe second part of thesis was focused on the Si1-xGex alloy nanowires. The effect of wire diameter and growth conditions on the interfacial abruptness of Si/Si1-xGex heterostructure nanowires was examined. Abrupt interfaces were obtained at smaller wire diameters. However, the growth temperature wasn\u2019t found to have much impact on the interfacial abruptness. These results were explained in terms of catalyst effects on the interfacial abruptness. The remaining part of the study was focused on the effect of growth conditions on the growth rate of Si1-xGex nanowires. It was found that the Si incorporation mechanism was different between Si and Si1-xGex nanowire growth which was ascribed to changes in the gas phase or catalyst composition that can impact the SiH4 decomposition kinetics at the catalyst surface (vapor-liquid interface) and/or Si incorporation at the growth front (liquid-solid interface).\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5020], "author_name_tesi": "Nimmatoori, Pramod ", "last_name_ssi": "Nimmatoori", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pramod", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Themis Matsoukas", "Darrell Velegol", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Elizabeth C Dickey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Marie Redwing, Dissertation Advisor", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Chair", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Silicon Germanium", "Silicon", "Nanowires", "Vapor-liquid-solid mechanism", "Growth"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Probabilistic Estimation And Validation Of Regional Climate Change Using Statistical Downscaling Methods", "id": "15289", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7164", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nTwo applications of regional climate changes are presented of a statistical downscaling method based on self-organizing maps (SOMs).  The first application produces high-resolution, downscaled precipitation estimates over the state of Pennsylvania in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. using synoptic circulation data from the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and nine General Circulation Models (GCMs). The downscaling approach provides a faithful reproduction of the observed probability distributions and temporal characteristics of precipitation on both daily and monthly time scales. The downscaled precipitation field shows significant improvement over the raw GCM precipitation fields with regard to observed average monthly precipitation amounts, average monthly numbers of rainy days, and standard deviations of monthly precipitation amounts. \nWhen applied to the future period 2046-2065, downscaling predicts an increase in annual and winter precipitation and a decrease in summer precipitation when ensemble averaged across the nine GCMs.  In order to examine the sensitivity of precipitation change to the water vapor increase brought by global warming, two downscaling approaches are used: one includes the specific humidity in the downscaling algorithm and the other does not.  The downscaled precipitation increases employing specific humidity are larger than those without it, and both of them are smaller than those increases from raw GCM simulations.  And application of downscaling reduces the inter-GCM variation, suggesting that some of spread among models in the raw projected precipitation may result from differences in precipitation parameterization schemes rather than fundamentally different climate responses. Projected changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) are found to be significantly related to changes in winter precipitation in the downscaled results but not for the raw GCM results, suggesting that the downscaling more effectively captures the influence of climate dynamics on projected changes in winter precipitation.\nThe second application of the downscaling method is the probabilistic estimation of temperature change over Central Africa as input for a malaria transmission model.  The downscaled temperature data are then evaluated using the malaria transmission model requirements.  The downscaled annual cycles and PDFs of maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, and diurnal temperature range (DTR), closely match observed annual cycles and probability distributions.  And the downscaled time series of the monthly number of days with daily maximum temperature and minimum temperature within malaria development thresholds closely reproduce the observed variability on seasonal to interannual scales.  \n From period 1961-2000 to period 2046-2065, the downscaled ensemble average maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and average temperature increase by 1.5 \u00baC and the DTR decreases.   The annual and boreal winter average temperature increases over West Africa are larger than those over East Africa and West Coastal Africa. The annual and boreal summer DTR decreases over West Africa are larger than those over the other two regions, and the results for boreal winter months are opposite.\nThe validations and probabilistic projections on the downscaling method show that this statistical downscaling method is capable of bridging the gap between coarse-resolution GCM output and the requirements of high-resolution input from the end users, on the inter-disciplinary studies about future climate impacts to hydrology, ecology, and human health. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7151], "author_name_tesi": "Ning, Liang ", "last_name_ssi": "Ning", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Liang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Mann", "Robert George Crane", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr.", "Thorsten Wagener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Mann, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert George Crane, Committee Chair", "Raymond Gabriel Najjar Jr., Committee Member", "Thorsten Wagener, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["regional climate change", "statistical downscaling", "probabilistic esitmation"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Fundamental Structure-Property Relationships towards Engineering of an Integrated NP0 Capacitor for Bismuth Pyrochlore Systems", "id": "5930", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2594", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-03-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A comprehensive investigation of the processing-structure-property-performance interrelationship in the Bi2O3-ZnO-Nb2O5 (BZN) pyrochlore system towards engineering of integrated capacitors with silver electrodes for LTCC (low temperature cofire ceramics) microwave applications is presented.\n\tThe first area of investigation covers the phase formation for the cubic pyrochlore with nominal composition Bi3/2ZnNb3/2O7 and monoclinic zirconolite Bi2Zn2/3Nb4/3O7 compounds through X-ray diffraction phase analysis.  Formation reactions sequences are identified.  In both phases, BiNbO4 is found to be a precursor that reacts primarily with ZnO to form the main phases.  It is also found that in order to kinetically limit the residual BiNbO4, the calcination and sintering profiles should spend limited time at temperatures between 650\u00b0C and 750\u00b0C.  It is shown that high ZnO activity is essential for the phase formation process and therefore the process is extremely dependent on milling and mixing.  In addition, batching with excess ZnO and low pO2 processing atmospheres are demonstrated as alternative processing routes to reduce residual BiNbO4.  The solubility of the main BZN phases to ZnO is investigated revealing wide compositional windows.  These results serve as a guide for the appropriate modifications in batching and processing required to obtain a BZN composite ceramic exhibiting desirable characteristics for integrated capacitors (temperature coefficient of capacitance (TCC) ~ 15 ppm/\u00b0C, mean dielectric constant of 96 and dielectric loss ~ 0.001 at 1 MHz), which can be densified at 950\u00b0C with no sintering additives.\n\tThe second area covers the phase refinement of the main phases in the Bi2O3-ZnO-Nb2O5 pyrochlore system performed via detailed X-ray and neutron diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  Crystal symmetry and atomic positions are presented.  Bi2Zn2/3Nb4/3O7 is characterized as a monoclinic zirconolite-like structure with space group C2/c and lattice parameters a = 13.1037(9) \u00c5, b = 7.6735(3) \u00c5, c = 12.1584(6) \u00c5, and &#61538; = 101.318(5)\u00b0.  Essential features in this phase are revealed by neutron diffraction analysis like the sheet like structure based on HTB- (hexagonal tungsten bronze) like layers formed by [Nb(Zn)O6] octahedra and stacked along the c-axis.  Analysis of TEM dark field images demonstrate the presence of stacking faults in the Bi2Zn2/3Nb4/3O7 phase parallel to the (00l) planes which is consistent with the HTB sheet-like structure characterized.  It is also shown that Zn occupies the central position of the rings in the HTB layers and is displaced from the center, leading to the odd (5+1) coordination with oxygen.  This displacement results in two equivalent sites that are half-occupied and introduces disorder in the system.  Through studying the closely related Bi2O3-MgO-Nb2O5 pyrochlore system, it is shown that the ability to establish the (5+1) coordination is essential for the thermodynamic stability of the phase.\n\tThe phase refinement of the cubic pyrochlore phase reveals the presence of free ZnO in the composition Bi3/2ZnNb3/2O7.  The correct stoichiometry for the cubic pyrochlore phase is determined as Bi1.5Zn0.92Nb1.5O6.92, space group Fd3m and lattice parameter a = 13.1037(9) \u00c5.  Neutron diffraction analysis confirms the multiple and random occupancy of Bi, Zn and vacancy in the A-site, putting an end to the debate regarding the unlikely occupancy of Zn in the A-site.  More importantly, it is shown that both the A- and O\u2019-sites are displaced from the ideal pyrochlore positions.  There are six equivalent positions for the A-site along the <112> directions, and twelve equivalent positions for the O\u2019-site along the <110> directions.  The displacements introduce disorder in the system that leads to a break in local symmetry.  Combination of the multiple occupancy and displacement enables the presence of random fields and nonergodicity in the system that ultimately explains the anomalous properties observed in Bi-cubic pyrochlores.  Finally, a crystallographic comparison between the cubic pyrochlore and monoclinic zirconolite is presented.  \n\tThe third area investigated corresponds to the dielectric properties (e\u2019 and e\u2019\u2019) of the main phases in the BZN pyrochlore system.  A series of different measuring techniques to cover from Hz to THz in the frequency space, and from 12K to 400 K in the temperature space are utilized. Measurements on the Bi2Zn2/3Nb4/3O7 phase reveal a very frequency stable dielectric constant.  e\u2019 is found to be approximately 80 throughout most of the measured range, with a  TCC value +170 ppm/\u00b0C from -55 to 125 \u00b0C at ~ 1 GHz, and quality factor Q ~ 500 at ~ 5 GHz.  These results confirm the BZN monoclinic zirconolite phase as an extremely appealing candidate for microwave applications.  A low temperature (~37 K) anomaly in the dielectric properties is reported and its nature discussed on the basis of the (5+1) coordination by Zn characterized in the phase refinement experiments.\n\tExperimental data of the dielectric properties of the BZN cubic pyrochlore phase reveal a temperature and frequency dependent dielectric relaxation with great variation across the frequency-temperature space.  For example, it is found that at room temperature and 1 MHz, &#61541;\u2019 ~ 150 and tand = 0.003, but at 10 GHz and room temperature, e\u2019 ~130 and tand = 0.115.  TCC at 1MHz = -390 ppm/\u00b0C.  The main characteristics of the dielectric relaxation are qualitatively discussed.  It is shown that despite the dielectric relaxation influencing the dielectric constant and primarily the dielectric loss present in the cubic pyrochlore, the opposing TCC of the monoclinic zirconolite allows the synthesis of a bi-phase composite with a compensated TCC and low loss.\n\tThe fourth research area presents the collection and analysis of Raman and infrared spectra of the main BZN phases.  Utilizing a factor group analysis, the Raman and infrared active phonon modes are identified and assigned.  Based on the crystallographic information, a comparison between the spectra of the cubic pyrochlore and the monoclinic zirconolite is presented.  Unique features are revealed in both phases with temperature dependence analysis of the spectra.  In Bi3/2ZnNb3/2O7, the lowest frequency infrared active phonon mode, corresponding to the O\u2019-A-O\u2019 is found to be main contributor to the dielectric permittivity in the cubic pyrochlore in the microwave regime.  Absorption parameters show that this lattice mode corresponds to an overdamped vibration with a temperature dependent damping coefficient. This behavior is explained by random occupancy and multiple equivalent positions in the A- and O\u2019- sites presented in the phase refinement studies.  Additional proof for the structural disorder is given by the temperature independence of the mode intensities in the Raman spectra.  The absorption parameters are utilized to predict the dielectric properties at microwave frequencies.  The base limit for the dielectric loss in BZN cubic pyrochlore is determined and a protocol that can be extended to any material in order to calculate the intrinsic loss arising from phonon losses is demonstrated.\n\tA peak narrowing and intensity increase of the active modes Raman spectra of BZN monoclinic zirconolite phase reveals ordering of the structure with decreasing temperature.  Dispersion analysis of the Bi2Zn2/3Nb4/3O7 infrared spectra reveal phonon hardening with increasing temperatures. These results are consistent with the crystallographic nature of the phase (HTB layers and (5+1) coordination of Zn) characterized in the phase refinement studies and can account for the temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity observed at low frequencies.\n\tAnalysis of the trends in the infrared absorption bands (phonon modes) with compositional changes is performed based on the spectra of four Bi-based cubic pyrochlore systems.  All measured trends are found to be in fair agreement with those observed in regular cubic pyrochlores.\n\tThe fifth area discusses in detail and extensively analyzes the dielectric relaxation phenomenon observed in Bi-based cubic pyrochlores.  Characteristics of the 3D nature (frequency-temperature space) of the dielectric loss are outlined.\n\tQuantitative analysis of Tm (the temperature at which the maxima in the dielectric loss curve occurs at a given frequency) is reported, and the behavior is successfully modeled with Arrhenius equations.  The pre-exponential coefficient in the Arrhenius equation representing the attempt jump frequency governing the phenomenon is found to closely correspond to the resonant frequency for the O\u2019-A-O\u2019 bending mode reported from the vibrational spectroscopy studies, thus relating the crystal structure with the relaxation observed in the dielectric properties.  \n\tThe shape of the dielectric loss (tand) curve is analyzed and a function (J) capable of modeling tan&#61540; throughout the entire frequency-temperature space where the relaxation phenomenon is active is introduced.  The J function is modified to include the base dielectric loss L0 as an input primarily based on the dispersion analysis calculations (fourth area) rather than a meaningless parameter of the model. \n\tIn addition, the influence of excess Bi+3 on the dielectric relaxation is investigated.  Limited solubility to Bi2O3 is found in the BZN cubic pyrochlore, as little as 5% mol Bi-excess results in a multiple phase ceramic.  Changes in the dielectric properties are explained by mixing rules.  To extend this analysis, the Bi+3 solubility in the Bi3/2MgNb3/2O7 cubic pyrochlore is studied.  Enhanced dielectric constant and shift in Tm to higher temperatures are found with increasing Bi-excess.  A strong correlation between lattice strain and Tm shift is demonstrated, and solid solution behavior of the A-site in the cubic pyrochlore structure is confirmed.\n\tFinally, bringing together all the evidence collected from the different characterization techniques employed in the areas investigated, it is concluded that the relaxation is associated with the following sources: nonergodicity, random fields, lone-pair electrons, site disorder, break of local symmetry, site solubility, and overdamped phonon modes.  As a result a self consistent schematic of the mechanism responsible for the dielectric relaxation in Bi-pyrochlores is proposed. \n\tIn the sixth and final area, several issues regarding the manufacturing of BZN based NP0 (negative, positive, but almost zero temperature coefficient of capacitance) capacitors are covered:  The appropriate composition leading to composite exhibiting NP0 characteristics is presented.  Densification curves for BZN ceramics are determined and analyzed on the basis of the phase formation reactions.  The compatibility of BZN ceramics with silver electrodes is investigated.  A reaction between BiNbO4 and Ag/AgO forming a silver based pyrochlore is identified.  It is demonstrated that if there is any residual BiNbO4 in the BZN composite, the cofirability with silver electrodes is hindered.  More importantly however, it is confirmed that if phase purity is ensured in BZN pyrochlore ceramics, then successful cofiring with silver electrodes is attainable.  This is demonstrated by building and testing prototype multilayer capacitors.  Several electrode pastes are tested.  It is shown that a pure non-glass Ag conductor provides the best results in terms of density, electrode continuity, no delamination and no ceramic-electrode interaction.  \n\tIn addition, the compatibility of BZN ceramics with LTCC technology and silver electrodes is further exemplified by the successful cofiring of an embedded BZN NP0 capacitor with a commercial LTCC system utilizing silver as internal electrodes.  These prototypes serve to the electronics industry as encouragement to incorporate Bi-based pyrochlores and in particular BZN dielectrics to their commercial applications.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2587], "author_name_tesi": "Nino, Juan Claudio", "last_name_ssi": "Nino", "middle_name_ssi": "Claudio", "first_name_ssi": "Juan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Xiaoxing Xi", "William Blaine White", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Michael T Lanagan", "Clive A Randall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Xiaoxing Xi, Committee Member", "William Blaine White, Committee Member", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["dispersion analysis", "crystal structure", "NP0 capacitors", "dielectric relaxation", "low fire ceramics", "phase refinement", "Bismuth pyrochlores"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Viscoelastic Surfactant/Fatty Acid Interfaces: Fluid Dynamics, Rheology, and Structure", "id": "14549zzn1", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14549", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present dissertation concerns an interdisciplinary subject focusing on both viscoelastic material characterizations and fluid dynamics experimental development for an immiscible amphiphilic system. In particular, a self-assembling material formed at the interface between an aqueous cationic surfactant (cetylpyridinium chloride, CPCl) solution and a fatty acid such as oleic acid (OA) is studied. The resulting interfacial layer forms owing to instantaneous self-organization of CPCl and OA molecules, which is similar to established surfactant systems including microemulsions and catanionic surfactants.  \n\n\n\n\nFirst, a ternary phase diagram for CPCl, OA and water was established, to study the phase behavior of equilibrium bulk phases. The morphology and structure of bulk phases were characterized using the Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) and oscillatory rheology. In the ternary diagram, we observed the formation of a gel phase at the equimolar mixing ratio of OA and CPCl. To characterize the interfacial layer made between CPCl solutions and OA, we reproduced the interfacial materials in small capillaries and employed SAXS. Both bulk gel and the interfacial material exhibit a domain spacing on the order of 20 nm as a lamellar phase. Interfacial rheology is applied to understand viscoelastic properties of the interfacial layer made between CPCl solution and a thin layer of OA. Both bulk rheology of the gel phase as well as the interfacial rheology of interfacial layer demonstrated a viscoelastic gel behavior (elastic modulus larger than loss modulus, and both moduli independent of frequency). Furthermore, a detailed comparison of bulk and interfacial materials characteristics are discussed.\n\nIn the fluid dynamics part, two flow geometries are used to examine flow instabilities during interfacial material formation. In the first flow configuration, injection of an aqueous CPCl solution into an immiscible OA results in formation of various geometry including a columnar geometry due to development of an interfacial layer. The interfacial layer or the column wall exhibits peculiar elastic behavior such as wrinkling, buckling, or rupture. The physical properties of the interfacial material such as velocity of the interfacial layer are measured using visualization techniques (utilizing Phanton V5 high speed video camera). \nThe second flow geometry is a quasi-2D Hele-Shaw cell, which is a classic method to study dynamics of an interface in a controlled and reproducible way. We observed that the interface dynamics and strength of self-assembled material are strongly dependent on surfactant concentration and flow conditions. The effect of oil molecular structures has been studied using various oils, including inert oils, other fatty acids, and triglycerides of oleic acid (triolein). We eventually discuss possibility of a connection between flow instabilities, phase behavior and interfacial material characteristics.\n\n\nIn our system, both components are known to have antimicrobial properties which made them suitable for many pharmaceutical and medical applications. The results offer a good potential for generalization to a wide variety of complex fluid systems including surfactant mixtures, polymer solutions, emulsions, and colloidal domains, where the physical properties of the interfacial materials can be tuned for variety of applications such as in chemical, food, and oil industries.

The underlying causes of cardiac malfunction are diverse, but often relate to thromboembolic events, arrhythmias, or cardiomyopathies (hypertrophic or dilated).  The polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine are known to be essential for cell growth.  Polyamines also regulate the excitability threshold and duration of action potentials in cardiomyocytes.  This regulation occurs through the action at the K+ inward rectifying channels, with spermine responsible for most of the effect.  Thus, studies of the interactions between polyamines and cardiac physiology should aid in the development of improved pharmaceutical agents for treating cardiac arrhythmias and hypertrophy.\nThe levels of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcAdoMet), an aminopropyl donor for the synthesis of the higher polyamines spermidine and spermine, are known to be low in cardiac cells and are thought to be a limiting factor for the production of spermine.  dcAdoMet is produced by S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC), a low abundance, tightly regulated enzyme with an extremely short half-life (30 minutes to 2 hours).  We have utilized the alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter to generate transgenic mice with cardiac-specific expression of AdoMetDC to enhance our understanding of the role played by AdoMetDC in controlling polyamine levels and of the importance of polyamines in cardiac physiology.\nA founder line was established with > 200-fold increase in AdoMetDC activity in the heart, resulting in decreased putrescine and spermidine levels, and increased spermine levels.  Transgene expression was maximal by one week of age and remained constant into adulthood.  However, the changes in polyamine levels were most pronounced during the first week of age, with a two-fold decrease in putrescine and spermidine, and a two-fold increase in spermine.  Spermine returned to near control levels at three weeks of age, while the levels of putrescine and spermidine remained lower than age-matched non-transgenic littermates.\nThe mechanism responsible for this apparent downregulation of spermine levels in the heart was investigated by assessing expression of other metabolic enzymes in the polyamine pathway.  We found that activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), an enzyme that catalyzes formation of the diamine putrescine in the initial enzymatic reaction of polyamine synthesis, was decreased during the first week of age; while the activity of spermine synthase, an enzyme that catyalyzes transfer of an aminopropyl group to spermidine to form spermine, was increased.  The activity of both enzymes was normalized by two weeks of age.  The activity of spermidine synthase, the enzyme that catyalyzes transfer of an aminopropyl group to putrescine to form spermidine, was increased two-fold at all timepoints studied.  In contrast, no detectable changes in activity, with respect to age-matched non-transgenic littermates, were found for spermine/spermidine N1-acetyl transferase, a rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine catabolism.  These findings suggest that downregulation of spermine levels may occur through upregulation of the polyamine transport system to directly excrete spermine from the cell.\nWhile MHC-AdoMetDC transgenics did not display an overt cardiac phenotype, they showed an enhanced response to \u00ce\u00b2-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol.  Eight day isoproterenol treatments lead to increased cardiac hypertrophy (compared to similarly treated non-transgenics) as measured by cardiosomatic index and histological examination.  The above treatment also resulted in increased mortality in transgenics.  Spermine content was significantly increased by the drug treatment and may be responsible for the increased hypertrophy and mortality in the transgenics.  These findings suggest that MHC-AdoMetDC mice may provide a good model to study the cooperativity between high AdoMetDC activity, increased spermine content and the beta-adrenergic pathway to induce cardiac hypertrophy.\nTo further understand the possible role of spermine in cardiac pathophysiology we decided to create a hybrid, double transgenic mouse line overexpressing both AdoMetDC and ODC enzymes under the control of the alpha-MHC promoter.  To create the hybrid line, we crossed MHC-AdoMetDC mice with the previously characterized MHC-ODC murine line, which demonstrate a 1000-fold increase in ODC activity, 50-fold increase in putrescine and 3.6-fold increase in spermidine.  We theorized that such a large increase in ODC activity combined with an approximately 200-fold overexpression of AdoMetDC would lead to a more significant increase in spermine levels, and would enable further investigation of spermine influence on cardiophysiology.  However, the double transgenic phenotype is lethal in utero.  Examination of embryos and fetuses at different ages of gestation revealed that embryos became non-viable at the point at which the MHC promoter is turned on, during fetal cardiac development (gestational days 10-12).  Furthermore, crosses of MHC-AdoMetDC mice with the newly created CMV-IE-Spermine Synthase transgenic mice, which overexpress spermine synthase, also strongly suggest that this hybrid phenotype is lethal in utero as well.  Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that increased spermine levels due to increased AdoMetDC activity are toxic and may result in fetal lethality.\nFinally, in a separate project we investigated the role of glutamic acid 247 in substrate and inhibitor binding in the catalytic site of AdoMetDC.  The crystal structures of the AdoMetDC/substrate analog and AdoMetDC/inhibitor complexes clearly show the importance of Glu247 in stabilizing both substrate and inhibitor binding through hydrogen bonds.  We decided to confirm the functional importance of Glu247 through site-directed mutagenesis experiments.  Kinetic studies with purified E247A and E247D mutants led to a decrease in Kcat and an increase in Km.  Studies with MGBG and CGP48664A, competitive inhibitors of AdoMetDC, showed that the mutants were resistant to inhibition as compared to the wild type protein.  The changes in kinetic parameters and resistance to inhibition were greater for the E247A mutant than for the E247D, which has a more conservative amino acid substitution.  The observed changes were in agreement with predicted changes in binding energies modeled using the MOE-Dock software.  In designing new inhibitors of AdoMetDC one would attempt to synthesize a compound that fits well into the active site of the enzyme and that takes advantage of all available binding interactions.  Thus, these studies presenting strong evidence for the importance of Glu247 for substrate and inhibitor binding at the active site of hAdoMetDC may aid in the design of new, more potent and less toxic inhibitors of AdoMetDC.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4810], "author_name_tesi": "Nisenberg, Oleg ", "last_name_ssi": "Nisenberg", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Oleg", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Edward Pegg", "Gary Alan Clawson", "Scot R Kimball", "Lisa M Shantz", "Bruce A Stanley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Edward Pegg, Committee Chair", "Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Member", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "Bruce A Stanley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["AdoMetDC", "SAMDC", "beta-adrenergic hypertrophy", "isoproterenol", "polyamine biosynthesis", "transgenic mice"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Essays on the Theory of Environmental Coalitions\n", "id": "8040", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5851", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis consists of two essays. In the first essay, we analyze a two-stage game, with coalition formation in the first stage and Cournot oligopoly in the second, to show how coalition formation takes place and affects the environmental level.\nIn open membership games with symmetric players, the coalition formation process fails, so that the players act independently. In coalition unanimity games with symmetric players, the resulting coalition is the grand coalition, which maximizes the environmental level and improves social welfare compared to the case with open membership.\nIn games with asymmetric players, we analyze coalition formation with and without an endogenous transfer scheme. In the game with a transfer scheme we show that it is possible to achieve a larger coalition than in the game without transfers. For a simple case we explicitly characterize the transfers and their effects on the coalition size.\n\nIn the second essay, we analyze a dynamic coalition formation game for the provision of a public good, which will be provided only when a certain number of contributions are made. In cinite horizon games, we specify the exact period in which the public good will be provided under subgame-perfect equilibria and show that for some costs there will be a delay in provision of the public good. The length of a delay is not monotonic in terms of costs. In infinite horizon games, we show that the immediate provision of a public good can be achieved in some subgame-perfect equilibria, but there might be delay under some other equilibria. We also introduce a partial public good, which requires fewer contributions to be provided but has a smaller value. We show that for some costs, introducing the partial public good eliminates the possibility of provision of any kind of public good in both finite and infinite horizon games. For other costs, introducing the partial public good may improve social welfare.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5848], "author_name_tesi": "Nishikawa, Shizuka ", "last_name_ssi": "Nishikawa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shizuka", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "James Schuyler Jordan", "Vijay Krishna", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "James Schuyler Jordan, Committee Member", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["environmental agreements", "coalition formation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "PHENOTYPIC AND GENETIC CHARACTERIZATION OF NON-SMALL  CELL LUNG CANCER CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS", "id": "14084mxn230", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14084", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are thought to be the drivers of metastasis, which is responsible for the majority of cancer-related deaths.

Rather than generate new effective particles or interactions within familiar flat space, one can also ask how novel geometrical constraints on the underlying manifold can generate new physics, even for old familiar interactions~cite{Thomson,Nelson}. \n \nPerhaps the simplest effective interaction is a featureless long-ranged repulsion, which leads to simple structures in flat space: in two dimensions, a triangular lattice. In contrast, interacting repulsive particles on a cylinder generate a rich degenerate family of helical structures that follow Fibonacci rules first seen in phyllotaxis, the study of plant morphology~cite{phyllo, phyllo2,phyllo3,Church,his,Levitov}. After demonstrating phyllotactic patterns in an experimental 'magnetic cactus`` we show that linear dynamics of phyllotaxis generates rotons and the nonlinear regime supports a large family of dynamically stable topological solitons that can fragment, merge, or interconvert upon collision, with propagation speeds governed by energy conservation and phase matching. These new phenomena should be observable in a wide range of systems, from quantum to classical and from nanometer-scale to macroscopic.\n\n In an attempt to mimic the zero point entropy of water and spin ice~cite{Giaque, Shulson, Pauling}, we have engineered arrays of nanoislands, called 'artificial spin ice`` such that their  simple magnetic interaction can be frustrated by their mutual disposition. While the magnetic cactus was degenerate - although not extensively so - yet could be annealed into its ground state, the artificial spin ice is  theoretically non degenerate, yet attempts to anneal it yield a disordered state,  described by an athermal  manifold of extensive degeneracy.  We show how to predict its non trivial  thermodynamics with good agreement with experimental data and no fitted parameters, using a principle of maximum likelihood reminiscent of entropy. \n\nWhen a flat graphene sheet is rolled in the  cylindrical geometry of a carbon nanotube, a mesoscopic system is born, with macroscopic length, yet atomic scale radius~cite{ji, imperial, Dresselhaus}. We will show here how to adapt to it the standard  elastic formalism for macroscopic objects so that its atomic complexities can be taken into account, and yet still solved analytically. Disparate experimental and numerical results find explanation in this unifying framework. \n\n{\bf Disclaimer}: this is a steroid-free thesis: it was not 'bulked up`` with  anabolic injections  of previously know methods or of accepted theories, which could be found in countless variations of flavors in reviews, textbooks, and other thesis.  To the best of our knowledge, it reports only novel results,  how interesting or relevant being left to the reader to decide. Attempt was made to write it in  a self consistent way, to a level   accessible to a graduate student in physics. We have added only a small introduction to elasticity of continua in Chapter 2, since it seems  more common of curricula in engineering rather  than in  physics, in USA. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1250], "author_name_tesi": "Nisoli, Cristiano ", "last_name_ssi": "Nisoli", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cristiano", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi", "Peter C Eklund", "Henry C Foley", "Gerald Dennis Mahan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Chair", "Peter C Eklund, Committee Member", "Henry C Foley, Committee Member", "Gerald Dennis Mahan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phyllotaxis", "spin ice", "graphene", "nanotubes", "elasticity", "solitons", "rotons", "phonons"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Overlapping Aesthetic Perspectives as International, Revolutionary Space in Presentations from the German Revolution to the Spanish Civil War\n\n\n", "id": "7297", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4902", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In my dissertation, through an extensive analysis of canonical and non-canonical German and Spanish publications dealing with the German revolution and the years leading up to Spanish Civil War (1918-1936) and 1936-1939 respectively, I theorize an international concept of ideology, geography and time accessed through a metaphor of space(s).  I demonstrate a common aesthetic space in literature between Spanish newspaper coverage, articles and poetry in La Acci\u00f3n, La Jornada, El Pa\u00eds, and Solidaridad Obrera from 1918-1919 and that in German publications of Der Ziegelbrenner, Die Aktion, and Die neue Weltbuhne during the same period.  I show a distinct aesthetic and political development and parallel between German and Spanish theater such as Brecht\u2019s Trommeln in der Nacht (1919/23), Ernst Toller\u2019s Masse Mensch (1922), and Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca\u2019s Bodas de Sangre (1931) with later pieces as Toller\u2019s Hoppla (1927), Lorca\u2019s La casa de Bernarda Alba (1935/6), Max Aub\u2019s Pedro L\u00f3pez Garcia (1936), Rafael Alberti\u2019s De un momento a otro (1938/9), Ludwig Renn\u2019s Mein Maultier, meine Frau und meine Ziege (1938) and Brecht\u2019s Die Gewehre der Frau Carrar (1938).  The novel is also a form whose development I expose from an historical novel in Ramon Sender\u2019s Mr. Witt en el Cant\u00f3n (1935), to Alfred Doeblin\u2019s montage historical novel November 1918 (1937-1955) and finally Joan Llarch\u2019s La muerte de Durruti (1973) and H.M. Enzensberger\u2019s novelesque collage Der kurze Sommer der Anarchie (1972).  A key to the aesthetic and political development and international parallel is a common presentation of geography (urban, rural, at the front), language, and identity as a revolutionary alternative to nationalism.  Exemplified in publications of \u201cDas Wort\u201d and \u201cEl Mono Azul,\u201d is a culmination of a \u2018re-definition\u2019 of commonness and foreignness, as opposed to nationalism, with a sharing of specific literary places and stories as well as sites of distribution, proliferation and audiences.  My dissertation is a significant contribution to the broad discussion of literature and revolution and is unique in its comprehensive discussion of the German revolution, its spatial application in understanding aesthetic production as revolutionary, and the depth of the German-Spanish discussion of Spanish Civil War presentations.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4879], "author_name_tesi": "Nissler, Paul Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Nissler", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Lisa Surwillo", "Greg Eghigian", "Bettina Mathias", "Thomas Oliver Beebee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Chair", "Lisa Surwillo, Committee Member", "Greg Eghigian, Committee Member", "Bettina Mathias, Committee Member", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["overlapping", "spanish civil war", "german revolution", "literary space"]}]
