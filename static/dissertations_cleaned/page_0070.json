By riding the tide of sensor and event processing technologies, the smart environment captures and processes information about its surroundings as well as its internal settings to support context awareness and intelligent inference. For example, in long term home health monitoring, automatic detection of activity and health status allows elders to receive continuous care at home, thus reducing health care costs, improving quality of life, and enabling independence. Moreover, one promising goal of smart spaces, \u201ccollecting and accessing information everywhere anytime\u201d, triggers the needs for efficient yet secured information sharing among smart spaces. In this dissertation, we explore new approaches to address challenges on processing high-level events and securing information sharing in the context of semantic spaces. \n\nWe first explore the event processing solutions in smart spaces. We propose an event processing framework, which includes two sub-processes: stream event processing and semantic event processing. Stream event processing extracts knowledge from sensor streams for each modality. We present a novel model to recognize motions of the objects attached with passive RFID tags. The model applies Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to accurately infer the motion sequence based on the relative variance in a time series of response rates. The model is augmented with an adaptive model, which can be used to dynamically adjust to the changing environment based on the change-point detection algorithm. Moreover, an online Viterbi algorithm is developed to get low output latency. \n\nThen, we turn our attention to inferring high-level semantic events based on the preliminary semantic events from stream event processing. We propose event ontology to enable semantic indexing and detecting of machine-processable events and exchanging event data among heterogeneous engines. Moreover, we develop an event processing framework driven by the event ontology, OntoCEP, to elaborate event composition and semantic reasoning, which apply event patterns and context reasoning rules into one coherent system. The event composition engine conducts detection of complex patterns of events based on the relationships such as causality, and timing relationships. The semantic reasoning engine integrates context knowledge from which more meaningful events are deduced. \n\nFinally, we investigate how to secure sharing of complex data objects among pervasive information systems. To address the challenges posed by heterogeneous data sources, complex objects and context dynamics, we propose an advanced authorization model that supports specifying and enforcing authorizations in flexible and efficient ways. The model employs semantic web technologies to conceptualize data and explicitly express the relationships among concepts and instances involved in information sharing. Authorizations can be specified at different levels of the predefined concept hierarchies and be propagated to lower-levels. A novel decision propagation model is proposed to enable fast evaluation and updating of concept-level access decisions. To resolve conflicts among policies, we model a policy set as a semilattice, upon which a binary operation is defined to adapt to various requirements. Moreover, enabled by ontology reasoning tools, a flexible specification approach of authorization, namely rule-based policy generation, is developed to encode context dynamics, making the authorization enforcement adaptive to contexts. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6976], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Zang ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Hsien Chu", "Chao Hsien Chu", "Sencun Zhu", "Dongwon Lee", "Jack C Hayya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Hsien Chu, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Hsien Chu, Committee Chair", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Dongwon Lee, Committee Member", "Jack C Hayya, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Event Processing", "Smart Spaces", "Access Control"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Effect of zinc chloride and PEG concentrations on the critical flux during tangential flow microfiltration of BSA precipitates", "id": "14510zzl5215", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14510", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is renewed interest in the possibility of using precipitation for initial capture of high value therapeutic proteins as part of an integrated continuous downstream process. These precipitates can be continuously washed using tangential flow filtration, with long term operation achieved by operating the membrane modules below the critical filtrate flux for fouling. Our hypothesis was that the critical flux for a suspension of precipitated protein was a function of the effective particle size of the precipitate, which could be controlled by the precipitation conditions. Experimental studies were performed to evaluate the critical flux using a flux-stepping procedure for model protein precipitates (bovine serum albumin) generated using a combination of a crosslinking agent (zinc chloride) and an excluded volume precipitant (polyethylene glycol). Data were obtained using 0.2 \u00b5m pore size hollow fiber polyethersulfone microfiltration membranes. The critical flux varied with shear rate to approximately the 1/3 power, consistent with predictions of the classical concentration polarization model. The critical flux increased significantly with increasing zinc chloride concentration, going from 60 L/m2/hr for a 2 mM ZnCl2 solution to 200 L/m2/hr for an 8 mM ZnCl2 solution. In contrast, the critical flux achieved a maximum value at an intermediate PEG concentration of around 6 weight percent at a fixed ZnCl2 concentration of 3.5 mM. Independent measurements of the effective size and viscosity of the protein precipitates were used to obtain additional understanding of the effects of ZnCl2 and PEG on the critical flux.

For example, spaceborne optical systems may be sensitive to optical contamination of their local environment by gases or condensate particles produced by the operation of attitude control system (ACS) jets. To simulate microscopic nucleation, which concerns the formation of clusters and collisions between clusters and monomers, a kinetic approach that may be applied to the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, is developed. The thesis research extends the previous condensation modeling performed in our research group in two important ways. First, we extend our study from the Lennard-Jones gas of argon to the study of non-Lennard Jones gases such as water. Second, we have initiated the modeling of heterogeneous condensation.\n\nTo model homogeneous condensation of small, polar molecules, such as water, accurate microscopic cluster models need to be developed. The molecular dynamics (MD) method is used to  develop a model of  water cluster sizes, cluster-monomer collisions, and sticking probabilities necessary for the study of water homogeneous condensation in a plume  expanding to low pressure, space conditions. The MD results are integrated into DSMC simulations of homogeneous condensation in free expansion water plumes and the simulated Rayleigh scattering intensities are compared with the Arnold Engineering Development Center (AEDC) experimental data.\n\nThe simulation results show that the nucleation rate is a key factor for accurately modeling condensation phenomenon. We use MD simulations of a free expansion to explore the microscopic mechanisms of water dimer formation and develop collision models required by DSMC. The bimolecular dimer cluster formation mechanism was found to be the main mechanism in expanding flows to vacuum. MD simulations between two water molecules were performed to predict the bimolecular dimer formation probability. The probabilities and post-collisional velocity and energy distributions were then integrated into DSMC simulations of a free expansion of an orifice condensation plume with different chamber stagnation temperatures and pressures. The terminal dimer mole fraction, similar to experiment, was found to decrease with chamber stagnation temperatures and increase linearly with chamber stagnation pressures, which is consistent with a bimolecular nucleation mechanism.\n\nA new heterogeneous condensation model, kinetic-based model of N2 molecules condensing on CO2 nuclei, was developed using MD techniques and was implemented in the DSMC simulation of an expanding heterogeneous condensation flow of a 5% CO2 and 95% N2 mixture experimentally studied at AEDC. Another nitrogen flow for the same expansion conditions was observed to not produce any clusters. It was found that incorporation of the heterogeneous condensation process of N2 molecules condensing on CO2 nuclei causes the average cluster size to increase from 10 (the homogeneous condensation result) to about 2,000. The predicted Rayleigh scattering intensity from the simulation results was found to agree well the AEDC experimental data.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6975], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Zheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah A Levin", "Deborah A Levin", "Barbara Jane Garrison", "David Bradley Spencer", "Sven G Bilen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah A Levin, Dissertation Advisor", "Deborah A Levin, Committee Chair", "Barbara Jane Garrison, Committee Member", "David Bradley Spencer, Committee Member", "Sven G Bilen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Kinetic Theory", "Condensation", "DSMC"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Joint Modeling Recurrent Events and a Terminal Event with Frailty-copula Models", "id": "15126zxl141", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15126", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A terminal event can stop a series of recurrent events, which commonly occurs in biomedical and clinical studies. In this situation, the non-informative censoring assumption could fail because of potential dependency between these two event processes, leading to invalid inference if we analyze recurrent events alone. The joint frailty model is one of the widely used approaches to jointly model these two processes by sharing the same frailty term. \n\nOne important assumption is that recurrent and terminal event processes are conditionally independent given the subject-level frailty; however, this could be violated when two processes also depends on time-varying covariates across recurrences. For example, time to death and time to stroke might both depend on the age of the patients. And when we do not include age in the survival models, the subject-level frailty cannot capture the change of the age across recurrences and lead to the violation of the conditional independence assumption. Furthermore, marginal correlation between two event processes based on traditional frailty modeling has no closed form solution for estimation. In order to fill these gaps, we propose a novel joint frailty-copula approach to model recurrent events and a terminal event with modest assumptions under Bayesian framework. Metropolis-Hastings within the Gibbs Sampler algorithm is used for parameter estimation. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the efficiency, robustness and predictive performance of our proposal. The simulation results show that compared with the joint frailty model, the bias and mean squared error(MSE) of the propose approach is smaller when the conditional independence assumption is violated.  We applied our method into a real example extracted from the MarketScan database to identify potential risk factors and study the association between recurrent strokes and all-cause mortality.\n\nAnother important assumption under the joint frailty model is that the correlation between the terminal event and the recurrent events is constant over time. This is an unrealistic assumption. For example, when we study myocardial infarctions, time to death might be more correlated with the last myocardial infarction compared with the earlier myocardial infarction. We propose a time-varying joint frailty-copula model to further relax this assumption. Under this model, the dynamic correlation between the terminal event and the recurrent event is modeled by a latent Gaussian AR(1) process. The simulation results show that compared with the joint frailty model and the joint frailty-copula model, the bias, SD, MSE and AB of the time-varying frailty copula model are the smallest. Then, we applied our method to analyze the CHS data to identify potential risk factors to myocardial infarction and stroke.\n\nIn summary, we propose two methods to jointly model recurrent events and a terminal event. Both methods outperform the traditional joint frailty model when the conditional independence assumption is violated. The time-varying joint frailty-copula model is more flexible, which allows the correlation between the recurrent event process and the terminal event process to change over time. One future topic is to jointly modeling biomarker, recurrent events and death time by the frailty-copula models. Other topics include extending the current model to a cure rate model and modeling multiple types of recurrent events.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16854], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Zheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "first_name_ssi": "Zheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biostatistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vernon Michael Chinchilli", "Ming Wang", "Runze Li", "Nasrollah Ghahramani", "Feng Yue"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Dissertation Advisor", "Ming Wang, Committee Chair", "Runze Li, Committee Member", "Nasrollah Ghahramani, Committee Member", "Feng Yue, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Joint Frailty-copula Models", "Bayesian Augmentation", "Recurrent Events", "Joint Frailty Model"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Greedy Algorithm for approximating maximum induced matching", "id": "22793", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10404", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An induced matching in a graph G=(V,E) is $M\\subseteq E$ such that it is a\nmatching and also the edge set of an induced subgraph G(U).

The occurrence of critical heat flux prompts an abrupt increase in the wall temperature which is further responsible for a physical burnout of the heated surface. IAFB conditions are usually not present during normal operations in nuclear reactors, but can be encountered in case of an accident following a loss of coolant. Experiments for measuring IAFB are not easy in conventional heat flux controlled systems and as a result different models and experiments need to be conducted. As a part of this thesis, different methods have been discussed for the purpose of conducting experiments.\n\nThe data has been collected from 10 experiments involving reflood heat transfer performed in The Pennsylvania State University/U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Rod Bundle Heat Transfer (RBHT) Test Facility. Measurements were taken for heater rod temperatures, bundle power, upper plenum pressure, inlet flow rate and inlet subcooling, superheated vapor temperatures in the bundle, liquid carryover, spacer grid temperatures and axial bundle pressure drop. The results obtained from the reflood data were used as a basis for developing and accessing the model.  \n\nMany theoretical and experimental models have been developed for IAFB, as many heat transfer coefficient correlations have been proposed to predict the experimental data.

experimental value,\ndespite the much shorter chains and faster cooling rates of simulations versus experiments,\nbecause these two effects tend to cancel each other.\nWhen we correct for these effects, the predicted $T_g$\nis within 5K of the experimental value.\nWe found that the carbonyl groups at the polymer/water interface\norient significantly toward the water phase.\nWe calculated the copolymer/water and the copolymer/vacuum interfacial tensions,\nand predict a contact angle for water on copolymer of $77^\\circ$,\nconsistent with experimental values.\n\nInformed by extensive characterization of particle synthesis and surface properties,\nwe investigate the electrostatic properties of the interface in Chapter \\ref{chapter4}, \nwhich is crucial to particle stabilization.

which the balance is important to paint formulation. \nWe investigate how the potential of mean force and binding free energy\ndepend on the amount of SDS adsorbed, solution ionic strength,\nand presence of other charged groups on the particle surface.\nWe show that the potential of mean force for SDS is a sum of two independent terms,\nfrom the hydrophobic surfactant tail and charged headgroup:\ndragging the surfactant tail into solution \ncontributes a linear potential of about $kT$ per CH${}_2$ group,\nwhile the headgroup is repelled by like charges on the surface\nwith a potential of about the zeta potential.\nFor surfaces charged by hairs, \nSDS binds more or less strongly\ndepending on the local environment because of \nthe heterogeneity of the surface

The application of two key techniques, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have made it possible to extract gas economically from shale. Despite this, field production data show a rapid decline in gas flow rate after a few years of production. This drawback has focused attention on methods to enhance shale gas recovery (ESGR). In this work, we develop dual-porosity, dual-permeability finite element models to simulate multicomponent gas flow in porous media coupled with shale deformation and sorption behavior. We use this to explore the injection of pure CO2, pure N2, and mixtures of CO2 and N2 for enhanced recovery of shale gas. This behavior necessarily includes the evolution sorption-induced strain by competitive adsorption and its influence on permeability of matrix and fractures to ultimately define cumulative production history of CH4. This also defines the pattern of stranded CH4 concentration within the matrix after production under different injection conditions. It is shown that CO2 and N2 can each enhance shale gas recovery, but as a result of different mechanisms. Injected CO2 has a higher affinity than CH4 and thereby desorbs CH4; this technique can increase shale gas recovery by ~20%.  Injection of N2 works as an ESGR because N2 lowers the partial pressure of CH4 in shale and thereby desorbs shale gas from the matrix for the lower absorbability of N2 with respect to CH4, which will enlarge fractures as well as shrinking the matrix; this method can increase shale gas recovery by ~80%. Injected mixtures of CO2 and N2 will result in shale gas recovery of between the end-member magnitudes 20% to 80% (injection of CO2 to injection of N2). Injected mixtures with a higher N2: CO2 ratio result in a greater recovery of shale gas.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13646], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Ziyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ziyan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Shimin Liu", "John Yilin Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth, Thesis Advisor", "Shimin Liu, Committee Member", "John Yilin Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["enhance shale gas recovery"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "coordinated transport of a slung load by a team of autonomous rotorcraft", "id": "23507", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10635", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research is motivated by the significant economical efficiency of multilift system for carrying a single heavy payload, which includes both military and commercial cargo. \n\nThis thesis seeks to develop a solution for the more general problem of multilft that uses two or more autonomous rotorcraft to transport a single payload.

Top-level is the payload trajectory following controller, which is a closed-loop controller computes net force and moment on the load's center of gravity so a desired trajectory is followed. Mid-level is the cable force control, which computes cable force at each attachment point so that the net force and moment on the CG equal to the desired value from the trajectory following controller.

A two-step cable force computation is developed: first, solve the least-norm solution to satisfy the desired net force and moment required for payload to follow its trajectory; second, compute null space of cable force to ensure other constraints (such as vehicle separation and cable force constraint) are met. Condition number is used to select the location of attachment points so that any error in the cable force will have minimum effect on the payload.

Two gear component materials were chosen as substrates, carburized AISI 8620 steel (8620 steel) and Inconel 718\u00ae with a chromium electroplated surface. The experimental material included AISI stainless steel 431 (SS 431) as the matrix and titanium carbide (TiC) particle as the reinforcement material. The directed laser deposition process was used to deposit the composite material onto the substrate. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and a particle size analyzer were used to characterize selected powders used during the laser deposition experiment. Deposited materials were evaluated by microstructural analysis, Vickers micro hardness testing, and EDS-mapping for examining the dissolution reaction of the reinforcement particles within the SS 431 matrix. Performance testing of the laser deposited composite material was also conducted and included rolling contact fatigue testing and tribological analysis. Vickers hardness testing indicated that the hardness of the SS 431/20 wt% TiC deposited on the 8620 steel matched the hardness of the carburized 8620 steel. Micro hardness of the deposited materials was found to be 750 in the Vickers scale. SEM images showed that some of the TiC particles dissolved and the Ti and C were reprecipitated in the SS 431 matrix. The higher carbon within the matrix material enhanced the overall hardness of the laser deposit. Chemical analysis by EDS further supported this finding. The TiC particles were dissolved into small unstable dendrite around the surface of the TiC particle. The dissolved TiC phase that surrounded the original TiC particle formed a secondary phase in the matrix alloy by reprecipitation during cooling. Rolling contact fatigue tests indicated that the composite deposit exhibited slightly greater wear, due to hard particle expulsion, that resulted in lower rolling contact fatigue life when compared to the 8620 steel that had been carburized.

Interventions or adjustments need to be performed to bring the\nprocess back to a desired or target performance. For many years, statistical techniques have\nbeen used in industry for this purpose, mainly to monitor and analyze process variation and\nmaintain process consistency hence leading to better product quality. In the last decade,\nadvancements in computer power and statistical methodology have taken place that can help\nmanufacturers in facing new challenges with respect to product quality. In this dissertation,\nsome recently developed Bayesian statistical methodologies are introduced for the \u00afrst time\nin the process control \u00afeld. The goal is to control or adjust a manufacturing process in order\nto improve the quality of the manufactured products.\nTraditional statistical process adjustment methods used in manufacturing are based on\nthe assumption that system parameters (e.g., the di\u00aeerent variance components that make\nup the total variability of the measurements) are known. In practice, it is necessary to\nestimate these parameters before a statistical process adjustment policy can be put into\nplace. If the sample size of the data used to get estimates is limited, parameter estimates\ncan be subject to substantial sampling error. Alternatively, biased estimates may also be\nobtained if the conditions are di\u00aeerent between previous runs and the conditions over which the process will operate. This can lead to a poor performance of the adjustment method if\nthe assumption of known parameters is made.\nThis research is focused on developing adjustment rules under unknown parameters for\ndi\u00aeerent process models and cost structures. The process models under study can all be\ncharacterized as univariate linear gaussian models. The process can be described by lin-\near equations containing additive error terms that follow a normal distribution. The vari-\nances of these terms are assumed unknown. Such mathematical models are very useful in\nmany discrete-part manufacturing industries, from metal-cutting to nano-scale manufactur-\ning. The costs considered in this research include symmetric and asymmetric o?target costs\nand \u00afxed adjustment costs. These di\u00aeerent process models and cost structures have been\nstudied in the literature on process adjustment under known parameters. The importance\nof considering unknown parameters has not been fully recognized and the related problems\nhave not been studied.\nIn this dissertation, the mathematical derivation of the proposed adjustment methods is\nbased on Bayesian statistics, an important branch of Statistics that has received renewed\ninterest in recent years. The Bayesian approach is carried out through two computational\ntechniques, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and Sequential Monte Carlo\n(SMC) methods.\nThis research provides fundamental new results in the area of statistical process control,\nwhich are likely to impact the practice of this \u00afeld.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6989], "author_name_tesi": "Lian, Zilong ", "last_name_ssi": "Lian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zilong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Enrique Del Castillo", "M Jeya Chandra", "Natarajan Gautam", "Duncan Fong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Enrique Del Castillo, Committee Chair", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member", "Duncan Fong, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Statistical Process Control", "Bayesian Statistics", "Markov Chain Monte Carlo", "Sequential Monte Carlo"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Approximate solution to second order parabolic equations, with application to financial modeling", "id": "22656", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10293", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, we consider second order parabolic equations with variable coefficients.

In the past few decades, biomolecular sensors have undergone several generations of development with the advances in biology, chemistry, and fabrication technology. Present-day biomolecular sensors often comprise Micro-Total Analysis Systems ( TAS) with minimization, integration, and intelligence. The final goal is to realize a Lab-on-a-Chip system which integrates fluid control, biomolecule detection, and processing in one single chip. Currently, most of the developed and utilized biomolecular sensors are based on a variety of technologies such as fluorescence probe detection, surface plasmon resonance detection (SPR), ion sensitive field effect transistor detection (ISFET), light addressable potentiometric sensor detection (LAPS), surface acoustic wave detection (SAW), and quartz crystal microbalance detection (QCM), etc.\nFrom the point of view of ease of data acquisition and of simplicity of system integration, the final goal of Lab-on-a-Chip biomolecule sensing seems best achieved by using a direct electrical detection method in future biomolecular sensors. Direct electrical detection methods are advantageous in that no signal conversion is required and, more importantly, because their integration with a fluidic control system is relatively straightforward. Capacitive electrical detection schemes are particularly easily integrated.\nIn this dissertation, a sub-50 nm capacitor sensing structure integrated with micro- and nano-fluidic flow control component has been constructed. It is based on a full analysis, design, and fabrication approach, which addresses noise, sensitivity, and integration issues. This device is composed of an integrated microfluidic flow control channel in PDMS and a nanofluidic channel in silicon oxide feeding a nano-gap capacitor sensing structure with gold electrodes. Our integrated analytical system is also capable of selectivity. This can be realized by the immobilization of specific probe and target molecules on the gold electrode surfaces.\nThe molecule detection capability is based on the electrical capacitance change upon probe and target molecule binding on the gold electrode surfaces (spaced 50 nm) in the nano-gap sensing structure. A result of our nano-gap capacitor sensing structure design and optimization analysis is our being able to reduce background noise from the electrical double layers by using the sub-50 nm gap sensing structure to overlap the electrical double layers. This results in the capacitance from the diffuse layers to increase dramatically, therefore, increase the system sensitivity to capacitance component due to probe and target molecule binding.\nThe possibility of excellent fluidic flow control through the nano-gap sensing structure for active molecule flow and exchange is accomplished by using a unique integrated nanofluidic flow control component, which consists of the microfluidic flow control channel in PDMS connected with the nanofluidic channel in parallel. This parallel flow control (PFC) configuration uses flow in the microfluidic channel to set up the pressure gradient across the nanofluidic channel. This configuration also facilitates the interfacing between nanofluidic systems and external macro fluidic systems.\nWe also provide a demonstration of the biomolecule sensing capabilities of our analytical systems. Probe molecules (cysteamine) are first self-assembled on the gold electrodes, and target molecules (quantum dots with carboxyl groups) then are bonded with the probe molecules. Both of binding occurrences are detected by measuring the capacitance change. We are able to detect about 15% capacitance changes with the amino-carboxyl binding occurrence. Optical fluorescence spectra are also obtained to verify that the quantum dots used in this demonstration actually do attach and cause the corresponding capacitance change. This successful electrical detection of the common amino-carboxyl binding process shows the potential detection applications of our systems for other biomolecules.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2387], "author_name_tesi": "Liang, Huinan ", "last_name_ssi": "Liang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huinan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash", "Osama O Awadelkarim", "Digby D Macdonald", "Jian Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash, Committee Chair", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member", "Digby D Macdonald, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanofluidics", "Nano-gap", "Biomolecular sensor", "Label-free"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Development of a Multihazard Resistant Panelized Brick Veneer Wall System", "id": "7162", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3193", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new type of prefabricated and panelized brick veneer on steel framework backup exterior wall system was developed that can be designed for multi-hazard resistance.

By investigating the impacts of entrepreneurship and industrial structure on the development and future pathways of a local economy, I seek to reveal details about the mechanisms of regional economic development and resilience from an evolutionary perspective.\nThe first two essays are about regional resilience against trade shocks. Different from previous literature in this area, these two articles study economic resilience from a new perspective of evolutionary economic geography, which emphasizes the ability to reconfigure economic structure and develop new growth pathways. The first essay proposes several mechanisms through which entrepreneurs can help to mitigate adverse trade shocks. Empirical results confirm that the adverse marginal impacts of trade shocks on job losses are dampened in regions with higher self-employment rates. The second essay studies how a regional economy converts the adverse impacts of import competition into a stimulus for developing new growth pathways. It is found that regions experiencing greater import competition are more likely to attract new industry entrants, which in turn may offer new growth opportunities and counteract the direct losses from trade shocks. \nThe third essay uses data on U.S. Commuting zones to investigate the heterogeneous impacts of industrial variety on the development of different sectors. The results suggest that industrial variety has a greater contribution to employment growth in two types of sectors: manufacturing industries that are technologically intensive, and geographically-agglomerated industries. This suggests the roles of industrial variety in contributing to growth are principally sector-based, and significantly depend on region-industry specific conditions.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11758], "author_name_tesi": "Liang, Jiaochen ", "last_name_ssi": "Liang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiaochen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephan J Goetz", "David Gerard Abler", "Spiro E Stefanou", "Johannes Wolfgang Fedderke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephan J Goetz, Dissertation Advisor", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Member", "Johannes Wolfgang Fedderke, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Entrepreneurship", "Economic resilience", "Related variety", "Evolutionary economic geography", "Trade shocks"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Hybrid magnetic/semiconductor nanowires: synthesis and characterization", "id": "16140", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8087", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hybrid magnetic/semiconductor structures are of current interest for their potential in spintronic applications. Within this context, hybrid structures in the nanowire geometry are novel candidates for room temperature spintronic devices with integrated ferromagnetic wrap-around contacts. Progress towards spin injection in quasi-one-dimensional channel provides a strong motivation for my work on hybrid ferromagnetic/semiconductor nanowires. \n\nThis thesis covers the growth, structural characterization and magnetotransport behavior of single GaAs/MnAs core/shell nanowires. First, an introductory chapter will be presented with the purpose of motivating my work and presenting highlights of past work in the field. This is followed by an overview of the techniques that were used in my experiments. Then, in the following chapters, I discuss the experiments we carried out. \n\nThe first set of experiments investigated the catalyst-free growth of GaAs nanowires and structural characterization of single nanowires. GaAs nanowires were grown using the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique. Detailed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis showed that GaAs nanowires are mostly in zinc-blende (ZB) phase, with segments of wurtzite (WZ) phases. Growth direction was identified as the [111] direction. Nanowires have six facets belonging to 110 family. Raman spectroscopy confirmed the coexistence of two phases. Qualitative analysis was given on the shifts of TO and LO modes corresponding to both phases. \n\nThe second set of experiments focused on synthesis and structural characterization of GaAs/MnAs core/shell nanowires using catalyst-free MBE growth technique. In additional to structural characterizations, we used local chemical analysis such as electron energy loss spectroscopy to confirm the shell composition. Cross-sectional TEM samples were prepared using a focused ion beam (FIB) system. The epitaxial relationship between the GaAs core and the MnAs shell was identified for both ZB and WZ GaAs cores. We obtained the MnAs easy axis orientations from the crystal orientations on both ZB and WZ GaAs cores. This is critical for understanding the magnetization dynamics in the ferromagnetic MnAs shell. \n\nIn the last set of experiments, we investigated the transport properties of single GaAs/MnAs core/shell nanowires. Four-probe measurements were carried out on nanowires with FIB-deposited Pt contacts. We studied nanowire resistance as a function of temperature (1 K - 350 K) and magnetic field (up to 140 kOe) along two orthogonal orientations. In the low field range, we observed anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR). Magpar micromagnetic simulations in combination with the AMR effect proved to be a useful tool for studying the magnetization reversal process in ferromagnetic MnAs nanoshells.

Furthermore, the study explored the relative contributions of each factor to student satisfaction.\n\nGiven the exploratory and descriptive purposes of this study, a cross-sectional survey research design was chosen for implementation. The population under study was older adults aged 55 and above registered as students at the National Open University of Taiwan (NOUT) in the Spring Semester 2005. Older adults affiliated with one of the identified six regional study centers (Taipei, Taipei [2], Taichung, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Hualien study center) were targeted as potential participants in this study. Motivation, as reflected in personal goals, was operationalized as the reason for older adult learners\u00a1\u00a6 participation in distance education. Motivation was measured using the Reasons for Participation Scale (Steele, 1984). The perceived learning environment at NOUT was measured using a modified Distance Education Learning Environment Survey (Walker, 2003b). The survey was distributed to a sample of 990 older students; 371 completed it (Mean age = 61).\nStudy results revealed four major motivation constructs that attracted older adults to NOUT, namely, keeping up and fulfillment, intellectual stimulation, escape and social contact, and adjustment. Several similarities and differences exist between this study and past research. First, the motivations for older adults\u00a1\u00a6 participation in educational programs may be interpersonal and intrapersonal, expressive and instrumental in nature.\n\nSecond, in discovering the primary motivation\u00a1Xintellectual stimulation, this study confirmed the literature (Boshier & Riddle, 1978; Bynum & Seaman, 1993; Furst & Steele, 1986; Kim & Merriam, 2004; Lamb & Brady, 2005; Scala, 1996; Swindell, 2002; Swindell & Vassella, 1999) that cognitive-related motivation is the strongest reason for older adults\u00a1\u00a6 participation in educational activities. Third, it is also noteworthy that the social interaction component of a program may not be as appealing to older adults who choose distance learning over the face-to-face learning environment. Furthermore, the absence of degree-seeking motivation add further support to the belief that expressive reasons may be more important than instrumental reasons for learning in later life.\n\nThe overall findings confirmed the assumption that the motivational dispositions an individual adopts are very sensitive to context and are influenced by how the individual perceives the environment (Ames, 1992; Ford, 1992). The learning environment at NOUT was perceived in terms of instructor support, student interaction and collaboration, and personal relevance. The factor of personal relevance appeared to be the most important predictor in explaining all four motivation constructs, and was the strongest predictor in explaining student satisfaction, followed by the factor of instructor support. It is the perceived distance education learning environment, rather than motivation dispositions and socio-demographic characteristics, which are a more powerful predictor of learning outcome. In other words, when older adult learners perceived a supportive climate within their learning environment and were able to relate the subject matter of the class to their personal lives, they tended to be more satisfied with the distance education provided by NOUT.

The results suggest that drift occurs when investors overreact to their private information, which is consistent with a common implication of two models (Daniel et al. (1998); Fischer, (2001)).  The results also indicate that drift can be attributed to investors' underreaction to more reliable earnings announcements, which is consistent with experimental studies in psychology (Griffin and Tversky (1992)) and accounting (Bloomfield et al.

The 80 fs time resolution of FLUPS provides accurate results for the fast dynamics and the long time window (20 ns) of TCSPC enables observation of the slow portion of the dynamics.  These complete solvation response functions are compared to the solvation dynamics predicted by a simple dielectric continuum model.  This dielectric continuum model works well in conventional solvents. However, the dynamics predicted in most ionic liquids are systematically faster than those observed, on average by a factor of 3\u20135.  \nTo bridge the knowledge gap between neat ILs and conventional solvents, the solvation dynamics of C153 in the mixture of a simple ionic liquid [Im41][BF4] and the prototypical dipolar solvent acetonitrile has been studied. This mixture was chosen because it is expected to exhibit the simplest behavior without much preferential solvation is not expected to complicate interpretation due to the similar \u2018polarity\u2019 of acetonitrile and [Im41][BF4].  The solvation energies of C153 in this mixture were determined and the complete solvation dynamics of C153 were measured and compared to simple dielectric continuum predictions.  In addition, the rotational dynamics of C153 in the mixtures of [Im41][BF4] and acetonitrile were studied. The rotation times <\uf074rot> of C153 vary with viscosity \uf068 in the manner <\uf074rot> \uf068p with p= 0.9.  \nSteady-state and picosecond time-resolved emission spectroscopy are used to monitor the bimolecular electron transfer reaction between the electron acceptor 9,10-dicyanoanthracene in its S1 state and the donor N,N-dimethylaniline in a variety of ionic liquids and several conventional solvents. Detailed study of this quenching reaction was undertaken in order to better understand why rates reported for similar diffusion-limited reactions in ionic liquids sometimes appear much higher than expected given the viscous nature of these liquids. Consistent with previous studies, Stern-Volmer analyses of steady-state and lifetime data provide effective quenching rate constants kq, which are often 10 to100-fold larger than simple predictions for diffusion-limited rate constants kD in ionic liquids. Similar departures from kD are also observed in conventional organic solvents having comparably high viscosities, indicating that this behavior is not unique to ionic liquids. A more complete analysis of the quenching data using a model combining approximate solution of the spherically symmetric diffusion equation with a Marcus-type description of electron transfer reveals the reasons for frequent observation of kq \uf03e\uf03e kD. The primary cause is that the high viscosities typical of ionic liquids emphasize the transient component of diffusion-limited reactions, which renders the interpretation of rate constants derived from Stern-Volmer analyses ambiguous. Using a more appropriate description of the quenching process enables satisfactory fits of data in both ionic liquid and conventional solvents using a single set of physically reasonable electron transfer parameters. Doing so requires diffusion coefficients in ionic liquids to exceed hydrodynamic predictions by significant factors, typically in the range of 3-10. Direct NMR measurements of solute diffusion confirm this enhanced diffusion in ionic liquids.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7367], "author_name_tesi": "Liang, Min ", "last_name_ssi": "Liang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Maroncelli", "Mark Maroncelli", "James Bernhard Anderson", "John B Asbury", "John H Golbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Maroncelli, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Chair", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Solvation dynamics", "ionic liquids", "bimolecular electron transfer"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "PONTINE AND THALAMIC INFLUENCE ON SUCROSE AND CORN OIL REWARD\n", "id": "9863", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4798", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Brain reward systems are fundamental for survival, reproduction, and fitness. Investigating the neural circuits of reward is critical for understanding how the brain organizes behavior as a function of experience. Oral food stimuli such as sugars and fats provide good probes to study reward because they are basic constituents of food that are rewarding to both humans and rodents. Although both orosensory stimuli are highly preferred, much less is known about how those rewarding effects are elaborated in the brain. Sensory detection of sucrose depends on the gustatory system. The sensory systems needed for detecting oil in the mouth have not been determined, but probably involve the olfactory, gustatory, and trigeminal somatosensory systems. The assumption in this dissertation is that coding of sucrose and corn oil depends on the gustatory and the intraoral trigeminal system, respectively. Previous dialysis studies demonstrated that dopamine (DA) overflow in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) increases during sham intake of sucrose solutions. The first objective was to examine whether sham feeding corn oil produces similar DA efflux in the NAc. It does and thus supports the hypothesis that the sensory activities from different orosensory stimuli are transmitted to the forebrain structures linked to reward. Based on the anatomical differences between the central gustatory and the intraoral trigeminal systems, it was hypothesized that the gustatory parabrahchial nucleus (PBN) is important in transmitting sucrose, but not corn oil reward. Conversely, the thalamic orosensory area (TOA) was involved in the processing of corn oil, but not sucrose reward. This hypothesis was tested in rats with PBN or TOA lesions using three reward-related behavioral tasks. Because orosensory reward was of interest, all the studies were designed using sham feeding. The first study tested whether rats can switch the hedonic value of an oral stimulus from positive to negative after conditioned taste aversion learning. The second study determined whether rats could measure the apparent reward strength of sucrose and corn oil after PBN or TOA lesions. Finally, an anticipatory contrast paradigm was used to assess whether lesions of the PBN and the TOA eliminate reward comparison for sucrose and corn oil, respectively. The results of these studies reveal that the PBN is important for processing not only sucrose but also corn oil rewards. On the other hand, an intact TOA is not necessary for either sucrose or corn oil rewards. Therefore, the original hypothesis that sucrose reward depends on the PBN and oil reward on the TOA requires revision. Given that brainstem gustatory relays receive projections from the intraoral trigeminal system, one alternative neural mechanism for corn oil reward is that the PBN processes both gustatory and trigeminal orosensory activity. Furthermore, this research has eliminated the classical thalamocortical sensory system as a likely candidate for transmitting the sensory neural activity generated by oral food stimuli to the central reward systems. This then points toward more direct projections from brainstem sensory relays to the limbic forebrain as exemplified by parabrachial nuclei.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4775], "author_name_tesi": "Liang, Nu-Chu ", "last_name_ssi": "Liang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nu-Chu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ralph Norgren", "Ralph Norgren", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy", "Kevin Douglas Alloway", "Andras Hajnal", "Chester A Ray"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ralph Norgren, Dissertation Advisor", "Ralph Norgren, Committee Chair", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy, Committee Member", "Kevin Douglas Alloway, Committee Member", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member", "Chester A Ray, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["trigeminal system", "thalamic orosensory area", "parabrachial nucleus", "sham feeding", "reward", "gustatory system"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Electronic Transport in Functionalized Graphene: from Strong Chemisorption to Weakly Bonded Adsorbates", "id": "27557", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12219", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Graphene is a new two-dimensional material that has many interesting properties due to its low energy excitations which behave as Dirac fermions.

This is due, in part, to a lack of therapeutic approaches designed to inhibit melanoma metastasis to the lung. Cancer metastasis requires that tumor cells detach from a primary site and invade the surrounding stroma, survive immune defenses and turbulence of the blood circulation after intravasating into the circulatory system, extravasate through the endothelial lining of blood vessels and finally form a new colony in the surrounding tissue. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of cancer metastasis holds the promise to design effective interventions for metastatic cancer. The goal of this study is to investigate mechanisms involved in an important step in the metastatic process \u00a8C the interactions of melanoma cells with leukocytes within the tumor microenvironment that results in tumor cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium (EC) and subsequent extravasation in the microcirculation.\n\nPolymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) can facilitate melanoma cell adhesion to the EC\nthrough the binding of \u00a6\u00c22 integrins on PMNs and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on\nmelanoma cells as well as on the EC. This process is regulated by the hydrodynamic shear rate, which is inversely proportional to the convection-driven cell-cell contact time (or adhesion on-rate kinetics), rather than by the shear stress, which is proportional to the force exerted on formed bonds (or adhesion off-rate kinetics). This shear-rate-dependence may be ascribed to two possible mechanisms which have been shown all to be affected by shear rate: first, heterotypic aggregation between melanoma cells and PMNs, a critical step for PMN-facilitated melanoma adhesion to the EC; second, the up-regulation of \u00a6\u00c22 integrins on PMNs in response to chemokines endogenously-produced within the tumor microenvironment.\n\nMolecular mechanisms involved in initiating the communications between melanoma cells,\nPMNs, and the ECs could be responsible for melanoma adhesion and extravasation, especially\nthose involving inflammatory cytokine communications under microcirculatory flow conditions.\n\nResults of studies have indicated that melanoma cells induce PMNs to secrete inflammatory IL-8\nthrough activation of NF-\u00a6\u00caB. Melanoma-derived IL-8 is also required, as a primary factor among\nmany other tumor-released factors, for induction of endogenous IL-8 in PMNs. PMN-derived\nchemokines in response to melanoma cells can act through autocrine and/or paracrine\nmechanisms to enhance PMN inflammatory activities.The functional significance of IL-8, through the CXC chemokine receptors 1 and 2 (CXCR1 and CXCR2) on PMNs, is that it facilitates the ability of PMNs to enhance melanoma cells to form shear-resisted arrest on the EC and subsequent extravasation within the circulation. A potential role of B-Raf, the gene that is mutated at the highest frequency in malignant melanomas has also been studied. Results have indicated that targeting mutant V600EB-Raf reduces melanoma metastasis through reductions in active melanoma cell extravasation through the EC. Mechanistically, reduced melanoma\nextravasation following inhibition of mutant V600EB-Raf is due to the disruption of downstream\nNF-\u00a6\u00caB signaling that regulates the constitutive IL-8 production and ICAM-1 expression, which\nare essential for PMN-facilitated melanoma extravasation under flow conditions.\n\nIdentification and characterization of molecular targets related to inflammation and cancer\nremain a high priority in cancer research. Results from this study provide new evidence for the complex roles of hydrodynamic forces, inflammatory factors such as chemokines within the tumor microenvironment, PMN-melanoma adhesion and oncogenes in the recruitment of metastatic cancer cells to the EC, which provide insights for the development of experimental\ntherapeutic approaches to prevent melanoma metastasis.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6070], "author_name_tesi": "Liang, Shile ", "last_name_ssi": "Liang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shile", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheng Dong", "Avery August", "Peter J Butler", "Andrea Marie Mastro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheng Dong, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["B-Raf", "integrins", "Inflammation", "Cancer Metastasis", "IL-8", "chemokine"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "SIMULATING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, WILDFIRE AND FUEL TREATMENT ON SIERRA NEVADA FORESTS", "id": "13698sul248", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13698", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sierra Nevada forests represent a major ecological and economic resource for the state of California.

Given the diverse tree species and forest types that differ in their optimal climate for growth and tolerance of stressors, I simulated forest dynamics in the Sierra Nevada under projected future climate and area burned as well as alternative management strategies with a species-specific, spatially explicit forest landscape model. First, I quantified how projected climate-wildfire interactions would affect forest communities and associated C dynamics. Here, results suggest that, across the Sierra Nevada, forest communities may not change as intact unit over the 21st Century and potential exists for substantial community change and C sequestration decline beyond this century. Then, I assessed the long-term successional trajectory and the ability of the system to sequester C beyond the 21st Century.

B1 ion content variations show maximum 25 \u00baC conductivity at 8mol%, reflecting a tradeoff between carrier density and Tg increase.  Ethylene oxide spacers (B2) lower Tg, and increase dielectric constant, both raising conductivity.  Perfluorinating the four phenyl rings (B3) lowers the ion association energy, as anticipated by ab initio estimations.  This increases conductivity, a direct result of 3X higher measured carrier density.  The ~ 9 kJ/mol activation energy of simultaneously conducting ions is less than half that of ionomers with either sulfonate or bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide anions, suggesting that ionomers with weak-binding borate anions may provide a pathway to useful single-ion Li+ conductors, if their Tg can be lowered.\n    Then two groups of novel non-volatile plasticizers containing pendant cyclic carbonates and short ethylene oxide chains have been successfully synthesized, as confirmed by 1H and 29Si NMR spectra. After mixing with polysiloxane-based ionomer, the resulting polymer electrolyte blends show improved conductivity. At room temperature the d. c. conductivity has been improved to between 10-4 to 10-5 S/cm. Electrode polarization in dielectric relaxation spectroscopy reveals that part of the increased conductivity comes from lowering Tg, which raises the mobility of the conducting ions. The number density of simultaneously conducting ions is also boosted by the plasticizers, particularly for those containing more of the strongly solvating oligo-(ethylene oxide).\n     Polysiloxane phosphonium single-ion conductors with ion contents ranging from 5 to 22 mol% were synthesized via hydrosilylation reaction. The parent Br- anion was exchanged to F- or bis(trifuoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI-).  Results of X-ray scattering experiments suggest the absence of ion aggregation in our phosphonium ionomers, which keeps glass transition temperatures (Tg) low. DSC Tg of the phosphonium ionomers are all below -70 oC, suggesting a weak dependence of Tg on both ion content and ion type; while conductivities weakly increase with ion content but exhibit a strong dependence on anion type. The highest conductivity at 30 oC, (2 x 10-5 S/cm) was obtained for the TFSI anion and is attributed to its relatively delocalized negative charge and its large size, both weakening the interaction between TFSI and phosphonium cation. \n    The linear viscoelastic (LVE) properties of polysiloxane-based phosphonium-containing ionomers with ion contents f = 0 to 0.22 have been studied. The master curves of those ionomers have been constructed with reduced frequency spanning 14 decades. The ionic association has been witnessed as a delayed polymer relaxation with increasing ion content, although there is no ion aggregate peak in X-ray scattering and LVE suggests only limited ionic associations with no ion clusters in our phosphonium ionomers. All observations are consistent with weak interchain ionic interactions determined by bulky weak-binding phosphonium salts. Ionomer LVE can be well fit by the KWW model on short time scales and the sticky Rouse model on long time scales, which proves that the ion association lifetime in our ionomers is shorter than that of polymer chain relaxation, despite the fact that the chains are short.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8602], "author_name_tesi": "Liang, Siwei ", "last_name_ssi": "Liang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Siwei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby", "Ralph H Colby", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "James Patrick Runt", "Harry R Allcock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ralph H Colby, Dissertation Advisor", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Chair", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Harry R Allcock, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polyelectrolyte", "single-ion conductor", "ionomer", "lithium-ion battery", "phosphonium ionomer", "rheology of ionomer", "dielectric relaxation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "in situ TEM study on anode materials in lithium-ion batteries", "id": "19926", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9292", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The growing demand for light-weight, high-capacity lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) for portable electronics, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and stationary energy storage systems has led to intensive research on developing new electrode materials with higher energy density, higher power density, and longer lifetime. However, a major issue with the high-capacity materials such as silicon (Si) is the rapid, irreversible capacity decay and poor cyclability due to the lithiation/delithiation induced mechanical degradation. A fundamental understanding of coupled electro-chemo-mechanical effects on the lithiation/delithiation of anode materials in LIBs is critical important for the development of advanced LIBs.\nIn this thesis, we constructed solid cell and liquid cell nanobatteries inside high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) for electrochemical tests and mechanical degradation study of anode materials in LIBs. With this approach, in situ TEM electrochemical tests of crystalline Si nanowires (SiNWs), germanium nanoparticles (GeNPs), SiNPs, and \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanowires have been performed. Integrating in situ TEM study with multiscale modeling, the failure mechanisms of these anode materials are characterized. \nA set of interesting phenomena were discovered, ranging from ion and electron transport, electrochemical reactions, phase transformation, microstructural evolution, defect nucleation and growth, to chemo-mechanical failure inside battery materials. For SiNWs highly anisotropic swelling with huge volume expansion ~300% was observed upon first lithium insertion cycle. The highly anisotropic swelling was caused by the much faster lithiation rate along <110> directions than the other directions. The anisotropy of lithiation induced stress concentration at the adjacent {110} planes, causing the formation of cracks and size-dependent fracture. The high compression stress at the lithiation front also causes retardation of lithiation. \nA comparative study of electrochemical tests of GeNPs and SiNPs demonstrated that GeNPs exhibited tough lithiation/delithiation behavior without fracture in multiple cycles, in distinct contrast to the size-dependent fracture of crystalline SiNPs upon the first lithiation. GeNPs experienced large volume expansion similar to SiNPs, but showed isotropic lithiation behavior that differs to the highly anisotropic lithiation behavior of SiNPs. It turned out that lithiation anisotropy causes the non-uniform stress build-up in the hoop direction in lithiated SiNPs, leading to fracture in the well-defined planes. \nDuring lithiation/delithiation cycles gallium nanodroplets (GaNDs) underwent reversible liquid-to-solid and amorphous to crystalline phase transitions. During delithiation, void nucleation, growth, and annihilation were observed, exhibiting a self-healing behavior. A phase field modeling and theoretical analysis unraveled the void growth and annihilation mechanisms as well as the associated time laws. \n\u03b1-Fe2O3 as a typical transition metal oxide is potential anode candidate for next generation LIBs. Inside in situ TEM, the high spatial resolution observation of lithiation of \u03b1-Fe2O3 nanowires revealed the three-step lithiation process \u03b1-Fe2O3 -> \u03b1-LiFe2O3 -> cubic-Li2Fe2O3  -> BCC-Fe with FCC-Li2O. Our TEM results demonstrated the conversion reaction mechanism of lithiation in transition metal oxide electrodes. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9097], "author_name_tesi": "Liang, Wentao ", "last_name_ssi": "Liang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wentao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sulin Zhang", "Sulin Zhang", "Michael T Lanagan", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Barbara Shaw", "Donghai Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sulin Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Chair", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Barbara Shaw, Committee Member", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["in situ TEM", "lithium ion battery", "gallium nanodroplets", "nanovoid", "germanium nanoparticles", "fracture"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Functional characterization of a Puf protein family member in malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum", "id": "14109xzl112", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14109", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Regulation of gene expression is important to cellular growth and differentiation of eukaryotes, as it plays key roles in determining the eventual expression levels and cellular localizations of a large number of proteins. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) with conserved RNA-binding domains (RBDs) are key molecules in controlling gene expression. These conserved RBDs can specifically interact with target RNAs through specific sequences and structures to regulate mRNA stability, translation efficiency and subcellular localization. One of the well-studied RBPs is the Puf family RBPs. Members of the Puf family share a highly conserved Puf RBD, which typically consists of eight imperfect tandem repeats of ~36 amino acids (aa). Here I report the studies of two Puf members, PfPuf3 in Plasmodium falciparum and its ortholog PyPuf3 in Plasmodium yoelii. Both genes could not be disrupted, suggesting that they may be essential for the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC). A time-course study of both PfPuf3 mRNA and protein indicated that PfPuf3 was expressed during the entire IDC, with peak expression in early trophozoites. Cellular fractionation demonstrated that PfPuf3 preferentially partitioned to the nuclear than the cytoplasmic fractions. Interestingly, tagging of the endogenous of PfPuf3 and PyPuf3 with the green fluorescent protein showed that both proteins were limited to the nucleus, which is in contrast to the cytoplasmic localization of PfPuf1 and PfPuf2. Further, we found PfPuf3 co-localized with a well-known nucleolus maker PfNop1, demonstrating that PfPuf3 is a nucleolar protein. Using a parasite line with PfPuf3-tagged with PTP (ProtC-TEV-ProtA), we were able to affinity purify the PfPuf3 protein complex and the associated RNAs. Proteomic analysis of the PfPuf3 complex identified 32 proteins that are associated with the 60S ribosome subunit, suggesting that PfPuf3 might be involved in ribosomal biogenesis. RNA sequencing analysis of the purified PfPuf3 complex revealed significant enrichment of the 28S rRNA and ITS2 (internal transcribed spacer 2), implying that PfPuf3 may recognize and bind to these rRNA sequences.

The guided wave method yields good sensitivity to certain defects by optimally selecting different guided wave loading functions. However, actuators and receivers at some distance apart must be placed in different positions in order to get reasonable coverage in a field inspection, since only the defect close to the wave propagation path can be detected. Therefore, the testing process is not always efficient. In contrast, as a global monitoring method, the vibration-based technique can achieve much faster testing speeds. But this technique has very low sensitivity to small defects due to the low operating frequencies. Taking advantage of both the ultrasonic guided wave and vibration techniques, a novel SHM method ultrasonic vibration is developed in this thesis. Ultrasonic vibration is capable of achieving defect detection sensitivity almost as good as ultrasonic guided waves, while maintaining the efficiency of the traditional low frequency vibration by fixing the actuator location and using only a few receivers to cover the whole structure. In this new method, continuous guided wave energy will be impinged into the structure to make the structure vibrate steadily. The steady state vibration depends on the initial ultrasonic guided wave loading function, and the boundary conditions as well as the structural geometry.\nIt is observed that the steady state vibration can be achieved by employing long cycles of guided wave inputs, say 1500 cycles or so. The structural vibration response relates to the guided wave loading. In order to use ultrasonic vibration for defect detection, it is necessary to study the guided wave sensitivity for defect inspection. Guided wave detection for delaminations in composites is studied in a sample problem. The sample problem demonstrates the significance of selecting the right guided wave loading function in defect detection in order to achieve good results.\nIn ultrasonic vibration, before the structure reaches a steady state, there is a transition process, during which the wave energy is bouncing among the edges. The edge reflection of guided waves was also studied here based on the semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) method and the mode expansion technique. The mode conversions are solved quantitatively when a guided wave hits the boundary at an angle.\n The relation between steady state vibration and transient guided waves is revealed by the guided-wave-based vibration analysis on a 2-D plane strain model. Applying the partial wave technique, a full field solution was constructed, which includes all the guided wave modes traveling forward and backward. Among those guided wave modes, only a combination set satisfying the boundary conditions can exist in the structures. This set composed of guided waves with relative amplitudes and phases is identified as the natural vibration mode. The forced response of the structure is highly related to the excitation source. For vibration modes that are associated with certain guided wave modes, they have a high chance to be generated by exciting those guided wave modes. \nA phased annular array transducer was designed for mode and frequency selection of the guided waves. By applying different phase delays, the annular array transducer is able to excite any guided wave mode in the dispersion curve space. Therefore, the structural response can be easily controlled by the frequency and phase delay of the annular array transducer, providing a method of finding optimal points for inspection.\nBased on theoretical studies, an ultrasonic vibration testbed was developed. In the ultrasonic vibration experiments, an annual array transducer was used as the actuator. The loading functions were tuned by the frequencies and phase delays among the transducer elements. Experiments demonstrate that ultrasonic vibration has a good capability of detecting defects and boundary condition changes in a variety of different structures.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8036], "author_name_tesi": "Liang, Yue ", "last_name_ssi": "Liang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yue", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Qiming Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["guided waves", "ultrasonic vibration", "structural health monitoring", "phased array", "finite element methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Effectiveness of Infographics Layout in Information Searching and Scanning: An Eye Tracking Study", "id": "19090", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9149", "abstract_tesi": "The layout of information arrangement could affect the effectiveness of information searching and scanning.

Most virtual environments provide options for avatar customization. This means that a person can either create an avatar from an existing selection of body parts and apparel or design an even more personalized image. Second Life, the investigative site for this study, is a popular online virtual world that provides almost endless possibilities for avatar assembling to anyone with the vision, skills, and patience to realize them. The process of creating an avatar usually involves negotiating with identity and body image, as it is necessary to select the avatar\u2019s gender, race, body type, features, and clothing style. These elements are all identity markers in the physical world. Even when a person creates a non-human avatar, the avatar is still likely to reflect something about that person\u2019s identity choices. As people are increasingly spending significant amounts of time in online environments, avatars are becoming an important medium for communicating and understanding identity. Though learning about identity is generally considered a critical component of contemporary art education, studies that address the virtual body from the perspective of art-making, self-making, and knowledge-making are scant.  \n\nIn this study, I argue that the processes of creating and communicating through avatars constitute a means of learning about identity through art-making. I argue that avatars are a medium and that avatar-making is art-making defined on the basis of three theoretical frameworks: Allan Kaprow\u2019s Happenings, Joseph Beuys\u2019s idea of social sculpture, and Nicolas Bourriaud\u2019s theory of relational aesthetics. Moreover, avatars are a medium for creating art within the broader practice of Net art. In using the term \u201cavatar re/assembling,\u201d I refer to creating avatars through an art-making process that relates directly to the genre of assemblage. In connecting avatar creation to art-making, I not only emphasize the purposefulness, complexity, and creativity inhering in presenting an avatar, but also postulate avatar re/assembling from a critical position. \n\nFurther, I frame the knowledge-making and self-making experience of avatar re/assembling through Elizabeth Ellsworth\u2019s (2005) discussions of the anomalous place of learning and the learning self in the making. Using this framework of learning to understand avatar creation, I perceive avatar re/assembling as an experience of knowledge in the making and envision the self as emerging from the experience of avatar re/assembling. Moreover, I contend that we do not create avatars in order to grasp an \u201calready-made\u201d knowledge of identity and socio-cultural ideas of the body, although doing so might teach us these. Rather, we assemble avatars to create experience and gain knowledge of the learning self in the making\u2014a self that is constantly learning, transforming, and becoming. \n\nI ask: How do different kinds of avatar-making experiences tell stories about self-making? How does avatar creation constitute art-making? How are these experiences pedagogical? Using the avatar as a methodological device (specifically, I observe avatar culture and reflect on my own avatar creation experience), I draw on two qualitative research methodologies: participant observation and autoethnography. I have investigated the experiences of people new to avatar creation, of those who continually change their avatars\u2019 appearance and post photographs of the outcomes online, and of those whose avatars do not represent an idealized human form. Through fictional dialogues, I create performative texts that present my interpretations of the findings. I consider the fictional dialogues as offering knowledge (Denzin, 2005; Neilsen, 2002) and insights through which others can learn about avatar re/assembling and make connections to their own experiences.\n\nI found that most participants in my study saw themselves as engaging in a creative process whereby they were able to give aspects of themselves fuller expression than in the physical world. Even those new to avatar creation whose avatars tended to reveal the limits of their incipient technological knowledge focused on creating avatars that reflected their physical appearance in some way, whether literally or in an idealized version. In addition, from my interviews and observations, I found that the experienced participants considered avatar creation crucial to their ongoing negotiation of identity and body image, their avatar-assembling experiences constituting a mixed-reality existence in which their virtual and physical bodies work together to create a learning self. And, based on the participants\u2019 experiences in this regard, I was able to identify the knowledge-making and pedagogical moments inhering in avatar embodiment.\n \nTo translate these research findings, I suggest avatar pedagogy as an element of art education. In theoretical terms, such an incorporation would involve using avatar creation to provoke critical discussions about body image, identity, and technology. In practical terms, drawing from participants\u2019 experiences, I recommend processes that can be exercised and transformed in teaching in service of a meaningful and effective avatar pedagogy.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1035], "author_name_tesi": "Liao, Christine Ling-Yin", "last_name_ssi": "Liao", "middle_name_ssi": "Ling-Yin", "first_name_ssi": "Christine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Karen Keifer Boyd", "Karen Treat Keifer Boyd", "Patricia Marie Amburgy", "Charles Richard Garoian", "Bettina Mathes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Karen Keifer Boyd, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Treat Keifer Boyd, Committee Chair", "Patricia Marie Amburgy, Committee Member", "Charles Richard Garoian, Committee Member", "Bettina Mathes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pedagogy", "New Media", "Identity", "Virtual Worlds", "Avatar", "Virtual Body"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Rokhlin type theorems in operator algebras", "id": "29605", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12735", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The classical Rokhlin lemma in ergodic theory asserts that an ergodic measure preserving transformation on a non-atomic probability space can be approximated by shifts in a suitable sense.

Under mild market-thickness conditions, symmetric Nash equilibria coincide with price-taking equilibria. In the case of two goods, a price-taking equilibrium is a Walrasian equilibrium. In the case of multiple goods, a price-taking equilibrium is competitive, but subject to a cash-in-advance constraint.\n\nChapter 2 considers periodic, complete-participation trade in the Lagos-Rocheteau (Econometrica, 2009) Mode. Lagos-Rocheteau is part of the literature that applies a search model to asset trade in the over-the-counter market. The only friction in their model is a cost of agents getting into contact with other agents. Therefore, as an alternative to their investor-dealer random meetings, a centralized competitive market which occurs periodically is studied. This arrangement preserves the main tension in their paper: a tradeoff between a portfolio that maximizes current utility and one that is good on average. For calibrated versions of the model, it is shown that this market must occur only infrequently in order for investors to be as well off as they in the Lagos-Rocheteau setup.\n    \nIn Chapter 3, employment agents (called as em-agents) are introduced as a third type of agent in world of a labor market with search frictions. Each type of agent matches pairwise with the other two types through two independent matching processes. Each process depends on the ratio of the agent's own type to the other type in the match ( market tightness). Job matches can be formed directly between a worker and a firm, or indirectly through an em-agent. It is shown that there is a unique steady-state equilibrium in which em-agents are active. The presence of em-agents enhances the welfare of workers. More generally, the welfare of workers decreases as the outside option of em-agents or firms increases. When job matches are heterogeneous in productivity, jobs filled through em-agents have higher average productivity than ones done directly.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7738], "author_name_tesi": "Liao, Mouhua ", "last_name_ssi": "Liao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mouhua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil Wallace", "Neil Wallace", "Edward James Green", "James Schuyler Jordan", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neil Wallace, Dissertation Advisor", "Neil Wallace, Committee Chair", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "James Schuyler Jordan, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Market game", "Limit orders", "Nash equilibrium", "Walras equilibrium", "OTC market", "Periodic market", "Random search", "Middlemen"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "HETEROSCEDASTIC UNBALANCED NESTED DESIGNS AND FULLY NONPARAMETRIC ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE", "id": "9816", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5983", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Analysis of variance is a corner stone of statistical applications. The classical asymptotic results were built either under the normality and homoscedasticity assumptions,\nor on cases when the numbers of factor levels are all fixed. However, the past decade has witnessed the generation of large data sets which involve a multitude of factor levels while the number of replications per factor combination is very small. The asymptotic theory is considerably more complicated when testing against those high-dimensional alternatives.\n\nIn the first part of this thesis, we consider the problem of testing for the sub-class effect in the unbalanced two-fold nested models with a large number of sub-classes. It is shown that the classical F-statistic is very sensitive to departures from homoscedasticity, even in balanced designs. We propose new testing procedures to accommodate heteroscedasticity, and the asymptotic distributions of the proposed test statistics, both under the null and local alternative hypotheses, are established. Simulation studies examine the finite sample performance of the proposed statistics and the competing classical F-test. Two real data sets are analyzed and ramifications of these results to the hypothesis of no covariate effect in the analysis of covariance are discussed, which leads to a more sophisticated approach described in the second part of the thesis. Testing for the class effect is also investigated.\n\nIn the second part of this thesis, we introduce a new approach for testing the covariate effect in the context of the fully nonparametric ANCOVA model which capitalizes on the connection to the testing problems in nested designs. The basic idea behind the proposed method is to think of each distinct covariate value as a level of a sub-class nested in each group/class.

Despite its action on proteins is widely exploited, the molecular mechanism behind the action is still debatable. Protein stabilizers are proposed to stabilize protein through preferential exclusion from protein surface or by enhancing bulk water structuredness.\nIn the first part of the thesis, we studied the stabilizing effect of TMAO on elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs). The interactions between TMAO and ELPs are studied by measuring the depression of lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of ELP by TMAO and by measuring surface tensions of TMAO solutions. The experimental results indicate there is no measurable interaction between TMAO and ELPs. However, TMAO indeed slightly accumulates at the hydrophobic surface. In addition, the influence of TMAO on the hydrogen bonding network is investigated via infrared spectroscopy. TMAO affects hydrogen bonding strength mainly by the NO dipole that serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor. Nevertheless, such influence is short-ranged and cannot affect bulk water structuredness. Molecular dynamic simulation results demonstrate that TMAO directly contacts the surface of ELP; moreover, it decreases the tetrahedral ordering of water structure both in the bulk solution and at the ELP surface. Such results contradict the central tenants of contemporary theories for the means by which TMAO can lead to protein stabilization. Namely, TMAO\u2019s effects are clearly not due to exclusion from the protein surface or making of water structure. Instead, a new model is required that takes into account the fact that TMAO preferentially binds to the protein structures and stabilizes the collapsed state on entropic grounds. Curiously, these results stand in contrast to the mechanisms of actions of other osmolytes such as glycine, sarcosine, dimethyl glycine, and betaine, which all appear to favor protein stabilization via preferential exclusion mechanism.\nThe intracellular environment is very crowded, and up to 70% water in a cell is present at an interface. Therefore, it is of interest to study water structure in a confined geometry. In the second part of the thesis, the effect of TMAO on the interfacial water structure at the air/water interface is studied to gain further insights into the influence of TMAO on water structure at hydrophobic portions of protein surface. Previously, our lab discovered that TMAO adopts a side-on orientation (methyl group-down) at the air/water interface. This indicates the methyl groups of TMAO are more hydrophilic than previously thought. Further studies show TMAO reorients slowly at the air/water interface during the adsorption process. In the early stage of adsorption, because the surface concentration is low, TMAO is able to adopt a side-on orientation to hydrate both the methyl groups and the NO dipole at the water-sufficient surface. In the later stage of adsorption, because the surface pressure is high, TMAO needs to adopt a surfactant-like orientation (NO dipole-down) to keep NO dipole sufficiently hydrated at the water-deficient surface. In addition, the interfacial water structure is strongly enhanced when TMAO reorients from a side-on orientation to a surfactant-like orientation. This is because the well-organized vertically-orientated NO dipole of TMAO at the interface aligns water molecules underneath. This discovery indicates the effect of TMAO on the interfacial water structure is strongly orientation dependent. In addition, the adsorption of TMAO at the air/water interface is an activated-diffusion process with an energy barrier about 22.5 kcal/mole. The adsorption energy barrier may be due to the increase in the surface pressure and the molecular realignment. The future direction for the second subject is also proposed in the final chapter of the thesis.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11162], "author_name_tesi": "Liao, Yi-ting ", "last_name_ssi": "Liao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi-ting", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Cremer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Cremer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Trimethylamine N-oxide", "surface tension", "Sum frequency generation", "protein folding", "water"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Improving Constraints on Climate System Properties with Additional Data and New Methods", "id": "12580agl127", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12580", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Future climate change depends on properties of the climate system and the external\nforcing factors that drive the global energy budget. Among those properties are climate\nsensitivity, the rate that heat is mixed into the deep ocean, and the aerosol forcing on\nthe planet. In this dissertation, we use the newly updated Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology Earth System Model (MESM) to derive the joint probability distribution\nfunction (PDF) for model parameters that represent the aforementioned climate system\nproperties. Climate sensitivity (ECS) in the model is set through an adjustment to the\ncloud feedback parameter. The vertical diffusion coefficient, Kv, represents the mixing\nof heat into the deep ocean by all mixing processes. The net anthropogenic aerosol\nforcing parameter, Faer, estimates the contribution of aerosol cooling to the global energy\nbudget. Using an 1800-member ensemble of MESM runs where the model parameters\nhave been systematically varied, we derive PDFs for the model parameters by comparing\nthe model output against historical observations of surface temperature and global mean\nocean heat content. In particular, we answer four main research questions: (1) How are\nthe parameter PDFs derived using the MESM ensemble different from those using a\nprevious version of the model?, (2) How do the estimates change when recent surface\ntemperature and ocean heat content observations are included in the model diagnostics\nused to evaluate model performance?, (3) How does internal climate variability lead to\nuncertainty in the parameter estimates?, and (4) What impact do the changes in PDFs\nhave on estimates of future warming, namely estimates of transient climate response\n(TCR)? We show that estimates of climate sensitivity increase and the aerosol forcing is\nless negative when using MESM. These shifts are the result of a new forcing suite used to\ndrive the model. By extending the length of the model diagnostics one decade at a time,\nwe show that recent temperature patterns impact our estimates of the climate system\nproperties. The continued rise in surface temperature leads to higher values of ECS,\nwhile the increased rate of heat storage in the ocean lowers estimates of ECS and leads\nto higher estimates of Kv. We show that the parameter distributions are sensitive to the\ninternal variability in the climate system and that using a single variability estimate can\nlead to PDFs that are too narrow. Throughout the dissertation, we show that estimates of transient climate response are correlated with ECS and Kv. Namely, higher ECS\nand weaker Kv lead to higher values of TCR. When considering all of these factors, we\narrive at our best estimate for the climate system properties.

In this study, surface temperature, upper-air temperature, and ocean heat content data are used to constrain the distributions of the parameters that define three climate system properties:  climate sensitivity, the rate of ocean heat uptake into the deep ocean, and net anthropogenic aerosol forcing.  Climate sensitivity is diagnosed by changing the strength of cloud feedback, the rate of deep-ocean heat uptake is determined by varying the effective vertical diffusivity of heat anomalies in the ocean, and the net anthropogenic aerosol forcing is controlled by scaling the spatial and temporal pattern of sulfate aerosol loadings by the model-defined global value in the 1980s.  Running a climate model of intermediate complexity forced by historical forcing patterns over a range of these parameter values allows for the derivation of probability distribution functions for the model parameter values corresponding to the climate system properties.  Using five different surface temperature datasets, this study explores the sensitivity of the parameter distributions to the choice of surface temperature data used to evaluate the model output.  Differences in estimates of climate sensitivity mode and mean are as great as 1 K between the datasets.  Ocean effective diffusivity is poorly constrained using all datasets and the shape of the distribution differs greatly depending on which surface dataset is used.  Distributions for anthropogenic aerosol forcing cluster into two groups.  While each group has the same general shape, the location of the mode and confidence intervals differ by approximately 0.1 watts per square meter between the two clusters.  This difference is small compared to other uncertainties in climate forcings. Transient climate response derived from these distributions ranges anywhere between 1 and 3 K and the shape of the distribution of these possible values is surface dataset dependent.  Some distributions are tall and narrow, while other distributions are short and broad.  Understanding the differences in parameter distributions and predicted warming is critical to understanding the full range of uncertainty involved in climate model calibration studies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [127], "author_name_tesi": "Libardoni, Alex Gordon", "last_name_ssi": "Libardoni", "middle_name_ssi": "Gordon", "first_name_ssi": "Alex", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chris Eliot Forest", "Chris Eliot Forest"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chris Eliot Forest, Thesis Advisor", "Chris Eliot Forest, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Likelihood estimation", "Climate variability", "Climate sensitivity", "Climate models", "Climate model evaluation", "Climate model calibration", "Climate data records", "Climate change observations", "Climate", "Bayesian statistics", "Net aerosol forcing", "Temperature records", "Transient climate response", "Uncertainty quantification"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "An Investigation into Genes Underlying Normal Variation in Facial Morphology in Admixed Populations", "id": "13148", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7024", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The human face is highly variable within and across populations and is likely under strong genetic control.

My dissertation research focuses on normal facial variation in admixed populations of West African and European genetic ancestry sampled in the United States, Brazil, and the Cape Verde Islands. First, morphometric analyses using a dense mesh of quasi-landmarks were performed on a set of three-dimensional facial photographs captured using the 3dMD imaging system. Facial variation was explored in terms of Principal Components (PCs) and these facial PCs were then tested for an association with West African genetic ancestry. Genetic ancestry was estimated in ADMIXMAP using a set of Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs) and a three-population model with Europeans, West Africans, and Native Americans as parental populations. A subset of the facial PCs representing various facial traits was found to be associated with West African genetic ancestry. Next, a list of 199 craniofacial candidate genes known to affect craniofacial dysmorphology was made and refined to those of interest for these particular admixed populations by searching for evidence of natural selection. The areas within and around the genes were explored for the presence of AIMs and this set subset of candidate genes were screened for evidence of directional selection in HapMap populations through the use of three population genetics statistics: Tajima\u2019s D, the log of the Ratio of the Heterozygosities, and Locus-Specific Branch Length. The final list included 50 selection-nominated candidate genes (SNCGs) that had evidence for signatures of selection in either West African or European populations. These SNCGs were then tested for an association with the facial PCs associated with genetic ancestry using an admixture mapping approach in the Cape Verdean sample. Of the 50 genes tested, there was strong evidence of an association with five candidate genes: RAI1, ASPH, FBN1, SKI, and SATB2.

The intricate nature of these systems makes it difficult to anticipate how modifications in one part of the system will impact the system as a whole.  Simulation modeling is an effective tool for representing the current state of a production system and experimenting with various changes within the production system.  The main benefit of simulation modeling is that it allows for the testing of various changes in a virtual environment, thus making it a relatively low-risk and cost-effective method for testing potential modifications to large-scale production systems.  While virtual experimentation has many benefits, one major drawback is that it can be challenging to analyze the simulation output and identify meaningful results.  The proceeding work focuses on methods for visualizing simulation output and analyzing simulation output to uncover significant patterns.  \n\nA simulation model representing a complex, large-scale manufacturing facility was used to experiment with modifying the number of operators per work center and the number of daily shifts per work center within the production system.  The manufacturing facility consists of four main production areas which can be broken down into 56 individual work centers.  Each work center contains one or more machines which are operated by one or more operators.  The manufacturing facility produces several distinct products which have all been designed on a single platform.  The single product platform enables the manufacturer to produce several product variants using the same production equipment.  While all products get routed through nearly-identical work centers, each product will be processed slightly differently at each work center.  Thus the raw components used in each work center, and the time to complete the manufacturing steps in each work center will vary slightly from product to product.  One of the manufacturer\u2019s primary goals is to ensure that that the facility stays on schedule and is able to ship their final products to their customers on time.  In order to keep the facility on schedule, the manufacturer has the ability to add capacity within their facility, either in terms of increasing the number of operators in each work center or increasing the number of shifts that each work center operates.  The simulation model representing this real-world manufacturing facility was used to experiment with modifying the facility capacity to uncover its impact in meeting the production schedule.  The output from these experiments was then analyzed, and visualizations of relevant data were developed.  \n\nHistorically most simulation analysis has centered around statistical analysis of:  i) each workstation\u2019s performance measure and ii) aggregate line measures.  In this work the focus is on finding patterns among the performance measures of individual work centers and using these patterns for predictive purposes. Apriori algorithm for uncovering patterns is one of the most used data mining algorithms. It was applied to the simulation output data in order to identify work centers which often experience low utilization of their equipment at the same time.  \n\nIt is important to visualize data in an effective way to present the manufacturing leadership team with the most relevant information in a manner that allows it to be quickly and easily reviewed, interpreted, and subsequently used to aid in the decision-making responsibilities of executive management and production supervisors.  We use several visualization techniques such as varying the type of chart used to represent the data based on whether the objective is to identify trends within the data or to read specific discrete values within the data.  We also present appropriate visualizations to the appropriate manufacturing leadership. The visualizations were created to present a clear, concise representation of the data to end users while having the flexibility to provide details as required. Both the visualizations of relevant information and the patterns of significance surfaced by the Apriori algorithm can aid decision makers in making effective use of resources by successfully distilling large amounts of data generated from the simulation models into understandable and actionable representations.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7167], "author_name_tesi": "Lidstone, Stephanie Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Lidstone", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Soundar Kumara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Soundar Kumara, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["data visualization", "manufacturing", "pattern recognition"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE ECOLOGY, DISTRIBUTION, CONSERVATION, AND MANAGEMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA\u2019S SURFACE-DWELLING CRAYFISH FAUNA WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE EASTERN PART OF THE STATE\n", "id": "12447", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1318", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although crayfish have long been the object of scientific inquiry and where studied appear to be functionally (ecologically) important, much remains to be learned about their ecology, distribution, and conservation. Even the most basic information (presence/absence data) is lacking for the majority of species. The absence of adequate crayfish data is a major problem, because many species are thought to be imperiled across all or parts of their range and even species that were once widely distributed are rapidly disappearing. Anthropogenic disturbances, especially crayfish introductions, appear to be responsible for many of these losses. The replacement of native crayfish by introduced (exotic) crayfish represents a significant threat to aquatic communities because introduced crayfish often become extremely abundant and can destroy aquatic macrophyte beds, suppress benthic invertebrate communities, reduce fish abundance and biomass, and negatively affect amphibian populations.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Arnold E. Ortmann published a monograph describing the crayfish fauna of Pennsylvania. Since then, very few crayfish studies have been published from the state. The need to re-examine Pennsylvania\u2019s crayfish fauna and the opportunity to revisit previously sampled areas to assess changes in the state\u2019s crayfish fauna over the past century motivated much of this work. The need for basic ecological and conservation information regarding Pennsylvania\u2019s crayfish fauna, as well as specific strategies for managing the state\u2019s native species, provided further motivation. To fulfill these needs, I conducted a series of crayfish studies in Pennsylvania. The findings of these studies and others were then utilized to address a broader ecological question: what determines surface-dwelling crayfish community structure? \n\nI first found that a previously unstudied, widely distributed assemblage of crayfishes (Cambarus bartonii bartonii and Orconectes obscurus) inhabiting Spruce Creek in central Pennsylvania had strong top-down effects on other invertebrates and reduced total invertebrate density by 70%. Crayfish were in turn readily consumed by brown trout (Salmo trutta), especially large trout (> 275 mm total length). Next, I surveyed Valley Creek in southeastern Pennsylvania for crayfishes and discovered a rare species of crayfish [Cambarus (Puncticambarus) sp., an undescribed member of the Cambarus acuminatus complex] that had not previously been reported from the state. The basic life history characteristics, reproductive status, and habitat preferences of C. (P.) sp. are described herein. Additional surveys in southeastern Pennsylvania and comparisons of these results to historical data indicated that exotic crayfishes have invaded many parts of the region, much of which no longer supports native crayfishes. In addition, populations of C. (P.) sp. were discovered from three more streams and are now known from a total of four streams in Pennsylvania, all of which are threatened by urbanization and exotic crayfishes. This information, in combination with other historical and contemporary data from Pennsylvania and nearby states collected for this study and other studies, indicate that C. (P.) sp. is critically imperiled in Pennsylvania and possibly across its range and that the range of another native Pennsylvania crayfish, Orconectes limosus, has declined (retreated eastward) by > 200 km in Pennsylvania and northern Maryland, likely as a result of exotic crayfishes. Although C. b. bartonii was found with exotic crayfishes in a number of water bodies in Pennsylvania, it was typically a minor component of the crayfish community and may not be able to persist in those systems indefinitely. An examination of potential determinants of surface-dwelling crayfish community structure suggests that a combination of local, regional, and historical processes operating across a variety of temporal and spatial scales shape these communities. More specifically, the interplay of competition with environmental conditions appears to limit the number of species that can occur in local communities, whereas regional, historical, and more recently human influences likely determine potential component species. \n\nIn light of these findings, the role of barriers (e.g., dams), environmental protection, educational programs, and regulations in preventing crayfish invasions and conserving native crayfishes is discussed and management initiatives centered on those factors are presented. The need for methods to eliminate exotics and monitor natives is highlighted. Although tailored to a specific regional fauna, the ideas presented in this dissertation have broad applicability and would likely benefit many of North America\u2019s crayfishes and the ecosystems in which they reside. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1307], "author_name_tesi": "Lieb, David Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Lieb", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Robert F Carline", "Robert F Carline", "Eric S Post", "Hunter J Carrick", "James Landis Rosenberger", "Katriona Shea"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Robert F Carline, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert F Carline, Committee Chair", "Eric S Post, Committee Chair", "Hunter J Carrick, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member", "Katriona Shea, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pennsylvania", "management", "conservation", "distribution", "ecology", "crayfish"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Numerical Algorithm for High Reynolds Number Fluid-structure Interaction Simulations", "id": "25020", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10547", "abstract_tesi": "A finite element based algorithm for high Reynolds number (10^6 \u2212 10^8 ) flow is implemented to simulate fluid-structure interaction (FSI).

For American women, body image plays an integral role in everyday life, including leisure. For younger women and girls, poor body image is related to lower levels of participation and decreased enjoyment in leisure activities. Understanding of the association between body image and leisure, however, is extremely limited and researchers have not yet addressed older women. Therefore, the purpose of this dissertation was to explore the role of body image in the leisure of older women. This dissertation is comprised of two article manuscripts.\nAdopting a life course perspective the first manuscript focuses on older women\u2019s perceptions of body image. Findings focus on the events and life factors that shape body image, trajectories of body image across the life course, and adaptive strategies for maintaining or improving body image. Participants reported that body image was largely shaped by interpersonal interactions and by society as well as by numerous physical changes such as pregnancy and menopause. Participants also depicted various adaptive strategies that allowed them to maintain or improve body image with age including de-prioritizing appearance and focusing on controllable aspects of their appearance.\nOlder women\u2019s experiences of body image in their leisure activities are addressed in the second manuscript. Participants describe body image as both a facilitator and a constraint. Many also described positive feelings about their appearance as facilitating their participation in social or visible leisure activities. Furthermore, participants illustrated that their body image focus has shifted from concerns about appearance toward concerns about health and physical ability. This cognitive change led to shifts in the role of body image in their leisure. Finally, several participants explained that they would not participate in activities that involved wearing a bathing suit due to concerns about appearance. \nOverall, the findings of this dissertation suggest that age or the aging process plays a role in older women\u2019s priorities and perceptions of body image. Changing attitudes influence the role of body image in leisure by shifting focus away from appearance toward health and physical ability. This study contributes to the body image literature by focusing on older women, a typically overlooked population, and by investigating the association between older women\u2019s body image and leisure, a topic not previously addressed. Additionally, this study extends leisure and aging literature by exploring the role of body image in the everyday leisure lives of older women. By so doing, this study fills conceptual gaps and extends understanding of leisure theory. Further research is needed to understand the process by which cognitive changes occur related to body image and to investigate possibilities for incorporating the adaptive strategies of older women into programs and interventions for younger populations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6330], "author_name_tesi": "Liechty, Toni ", "last_name_ssi": "Liechty", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Toni", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Leisure Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Careen M Yarnal", "Careen M Yarnal", "Patricia Barthalow Koch", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Careen M Yarnal, Dissertation Advisor", "Careen M Yarnal, Committee Chair", "Patricia Barthalow Koch, Committee Member", "Andrew Justin Mowen, Committee Member", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["leisure", "older women", "leisure constraints", "body image", "life course perspective"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE ROLE OF INTERHEMISPHERIC PATHWAYS\nIN PARKINSON\u2019S DISEASE AND DRUG-INDUCED DYSKINESIAS\n", "id": "12426", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "920", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by cell death of the nigrostriatal pathway and loss of dopamine. Although current pharmacological therapies such as levodopa (LD) can significantly ameliorate symptoms in early stages of the disease, patients develop drug-induced motor complications in later stages. One such complication is the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements known as drug-induced dyskinesias (DID), which are disabling and limit effectiveness of anti-PD treatments. Despite significant advances in the field for understanding the mechanisms associated with DID, treatment for DID in PD is largely unsatisfactory for many patients. Advancing our understanding of the pathophysiological basis of DID will allow for better development of novel therapies that reduce or prevent DID. \n \t\nThe goals of this dissertation research were: 1) to examine novel experimental therapeutics that do not cause DID in animal models of PD; 2) to examine putative mechanisms through which such therapies exert their effects; 3) to examine the role of interhemispheric pathways in the genesis of DID.\n\t\nIn experiment 1, we evaluated if the Ayurvedic medication Mucuna pruriens would reduce DID in the rat and primate models of PD. Our results showed that a water formulation of Mucuna pruriens was highly effective in ameliorating parkinsonian deficits with reduced severity of DID. We also used a novel D1 agonist EFF0311 in both the parkinsonian rat and monkey to show that EFF0311 can significantly decrease parkinsonism and reduce the risk of DID. These two experiments support the use of novel pharmacological agents to mitigate the problem of DID. In experiment 2, we showed that seventeen clinically hemiparkinsonian rhesus monkeys exposed to high doses of LD did not develop DID, and that such monkeys had profound unilateral loss of nigrostriatal neurons (90%). In experiment 3, we explored the putative mechanisms for the resistance of hemiparkinsonian monkeys to DID using single-cell and local field potential electrophysiology in two hemiparkinsonian Rhesus monkeys. We show that chronic intermittent LD did not substantially alter firing rate or patterns in the subthalamic nucleus (a downstream nucleus critically implicated in parkinsonism and in genesis of DID). In experiment 4, we used a variety of tracing techniques (retrograde labeling and optogenetic viral vector systems) to label interhemispheric nigrostriatal connections in normal, partial and completely nigrostriatal lesioned hemiparkinsonian rats. We showed that LD administration to completely lesioned rats (the Ungerstedt model) and severely partial lesioned rats (the Winkler model) caused DID. Histological analysis showed loss of interhemispheric nigrostriatal fibers in these dyskinetic animals. Whereas, the partial striatal lesioned model (Sauer and Oertel model) did not develop DID and retained interhemispheric nigrostriatal fibers. In conclusion, these experiments provide novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms that underly DID. Furthermore, this series of experiments show that interhemispheric pathways may play a significant role in the genesis of DID. These findings could potentially lead to improved development of novel therapies that can reduce or prevent DID in patients suffering from PD. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [912], "author_name_tesi": "Lieu, Christopher Anson", "last_name_ssi": "Lieu", "middle_name_ssi": "Anson", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thyagarajan Subramanian", "Thyagarajan Subramanian", "James Robert Connor", "Paul Joseph Eslinger", "Kent Eugene Vrana", "Kathy Steece Collier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thyagarajan Subramanian, Dissertation Advisor", "Thyagarajan Subramanian, Committee Chair", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Paul Joseph Eslinger, Committee Member", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Member", "Kathy Steece Collier, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["basal ganglia", "nigrostriatal degeneration", "movement disorders", "alternative and complementary medicines"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Computation of Interactions of Blast with Responding Solids using an \"Embedded Solid\" Approach\n\n", "id": "7890", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6920", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the development of a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) methodology and its implementation to simulate a shock/blast wave interaction with a complex structure, to a good engineering approximation.  The method allows for an easy definition of the geometry of the structure and helps to reduce the computational resource requirements.  An `embedded solid' approach, using the Brinkman Penalization Method, is used for its ease of defining a structure in the computational domain. Two implementations of the Brinkman Penalization Method are considered: a semi-implicit computation of the Brinkman Formulation and a discrete-time derivative version of the Formulation.  It is found that these two implementations give essentially the same results, though they give slightly different solutions compared to the exact solutions.  The semi-implicit method is more expensive computationally.  A distorting grid methodology is used to simulate the movement of the `embedded solid' to avoid the disturbance in the simulation that results when the `solid' moves across a new grid point. The distorting grid methodology allows the `solid' to stay in the same computational grid while moving in the physical domain.\n\nSeveral test cases are presented in this thesis to demonstrate the method's ability to simulate complex structures easily.  These include, two-dimensional cases of shock waves over a square cavity and shock wave interaction with an I-beam.  For a three-dimensional case, low Mach number flow past a cone is presented.  For the responding geometry cases, a simulation of a three degree of freedom cylinder responding to a shock wave is presented.\n\nThe above test cases shows that the methodology can simulate complex structures in high Mach number and shock strength flow, and the structures corresponding response to the flow.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6917], "author_name_tesi": "Liew, Yih-Pin ", "last_name_ssi": "Liew", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yih-Pin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip John Morris", "George A Lesieutre", "Lyle Norman Long", "Andrea Schokker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Philip John Morris, Committee Chair", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member", "Andrea Schokker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Structured Grid", "Evolving Grid method", "Computational Fluid Dynamics", "Immersed Boundary Method", "Blast and Responding Solid Interactions"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "HAVE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN PUNISHMENT DECISIONS CHANGED OVER TIME?

While much scholarly attention has been devoted to examining whether racial and ethnic minorities are disadvantaged at sentencing, we still know very little about whether these disparities have gotten better, worse, or remained constant over time. Answering these questions is a fundamental consideration to both scholars interested in inequality in the criminal justice system and policy makers concerned with the effectiveness of sentencing reform. Using individual-level sentencing data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission from 1992 to 2004 for White, Black, and Hispanic offenders, I attempt to fill this glaring gap in the literature by modeling the trends in racial and ethnic disparities in punishment decisions using both logistic and OLS regression to model four dependent variables: 1) likelihood of receiving an \u201cother\u201d downward departure (logistic regression); 2) likelihood of receiving a substantial assistance departure (logistic regression); 3) likelihood of incarceration (logistic regression), and; 4) the length of sentence (OLS regression). The results show that racial and ethnic disparities have not uniformly increased, decreased, or remained the same under the federal sentencing guidelines. Rather, consistent with the focal concerns perspective, disparities appear highly dependent on a variety of different contexts including sentencing outcome, offense type, and time period. The theoretical and policy implications of these various trends are then discussed in the discussion and conclusion sections. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4360], "author_name_tesi": "Light, Michael  T", "last_name_ssi": "Light", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Michael ", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffery Todd Ulmer", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffery Todd Ulmer, Thesis Advisor", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sentencing trends", "sentencing guidelines", "race and ethnicity"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Punishing the 'Others': Citizenship and State Social Control in the United States and Germany", "id": "18674", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8907", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     This dissertation examines the punishment consequences of citizenship status in U.S. and German criminal courts. The conceptual and analytical models of sentencing merge two distinct theoretical traditions \u2013 citizenship studies and the sociology of punishment. Utilizing an ideal-type comparison of case outcomes in the United States and Germany \u2013 two advanced western democracies with strong rule of law traditions but markedly different conceptions of citizenship and nationhood \u2013 this dissertation investigates the sentencing of non-state members using a unique cross-national, mixed-methodological research design. Specifically, data from the U.S. federal courts and German court system from 1998 to 2010 are used to estimate the punishment gap between citizen and noncitizen offenders across a range of statistical analyses. These results are then combined with judge interviews from both countries to identify and explicate the mechanisms linking national membership to punishment considerations. \n     Two main findings emerge from this analysis. First, citizenship is a powerful predictor of increased punishment in U.S. and German courts. The results indicate that the effect of citizenship on sentencing is equal to or greater in magnitude than factors traditionally stressed in legal inequality research, such as race/ethnicity or gender. Particularly in U.S. federal courts, the evidence is clear that national boundaries are more salient than racial/ethnic distinctions. Second, noncitizens are punished more harshly in both countries despite fundamentally different legal, political, and normative conceptions of citizenship, suggesting that national boundaries are significant in criminal courts even in countries that have distinct definitions of national membership.     \n     The interviews suggest a variety of intervening mechanisms explain these findings. First, a prominent theme emerged that judges in both countries resented that noncitizens would compound their immigrant status with criminal transgressions and violate their countries hospitality. Second, foreigners lack of social bonds to society affected judges sentencing decisions through a variety of pathways, including defendants\u2019 lack of gainful employment or native language proficiency. In the U.S., some judges also felt their sentencing options were limited because foreign defendants would likely be deported. Third, several judges viewed noncitizens criminality as rooted in cultural practices, and thus a message needed to be sent to other members of the immigrant group. These themes often overlapped, demonstrating an intricate web of relationships that explain the differential legal treatment of non-state members.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8749], "author_name_tesi": "Light, Michael  T", "last_name_ssi": "Light", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Michael ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffery Todd Ulmer", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer", "Glenn A Firebaugh", "John Iceland", "John Kramer", "Christopher Jon Zorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffery Todd Ulmer, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffery Todd Ulmer, Committee Chair", "Glenn A Firebaugh, Committee Member", "John Iceland, Committee Member", "John Kramer, Committee Member", "Christopher Jon Zorn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Citizenship", "Punishment", "Immigration"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Alterations in Amputee Gait Mechanics Produced by Varied Stiffness and Damping in a Shock Absorbing Prosthetic Pylon", "id": "26489", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10824", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Advanced electrically powered prostheses have become increasingly common in recent years for use by amputees.

The main purpose of this thesis is to investigate the effects of varied stiffness and damping of a shock absorbing prosthetic pylon on unilateral, transtibial amputee gait in an attempt to characterize the effects of a real energy harvesting prosthetic pylon.\nWe investigated the variations in intact side ankle moment and power and intact side hip moment and power of five unilateral, transtibial amputees walking with a shock absorbing pylon across five different stiffness and damping combinations.  We also conducted a computational modeling study in which we simulated a unilateral, transtibial amputee walking with a shock absorbing pylon with 30 different combinations of stiffness and damping and investigated the differences in intact side ankle moment and power, knee moment and power, hip moment and power, and center of mass acceleration.\nVariation of both stiffness and damping had significant effects on intact side joint kinetics, but not all subjects reacted in the same way to increasing stiffness and damping.  In general, a more compliant pylon allowed amputees to walk with reduced joint moments and powers.  Modeling results suggested that some combinations of stiffness and damping can minimize user effort while still effectively harvesting energy.

These volumes employ gestures that sidestep traditional Renaissance counterpoint, featuring unprepared dissonances and incongruous styles that prioritize text expression above codified conventions. Monteverdi\u2019s arrival at a style tailored for conveying the text\u2019s poetic imagery and emotional state of its characters marks a decisive turning point in his compositional development and aesthetic philosophy: the seconda pratica. This thesis addresses the context surrounding Monteverdi\u2019s stylistic evolution, embracing scholarship that demonstrates the influence of his contemporaries, but expanding and isolating the discussion toward one key mentor: Giaches de Wert.\n\n\tWert advanced expressivity in the madrigal during his 1565-92 tenure as maestro di cappella at the ducal chapel of Santa Barbara in Mantua. He incorporated a lifetime of experiences with theatrical music and immersive chamber performances toward musically representing the dramatic content of contemporary poetry, notably works by Torquato Tasso and Giovanni Battista Guarini. In 1590, when Monteverdi entered into employment as a musician at the Mantuan court, Wertian influences surfaced in his poetic selection and compositional gestures, appearing prominently in texts functioning as first-person laments during emotional peaks in their surrounding narratives. This thesis analyzes the plaintive madrigals Giunto alla tomba, Ah, dolente partita, Cruda Amarilli, and Lasciatemi morire for their expressive commonalities, illuminating Wert\u2019s influence in Monteverdi\u2019s burgeoning seconda pratica language. \n\nThe Prologue frames Monteverdi\u2019s early development as a madrigalist within the thriving artistic climate of 1590s Mantua, discussing the environment and influences surrounding the composer while honing his craft. It considers Monteverdi\u2019s turn toward affective representation after his Third Book, and his search for compositional devices useful in conveying the emotional turmoil of his selected texts. Chapter One discusses a shifting dynamic in madrigal performance during the sixteenth century, from social, amateur readings to concert environments that distinguished between audience and performer roles. Wert\u2019s experience as a composer for theater, and his compositional involvement with the Concerto delle donne in 1580s Ferrara frames a discussion of Wert\u2019s role in advancing dramatic representation in the madrigal. The final section of Chapter One considers the artistic movement of Mannerism, and its relationship to the stylistic developments of Wert and his contemporaries. Chapter Two analyzes direct comparisons between Wert and Monteverdi\u2019s madrigals, tracing gestural similarities showing Wert\u2019s continued influence on Monteverdi\u2019s evolving seconda pratica style. It then analyzes settings of parallel texts between the two composers, isolating similar expressive gestures, then demonstrates their presence in Monteverdi\u2019s later polyphonic reworking of his dramatic masterwork: the Lamento d\u2019Arianna. The Epilogue discusses Wert and Monteverdi\u2019s ideological relationship to aesthetic debates of the late sixteenth century, briefly profiling writings by Torquato Tasso and Giovanni Maria Artusi that interacted with the two composers\u2019 stylistic changes. \n\nIn summary, this thesis seeks to trace Monteverdi\u2019s arrival at a profound compositional style suited to the lament, by analyzing Wert\u2019s contributions to the seconda pratica. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11799], "author_name_tesi": "Ligrani, Jonathan Christopher", "last_name_ssi": "Ligrani", "middle_name_ssi": "Christopher", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Musicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marica Susan Tacconi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marica Susan Tacconi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Monteverdi", "Wert", "seconda pratica", "madrigal", "lament"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Aerodynamic Testing of Micro-scale Wind Turbines", "id": "25656", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10795", "abstract_tesi": "In efforts to develop a platform and methodology for testing wind turbines at Penn State, wind tunnel and field experiments were conducted with micro-scale turbines.  Testing was aimed to expand on the results collected in previous work by Kylie Flickinger [1].  This research focused on gathering a broader spectrum of data using a 3-phase electrical generator with a simplified control arrangement.  The factory installed, internal speed controller was removed from an All-Power brand 400 watt turbine.  This allowed for non-adaptive control of the AC generator in the form of a user applied electronic load from an adjustable resistor bank across the DC output of an external rectifier.\n\nBench-top dynamometer testing was conducted to collect performance data and calculate the generator's efficiency.  In this round of experimentation, 12 different load resistor settings were used.  The 0.333 ohm loading case had consistently high efficiencies over the full range of generator speeds tested, but at higher rotational velocities, the 1.0 and 1.5 ohm loads were the most efficient, at 83\\% and 82\\%, respectively.\n\nWind tunnel testing of the generator was then conducted in the Penn State Multi-Purpose Low-Speed Wind Tunnel at the Academic Projects Building.  The test section was not large enough to accommodate the fully assembled turbine, so it was placed in the second diffuser.  Three different blade shapes were tested in the tunnel, in both a two and three blade configuration.  The load resistances tested were simplified to eight different settings due to safety concerns of testing under 0.333 ohms and in efforts to reduce the duration of the wind tunnel tests.  The blade designs included the All-Power and Sunforce blades, as well as a newly fabricated set.  The new blade design, referred to as the Micro Whisper, was a scale model of the Whisper 500, which is a research turbine located at the Penn State Center for Sustainability.  This facility was developed and maintained by Brian Wallace, whose Masters and Ph.D research has focused on this system [2].\n\nThe Micro Whisper blades were manufactured for this project in an attempt to explore the effects of scaling on performance.  The model blades were scaled from the original 15 foot diameter down to the size of the Sunforce and All-Power blades, which are 3.83 feet in diameter.  Unfortunately the Whisper blades did not hold their proper shape during wind tunnel testing, so comparison to the full scale turbine was impractical.  The blades were not designed for the scale they were operating at and as a result, they also remained in a stalled condition for the majority of test cases, until they twisted during testing.\n\nThe data for electrical power output collected in the wind tunnel was corrected for losses due to the generator efficiency, as calculated during bench-top dynamometer testing of the three phase generator.  Corrections to the wind speed at the location of the turbine were made using a method developed to more accurately calculate the effects of blockage based on turbine performance.  This method focused on adjusting the wind speed for the amount of power that was extracted from the tunnel, allowing for a correction that would adjust appropriately to any turbine.\n\nThe corrected wind tunnel results show that increasing the loading resistance resulted in reduced blade power.  This also caused the turbine to reach greater angular velocities at lower wind speeds.  At a 3.0 ohm load, the maximum mechanical blade power reached was 232.6 watts, at a wind speed of 33.1 ft/s and turbine angular speed of 2024 RPM.  The greatest mechanical power was 444.6 watts, achieved under a 0.8 ohm load on the generator, at 38.1 ft/s and 1822 RPM.\n\nA new mobile field test facility was developed for micro-scale wind turbines.  Tests were conducted using the Sunforce two and three blade configurations under 0.8, 1.5, and 3.0 ohm loads on the generator.  This data was corrected for generator efficiency losses and then compared to the wind tunnel corrected results to determine the accuracy of the new blockage calculation method.  The field data appeared to be comparable to the corrected wind tunnel results, but when the coefficient of power was plotted as a function of the tip speed ratio, it became apparent that the processed data exhibits significant problems.

Over the past decade, plasma engineering became a significant part of aerospace engineering, material processing, medicine, geosciences, etc. One of the main goals of plasma research is to discover new perspectives in a wide range of research areas. It makes plasma engineering a truly interdisciplinary subject.\nRecently, a significant interest in the aerospace community was caused by the possibility of an active flow control using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma actuators. A number of groups tried to explain the physics of the experimentally observed phenomena. However, the developed models could hardly explain the DBD phenomena even qualitatively. This thesis presents the first complete, comprehensive, physically-based model, which tracks all essential physics of the DBD plasma actuators and utilizes modern numerical capabilities for efficient simulations. By using the developed model, the physics of the plasma actuators was explained. Based on the understanding of the operation of the conventional DBD, driven by a sinusoidal voltage, a novel configuration was proposed. The sinusoidal driving voltage was substituted by the repetitive nanosecond pulses superimposed on the bias voltage. The advantages of the proposed concept over the conventional one were experimentally validated. \nThe developed model demonstrated flexibility for different plasma engineering areas. The model can be used not only for a description of the DBD plasma actuators, but also for a number of problems involving the gas discharges. By using the developed model, plasma generation by the ferroelectric plasma source, which is used in fusion technology, was explained.\nIn the area of material processing, a significant interest was caused by an apparent possibility of precise high intensity ultra-short laser pulse drilling with negligible melt production. However, the experiments did not validate the theories proposed in literature. In order to explain the experimental data and analyze the possibility of reduction of melt generation, a new model for laser pulse drilling was developed in this thesis. The model comprehensively describes laser-material interaction and explains the significant amount of melt production in the case of ultra-short laser pulses. The results of the simulations are in good agreement with the experimental data.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [415], "author_name_tesi": "Likhanskii, Alexandre ", "last_name_ssi": "Likhanskii", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alexandre", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vladimir Semak", "Vladimir Semak", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia", "Albert Eliot Segall", "Victor P Asko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vladimir Semak, Dissertation Advisor", "Vladimir Semak, Committee Chair", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Committee Chair", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Member", "Victor P Asko, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["flow control", "gas discharge", "Plasma physics"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "HYDROGEN ASSISTED DIESEL COMBUSTION\n", "id": "8302", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2061", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    In this study, the effect of hydrogen assisted diesel combustion on conventional and advanced combustion modes was investigated on a DDC/VM Motori 2.5L, 4-cylinder, turbocharged, common rail, direct injection light-duty diesel engine, with exhaust emission being the main focus. Hydrogen was substituted for diesel fuel on a percent energy basis of 0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10% and 15%.  The conventional combustion modes studied consisted of four engine combinations of speed and load (1800 rpm at 25% of maximum output, 1800 rpm at 75% of maximum output, 3600 rpm at 25% of maximum output, and 3600 rpm at 75% of maximum output). A significant retarding of injection timing by the diesel fuel injection timing map in the engine\u2019s electronic control unit (ECU) was observed during the increased aspiration of hydrogen.  The retarding of injection timing resulted in significant emission reductions, however, the same emission reductions were achieved without aspirated hydrogen by manually retarding the injection timing.  Subsequently, hydrogen assisted diesel combustion was conducted, with the pilot and main injection timings locked, to study the effects caused directly by hydrogen addition. \n       Hydrogen assisted diesel combustion resulted in a modest increase of NOX emissions and a NO / NO2 trade-off in which NO emissions decreased and NO2 emissions increased, with NO2 becoming the dominate NOX component in some circumstances. Increased aspiration of hydrogen resulted in PM, and HC emissions which fluctuated with speed and load.  Predominantly, CO and CO2 decreased with the increase of hydrogen. The aspiration of hydrogen into the engine modestly decreased fuel economy due to the reduction of oxygen in the cylinder charge. \n\tIn the advanced combustion portion of the study, the engine was operated under a partially-premixed charge compression ignition PCCI mode known as high efficiency clean combustion (HECC), in which NOX and PM emissions dramatically decreased while fuel economy was maintained.  Hydrogen assisted diesel combustion was performed while the engine operated in the HECC mode, which resulted in emissions and combustion impacts similar to those observed in the conventional combustion modes. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2043], "author_name_tesi": "Lilik, Gregory Kenneth", "last_name_ssi": "Lilik", "middle_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["HCCI", "LTC", "HYDROGEN ASSISTED DIESEL COMBUSTION", "PCCI", "Hydrogen", "Diesel"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Advanced Diesel Combustion of High Cetane Number Fuels and the Impacts on the\ncombustion Process", "id": "13781", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7121", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Advanced diesel combustion is of great interest due to the promise of simultaneously reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) and particulate matter (PM), while maintaining or improving efficiency.  However, the extended ignition delay along with the combustion of a partially premixed charge results in excessive emissions of total hydrocarbons (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) from incomplete combustion.  In this study, a light duty turbodiesel engine was operated in an advanced diesel combustion mode, specifically high efficiency clean combustion (HECC), using three different fuels including a conventional ultra low sulfur diesel fuel (diesel), a synthetic fuel produced in a high temperature Fischer Tropsch (HTFT) process, and a synthetic fuel produced in a low temperature Fischer Tropsch (LTFT) process.  Start of injection (SOI) timing was swept from  8\u00b0 ATDC to 0\u00b0 ATDC to find the optimized injection timing for each fuel.  The HTFT fuel, which had a derived cetane number (DCN) of 51, was found to decrease THC and CO emission by 32% and 31%, respectively, compared to the diesel fuel, which had a DCN of 45.  The higher ignition quality of the HTFT fuel was found to reduce emissions from incomplete combustion by presumably consuming more of the fuel charge before it reached a region of the cylinder where it was too lean to effectively burn.  However, with the HTFT fuel, NOx and PM emissions increased relative to the diesel baseline due to a higher peak heat release rate, presumably caused by 2% less EGR during the HTFT fuel\u2019s operation.  In contrast, the LTFT fuel with a DCN of 81 enabled an 80% reduction in THC emissions and a 74% reduction in CO emissions compared to the diesel fuel.  The LTFT fuel, though having a very short ignition delay, did not increase NOx and PM emissions apparently due to the fuel burning in a shorter, less intense premixed combustion phase followed by a prominent mixing-controlled combustion phase.  This study revealed that a high ignition quality (DCN 81) fuel is well suited for operation under a high EGR advanced diesel combustion mode and led to reductions in all primary pollutant emissions.\n\nMany factors were suggested which contribute to the lower THC and CO emissions produced by the combustion of a high cetane fuel.  Among the factors was the theory that a high cetane number fuel will have a lower combustion lean limit than a lower cetane number fuel, thus resisting incomplete combustion.  This theory was examined in a subsequent study where the critical equivalence ratio (\u03a6), the minimum equivalence ratio at which a fuel can autoignite, was identified for the diesel, HTFT and LTFT.  The fuels were vaporized and premixed with air heated to 260 \u00b0C then fed into a modified Cooperative Fuels Research (CFR) Octane Rating engine, at compression ratios of 4, 5, 6 and 8.  Equivalence ratio (\u03a6) was gradually increased until the critical \u03a6 was determined.  At the lowest compression ratio of 4, the diesel fuel did not autoignite while the HTFT and the LTFT fuels did at critical \u03a6 of 0.76 and 0.35, respectively.  At the highest compression ratio of 8, the critical \u03a6 of the fuels began to converge where diesel, HTFT, and LTFT had critical \u03a6 of 0.23, 0.20 and 0.17, respectively.  However, in the presence of simulated EGR (O2 10.7 vol. %, CO2 8 vol. % and N2 81.3 vol. %) at a compression ratio of 8, the critical \u03a6 diverged dramatically, where the diesel, HTFT and LTFT had critical \u03a6 of 1.00, 0.77 and 0.38, respectively.  n Hexane, n heptane and n dodecane were used as single component surrogates of similar ignition quality as the diesel, HTFT and LTFT, respectively.  The single-component surrogates had leaner critical \u03a6 than their multi-component counterparts did.\n\nThe higher ignition quality fuels were shown to have leaner critical \u03a6, but a question remained regarding fuel compositional effects on critical \u03a6.  Blends of n dodecane/toluene and n dodecane/isooctane were prepared to have the same DCN as n heptane.  Critical \u03a6 measurements of the two blends and n heptane revealed that critical \u03a6 could vary between fuels with the same DCN.  The n dodecane/toluene blend was found to have a leaner critical \u03a6 than the n dodecane/iso octane blend under low compression ratios (CRs) or simulated EGR.  It was concluded that the 11% greater n paraffin content of the n dodecane/toluene blend compared to the n dodecane / iso octane, resulted in more LTHR and a leaner critical \u03a6.  The critical \u03a6 of the low cetane number FACE fuels were also determined.  A linear correlation with an R2 coefficient of 0.949 was observed between critical \u03a6 and n paraffin mass content of the low CN FACE fuels.  This result corroborated with the conclusion of the DCN parity blends, that the critical \u03a6 of a fuel is governed by the fraction of reactive components (n paraffins), which increases low temperature heat release (LTHR).  The critical \u03a6 measurements of the low cetane number FACE fuels were compared to CO and THC emissions from a light duty turbodiesel engine operating in advanced combustion mode with the low cetane number (CN) FACE fuels.  Low CO and THC emission produced from early SOI timings are suggestive of a correlation with lean critical \u03a6 measurements.  It was concluded that the relationship between low CO and THC emissions and a lean critical \u03a6 is only present when early SOI timing produces an overly lean fuel air charge.  It was conjectured that the contribution of CO and THC emissions from overly rich regions becomes larger, and a fuel with a leaner critical \u03a6 would not reduce these emissions.  These results suggest that a fuel can be blended to have a low ignition quality, which is desired for high efficiency advanced combustion operations and with high n paraffin content to reduce CO and THC emission.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7111], "author_name_tesi": "Lilik, Gregory Kenneth", "last_name_ssi": "Lilik", "middle_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Randy Lee Vander Wal", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Robert John Wagner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Dissertation Advisor", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Member", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Robert John Wagner, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Advanced Diesel Combustion", "Total Hydrocarbons (THC)", "Carbon Monoxide (CO)", "Ignition Quality", "Equivalence Ratio"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A Comparison of Plasticulture and Strip Tillage Production Systems With and Without Row Covers for Organic and Conventional Cucurbit Production ", "id": "25113", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11249", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The production of most cucurbit crops in the Northeastern U.S. uses polyethylene mulch on raised beds with drip irrigation, or a plasticulture system. While the use of plasticulture systems decreases weed pressure, and increases soil temperatures, typically resulting in increased yields, disadvantages include plastic disposal issues and costs, and soil degradation due to the intensive tillage required for installation. Strip tillage systems have been shown to decrease soil erosion, increase soil moisture retention and increase soil microbial communities. In conventional production, the use of spunbonded polypropylene row cover shows potential to replace the use of neonicotinoids, the common early season control method for insect pests of cucurbits. These row covers have been shown to control early season striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum ) populations, therefore decreasing the incidence of bacterial wilt caused by Erwinia tracheiphila. In organic production, the use of row covers can decrease early season pest pressure, being an alternative to expensive and largely ineffective approved insecticides. Research was conducted during the 2013-14 growing seasons at The Pennsylvania State University\u2019s Russell E. Larson Research and Education Center in Rock Springs, PA to investigate these production practices. Plasticulture and strip tillage systems were compared with and without row covers in four separate experiments: conventionally managed summer squash (Cucurbita pepo \u2018Lioness\u2019), conventional muskmelon (Cucumis melo \u2018Athena\u2019), organic summer squash, and organic muskmelon. Soil moisture levels, air and soil temperatures, soil nitrate levels, light intensity at the plant canopy, weed densities, striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum) populations, incidence of bacterial wilt, and crop yields were measured. Plants grown in the strip tillage system generally had lower yields than in the plasticulture system in both years. Numerically higher soil moisture levels were observed in the strip tillage system during the 2013 season but no differences were observed in 2014. Row covers resulted in larger plants and generally resulted in equal or higher yields when compared to not using row covers within all systems. Late timing of row cover removal may have negatively affected summer squash yields in the plasticulture system. The use of row covers allowed for the elimination of neonicotinoid application in conventional trials and fewer insecticide applications required in organic treatments with no increase in pest pressure or incidence of bacterial wilt, although there was low incidence of bacterial wilt in both years of the experiments. Lower yields in the strip tillage system observed in the muskmelon experiment and in the majority of the summer squash experiments were beyond acceptable levels. This research found that decreased soil temperatures, high weed pressure, and dramatically lower yields in the strip tillage system limit the successful use of this system for these crops. Although economic analysis was not conducted, this research showed that row covers are a viable production alternative to the use of neonicotinoids in conventional production systems. In organic trials, row covers reduced the need for early season insecticide applications and protected plants when they are most susceptible to pest damage.

Considering potentially high price responsiveness of lower degree of necessity drugs, Part D is likely to induce higher consumption of improperly used prescription drugs, including inappropriate and off-label drugs, in Medicare enrollees. Yet little evidence exists about how\u2014and to what extent\u2014Part D might have an impact on these types of medication use of elderly Medicare recipients. This thesis using multi-year (2001-2010) data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) explores whether and how much Part D has influenced inappropriate and off-label drug use patterns among elderly Medicare beneficiaries. The difference-in-differences (DD) model was used for both analyses. The inappropriate drug use study found that Part D did not promote the use of Beers Criteria (BC) drugs among elderly Medicare beneficiaries; rather, there has been a decreasing trend in the use of BC drugs over time regardless of type of insurance coverage. Similarly, Part D did not promote off-label psychotherapeutic drug use among those who had newly obtained drug coverage through Part D. However, dual-eligibles increased off-label psychotherapeutic drug use after Part D went into effect, indicating that the transition of prescription drug costs from Medicaid to Medicare after Part D might have influenced the off-label psychotherapeutic drug use patterns of dual-eligibles. Both inappropriate and off-label drug use rates are remarkably high among elderly Medicare beneficiaries, suggesting that continuing clinical and policy efforts should be established to reduce non-proper use of prescription drugs among elderly Medicare enrollees in order to improve quality prescription drug therapies.

The performance of visual tracking systems is often severely affected by appearance changes of the target, occlusion, scene clutter and sensor noise.  Conventional approaches address these challenges by introducing simple dynamic models such as constant velocity of the target, and adaptive appearance models based on the assumption that the target features are continuous in the spatial and time domains. These approaches, however, have been shown in the literature to be fragile to occlusion and susceptible to incorrect observations. In addition, modeling dynamic target appearance is often faced with difficulties due to its high dimensionality and nonlinearity.\n\nThis thesis presents efficient frameworks for modeling dynamic motion and appearance of the target object by employing tools from robust system identification theory and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques. The target motion and appearance are modeled as unknown operators that satisfy certain interpolation conditions. The unknown operators can then be identified by solving a convex optimization problem where high dimensionality and nonlinearity in appearance changes are addressed by efficiently projecting high dimensionality descriptors into low dimensional manifolds.  The learned dynamic models are then used to accurately predict  the location and appearance of the targets in future frames, thus preventing tracking failures due to model drifting, target occlusion, and scene clutter.\n\nThe advantages of this approach are multiple: 1) It allows to treat the tracking problem from an input/output point of view, requiring very little a priori knowledge about the target. At the same time, it allows to naturally incorporate as much prior knowledge as it is available. 2) It  decouples  nonlinear appearance changes from linear dynamics facilitating the identification process. 3) It provides mechanisms to invalidate a priori assumptions and worst-case estimates of the identification error that can be used to determine how long the predictions are valid. 4) Finally, the use of reliable models allows for simpler computational complexity algorithms.\n\nThe proposed approach was validated with several experiments  conducted under various scenarios such as single and multiple target tracking, and static and moving camera environments, and finally, single and multiple camera environments. The advantages of the proposed approach are shown with illustrated examples in which robustness to severe occlusion and efficiency of appearance modeling are compared to conventional approaches.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2335, 2336], "author_name_tesi": "Lim, Hwasup ", "last_name_ssi": "Lim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hwasup", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Octavia I Camps", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Mario Sznaier", "William Evan Higgins", "Sunil K Sinha", "William Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Octavia I Camps, Committee Chair", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Chair", "Mario Sznaier, Committee Member", "William Evan Higgins, Committee Member", "Sunil K Sinha, Committee Member", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["visual tracking", "caratheodory-fejer", "appearance modeling", "motion modeling", "object tracking"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "LEARNING AND SOCIAL PROCESS OF AGING AMONG KOREAN OLDER MARRIED WOMEN: THE CULTURAL-HISTORICAL ACTIVITY THEORY ANALYSIS\n\n\n\n", "id": "11390", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2354", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aging population has rapidly increased in South Korea.

In the last decade, the rapid growth of wireless applications has led to an increasing demand for highly accurate and stable reference clock sources for data communication. Quartz crystal resonators are the most common devices used to generate frequencies in order to control and manage the systems. Among the various types of crystal oscillators, OCXOs have superior frequency stability. However, a typical OCXO package includes not only a metal block, but also multiple PCBs for the resonator, oscillator circuitry, and temperature sensitive components, the combination of which results in a large package size and a long warm-up time. An SC-cut crystal, which is considerably more expensive than an AT-cut crystal, is generally used as the resonator. In addition, power consumption of these OCXOs is very high. Despite the excellent frequency characteristics of OCXOs, these drawbacks prevent their use in small mobile or battery-powered devices.\n\nTo overcome the limitations of conventional OCXOs, we present a new design of miniature OCXO on a single CMOS chip. The object of this project is to design an ultra-compact and low-power precision OCXO. All the main components of an OCXO such as an oscillator, a temperature sensor, a heater, and temperature-control circuitry are integrated on a single CMOS chip. The OCXO package size can be reduced significantly with this design, since the resonator does not require a separate package and most of the circuitry is integrated on a single CMOS chip. Other characteristics such as power consumption and warm-up time are also improved.\n\nTwo different types of quartz resonators, an AT-cut Tab Mesa type quartz crystal and a frame enclosed resonator (FER) allowed the miniaturization of the OCXO structure. Neither of these two quartz resonator types requires a separate package inside the oven structure; therefore, they can each be directly integrated with the custom-designed CMOS chip. The miniature OCXO achieved a frequency stability of \u00b10.35 ppm with an AT-cut Tab Mesa type quartz crystal in the temperature range of 0 \u00b0C to 60 \u00b0C. The maximum power consumption of this miniature OCXO was 1.2 W at start-up and 303 mW at steady state. The warm-up time to reach the steady state was 190 seconds. These results of the proposed design are better than or comparable to high-frequency commercial OCXOs.

This however, limits the number of active threads and thus the amount of latency that can be tolerated.  The generality of dataflow scheduling makes it difficult to fetch and execute a sequence of logically related sets of threads through the processor pipeline, thereby removing any opportunity to use registers across thread boundaries.  Relegating the responsibilities of scheduling and storage management to the compiler alleviates this problem to some extent.  In conventional architectures, the reduction in memory latencies is achieved by providing (explicit) programmable registers and (implicit) high-speed caches.  Amalgamating the idea of caches or register-caches within the dataflow framework can result in a higher exploitation of parallelism and hardware utilization.  This thesis investigates the suitability of cache memory in a dataflow paradigm.  \n\tWe present two heuristic schemes that allow the detection, exploitation, and enhancement of temporal and spatial localities in a dataflow graph (dataflow program).  Dataflow graphs are partitioned into subgraphs while preserving localities, and subgraphs are distributed among the processors in order to reduce cache misses and communication cost.  The Staggered Distribution scheme was proposed to address the issue of detection and allocation of dynamic parallelism in a program.  On the other hand, the Vertically Layered (VL) allocation scheme, can effectively detect spatial localities in a dataflow graph by assigning nodes connected serially to a partition (a vertical layer).\n\tAs part of this thesis, we intend to incorporate and utilize these two schemes for detecting and enhancing localities in a dataflow graph, which is essential in optimizing the effectiveness of cache in multithreaded dataflow architectures.  In addition, since the Staggered scheme produces an unbalanced load among processors.  An extension to the Staggered scheme that produces a more balanced distribution of iterations among processors will also be developed.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3029], "author_name_tesi": "Lim, Joford T.", "last_name_ssi": "Lim", "middle_name_ssi": "T.", "first_name_ssi": "Joford", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali R Hurson", "Mary Jane Irwin", "John Metzner", "Ali Borhan", "Octavia I Camps"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali R Hurson, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "John Metzner, Committee Member", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member", "Octavia I Camps, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dataflow", "program allocation", "loop scheduling", "computer architecture", "cache"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Progressive Collapse Analyses of Steel Framed Moment Resisting Structures", "id": "6348", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3188", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Progressive collapse has been an important issue in building failures since the collapse of the Ronan Point apartment building in 1968.

In Korea, education stakeholders have been facing political conflicts surrounding the High School Equalization Policy (HSEP), an anti-choice policy, since 1974. This study assumed that education policy is the outcome of political struggles among education stakeholders. In particular, government officials like superintendents are involved in the political game in order to advance their values or interests. Thus, to investigate the political dynamics among stakeholders surrounding the HSEP, this study had five research questions: 1) Who were the proponents and opponents of the High School Equalization Policy?  2) Why did they take sides, pro or con? 3) How was the superintendent of the provincial school district, as a final decision-maker, involved with this issue? 4) What political tactics did each coalition use to achieve its policy goals? 5) How effective did major stakeholders think that the strategies were?\nConsidering the main purpose and research questions of the study, this study used qualitative research methods. As qualitative research, a case study was used to explain political dynamics happening within a school district. The researcher employed interviews as the main method and document analysis and observation as complementary methods. A total of 32 participants were interviewed in a Korean school district, and a number of government documents, minutes of school board meetings, news articles, and other written materials were analyzed. Observation of a study committee meeting also was conducted. \nThis study confirmed that educational policy-making was a product of political conflicts among political interest groups. The overall results of this study show that interest group politics played a key role in the equalization policy-making process. Moreover, most stakeholders took sides in either the pro-coalition or anti-coalition in order to accomplish their practical interests. The pro-equalization group took the initiative in the political game to challenge the established power structure in the community. In response, the opponents of the equalization movement launched an anti-coalition in connection with school district officials and school board members. This study found that the wealthy, well-organized patron's role and the entrepreneurial leadership were important for the initiation and maintenance of educational interest groups. Without the support of a progressive teachers union, the advocate group could not have championed the equalization movement for such a long time. Likewise, without the support of the Harbor High School Alumni Association, the superintendent could not have defended his policy preference so well against the attacks from the advocates.\nThe government officials also participated in the political game, not as neutral arbitrators, but as major stakeholders. Whereas the pro-coalition employed massive rallies, the anti-coalition resorted to the passive, defensive, and small-scale persuasion or the formal and informal connection to decision-making authorities.  There were conflicting views among stakeholders about the effectiveness of various political activities.  While some stakeholders evaluated the anti-choice movement as a success, others argued that the movement's political activities did not influence the superintendent much on acceptance of their policy demand.\nHowever, this study has limitations coming from the researcher. His affiliations with the Korean government and his educational background might have influenced the collection and analysis of data. Because this study involved only a single case study and selected key interview participants through a purposeful sampling method, not a randomized sampling method, the findings, although suggestive of broader patterns, cannot be generalized.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3072], "author_name_tesi": "Lim, June Hee ", "last_name_ssi": "Lim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "June Hee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William L Boyd", "John W Tippeconnic", "Roger C Shouse", "Bernard Joel Badiali"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William L Boyd, Committee Chair", "John W Tippeconnic, Committee Member", "Roger C Shouse, Committee Member", "Bernard Joel Badiali, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["policy coalition", "politics of education", "high school equalization policy", "politics of policy-making", "educational interest group"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECT OF CONCEPT MAPPING WITH DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GENERATIVITY AND LEARNERS' SELF-REGULATED LEARNING SKILLS ON KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION AND REPRESENTATION \n\n\n", "id": "8740", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3644", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of concept mapping strategies with different levels of generativity in terms of knowledge acquisition and knowledge representation.

Four research questions were posed: (1) Do concept mapping strategies with different levels of generativity influence factual and conceptual knowledge acquisition? (2) Do different levels of self-regulated learning skills influence factual and conceptual knowledge acquisition? (3) Do different levels of self-regulated learning skills affect the effectiveness of different concept mapping strategies in terms of factual and conceptual knowledge acquisition? (4) Do different levels of self-regulated learning skills influence the knowledge representation of learners who study with a fully learner-generated concept map?\n<p>\nThe participants were 285 undergraduate students who enrolled in a 200-level statistics course at a large northeastern university. The independent variables of this study were the levels of self-regulated learning skills and the levels of generativity in concept mapping strategies. The levels of SRL skills were divided into high and low, while the levels of generativity in concept mapping were operationalized in three treatments: Expert-generated concept mapping, partially learner-generated concept mapping, and fully learner-generated concept mapping. Dependent variables were knowledge acquisition (factual and conceptual knowledge), and knowledge representation of concept maps (the proposition quality, overall quality, and the quantity of propositions).\n<p>\nAccording to the MANOVA results for the first research question, three levels of generativity operationalized in concept mapping strategies produced significantly different levels of effectiveness for knowledge acquisition (F=3.094; p=.016; Wilk's Lambda=.939). Tukey post hoc comparisons showed that the expert-generated concept map group outperformed the partially learner-generated concept map group in factual knowledge, while the expert-generated concept map group outperformed both the partially learner-generated concept map group and the fully learner-generated concept map group in conceptual knowledge. Regarding the second research question, self-regulated learning skills caused significant difference in factual knowledge (F=7.627, p=.006). Regarding the third research question, no significant interaction was found, when using MANOVA, between the levels of generativity in concept mapping and the levels of self-regulated learning skills. However, regression analysis indicated that the higher the participants' self-regulated learning skills, the higher the factual knowledge acquisition score, only for the expert-generated concept map group and partially learner-generated concept map group. Regarding the last research question on knowledge representation, a significant effect of the levels of self-regulated learning skills was found in proposition quality, overall quality, and the quantity of proposition (F=3.004; p=.037; Wilk's Lambda=.880).

It suggests that blogs perform three main functions, which help make a democracy more meaningful: blogs as fifth estate, blogs as networks, and blogs as platform for expression. First, blogs function as the fifth estate performing checks-and-balances over the government. This function is expressed by blogs\u2019 role in the dissemination of information, providing alternative perspectives that challenge the dominant frame, and setting of news agenda. The second function of blogs is that they perform as networks. This is linked to the social-networking aspect of the blogosphere both online and offline. Blogs also have the potential to act as mobilizing agents. The mobilizing capability of blogs facilitated the mass street protests, which took place in late-2007 and early-2008 in Malaysia. Thirdly, blogs function as a platform where users can express themselves. The significance of this function becomes more apparent in countries with strict media control such as Malaysia. Blogging allows users to directly publish their thoughts, unfiltered and uncensored, by circumventing conventional mechanisms of control. It is a platform that is nearly cost-free and easy-to-use. Blogs also act as a training ground for self-expression not just for the bloggers but for readers of the blogs as well. The three functions are not mutually exclusive but are merely viewed as having enough unique qualities to be differentiated from one another. Some features do overlap, for example, the mobilization of people to participate in mass rallies could not have happened without the dissemination of the news about the rallies, and readers would have very little to comment on if the information of the rallies was not posted by the bloggers after they had taken place. This study complements existing research on mass media and democratic movement. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4483], "author_name_tesi": "Lim, Ming Kuok ", "last_name_ssi": "Lim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ming Kuok", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amit Schejter", "Amit Schejter", "Richard Denny Taylor", "Jorge R Schement", "John Philip Christman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Amit Schejter, Dissertation Advisor", "Amit Schejter, Committee Chair", "Richard Denny Taylor, Committee Member", "Jorge R Schement, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Political Communications", "Web 2.0", "User-generated Content", "Blogs", "Malaysian Politics", "New Media", "Deliberative Democracy", "Southeast Asia"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Development and Characterization of Direct Ethanol Fuel Cells Using Alkaline Anion-Exchange Membranes\n", "id": "9302", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5009", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-01-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Alkaline membrane fuel cell (AMFC) is a relatively new fuel cell technology that is generating considerable interests.  It offers the electrocatalytic advantages of conventional alkaline fuel cells, and the manufacturing and cost advantages of solid polymer electrolyte fuel cells.  This project was carried out to develop and characterize high performance membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for all-solid-state AMFCs.  The primary fuel of interests is ethanol, but hydrogen was used in the development stages to facilitate the diagnostic and evaluation of the fuel cell performance.\n\nIn the preliminary investigation, AMFC was assembled using off-the-shelf electrodes and anion-exchange membrane (AEM).  It was found that the performance of AMFC operating on ethanol fuel was limited by a large high-frequency resistance (HFR) value.  The advantage of using non-toxic ethanol fuel was also compromised by the need to add hydrazine and potassium hydroxide to the fuel blend.  \n\nSubsequently, a high performance MEA was developed for an all-solid-state AMFC, in which liquid electrolyte or other additives were not required during the operation of the fuel cell.  Ionomer was incorporated in the formulation of catalyst ink, and the catalyst ink was directly coated on the anion-exchange membrane (AEM).  An ionomer content of 20 wt.% was found to be the optimum amount required in the catalyst layers.  It was demonstrated that the AMFC generated a maximum power density of 365 mW/cm2 and 213 mW/cm2 with the use of hydrogen/oxygen and hydrogen/pure air, respectively.  The performance of the AMFC was also found to be influenced by exposure to carbon dioxide in the air.  Hence, the CCMs were pre-treated in potassium hydroxide solution and pure oxygen was used to condition the fuel cell to maximize the power output from the AMFCs.  Although satisfactory performance was demonstrated in the AMFC, its stability during cell operation remains a major issue.  The poor stability was attributed to degradation of ionomer in the catalyst layers, especially at the catalyst/ionomer interfaces.\n\nEthanol was also used as a fuel in the AMFC with newly developed MEAs.  Wet-proof gas diffusion layers (GDLs) was found to enhance mass transport in liquid-fed AMFC.  With the use of 1M ethanol, the AMFC exhibited a maximum power density of 6.482 mW/cm2 and 3.380 mW/cm2 with pure oxygen and ambient air as oxidant, respectively.  These maximum power density values are the highest reported to-date.  However, significant work is still necessary in advancing the AMFC technology for direct alcohol fuel cell applications.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4985], "author_name_tesi": "Lim, Peck Cheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Lim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Peck Cheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Chao Yang Wang", "Long Qing Chen", "Qing Wang", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Membrane-Electrode Assembly", "Anion-Exchange Membrane", "Alkaline Membrane Fuel Cell", "Hydrogen", "Ethanol"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Managing Performance And Energy In Large Scale\ndata Centers\n", "id": "13794", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6082", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Data centers are the computing facilities to process, store, and access information.\nSpecifically, data centers serve as the key infrastructure for Cloud computing service providers.\nHowever, service providers have observed the trend of the under-utilization of production servers, which unnecessarily increases the total cost of ownership.\nThe demand on managing the total cost of ownership is driving researchers to study both performance and energy issues in data centers, which are addressed in this thesis.\nFor considering performance and energy, this thesis consists three contributions -- design of a comprehensive multi-tier data center simulation platform;

Data-driven event detection and prediction provide valuable current and future knowledge not only to large organizations, such as enterprises and hospitals, but also to individuals, such as customers and patients, respectively. In particular, textual data have been widely used as a primary knowledge source for data-driven event detection and prediction, since 80 percent of the digital data that have been generated by society today originates in unstructured textual form. Unfortunately, existing studies on text-data-driven event detection and prediction typically employ top-down machine learning methods, which are constrained by their need for (1) datasets of examples for training the models or (2) predetermined search keywords. However, in many cases, generating datasets of examples is an expensive process and impractical for many real-world applications. Furthermore, it is also difficult to use predetermined indicators for new event detection and prediction. \n\nThe objective of this dissertation is to create bottom-up machine learning models, which do not require datasets of examples for training the models or predetermined search keywords, for text-data-driven event detection and prediction. The bottom-up machine learning models reduce type I and type II identification errors during the process of text-data-driven event detection and prediction. Reducing type I identification errors (i.e., false positives) is crucial for decreasing the misidentification of irrelevant data as relevant data, as such errors reduce the quality of necessary data needed for event detection and prediction. Reducing type II identification errors (i.e., false negatives) is also important, because increasing the size of correctly identified data can improve the quantity of necessary data needed for event detection and prediction. \n\nIn particular, this research uses online user generated data, such as social media data, as a knowledge source for event detection and prediction due to (1) the availability of user opinions related to a wide range of topics (from a user\u2019s perspective); (2) the ability to acquire user feedback in real-time and at a low-cost (from an analyst\u2019s perspective); and (3) the size and heterogeneity of the data. \n\nIn this dissertation, first, a Bayesian sampling model is presented for determining appropriate search keywords that reduce type I and type II identification errors when detecting events, such as detecting users\u2019 feedback on product features or users\u2019 medical conditions. Second, a clustering-based model using sentiment analysis is proposed for detecting the spread of events, such as detecting the spread of positive/negative online user feedback or the spread of a latent disease(s). Third, a causal analysis model based on word co-occurrence networks and Ganger causality analysis is provided for event prediction, such as predicting the spread of positive/negative user generated content or future enterprise outcomes.

To further this goal, a micrometeorological field campaign was conducted between the months of Aril and July of 2009 at Rock Springs, Pennsylvania. Five CSAT3 sonic anemometers were mounted on a telephone pole at heights ranging from 0.5 m to 10 m and operated continuously at a frequency of 20 Hz for the duration of the experiment. Structure functions and turbulence spectra were computed from the data during quasi steady-state periods, and were used to calculate isotropy ratios and to estimate the TKE dissipation rates. Spectral dissipation rates show heavy dependence on corrections to Taylor\u2019s hypothesis and spectral tapering, and significant error is introduced if these corrections are not made. As has been demonstrated in previous studies, results confirm that Kolmogorov\u2019s four-fifths law consistently underestimates the TKE dissipation rate when compared to other indirect methods. Although our results show the third-order structure functions becoming more isotropic with height in the ensemble mean, the dissipation rates obtained from the four-fifths law fail to improve with height. We conclude that the spectral dissipation rate estimates are superior to those estimated from the four-fifths law and the second-order structure function for two main reasons: the spectrum shows a broader inertial subrange with better scaling at all heights, and local isotropy holds better for the spectra at all heights.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2510], "author_name_tesi": "Limbacher, James Alan ", "last_name_ssi": "Limbacher", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan ", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marcelo Chamecki", "Marcelo Chamecki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marcelo Chamecki, Thesis Advisor", "Marcelo Chamecki, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["TKE", "dissipation rate", "atmospheric surface layer", "turbulence"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON DEVELOPMENT AND FITNESS OF ASIAN GYPSY MOTH AND THE BIOCONTROL AGENT OF HEMLOCK WOOLLY ADELGID, SCYMNUS CAMPTODROMUS ", "id": "13646szl175", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13646", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The recent rise in mean annual temperature along with growth and advancement in international trade have accelerated the rate of invasion by exotic species throughout the world. Around 50,000 non-native species have been estimated to be introduced into the US (Pimental et al. 2004). Exotic species have often become pests and have caused substantial disturbances to forest and agricultural ecosystem, threatened the biodiversity, and has the potential for severe economic impacts.  Hemlock woolly adelgid, Adelges tsugae (Annand) (Hemiptera: Adelgidae) and gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) are examples of two non-native insects that have seriously threatened urban and forest ecosystem in the US. Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) since its initial introduction has steadily expanded its range in the eastern US and caused extensive damage to hemlock stands. This insect is now considered as the single most important threat to native hemlock stands in the eastern US. Similarly, gypsy moth is a major defoliator of numerous tree species in most of the northern hemisphere. In North America, the gypsy moth of European origin has been present for over 145 years and has decimated hardwood forests. Recently, introductions of Asian subspecies of L. dispar have been detected in North America potentially through international trade and it is considered a greater threat to the commercial and urban forest than the European counterparts.\nNot all non-native species have a negative impact because most of them do not survive in a new environment. Environmental barriers can prevent introduced species from establishing in a new location.  Thus, invasion success is more likely when climatic conditions in the introduced area are similar to the native habitat of the exotic species (Walther et al. 2009).  Because insect is ectotherms, temperature has a significant impact on their survival. Understanding the potential of the non-native species to colonize and establish in a new environment requires a thorough knowledge on effects of temperature on the life history of the insect. We examined the effects of temperature on growth, development and fitness of two insect species: Scymnus camptodromus and Asian gypsy moth.  \nIn an attempt to control HWA population in the eastern US, several predators were introduced from outside the pest\u2019s native range and Scymnus (Neopullus) camptodromus Yu and Liu (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) was one of them. It is a predacious lady beetle brought to the US from China as one of the potential biological control agents of HWA. The lady beetle\u2019s phenology is closely synchronized with that of HWA and has several characteristics of a promising biological control agent.  As a prerequisite to field release, we first evaluated the potential non-target impacts of S. camptodromus.  In host range studies, the predator was given the choice of adelgid and non-adelgid prey items.  Non-target testing showed that S. camptodromus will feed to some degree on other adelgid species, but highly prefers HWA.  We also evaluated the larval development of the predator on other adelgid species and only a small proportion of predator larvae were able to develop to adulthood.  S. camptodromus showed minimum interest in feeding on the non-adelgid species tested in choice and no-choice experiments.  S. camptodromus females did not oviposit on any host material other than HWA infested hemlock.  Under the circumstances of the study, S. camptodromus appears to be a specific predator of HWA, with minimal risk to non-target species.  \nWe also evaluated the effect of temperature on S. camptodromus larval development time and predation by instar and strain (geographical population). We observed that temperature had significant effects on the predator's life history.  The larvae tended to develop faster and consume more eggs of HWA per day as rearing temperature increased.  Mean egg consumption per day of HWA was significantly less at 15 than at 20 \uf0b0C.  However, since larvae took longer to develop at the lower temperature, the total number of eggs consumed per instar during larval development did not differ significantly between the two temperatures.  The lower temperature threshold for predator larval development was estimated to be 5 \uf0b0C and the accumulated degree-days for 50% of the predator neonates to reach adulthood were estimated to be 424.  Although temperature had a significant effect on larval development and predation, it did not impact survival, size or sex ratio of the predator at 15 and 20 \uf0b0C.  Furthermore, no remarkable distinctions were observed among different geographical populations of the predator. These findings on developmental rates, degree-day requirements, and predator consumption provide baseline data for developing mass rearing procedures and planning field releases of S. camptodromus. \nFor Asian gypsy moth, because it is not yet an established pest, our goal was to develop phenology models of AGM strains in response to temperature to facilitate detection and management/eradication efforts. Predicting phenology of the Asian gypsy moth is critical for monitoring and management.  For instance, Bacillus thuringiensis kurstaki (Btk), a preferred treatment for Asian gypsy moth control, is most effective if applied to the early second instar (Reardon et al. 1994). Currently, phenology of the gypsy moth is predicted based on the European subspecies and by climate matching, which may not be accurate for the Asian subspecies. In this study we evaluated the development of eight strains of AGM from a broad range of geographic latitudes reared on artificial diet at five constant temperatures (10-30 \u00b0C). Our results suggest that AGM larvae developed faster as rearing temperature increased until it reached an optimum at 29 \u00b0C.  Larvae displayed significant molting problems at the highest and lowest temperatures tested (10 and 30 \u00b0C), and at 30 \u00b0C female fitness was markedly compromised, as evidenced by reduced fecundity and fertility.  These findings suggest that development and survival of Asian gypsy moth may be limited by summer temperature extremes in the southern US.  We also determined the degree-day requirements for two critical life stages (from egg hatch to second instar and egg hatch to adult) to predict the timing for both bio-pesticide application and adult trapping. Our data will benefit pest managers in developing management strategies, pest risk assessments, and timing for implementation of management tactics.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14433], "author_name_tesi": "Limbu, Samita ", "last_name_ssi": "Limbu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Samita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kelli Hoover", "Kelli Hoover", "Melody Keena", "Edwin G Rajotte", "Jim Sellmer", "Mary Barbercheck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kelli Hoover, Dissertation Advisor", "Kelli Hoover, Committee Chair", "Melody Keena, Committee Member", "Edwin G Rajotte, Committee Member", "Jim Sellmer, Outside Member", "Mary Barbercheck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hemlock woolly adelgid", "Scymnus camptodromus", "Asian gypsy moth", "Temperature", "Development time", "Degree-day", "Host range specificity"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "ASSESSING THE VIABILITY OF MEDIATED EXERCISE COMPANIONS IN MOTIVATING FUTURE EXERCISE INTENTIONS: AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION OF TRADITIONAL AND ADVANCED\nFORMS OF EXERCISE MEDIA\n\n", "id": "12092", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "279", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research has generally shown that video games can be effective at teaching and persuading individuals engage in certain behaviors and outcomes (e.g., Baranowski, Buday, Thompson, & Baranowski, 2008; Lee, Peng, & Park, 2009).

Thus, I attempted to develop the theoretical groundwork for a tool that addresses this cartographic challenge. Evaluation of previous work on visual contrast, visual hierarchy, Gestalt object perception theories, map layout and organization, and map aesthetics were used to determine design configurations of these visual components. These configurations were tested as comprehensive visual contrast schemes in a user study.

The perceived clarity of visual hierarchy of a map was shown to positively correlate with the perceived aesthetic value. Further, this perceived clarity of visual hierarchy and map aesthetics were most highly rated on map contrast schemes with high lightness contrast in combination with low hue contrast. The inclusion of high line contrast to this configuration was shown to nominally improve this preference further. The results lay the empirical and theoretical foundation for an application that provides users with definitive map design schemes that preserve visual contrast and hierarchy relations through scales in multi-scale map displays.

The huge amount of data about users\u2019 activities and personal information are collected and analyzed to improve the quality of service or to serve as scientific research data. However, the individual\u2019s privacy may not be protected.\n\nThe protection of privacy relies on the privacy definitions. Privacy definitions act as a contract defines the behavior of algorithms on processing sensitive data and producing non-sensitive sanitized data. Most of privacy definitions are constructed from intuition and intuition alone leads us astray. Examples include the release of AOL search log and Netflix competition dataset. The released data were anonymized based on intuition but, only a few days later, the journalist and researchers figure out means to identify people in the dataset. One goal of this thesis is to provide a systematic approach to extract semantic guarantees of privacy definitions.\n\nMost of privacy definitions are constructed from intuition. In most cases, it is not clear what these privacy definitions actually guarantee. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first general framework for extracting semantic guarantees from privacy definitions. The privacy guarantees we can extract are Bayesian in nature and deal with changes in an attacker\u2019s beliefs. The framework can be applied to privacy definitions or even to individual algorithms to identify the types of inferences they defend against. We illustrate the use of our framework with analyses of several definitions and algorithms for which we can derive previously unknown semantics.\n\nThe other goal of this thesis is to systematically study utility measures via the first principle approach. The privacy definitions constrain the behavior of privacy algorithms. The utility measures are designed to help to choose which privacy algorithm to be used to process the sensitive data. In statistical privacy, utility refers to two concepts: information preservation \u2013 how much statistical information is retained by a sanitizing algorithm, and usability \u2013 how (and with how much difficulty) does one extract this information to build statistical models, answer queries, etc. We analyze the information-preserving properties of utility measures with utility axioms and study how violations of an axiom can be fixed. We show that the average error of Bayesian decision makers forms the unique class of utility measures that satisfy all of the axioms. The axioms are agnostic to Bayesian concepts such as subjective probabilities and hence strengthen support for Bayesian views in privacy research. This result connects information preservation to aspect of usability. Utility is measured in Bayesian manner. Shouldn\u2019t Bayesian decision theory be a good choice to work with sanitized data?

Building cooling heating and power (BCHP) is considered a promising and affordable technology to reduce primary energy consumption, fuel costs and greenhouse gases emissions. The BCHP system simultaneously produces electricity and heat to achieve the high system fuel utilization efficiency. The wider implementation of BCHP system can further increase the reliability of the grid power system, fuel diversity and national security.\nIn this research, a comprehensive factor evaluation method of BCHP system implementation potential is presented. From the analysis, the top seven states are identified as most suitable to utilize technology. The realization of BCHP benefits depends on the system selection, integration and operation. The research further examined the effect of different types and number of primer movers, absorption cooling, vapor compression cooling, operational strategies on the performance of system, and, consequently, CHP system adoption. The IC engine and microturbine are the two major groups of prime mover systems. 32 different system combinations are calculated and compared for annual primary energy consumption, fuel cost; greenhouses gas emissions, system fuel utilization efficiency and overall building energy efficiency. From the results, the overall best performance scenario is selected and further optimized. In the operational strategy optimization, linear programming is the algorithm. In this optimization, objective functions and constraints are developed and defined.\nThe research results show that the implementation of an appropriate BCHP system can effectively reduce primary energy consumption, fuel cost and emission in residential buildings.

Two advanced and robust variable selection techniques -Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and Variable Selection though Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation Penalty (SCAD) - are implemented as part of the regression based model development. It is established that independent variables determined to be important in influencing building energy models use should be metered prior to the building retrofit or audit. \n\nA medium sized office building developed by U.S Department of Energy (DOE), also known as the DOE commercial reference buildings is utilized to develop the model formulation methodology. The building represents an average condition of numerous buildings in the US medium size office building sector. The \u201ctypical\u201d office building condition is established as a baseline model case for the analysis.  Input data variation, models generations and independent variable selections are determined using the baseline building through the use of EnergyPlus and Matlab tools. Multi-variant regression models are formulated for whole building energy utilization, the cooling system and heating sub-system utilization. Statistical indices indicate that the models developed though the two methods are valid and effective in confidently predicting building energy utilization. Though the LASSO and SCAD variable selection techniques, key variables that are statistically significant to building energy use are identified. Those variables should be given priority in any building monitoring plan as their characterization with assist in energy utilization analyses to continuously improve building energy performance.\n\nIn addition to establishing inverse model formulation though variable selection techniques, this investigation developed a variation bin method to identify \u201cinefficient\u201d sub-system utilization in building energy use. The idea of bin method is to compare energy variation of sub-systems\u2019 data by excluding impacts from ambient weather conditions. The advantages of this method are obvious. Firstly, it is easy and straightforward to apply. Secondly, it can be applied to the entire metered sub-systems data.\n\nThe methodology is used to formulate as-operated, low variance forward building energy models. Forward building energy models enables parametric analysis to evaluate design or renovation strategies. It allows energy efficiency estimates that can be achieved by implementation of energy standards or codes and assists in application for design certifications. As-operated building energy models are often developed to assist energy conservation measures (ECMs) design and evaluation. The methodology developed in this investigation results in an actual data based, sub-system focused energy model. The methodology avoids trial and error, time consuming, labor intensive approaches.  The model is considered calibrated when simulated heating, cooling, plug and lighting sub-systems end use and whole building energy use meet predefined statistical criteria. Two medium size office buildings in Pennsylvania are selected as case studies and show that the method is valid and efficient. Monthly and weekday daily comparisons indicate that simulated results satisfy statistical criteria and models are considered as calibrated.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11331], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Bo ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Freihaut", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba", "Stephen James Treado", "Runze Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Freihaut, Dissertation Advisor", "Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba, Committee Member", "Stephen James Treado, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Inverse model", "energy model", "calibration", "measurement & verification", "sub-metering", "variable selection", "benchmark", "audit"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A BIDDING DECISION MODEL FOR SMEs", "id": "12896czl186", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12896", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A bidding decision model describing the bidding patterns of competitors by triangular distribution is developed for small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

During rocket motor operation, nozzle surface are subjected to thermalchemical erosion by oxidizing gaseous species such as H2O , OH and, CO2 and/or mechanical erosion by impinging aluminum oxides when metallized propellants are used. The throat area undergoes the extreme heat transfer, thereby decreasing the thrust and causing severe performance reduction of the propulsion system. Accordingly, detailed understanding of the erosion mechanism is desirable. Shear and normal forces on the nozzle surface, temperature, pressure, heat transfer to the wall, particle impacts, chemical kinetics, and surface melting are considered primary factors of nozzle erosion. Various aspects that are closely related to the nozzle recession processes conducted by several research groups are summarized. \nIn order to reduce the overall recession rate of the nozzle, the nozzle boundary-layer controlled system (NBLCS) has been introduced and shown the effectiveness in mitigation of the nozzle erosion. This method produces relatively low product gases to be injected into the upstream of the nozzle throat section, which not only reduces the concentration of the oxidizing species but also cools down the hot combustion product gases in the boundary layer region near the throat. Refractory materials like tungsten (W) , plays a significant role in overall nozzle erosion mechanism due to its high melting temperature. However, heterogeneous reaction kinetics must be carefully examined and modeled since tungsten oxidation by several oxidizing species such as CO2, CO and O2 could generate metal compounds with lower vaporization and/or melting temperatures. These compounds may be removed from the nozzle surface as fast as they are forms, either by vaporization or surface forces, thereby expanding the nozzle throat area and reducing overall performance. \nTo increase the operating condition range and performance of a future rocket propulsion system, understanding the rocket nozzle erosion processes and developing methods for nozzle erosion reduction are vitally important. Thus, quantitative and qualitative experimental studies and theoretical simulations are required to be advanced due to the complexity involved in the rocket nozzle erosion characteristics.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1169], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Chia-Yung ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chia-Yung", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth K Kuo", "Kenneth K Kuo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth K Kuo, Thesis Advisor", "Kenneth K Kuo, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["rocket nozzle erosion"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF THE U12-TYPE SPLICEOSOMAL INTRONS IN MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS\n", "id": "8611", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1257", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many multicellular eukaryotes have two types of spliceosome for the removal of introns from messenger RNA precursors.  The major (U2) -type spliceosome processes the vast majority of introns, while the minor (U12) -type spliceosome removes the small fraction (less than 0.5%) of introns referred to as U12-type introns.  U12-type introns have distinct sequence elements, and mostly occur in genes together with U2-type introns.  A phylogeny of species with and without U12-type introns shows that the minor splicing pathway has been lost repeatedly in evolution. With four parallel and one shared snRNPs, the two spliceosome function in a similar, cooperative, and competitive manner. The possibility of U12-introns converting to U2-type introns make the evolutionary dynamics of U12-type introns more complicated than just gain and loss. The studies in this thesis include computational identification and characterization of U12-type introns, and the evolutionary dynamics of U12-type introns.\n\nI have investigated the evolution of U12-type introns among 18 metazoan genomes by analyzing orthologous U12-type intron clusters.  Examination of gain, loss and type switching shows that intron type is remarkably conserved among vertebrates.  Among 180 intron clusters, only eight show intron loss in any species and only five show U12 to U2 conversion.  In contrast to the other insect species investigated, Dipteran genomes are characterized by a rapid evolution (or loss) of components of the U12 spliceosome and a striking loss of U12-type introns.  Nevertheless, we find one case of U2 to U12 conversion, apparently mediated by activation of a cryptic U12 splice site, in Diptera.  Overall, loss of U12-type introns is more common than conversion to U2-type.  U12 to U2 conversion occurs more frequently among introns of the GT-AG subtype.  I also found support for natural U12-type introns with non-canonical terminal dinucleotides (CT-AC, GG-AG, and GA-AG) that have not been reported previously.\n\nMy most salient finding is that U12 introns are extremely stable in some taxa, including eutheria.  U12-type intron loss is more frequent than conversion to the major type.  The degeneracy of U12-type terminal dinucleotides among natural U12-type introns is higher than previously thought.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1246], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Chiao-Feng ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chiao-Feng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wojciech Makalowski", "Edward C Holmes", "Webb Colby Miller", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Stephen M Mount"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wojciech Makalowski, Committee Chair", "Edward C Holmes, Committee Chair", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Stephen M Mount, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["spliceosomal introns", "U12-type intron", "intron evolution"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Nano-structured TiO2 And Applications To Energy Harvesting", "id": "23342", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9749", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dye-sensitized solar cells have been developed for two decades. However, the highest light-to-electricity power conversion efficiency still remains at ~11 percent based on TiO2 nanoparticle-thin film with thickness of over 10\u03bcm for many years. One of the main issues for further enhancement of the power conversion efficiency in dye-sensitized solar cells, as the analyses of their parameters show, is the fundamental tradeoff between light-harvesting efficiency and the recombination rate in the photoelectrodes of dye-sensitized solar cells. How to develop a novel electrode to maintain a high light-harvesting efficiency and provide good charge transport properties remains a major issue.\n    Three-dimensional (3-D) titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoforests with a large surface area and high-electron transport properties have been successfully synthesized on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate by using a unique multi-step hydrothermal synthesizing process. First, TiO2 nanorods with well-controlled density and length are grown on TCO glass substrate. TiO2 nanowires are then synthesized on TiO2 nanorods with another hydrothermal process. In comparison with previously reported one-dimensional (1-D) TiO2 nanorod arrays, TiO2 nanoforests offer a larger surface area for the same height, which is beneficial for achieving a higher-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). The experimental results confirm that a conversion efficiency of 3.93 percent can be achieved with a 5.1\u03bcm long TiO2 nanoforest-based DSSC.\n    According to the previous research, electrons have better charge transport ability in anatase TiO2 than rutile TiO2. A novel method to grow single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowires was proposed. A bulk-like TiO2 thin film was deposited on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate to act as a protective layer of TCO substrate and a starting material for hydrothermal synthesis in a strong alkaline solution (10M NaOH). After the hydrothermal process, Na2Ti3O7 nanowires were synthesized on TCO substrate. Single crystal anatase nanowires were successfully synthesized on TCO substrate after ion exchange and annealing. The light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on 2.2 \u03bcm anatase nanowires reaches 5.2 percent, which was the highest efficiency of single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowire-based DSSCs realized in early 2012.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9500], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Chih-min ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chih-min", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shizhuo Yin", "Shizhuo Yin", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Julio Urbina", "Qi Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shizhuo Yin, Dissertation Advisor", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Chair", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "Qi Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dye-sensitized solar cell", "nanoforests", "single crystal anatase TiO2 nanowires"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Novel Generative Semisupervised Learning Based on Fine-Grained Component-Conditional Class Labeling\n", "id": "12029", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1178", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation presents novel generative semisupervised mixtures with more fine-grained class label generation mechanisms than in previous semisupervised learning works. The proposed fine-grained models combine advantages of  semisupervised mixtures, which achieve label extrapolation over a component, and\nnearest-neighbor(NN)/nearest-prototype classification, which achieve accurate classification in the vicinity of labeled samples.\nThis dissertation includes several two-stage stochastic data generation mechanisms\nwhich involve first generating all the feature data and then, for the labeled data subset, generating each class label, not directly according to a component density, but rather based on unlabeled samples that were generated according to the component density.\nVariants of the proposed methods differ in whether or not class decisionmaking requires transduction. This generation mechanisms entail more\nsophisticated, exact E-step evaluations than for\nstandard mixtures. These form the basis for generalized EM algorithms for learning. The proposed models are advantageous, compared to\nprevious semisupervised mixtures, when within-component class proportions are not constant over the feature space region \"owned by\" a component. The practicality of this scenario is borne out by\nour experiments on UC Irvine data sets, which demonstrate consistent, substantial gains in classification accuracy over previous semisupervised mixtures and over both standard KNN and within-component KNN classification. Moreover, for small labeled fractions, the fine-grained methods also outperform supervised linear and\nnonlinear kernel support vector machines. For clustering and density estimation, the proposed methods outperform previous semisupervised\napproaches, but only give better results than standard unsupervised mixtures when there is both significant true component overlap and sufficient labeled examples to disambiguate components.\nWe extend the original inductive fine-grained model by incorporating active learning methods. We propose two new uncertainty sampling methods in comparison with traditional entropy-based uncertainty sampling. Our experiments on UC\nIrvine data sets validate that the proposed active learning methods improve classification accuracy more than standard entropy-based active learning, especially when the labeled percentage is small. Moreover, we extend our inductive fine-grained model by introducing variable weighting to modulate the influence of samples and labels on EM parameter estimation. This new approach is shown to outperform previous weighting schemes.\n\nAnother area where a significant amount of research is conducted to reduce supervision is image segmentation. We propose a three-dimensional (3D) tissue delineation framework to address the challenging of segmenting soft tissues in computed tomography (CT) images from diverse body types with little supervision. Conventional image processing methods are not suitable for automated delineation of soft tissue boundaries in CT image due to low contrast between soft tissues the variability in tissue location, shape, and size. To overcome these limitations, we have introduced a novel procedure, making use of a standard labeled template and an abdominal probabilistic atlas.\nOur algorithm seeks to find an optimal 3D tissue mapping to each new individual. The mappings are chosen to minimize a customized cost function\nthat enforces tissue contiguity and relative tissue locations while accounting for tissue variability across individuals. Tissue boundaries in CT images that are missing due to low contrast are extrapolated using boundary information and anatomical knowledge from the mapped labeled template and the probabilistic atlas. Our approach leads to satisfactory tissue delineations for diverse body types. \nWe view the tissue segmentation task as a classification problem and apply semisupervised learning on CT images. A mixture of expert classifier is applied on the CT soft tissue segment, which comprises multiple soft tissues, to further classify individual tissues. By extracting texture and distance features from the standard anatomical images in addition to gray-scale intensity from patient-specific CT images, we are able to classify seven soft tissues. A future work that combines our fine-grained models with the tissue delineation framework is suggested to obtain more accurate soft tissue segmentation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1166], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Chu-Fang ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chu-Fang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Jonathan Miller", "David Jonathan Miller", "George Kesidis", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "Christopher Collins", "Kenneth K Kuo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Jonathan Miller, Dissertation Advisor", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Chair", "George Kesidis, Committee Member", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", "Christopher Collins, Committee Member", "Kenneth K Kuo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nearest neighbor classification", "mixture models", "inductive inference", "generative models", "semisupervised learning", "Expectation- Maximization algorithm"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "AN EXPLORATION ON THE USE OF DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS IN THE PRODUCT DESIGN DOMAIN\n\n\n", "id": "9666", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1299", "abstract_tesi": "In engineering design domain, product design\t process is a major focus.

Multiple-generation products involve a single product line that is modified and dispersed over a time period. As an example, Apple recently released four generations of iPhones\u2014a strategy that resulted in great market success. Adopting such a strategy elongates the entire life cycle of a product and relaxes its development time span, thus allowing companies to better utilize their resources and technologies to plan for better products. \nThis research proposes a new framework to aid companies in designing a forward-looking, multiple-generation product line at the early product design stage. It adopts recent developments from the behavioral ecology field where a product line is considered to be a living organism, while related potential market events and decisions are regarded as behaviors. Within this framework, the problem is modeled using a dynamic state variable model in which the behaviors of the multiple-generation product line are assumed to occur stochastically. The results indicate optimal operational strategies related to the life cycle of the product line and can be used to predict both the performance and the optimal introduction timing for each generation. \nThe proposed framework includes two market scenarios. One scenario is the complete replacement scenario, the situation in which the successive product generation fully substitutes the current one. The second scenario, the cannibalization scenario, assumes that multiple-generation of products cannibalize sales in the same market. We propose different models for each market scenario and provide several illustrative case studies to show the validity of the proposed models. For the complete replacement scenario, we implement IBM mainframe product line data and compare the output results to those from the published work using the same data. We use the Apple iPhone product line to verify three instances of the cannibalization scenario. These include a) applying limit terms of data to predict the overall lifetime performance of an on-going multiple-generation product line, b) predicting the lifetime performance of a brand new product line based on an existing or on-going product line, and c) applying limit terms of sales data to predict the lifetime performance of a multiple-generation product line involving a single evolving technology. The results indicate that the proposed framework can closely predict the lifetime performance of a multiple-generation product line.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8128], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Chun-yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chun-yu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gul Kremer", "Timothy William Simpson", "Andris Freivalds", "Charles David Ray Sr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gul Kremer, Dissertation Advisor", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Chair", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "Charles David Ray Sr., Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dynamic State Variable Model", "Multiple generation product line"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Faming Hedonic and Utilitarian Product Attributes in Advertisements: The Impact of Regulatory Fit on Persuasion ", "id": "7604", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2287", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A number of studies have examined regulatory fit, a match between the means through which people pursue their goals and their goal orientation, in the area of consumer psychology.

Based on prior research, this study posits that the framing of hedonic and utilitarian product attributes can interact with regulatory focus in influencing individuals\u00a1\u00a6 evaluations of both the brand and the advertisement. It is further hypothesized that fit between the message framing of product attributes and one\u00a1\u00a6s regulatory focus is expected to lead to greater message framing effects. These propositions were tested in an experiment with a 2 x 2 x 2 between-subjects design. The first factor, regulatory focus (promotion vs. prevention), was manipulated by asking students to list their ideals and oughts as well as complete a paper-and-pencil maze. The other two factors, product attributes (hedonic vs. utilitarian) and message framing (gain vs. loss), were manipulated through the copies of two print advertisements. Message effects were measured by brand attitude, attitude toward the advertisement, and purchase intention. A total of 215 subjects participated in this study. \nFindings revealed several significant effects of regulatory focus on evaluations of hedonic and utilitarian product attributes. When the attributes emphasized in advertisements fit individuals\u00a1\u00a6 regulatory orientation, stronger attitude towards brand and advertisement as well as greater purchase intention were induced. Furthermore, when product attributes emphasized in a gain or loss frame fit one\u00a1\u00a6s regulatory focus, stronger attitudes toward brands and advertisements were found. Consistent with prior research, when promotion-focused individuals are exposed to advertisements framing hedonic attributes as a gain, they are more likely to engage in heuristic processing than when exposed to advertisements framing utilitarian attributes as a loss. On the other hand, when prevention-focused individuals are exposed to advertisements framing utilitarian attributes as losses, they are more likely to engage in systematic processing than when exposed to advertisements framing hedonic attributes as a gain. Ease of process was found to be a significant mediator between regulatory focus and message framing. These results extended prior research findings on framing and regulatory focus.

The instructional module used in this study contained a 2,000-word physiology unit focusing on the human heart, its parts, locations, and functions during the diastolic and systolic phases (Dwyer & Lamberski, 1977). \nThe data analysis was composed of two phases. The first phase analyzed data that included all items in the four criterion posttests (80 items) plus a composite score. The second phase analyzed data that included enhanced items only (34 items), plus a composite score that was calculated based on these 34 items. In addition, the amount of time spent on the task (time-on-task) was entered into the analysis as a covariate in both phases of data analysis. \nThe results of the study indicated that there was no interaction between visual type and instructional strategy on all criterion posttests or the composite score across the two phases of analysis. Students who received either the animated or static visual treatments did not score differently for the level of instructional strategy they received.  However, the main effect of visual type and instructional strategy was detected on some criterion posttests. For the visual type, students who received the animated visual treatment scored significantly higher on all criterion posttests than those who received the static visual treatment. For the instructional strategy, students who received the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions+Feedback\u00e2\u20ac\u009d scored significantly higher than those who received \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No strategy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on both the terminology and comprehension tests. In addition, students who received the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d treatment scored significantly higher than those who received \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No strategy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d on the terminology test. All observed differences between the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions+Feedback\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d treatments failed to reach statistical significance at the .05 level. \nIn regard to the second phase of the analysis, the result indicated that students who received animated visuals scored significantly higher than those who received static visuals on the drawing, terminology, and comprehension criterion posttests. Students who received animated visuals also had a significantly better overall performance than those who received the static visual treatment as indicated from the composite score of the 34 enhanced items. In regard to the instructional strategy, students who received the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions+Feedback\u00e2\u20ac\u009d treatment scored significantly higher than those who received the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No strategy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d treatment on the terminology and comprehension criterion posttests in addition to a higher composite score. Students who received the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d treatment scored significantly higher than those who received \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No strategy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d only in the terminology criterion posttest. All observed differences between \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions+Feedback\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d failed to reach significant differences at the .05 level. The data analysis on the time-on-task for each treatment group yielded different results. Students who received the animated visual treatment spent significantly more time on the instruction than those who received the static visual treatment. Students in both the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions+Feedback\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d treatment groups spent significantly more time in studying the material than those who received \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No strategy.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d However, no significant differences on instructional time were found between \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions+Feedback.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Considering that the amount of time needed to engage in the learning task may contribute to the students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 learning achievement, a series of follow-up analyses holding the time constant were conducted. \nThe results, when adjusting for the time-on-task, indicated that the relationship observed from the initial analysis, where the time-on-task was not controlled, was inflated. There was no interaction between the visual type and the instructional strategy on all criterion posttests or the composite score across the two phases of analysis. Furthermore, no significant differences between the static and animated treatments on all criterion posttests were observed in the first phase of the analysis. In the second phase of the analysis, however, the students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 achievement on the drawing test was effectively facilitated by the animated visuals while their achievement on the other three tests was not significantly different. In addition, when controlling for the time-on-task, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No strategy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d was found to be significantly more effective than both \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions+Feedback\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in facilitating the students\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 learning of lower-level learning outcomes as reflected in their higher scores in the drawing test and the identification test (the first phase). \u00e2\u20ac\u0153No strategy\u00e2\u20ac\u009d is significantly more effective than \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d in facilitating the achievement of the drawing test (the second phase).  All observed differences between \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions\u00e2\u20ac\u009d and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Questions+Feedback\u00e2\u20ac\u009d were not statistically significant at the .05 level. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2338], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Huifen ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huifen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Francis M Dwyer Jr.", "John David Popp", "Bonnie J Meyer", "Fern Kaley Willits"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Francis M Dwyer Jr., Committee Chair", "John David Popp, Committee Member", "Bonnie J Meyer, Committee Member", "Fern Kaley Willits, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Animation", "feedback", "questions", "instructional design", "visuals"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "EVALUATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL USE OF THE ANGEL COURSE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AT THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n\n\n", "id": "6590", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2285", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    ANGEL (A New Global Environment for Learning) is a Web-based tool that enables faculty, instructors, and teaching assistants who have no knowledge of HTML to use the Web to enhance their courses. In fall 2001, ANGEL 2001 replaced CourseWeb, the previous course management system at the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). Since then, the number of ANGEL users has increased significantly each semester. However, despite the many users involved in ANGEL, there have been few studies or evaluations of ANGEL's use in support of faculty members' teaching.\n    To explore how Penn State faculty implement ANGEL in instruction, this study sought to ascertain whether there were relationships between the use of ANGEL features and each of the following three factors: (a) The rate of ANGEL course adoption in an academic unit, (b) the average number of ANGEL course sections implemented by a faculty member in an academic unit, and (c) the average ANGEL class size in an academic unit.\n    The material in this thesis is derived mainly from the ANGEL course database, which is maintained by Information Technology Services (ITS) at Penn State. The database contains statistics from spring 2002 to spring 2004. As the purpose of the study was to examine the latest instructional use of ANGEL, the data from spring 2004 was chosen as the main analysis resource. Since certain instructional features, such as Syllabus, Calendar, Lessons, Quiz, Question, Folder, Drop box, Page, File, Message board, Message, Email, and Chat room provide the most insightful information on how faculty use ANGEL, this study's analytical focus was on the use of those features.\n    The findings from the analysis of ANGEL feature use at Penn State indicate that the average university-wide ANGEL adoption rate in spring 2004 was 29%. The adoption rates for some campuses and colleges were lower than 10%; however, other campuses or colleges had an adoption rate higher than 40%. In terms of the rate of use of ANGEL features, the study results reveal that some features such as Syllabus, Lessons, Folder, and File had a use rate higher than 44%, while some features, such as Calendar, Message board, Message, Quiz, and Question, had a use rate lower than 15%. Also, Chat room was utilized at a lower rate by users. These results reveal that some important ANGEL features, such as Calendar, Quiz, Message board, and Chat room, were not often employed by users.\n    To sum up, according to the study's findings (as organized here according to the research questions), instructional use of ANGEL at Penn State can be characterized as follows:\n    1. The use rate for some ANGEL features, such as Calendar, Quiz, Message board, and Chat room, was much lower than for other ANGEL features. The results indicate that some important ANGEL features were not adopted by faculty members.\n    2. The ANGEL adoption rate did not have much impact on a unit's ANGEL use. Only the use of Email increased and the use of Syllabus declined.\n    3. The greater the number of ANGEL course sections implemented by a faculty member, the greater that member's use of the essential ANGEL features; however, because of the faculty member's limited time for feature exploration, the use of most ANGEL features declined.\n    4. Larger ANGEL classes increased their use of essential ANGEL features that contributed more pedagogical benefits to a class. However, some little-used features were not adopted by most faculty members and so their use declined.\n    Based on the results of this study, the researcher suggests that Penn State make an effort to increase the use of the following aspects of ANGEL: ANGEL program improvement, ANGEL learning/help documentations, ANGEL training, and administrative leadership encouragement.

Transaction level\nmodeling (TLM) represents the communications of IP cores as transactions and provides higher simulation speed than lower level of abstraction. We construct a hierarchical power modeling tree and augment the transaction level models with power estimation functions. We demonstrate the power estimation methodology on PCI Express transaction level models, and create various scenarios and validate the methodology on IBM CoreConnect platform. We also present experimental results to validate the accuracy and speed of our approach.\n\nIn the system level reliability modeling, we propose a transaction-based error susceptibility\nmodel for a bus-based System-on-Chip system. This reliability model provides a detailed analysis of different kinds of errors and the susceptibility of such systems to such errors on various components that comprise the bus. We inject single and multi-bit error during the execution of various transactions and examine the effect of the errors. Experimental results demonstrate error susceptibility of signals are similar across the\nbenchmarks. Such transaction-based analysis helps us to develop an effective prediction methodology to predict the effect of a single and multi-bit error on any application running on a bus-based architecture. We demonstrate that our  transaction-based prediction scheme works with an average accuracy of 91% over all the benchmarks when compared with the actual simulation results.\n\n\nIn the system level modeling for device degradation, we explore how Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) and Hot Carrier Effects (HCE) cause device degradation in the system. We discuss the tool we developed: a HCE and NBTI Incorporated Tool for ASICs (HANITA), for the complete analysis of circuit degradation. The tool analyzes the degradation impact on bus systems and the vulnerability of buses to such circuit degradation.

InGaAs is an important material for the continued development of high speed, aggressively scaled transistors, and a fundamental understanding of the formation and behavior of low-resistance ohmic contacts to InGaAs is vital to address issues such as reducing parasitic resistance and improving processing reliability. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy (XTEM) characterization and Schottky barrier height fitting was used to better understand the origins of low contact resistance and properties after thermal annealing for non-alloyed contacts to n+- and n-In_0.53Ga_0.47As, given constant surface preparation of UV-ozone and buffered oxide etch (BOE). Two methods of engineering the metal/InGaAs interface were also explored in order to address complexities in ex situ surface preparation and the need for heavily-doped material. Enhanced topography was introduced in ohmic contacts of Ti/Pt/Au via selective etching through refractory thin film etch masks fabricated by glancing angle deposition (GLAD). Specific contact resistance was reduced up to 85%, and features with dimensions 30-50 nm wide and 2-3 nm deep were obtained. This method shows potential as a method for introducing controlled nanomorphology at a substrate surface. A Pd/Si/Pd solid-phase regrowth (SPR) contact was fabricated using a low-temperature, two-step annealing process that resulted in the formation of shallow, ultra-low resistance ohmic contacts with little lateral diffusion. An optimum Pd/Si atomic ratio of 1.5 was needed for the SPR process to result in extremely low specific contact resistances on the order of 9x10^-8 and 1.8x10^-8 \u03a9-cm^2, respectively, for both lightly and heavily-doped n-InGaAs. I-V-T measurements and Schottky barrier height modeling was used to calculate the addition of increased Si dopant concentration of about 1.0x10^19 cm^-3 at the InGaAs interface from the SPR process.

As one of the most important FEAPs, the large electromechanical responses in the ferroelectric relaxor poly(vinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene chlorofluoroethylene) P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) terpolymers make them attractive to nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), as well as nano-actuator and nanosensor applications. This dissertation develops the fabrication process for the nanorod array of P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) relaxor ferroelectric terpolymer using an anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template. Nanorod arrays in the rod diameter have been fabricated down to 25 nm.  \nIn the relaxor ferroelectric terpolymers, the bulky CFE monomers act as the random defects that break the long range polar-ordering in the ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE), and the freezing of the random dipoles leads to the relaxor behavior.  Making use of the nanorod arrays, the evolution of the relaxor ferroelectric behavior of the P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) terpolymers was investigated for nanorods with diameters reduced from 200 nm to 25 nm. It was observed that all the nanorods exhibited relaxor ferroelectric behavior, as characterized by the dielectric peak shifting toward high temperatures with frequency. The frequency-permittivity peak temperature characteristics fit well with the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) relation. Moreover, the freezing temperature in the VFT relation decreases with the reduction of the nanorod diameter, indicating that the reduction of the nanorod\u2019s diameter influences the relaxor ferroelectric behavior of the terpolymer. The existence of ferroelectric relaxor properties in terpolymer nanorods as small as 25 nm suggests the possibility of terpolymers for NEMS and nanoactuator applications. It also provides an interesting ferroelectric material system with which to study the finite size effect in ferroelectric relaxor.  \nIn the IEAPs, the ions transport through the ionic systems under an applied field and the subsequent accumulation and depletion of excess ions at the electrodes determine the response behavior of the electroactive devices, such as IEAP actuators and supercapacitors. Moreover, recent experimental results reveal the potential of ionic liquids (ILs) in enhancing the IEAP device performance. For instance, the vapor pressure of ILs is negligibly low and as a result they will not evaporate out of the IEAP devices when operated in ambient conditions. Their wide electro-chemical window (~4 V) allows the IEAP to utilize higher applied voltages than the dilute water solution electrolyte. ILs also offer the possibility of achieving high mobile ion concentration and high ion mobility. This dissertation investigates the charge dynamics of ILs in two kinds of nanostructured IEAPs, which possess distinctively different polymer nano-morphologies, and it is of great interest to know how these morphologies affect the charge dynamics of ILs:\n(i)\tAquivion ionomer, which forms percolating nanostructured ionic clusters above a critical uptake of ILs for fast ion transport. In addition, its shorter side chain (in comparison to Nafion) could also lead to better IEAP actuator performance, owing to superior coupling to the polymer backbone. \n(ii)\tPoly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate-co-diethylene glycol methylether methacrylate) P(DMAEMA-co-DiglymeMA) copolymer, which was synthesized by Prof. Tim Long\u2019s group at Virginia Tech as a new class of IEAP.\n A time domain electrical characterization method was developed and employed to systematically study the charge dynamics of ILs in these IEAPs. Compared with the frequency domain method, this method offers the possibility of probing the charge dynamics over a broad voltage range. In the Aquivion membrane swelled with EMI-Tf, the ionic conductivity and mobility show strong uptake dependent behaviors and undergo abrupt enhancement transitions close to the critical uptake, which suggests that the minimum uptake for the IEAP application is above its critical uptake. It was found that the ionic conduction of ILs is coupled with the segmental motion of the ionic phase of the Aquivion membrane implying that the enhancement of the ionic conduction is mainly due to the reduction of the glass transition temperature of the ionomer matrix with an increased uptake of EMI-Tf. The activation energies for ions to dissociate do not show substantial uptake dependence. With the same uptake of EMI-Tf, both Aquivion and Nafion show almost the same charge dynamics, while the short side chain Aquivion shows a better electromechanical coupling per charge than that of the longer side chain Nafion.\nIn the P(DMAEMA-DiglymeMA) copolymers with 10, 30, 50 and 70 mole% of DMAEMA ionic chains blended with 40 wt% uptake of EMI-Tf systems, a rapid drop of the conductivity, mobility and mobile ion dissociation ratio with increasing ionic chain density is observed. The conductivity follows Debye-Stokes-Einstein relation closely implying that the ionic conduction is coupled with the copolymer\u2019s segmental motion in this system. The electrostatic interactions among charges and ionic chains may slow down the chain mobility and increase the energy barrier for ion dissociation. These results suggest that the suppression of ionic conductivity, mobility and mobile ion dissociation ratio may be mainly caused by the increase in the ionic charged density of the local environment where the ions transport. \nThis dissertation shows that at voltages <1 V the charge dynamics in these IEAPs in a short time are dominated by the electric double layer (EDL), in which the charging time &#61556;DL follows the classic model &#61556;DL =&#61472;&#61472;&#61548;Dd/(2D) (<< 0.1 seconds at room temperature for the IEAPs studied here) very closely where &#61472;&#61548;D is the Debye length, d the membrane thickness, and D the diffusion constant. However, my study reveals that the EDL charges do not make much of a contribution to IEAP device responses, which are instead dominated by a much longer time charging process (> 0.1 seconds).  Several recent theoretical models suggest that the charge dynamics at the later stage should follow the random diffusion time &#61556;diff = d2/(4D), indicating that by reducing the membrane thickness d the IEAP device response speed can be increased significantly.  After examining the charge dynamics in the Aquivion membrane with 40 wt% uptake of EMI-Tf and pure BMI-PF6 over a broad thickness range, my results show that in the longer time regimes (t >> &#61556;DL) the charge dynamics become dependent on the applied voltage. At a low applied voltage (0.1 V) the charge response seems to follow the d2 dependence, whereas at a high applied voltage (> 0.5 V) where substantial actuation occurs, the charging responses do not show significant thickness dependence. These results imply that the movement of charges is mainly from the near electrode region, which might be due to the very high mobile ion concentration of the ionomer/IL systems studied here. The finding that actuation is mainly driven by the slow nonlinear charges instead of the double layer charges explains why the substantial actuation only occurs with voltage > 1 V and longer times.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3175], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Junhong ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Junhong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Ralph H Colby", "Qing Wang", "James Patrick Runt", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["actuator", "polymer", "charge dynamics", "ionic liquids", "ionomer"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Copula Versions of RKHS-Based and Distance-Based Criteria", "id": "14485jul268", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14485", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Four general classes of statistics in hypothesis testing and corresponding measures are those based on reproducing kernels or distances.

This result reveals the potential loss\nof efficiency related to the covariate-adjusted approach, particularly when sample size is not large. These theoretical results are illustrated through examples, a simulation study and a\nreal data example.\n\nThis dissertation is also concerned with feature screening for ultrahigh dimensional data. We propose two unified sure independence ranking and screening procedures based on conditional characteristic functions. The proposed procedures do not require specification of a regression function. In addition, they can  be directly applied for univariate or multivariate continuous, discrete and categorical responses.  We show that, with the number of predictors growing at\nan exponential rate of the available sample size, these  unified procedures possess both the ranking consistency and sure screening properties. The ranking consistency property ensures that all important features will be ranked above the unimportant ones asymptotically, and the sure screening property guarantees that all\nimportant features will be retained with an overwhelming probability after screening. Both are desired properties  in  ultrahigh dimensional data analysis. We study the finite-sample performance of our proposed independence ranking and screening procedures through simulations and illustrate the proposed procedures via an empirical analysis of a real-world data set.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12803], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Junyi ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Junyi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Runze Li", "Naomi Altman", "Debashis Ghosh", "Hunter David", "Ping Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Runze Li, Committee Chair", "Naomi Altman, Committee Member", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Member", "Hunter David, Committee Member", "Ping Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Covariate-adjusted approach; generalized linear re"]}]
