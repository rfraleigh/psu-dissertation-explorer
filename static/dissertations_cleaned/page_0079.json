Porosity in these materials\u2014closely related to free volume\u2014arises from an unusual chain structure combining rigid segments with sites of contortion. Linear PIMs can be easily solution-cast into films whose interconnected networks of micropores can be exploited for applications such as gas separation and storage. Like other glasses, though, PIMs are subject to physical aging: a slow increase in density over time. This is accompanied by a decrease in permeability that reduces their performance as gas separation membranes.\n\nSeveral characterization methods are routinely employed to measure the structural properties of microporous materials, but none are as widely available and as easily applied to film samples with varied sample histories as small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS). Although it is possible to derive useful information such as surface areas and pore sizes from the scattering patterns of many porous materials, scattering from PIMs includes some unusual features whose interpretation is not readily apparent. \n\nIn this work, a robust interpretation of PIM SAXS and WAXS features is developed with support from molecular dynamics simulations. The sensitivity of these patterns to time, temperature and film thickness is shown to be qualitatively consistent with physical aging, demonstrating that high-free-volume, porous polymeric glasses present a unique opportunity to study structural changes during physical aging using scattering methods. Models for extracting quantitative information about changes in the sizes and volume fraction of pores are also explored. Although quantitative interpretation of scattering patterns remains challenging, results of the aging study suggest that there may be two distinct mechanisms of aging in PIMs. \n\nSeveral tangential investigations are also presented, including (1) a study of small-molecule porous materials using scattering experiments; (2) a preliminary study of alcohol adsorption in PIMs using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) techniques; and (3) a study of the low-q power-law scattering observed in a wide variety of amorphous, homogeneous polymers, including PIMs. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8207], "author_name_tesi": "Mcdermott, Amanda G", "last_name_ssi": "Mcdermott", "middle_name_ssi": "G", "first_name_ssi": "Amanda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt", "Coray M Colina", "Ralph H Colby", "Scott Thomas Milner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt, Dissertation Advisor", "Coray M Colina, Committee Member", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Scott Thomas Milner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["scattering", "SAXS", "WAXS", "physical aging", "PIMs", "polymers of intrinsic microporosity", "microporous polymers", "free volume"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Understanding Family and Neighborhood Socioeconomic Risk for Internalizing and Externalizing in Adolescents: A Person-Centered Approach", "id": "14873axm565", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14873", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Socioeconomic status differences in adolescent internalizing and externalizing are well established.

Data for this study comes from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health, N = 4107).

Notable differences emerged concerning adolescent depression and antisocial behavior. Adolescents in the Single-Parent Economic Risk, Two-Parent Family Risk, and High-Risk groups reported more depression than adolescents in the Low-Risk group. Adolescents in the Single-Parent Economic-Risk group reported more antisocial behavior than adolescents in the Low-Risk and Neighborhood-Occupation Risk groups. Overall, adolescents in the Low-Risk group had low levels of depression and antisocial behavior while adolescents in the Single-Parent Economic Risk group had some of the highest levels of depression and antisocial behavior. These findings offer a more nuanced understanding of how family and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage impacts adolescent internalizing and externalizing and have valuable implications for prevention and intervention efforts.

From the perspective of identity as an enactment of self, I used the lens identities-in-practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991) to examine the impact that having classroom science instruction framed around constructing explanations with evidence would have on the girls in the class. In this study, I drew from theories of sociocultural learning, positioning, and identities-in-practice to study: a) the norms of participation, b) the authoring and positioning of girls, and c) the identities-in-practice that the girls\u2019 enacted in the kindergarten science classroom.  Using a research design informed by qualitative methods and participant observation, I analyzed data using a constant comparative approach and crafted case studies of four girls in the science classroom.

In order to predict, measure, and fully understand the scattering properties of bubbly media, the bubble size distribution and its spatial distribution must be known with great detail.  Mathematical models capture the physical behavior of individual bubbles, and various theories describe how bubbles will collectively respond to an incident acoustic wave.  An \"effective medium\" theory is used as the foundation of a Matlab model for predicting mid-frequency backscatter from bubbly wakes and plumes, which is discussed in this thesis.  In order to experimentally verify effective medium theory, a bubble distribution must first be created that has very few large bubbles (with a radius greater than 300 microns).  Plumes of bubbles were generated first by a commercially available ceramic oxygen diffuser, then by a Venturi water oxygenation system.  The resulting bubble distributions are presented in this thesis.  Unfortunately, the large quantities of bubbles with radii greater than 300 microns made it impractical to measure backscattering in the Applied Research Laboratory Reverberation Tank at a frequency that was below the resonance of all individual bubbles.

By expanding these methodologies to targeted nanomaterials, we have been able to synthesize and characterize new catalytic nanoparticle systems, primarily for the catalysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) but also for CO2 photoreduction to carbonaceous fuels.  Both of these reactions offer exciting potential routes toward a clean energy future if they can be produced and perform with enough cost efficiency.  \n\nWe begin with a discussion of the capabilities of colloidal nanosynthesis, followed by the intricacies of the HER and CO2 photoreduction.  For the HER, replacing highly active noble metals with Earth-abundant, active, and stable materials is a major goal.  The majority of this dissertation will focus on the discovery, characterization, and evaluation of new materials to satisfy this goal.  For this, we will start by reporting on the synthesis and evaluation of new amorphous molybdenum phosphide and amorphous tungsten phosphide nanoparticles as HER catalysts.  Each of the full HER evaluations will include linear scan voltammetry for testing the activity of each material, comparison versus a platinum standard electrode and a bare Ti foil substrate as controls, then sustained cyclic voltammetry as well as a galvanostatic hold for stability testing. We will then discuss the discovery of hollow nanospheres of FeP as an exceptionally active HER catalyst.  This will be followed by the establishment of a synthetic route to colloidal transition metal silicide nanoparticles.  Ni2Si, Pd2Si, and Cu3Si nanoparticles were all synthesized preliminarily tested for their ability to catalyze the HER.  Next, we discuss phase control of cobalt sulfide nanomaterials and establish parameters in a non-polar synthesis to make each of three crystalline phases, and begin to compare them for the HER.  After this, we will show specific colloidally controlled manipulations of TiO2 truncated bipyramidal nanoparticles, including size control of Ag domains grown on TiO2 and multilayered assemblies of TiO\u00ac2 nanoparticles.  Finally, we delve into the challenges and opportunities of CO2 photoreduction before concluding.  Briefly, for CO2 reduction, activity has typically been low compared to the HER, product selectivity remains a major hurdle, and there is a lack of standardization in testing methods, though the infrastructures of first world countries are already built for carbon based fuels, and CO2 itself provides an excellent feedstock from a growing pollutant.  We highlight colloidally synthesized SnO nanosheets with primarily exposed (001) facets as selective for ethanol production from CO2 and water, then directly compare CuPt alloy nanospheres against Pt nanospheres on a TiO2 substrate for CO2 photoreduction to methane.  Each of the chapters included will illustrate the powerful capabilities of colloidal nanosynthesis, as they can be applied to learn about and discover solutions to real world problems such as the development clean energy technologies.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11010], "author_name_tesi": "Mcenaney, Joshua M", "last_name_ssi": "Mcenaney", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Benjamin James Lear", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Barbara Jane Garrison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Barbara Jane Garrison, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanosynthesis", "Water Electrolysis", "Hydrogen Evolution Reaction", "CO2 Photoreduction", "Electrocatalyst", "Metal Phosphide"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "The complex interplay of heroin, reward and gene expression", "id": "14596ajm5836", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14596", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-12-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Addiction is a disease of brain reward circuitry whereby systems which evolved to respond to \u201clife-giving\u201d rewards (such as food and social relationships) are now primed to bring about the ultimate goal of seeking and acquiring more drug.  Moreover, individual propensities to becoming addicted to a given drug vary greatly, a phenomenon that we now know finds its root in individual internal and external environments.  Therefore, the primary goal of this thesis was to examine the intersection of gene-expression, environment and individual susceptibilities to addiction-like behavior.  In Chapter 2, we utilize a model of reward devaluation and heroin self-administration.  When the opportunity to self-administer heroin is preceded by the opportunity to ingest a sweet saccharin solution, an outbred group of Sprague-Dawley rats splits into two distinct behavioral phenotypes: Those that show a preference for saccharin and low/moderate intake of heroin (small saccharin suppressors; SS) and those that avoid the saccharin cue and escalate heroin intake (large saccharin suppressors; LS).  We examined the gene expression of the corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) pathway in reward areas (medial prefrontal cortex; mPFC, hippocampus, ventral tegmental area; VTA and nucleus accumbens; NAc) of these two different phenotypes and found that LS demonstrated greater gene expression of the CRF signaling pathway across reward regions.  DNA methylation analysis revealed that the LS group had decreased methylation of cytosines in the CRFbp gene promoter.  Chapter 3 explored whether saccharin suppression, brought about by passive infusion of heroin, would recapitulate the gene expression findings of the self-administration model.  Overall, gene expression differences were markedly different from those reported in Chapter 2, indicating that passive infusion and self-administration bring about different molecular effects.  Chapter 4 investigated gene expression differences between the mPFC transcriptome of SS and LS rats.  Genes found to be differentially expressed between groups included those involved in schizophrenia and dopamine signaling, signal transduction, development and synaptic plasticity.  The occurrence of several failed confirmatory qRT-PCR experiments led us to the hypothesis that the two mPFC hemispheres may not always have the same levels of gene expression.  Chapter 5 explored this question through an RNA-Seq study on the left and right mPFC of drug-na\u00efve male rats.  2.6% of expressed genes were found to differ between the left and right mPFC.  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed these differentially expressed genes to be involved in pathways such as cell signaling and cell morphology.  Given the reports of functional laterality of the mPFC in the stress response, we asked whether the CRF pathway would be differentially expressed in reward regions in response to the passive heroin infusion model (which likely contains a stress component).  CRF binding protein and CRFR2 were differentially expressed between left and right hippocampus between groups, CRF was differentially expressed between left and right VTA.  Lastly, in Chapter 6, we show that environmental enrichment attenuates drug-seeking and motivation and is accompanied by expression differences of the early response genes EGR1 and EGR2.  Bisulfite amplicon sequencing revealed site-specific methylation differences for EGR1 and EGR2 in the mPFC and NAc.  Taken together, we show that individual propensities to drug-taking behavior are tied to differential gene expression and regulation and can be influenced by environmental factors.

Focusing on the themes of cultural capital and consumer agency; intangible assets as a basis for competition; and the theoretical notion of rational amusement, this project uses case studies to investigate the roles of the New York Times, the National Broadcasting Company, and the Walt Disney Company in American corporate and popular culture. \nCase studies are the central keys to understanding the larger themes present within each corporation\u2019s products and services. The New York Times is set apart in this project through its crossword puzzle and its publication of the Pentagon Papers. The crossword puzzle, through its association with the American \u201cpaper of record,\u201d has come to be the gold standard of American-style crossword puzzles. Through an examination of the puzzle\u2019s folklore, cultural references, and evolution, the puzzle reifies the Times\u2019 status as the paper of record among American publications, thereby creating a recurring loop of prestige. The NBC case studies focus on its late night line-up and its Olympics coverage. NBC\u2019s late night programming was the first of its kind on a national network, and The Tonight Show, Late Night, and Saturday Night Live serve as texts by which to examine the importance of brand loyalty and identity at the network. This case study also emphasizes the geographic importance of the late night line-up and its relation to New York and Los Angeles. NBC\u2019s Olympic coverage is a more recent success, and the network has pulled from its own experiences, as well as those of their competitors, to create Olympic programming for a post-Cold War, post-9/11 world. Finally, the Walt Disney Company is analyzed through its animated features and the role of Walt Disney World Resort in popular culture. The Walt Disney Company has learned as much from its failures as its successes, and therefore an analysis of its less-popular animated features, such as Song of the South, provides insight into the Disney brand and its long-term success. Walt Disney World is examined through the lens of rational amusement in American life. Walt Disney continues an arc of American rational amusement that began with Philadelphia\u2019s Charles Willson Peale in the Early Republic. \nThis project signals a paradigm shift in the way the world of business is perceived within American studies.

With the growing numbers of people requiring care, family members are increasingly filling the caregiving role.  Caregiving experiences can range from those that are relatively easy to manage to those that are burdensome and cause caregiver strain.  Caregivers with the heaviest responsibilities are vulnerable to risks such as a decline in mental or physical health.  Recent research has begun to address the positive aspects of caregiving including improved well-being and health benefits.  What is less well known is how resources, both utilization and perception of adequacy, in the caregiving role may support the family caregiver in providing care to a community dwelling older adult.  \n\nPurpose:  The purpose of this study was to determine if resource utilization and family caregivers\u2019 perception of resource adequacy are associated with caregiver strain and satisfaction, specifically if caregiver outcomes are moderated by resource utilization and adequacy.  \n\nMethods: To examine caregiver outcomes and the association of resources with those outcomes, a secondary analysis of data from the Informal Caregiver Survey was conducted.  Bivariate analysis and hierarchical regression models were used to examine the relationship between caregiving demands and caregiver outcomes of satisfaction and strain.  Hierarchical regression with moderation was used to examine if resource utilization and perceptions of resource adequacy moderate the relationship between caregiving demands and caregiver satisfaction and strain. \n \nResults: A significant positive relationship was found between caregiving demands and caregiver strain, suggesting that as caregiving demands increase levels of caregiver strain do as well.  The utilization of formal resources also has a positive relationship with caregiver strain indicating that as resource utilization increases so do levels of caregiver strain.  Social support was found to have a positive relationship with caregiver satisfaction and a negative relationship with caregiver strain indicating that perceived levels of higher social support are associated with higher levels of caregiver satisfaction and lower levels of caregiver strain.  Family support was found to have a positive relationship with caregiver strain, indicating that as levels of family support increase so do levels of caregiver strain.  Finally, the perception of formal resource adequacy was found to have a negative relationship with caregiver strain meaning that higher levels of perceived adequacy are associated with lower levels of strain.  Additionally, resource adequacy was found to moderate the relationship between caregiving demands and caregiver strain with individuals reporting the highest levels of resource adequacy experiencing the lowest levels of caregiver strain.  \n\nConclusion: Understanding the caregiving experience and the impact it has on family caregivers is a critical consideration given the sheer numbers of caregivers and the invaluable service they provide.  This study begins to address the question of how resources in the caregiving role can impact both the positive and negative outcomes for family caregivers.  It also highlights that not all resources are equal; different resources are required to support the individual caregiving context.  Findings from this study contribute to the importance of providing targeted resources to family caregivers which may be especially salient for those without a supportive family, lack social support or whose needs are unmet in the caregiving role.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9894], "author_name_tesi": "Mcghan, Gwen E", "last_name_ssi": "Mcghan", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Gwen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janice Lee Penrod", "Ann Marie Kolanowski", "Amy M Sawyer", "Rhonda Belue"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janice Lee Penrod, Dissertation Advisor", "Ann Marie Kolanowski, Committee Chair", "Amy M Sawyer, Committee Member", "Rhonda Belue, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Older Adults", "Family Caregivers", "Resources"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Towards an integrated career change model in the hotel industry:  A grounded theory approach", "id": "16042", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8045", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this paper is to deepen our understanding of why young professionals in the hotel industry change their careers to work in different industries.

This dissertation examined how employment has changed in contemporary American society in recent decades, by means of testing several hypotheses that were derived from the literature on the topic and that were related to the effect of individuals\u2019 career variety on their future career trajectories. Specifically, the study investigated how a person\u2019s career variety (defined as the accumulation of distinctly different professional experiences) predicted future mobility outcomes, such as the intent to turn over or to change careers, as well as one\u2019s commitment to an organization. \nThe study gathered data from 111 actively working hotel managers from various professional affiliations and from various management levels and career stages and found that these proposed associations of career variety and career change intentions were moderated by the satisfaction that people had had with their careers. Data were analyzed using a regression-based approach and paradoxically revealed that the same conditions that induced career change intentions also induced feelings of commitment to one\u2019s employing organization. Specifically, as the amount of career variety increased, the more satisfied hotel managers were, and they reported a positive association with both career change intentions and continuance commitment to an organization. On the contrary, when career variety increased and hotel managers were relatively unsatisfied they reported a negative association with both career change intentions and continuance commitment to an organization. The relations were different for men and women, which suggests that men and women engage in professional mobility under different conditions and for different reasons.\nRecommendations for industry practitioners include suggestions on how to better hire applicants and how to conduct annual audits to reduce costs associated with hotel managers exiting the hotel industry.

Understanding its sources and sinks is critical to the mitigation of future climate change. Sources and sinks of CO2 are not as well known on city scales. It is important to improve the uncertainty in urban-scale CO2 budgets since regional/local scales are where polices are most likely to be implemented. The months of February and July 2011 were simulated over Indianapolis, Indiana with the atmospheric transport model Weather Research and Forecasting Advanced Research Model (WRF-ARW) version 3.2  to a) quantify the impact of anthropogenic city emissions on regional CO2 atmospheric mole fractions under a variety of meteorological conditions and seasons, b) determine how much biogenic fluxes of CO2 within the city and all fluxes outside of the city contribute to the CO2 mole fraction in an urban atmosphere, and c) explore the importance of the resolution of fossil fuel emission products on simulated CO2 mole fractions. Anthropogenic emissions were simulated with the Vulcan and Hestia data products. It was found that local anthropogenic emissions within the city lead to detectable but modest enhancements in the atmospheric CO2 mole fraction over Indianapolis. There were large day-to-day variations in the buildup of CO2 in urban boundary layer which were explained in part by the variability in atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) depth and wind speed. A sound approach to generalizing these results to other urban areas was established using wind speed and ABL depth along with surface emissions. The detection of city emissions was substantially easier in the winter compared to the summer; biogenic fluxes had large contributions to the cross-city CO2 mole fractions in the summer. Lastly, lower resolution anthropogenic emissions from Vulcan were found to underestimate the day-to-day variability in cross-city CO2 values compared to the results from the higher resolution Hestia product.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8146], "author_name_tesi": "Mcgowan, Laura Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Mcgowan", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis", "Aijun Deng", "William Henry Brune"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis, Thesis Advisor", "Aijun Deng, Thesis Advisor", "William Henry Brune, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["co2", "meteorology"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "On Community Participation and Identity Negotiation in a Study Abroad Context: A Multiple Case Study", "id": "16040", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8022", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I report on a multiple case study conducted with six American undergraduate students during their year abroad in Marburg, Germany. Using a communities of practice orientation to second language socialization, this study sought to investigate issues surrounding the participants\u2019 identity negotiation and development through mutual engagement in communities while abroad (Lave & Wenger, 1991). Study abroad students face the immediate need to negotiate difference due to linguistic and cultural variation. Such critical encounters or, rich points (see Agar, 1994), often occur through participation in new communities, and can lead to instances of identity negotiation. I followed the participants for one year, looking at the communities that they participated in, and their levels of engagement within these communities. Data were collected via language history questionnaires, language proficiency evaluations, group conversation sessions, and oral recordings in which participants reflected on the rich points that they experienced throughout the year. I also conducted four individual semistructured interviews with each participant. These data were supplemented by observational notes regarding their daily lives in Marburg. I used these converging data sources to investigate participants\u2019 own references to agency and access within their communities, as well as how they perceived and positioned themselves and others. I explored the relationships between community participation, levels of engagement, identity negotiation and identity transformation. The results show that many participants shifted their original goals in order to maintain emotional security and participate in a meaningful way in their communities during their year abroad. Those who reflected on their own and others\u2019 salient identity issues learned to consider other perspectives, and as a result showed more signs of developing into transcultural speakers than those participants who were less reflective and less able to consider multiple perspectives. The analysis highlights the importance of sites of struggle as opportunities for reflection, compassion and ultimately, learning and development. Sojourning students often have real and imagined desires vis-\u00e0-vis learning and language use in a study abroad context, and therefore, scholars, educators, and study abroad administrators interested in sociocultural approaches to second language acquisition should find this study relevant to ongoing discussions of second language learning, mobility and identity.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7967], "author_name_tesi": "Mcgregor, Janice Michelle", "last_name_ssi": "Mcgregor", "middle_name_ssi": "Michelle", "first_name_ssi": "Janice", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carrie Neal Jackson", "Carrie Neal Jackson", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Dr John Plews", "Celeste S Kinginger", "Robert William Schrauf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carrie Neal Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "Carrie Neal Jackson, Committee Chair", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member", "Dr John Plews, Committee Member", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member", "Robert William Schrauf, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["study abroad", "identity", "language learning", "community participation", "case study", "ethnography"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "consumer Responses to Vice and Virtue Food Advertising: A Comparison Between Organic and Non-organic Products\n", "id": "25032", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11262", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although organic foods continue to gain popularity in the US, there is very little research about consumers\u2019 responses to advertising promoting organic foods.

Although previous research suggests that parental use of effective commands and quality of dyadic interaction influence parents\u2019 ability to elicit child compliance, comparatively less research has examined the role of social cognitive capacities in determining parents\u2019 ability to elicit child compliance as well as their discipline responses. This study examined relationships between maternal Social Information Processing (SIP) deficits, mothers\u2019 use of effective commands, dyadic dyssynchrony, child compliance, and maternal endorsement of punitive discipline. It was predicted that greater maternal SIP deficits including unrealistic expectations of children\u2019s capacities, problem-solving deficits, and attributional biases toward children\u2019s behaviors would result in increased use of ineffective commands and lower the quality of interactions between mothers and their children. In turn, these deficits were predicted to result in lower levels of child compliance and greater maternal endorsement of punitive discipline. These hypotheses were tested in a low-income sample of mothers and their 3-5 year old children. As predicted, maternal SIP deficits were related to mothers\u2019 endorsement of punitive discipline. However children\u2019s compliance did not mediate this relationship. This study did find the predicted indirect effect of one maternal SIP deficit, unrealistic expectations, on endorsement of punitive discipline through increased dyadic dyssynchrony.

Having positive faculty-student contact is one known way to enhance students\u2019 experiences and outcomes. Yet, many institutions struggle to encourage these relationships. Indeed, much of what may influence relationships between faculty and students is not within an institution\u2019s immediate control. Despite this issue, some institutional actions may still have a significant relationship to students\u2019 experiences. This study explores the antecedents of students\u2019 relationships with faculty members, specifically addressing the research questions: 1) How does the organizational context relate to students\u2019 reports of their interactions with and perceptions of faculty members? and 2) Is the relationship of student characteristics and organizational context to students\u2019 reports of frequency of faculty-student interaction the same as their relationship to perceptions of faculty concern and interest in student development and teaching?  Understanding how individual and institutional factors relate to different aspects of faculty-student interaction may help in creating environments where faculty engage in higher levels of contact with and express higher levels of concern for students. This study, therefore, identifies factors and possible social-psychological accessibility cues that may relate to either students\u2019 interaction with or perceptions of faculty members\u2019 interest in student development and teaching.\nThe study was guided by a conceptual framework modified from the Terenzini and Reason (2005) comprehensive model of influences on student learning and persistence. The framework specifies the organizational context and culture, and details the student experience of faculty-student interaction. Possible factors and actions related to faculty-student interaction are explored through quantitative data from a nationally representative dataset collected for the Parsing the First Year of College study.  The study uses survey responses from 5,905 first-year students, 4,987 faculty members, and 33 chief academic and student affairs officers from 33 institutions. A series of hierarchical linear models were constructed separately for the two outcome variables: NSSE\u2019s Benchmark Student-Faculty Interaction scale and Pascarella and Terenzini\u2019s (1980) Faculty Concern for Student Development and Teaching scale.\n  Most importantly, this study identified key interventions that are within institutions\u2019 control that may promote student-faculty interaction. Having an institutional emphasis on teaching as well as academically-focused, faculty-involved, residential life facilities were related to students\u2019 frequency of interaction with faculty members.  Moreover, faculty involvement in out-of-class experiences was related to students\u2019 perceptions of faculty members\u2019 level of concern and interest in student development and teaching.  This study also shows that not all institutional variables or all characteristics have the same predictive power - institutional characteristics do not have more explanatory power than institutional practices, policies, and structures.\nThe findings of this study also reveal that differences exist between how student characteristics, institutional characteristics, and institutional actions relate to students\u2019 frequency of interaction with faculty members and students\u2019 perceptions of faculty members. While women and well-prepared students had lower frequencies of interaction, they had higher levels of perceptions of care from faculty members. Full-time students and Black/African-American students (as compared to White students) reported greater frequencies of interaction and higher perceptions of care from faculty members. Asian and Pacific Islanders did not have a significantly different level of interaction than White students, but did have a significantly lower level of perception of care from faculty members. The findings of this study provide an understanding of the individual and institutional factors that relate to first-year students\u2019 interactions with and perceptions of faculty members.\nThese findings have several implications for practice, policy, theory-building, and future research. Student affairs professionals can work to create environments within residential life and student affairs at large that have an academic focus and include faculty involvement.  Academic affairs can increase interaction by creating a culture that emphasizes teaching through policies, recruitment, hiring, incentive systems, and professional development. Administrators could also promote faculty participation in orientation and mentor programs, convocations, advising student organizations, and serving on or creating student committees. This may be an effective way to give a positive impression of faculty accessibility to students.\nWhen creating institutional policies, it is important to look at the entire context of the institution to determine what works, for whom, and for which specific outcomes. Administrators can borrow characteristics associated with the significant institutional actions by promoting and providing resources for similar practices that are academically-related and encourage faculty involvement.  Beyond institutional policies, states and federal education agencies could support researchers through national databases and faculty development by funding teaching and learning centers.\nTo aid theory-building, future researchers can apply the Terenzini and Reason (2005) model to their work by specifying it to the experience or outcome of interest. Researchers using this model could consider including factors that are representative of institutional characteristics, proximal to their participants\u2019 experiences, and able to transfer culture and cues to participants. Future research can explore other aspects of students\u2019 relationships with faculty members such as the content of their discussion or the nature of the relationship. These additions would help to establish patterns and clarify nuances in faculty-student interaction. Scholars may also examine antecedents of intended experiences. However, researchers should not simply rely on examining variables related to institutional characteristics, but should also focus on those related to institutional actions. More and better measurements are still needed to capture the organizational context.  \nFirst-year experiences can be intentionally designed based on well-researched evidence. This study provides an understanding of student-reported interactions with and perceptions of faculty members and institutional actions that are related to students\u2019 relationships with faculty members. It does so by accounting for different characteristics and actions, and using different instruments for measuring faculty-student interaction. It adds to the body of literature that clarifies aspects of faculty-student interaction and focuses on not only what an institution is, but also what it does.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9023], "author_name_tesi": "Mcintosh, Kadian L", "last_name_ssi": "Mcintosh", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Kadian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kimberly Griffin", "Patrick T Terenzini", "David Post", "Molly Martin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kimberly Griffin, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick T Terenzini, Committee Member", "David Post, Committee Member", "Molly Martin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["faculty-student interaction", "organizational context", "faculty concern", "frequency of interaction", "students' relationships"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Modelling Management for the Maintenance of Measles Elimination", "id": "13450azm200", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13450", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite decades of extensive control, measles remains a major contributor to vaccine-preventable childhood death.  As such, measles is an important target for global eradication.  Global eradication comprises two parts; achieving local elimination, and maintaining local elimination while elimination is achieved elsewhere.  This dissertation focuses on the post measles elimination context, which requires high levels of population immunity to be maintained via a carefully considered vaccine policy.  Vaccine policies for measles typically contain combinations of two basic vaccine strategies; routine immunization and supplemental immunization activities (SIAs).  Routine immunization consists of one or more doses administered to children at specified target ages.  SIAs are campaigns that typically take place over a wide geographic area, where all children within a specified target age range are vaccinated within a relatively short time.  In my work I examine the interaction of human demographic structure, maternal immunity, and three health system factors (coverage, age targets, and correlation between populations receiving each dose) on the effectiveness of a vaccine strategy for the maintenance of measles elimination.\nI find that, regardless of health system aspects, maternal immunity and age structure can interact so that measles elimination is impossible to maintain with a single dose routine immunization strategy.  When a second dose is added, the maximum level of population immunity maintainable in a population still depends on demographic structure, but age target selection can ensure that measles elimination is sustained.  The optimal age target for each of two doses of routine immunization depends on the coverage of the other dose as well as on demographic structure.  Low correlation between the populations receiving each dose increases the proportion of the population that receives at least one dose, thereby increasing population immunity, at the cost of increasing the rate of primary vaccine failure.  The effect of correlation may outweigh the effects of age structure and changing coverage in a variety of real contexts.  The dependence of population immunity on the correlation between doses also arises when SIAs are administered in conjunction with the second routine dose.  Whether or not the second dose contributes more to population immunity than SIAs depends, not just on the coverage of all doses, but also on their correlation.  While population immunity is important for maintaining elimination, optimal age target selection depends on a carefully specified objective; the optimal age targets to minimize the incidence or mortality of a reintroduction outbreak are different.\nI conclude with a synthesis of my research in the context of previous measles work.  Overall, I show that, while coverage is essential, human demography, maternal immunity, and other aspects of the health system (coverage, age targets and correlation) also have significant effects on population immunity, and hence the maintenance of measles elimination.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13107], "author_name_tesi": "Mckee, Amalie Elena", "last_name_ssi": "Mckee", "middle_name_ssi": "Elena", "first_name_ssi": "Amalie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katriona Shea", "Andrew Fraser Read", "Matthew Joseph Ferrari", "Ottar N Bjornstad", "Rachel Annette Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katriona Shea, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Fraser Read, Committee Chair", "Matthew Joseph Ferrari, Committee Member", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Member", "Rachel Annette Smith, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["measles", "routine immunization", "vaccine policy", "disease elimination", "mathematical models", "modelling management"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "BOARD NETWORKS AND FIRM PERFORMANCE", "id": "15285djm515", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15285", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I find evidence that networks formed between boards by shared directors are beneficial to the firm\u2019s governance and performance.

I find that this new measure is associated with stronger sales growth, a lower likelihood of financial distress, more favorable credit rating changes, increased patent production, fewer value-destroying acquisitions, a lower likelihood of facing a class-action lawsuit, decreases in excess CEO compensation and options-based executive compensation, smaller dividend payments, and a greater willingness by directors to acquire costly external information for a panel of S&P 1500 firms from 2001 to 2015. I test the performance of my measure against existing econometric specification approaches, and find material differences in the performance of the specifications and the outcomes of the regressions that compare firm-level outcomes and board connectedness. I also find evidence suggesting that the market incorporates network connectedness into firm valuations, in contrast with the prior literature.

Clinically, bone grafts are used to treat congenital abnormalities, trauma, and cancer surgeries, each which carry a specific set of requirements. Successfully engineered grafts must exhibit biological and structural functions similar to native tissue and have ability to integrate into the surrounding tissue. Stem cells have the capability to differentiate and deposit mineral in culture on a three dimensional scaffold. In this thesis, the visualization and quantitation of stem cell mediated remineralization of a demineralized collagen scaffold was demonstrated. The overall investigational approach was to first test feasibility of mineralization on demineralized and decellularized scaffolds in vitro using static culture (aim 1) and then use a perfusion bioreactor to create a physiologically relevant environment and further quantify and visualize the mineralization (aim 2). This novel, imaging-compatible bioreactor system yielded native bone architecture and enhanced bone volume when compared to static culture. Biomineralization was accomplished by remineralizing a collagen scaffold derived from bovine tissue in a trabecular anatomical pattern which was then quantified and visualized. Since stem cells are the biological powerhouse of this model, it is crucial to understand their specific role and behavior. Biomineralization is driven by osteogenic differentiation and protein expression of the stem cells. As fabricated mineralized collagen becomes better understood, laboratory tissue engineering work will translate into improved clinical applications.

In chapter 2 we use generalized unitarity to construct the terms with logarithmic dependence on external momenta at one- and two-loop order in the worldsheet S matrix for strings in a general integrable worldsheet theory. We also discuss aspects of calculations as it extends to higher orders. The S-matrix elements are expressed as sums of integrals with coe\ufb03cients given in terms of tree-level worldsheet four-point scattering amplitudes. O\ufb00-diagonal one-loop rational functions, not determined by two-dimensional unitarity cuts, are \ufb01xed by symmetry considerations. They play an important role in the determination of the two-loop logarithmic contributions. We illustrate the general analysis by computing the logarithmic terms in the one- and two-loop four-particle S-matrix elements in the massive worldsheet sectors of string theory in AdS5\u00d7S5, AdS4\u00d7CP3, AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7S3\u00d7S1 and AdS3\u00d7S3\u00d7T4.

Fermented semi-dry and dry sausages are safe, ready-to-eat (RTE) meat items produced using strict government regulations. One of these regulations requires meat processing establishments to create and have a scientifically-validated Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan. HACCP plans are validated utilizing a combination of data collected in the plant and scientific literature to ensure that process controls exist for identified food safety hazards. When little or incomplete data exists for very specific products or processes, challenge studies may be conducted to investigate the safety of the processes used to produce the food item.\n\tThree experiments were conducted to determine the effects of varying fermented semi-dry and dry sausage production parameters on the reduction of three pathogenic bacteria: E. coli O157:H7 (EC), Salmonella spp. (S; S. Typhimurium, S. Montevideo, and S. Panama), and L. monocytogenes (LM). These experiments will serve as challenge studies for semi-dry and dry sausages under various conditions.\n\tThe first experiment evaluated the effects of fat content and grind size on the attachment and survival of pathogenic bacteria in fully-cooked, semi-dry sausages. Lean and fat trim consisting of beef and pork were analyzed for fat content and mixed to create meat blocks consisting of 10%, 20%, and 30% fat. Meat blocks were ground a second time to create meat particles that were 3.00 mm, 4.75 mm, or 12.50 mm in size. Neither fat content nor grind size significantly impacted pathogen populations for any of the bacteria examined (p>0.05).\n\tA second experiment demonstrated the efficacy of a low-heat treatment for an extended time to reduce pathogenic bacteria in a fermented, dry sausage. Ground pork (20% fat) was stuffed into 38-mm, 64-mm, and 120-mm diameter casings, fermented, heat treated, dried, and vacuum-packaged up to 28 d. A 5 log10 reduction was achieved by day 9 (D9) of drying for S and LM regardless of diameter; by D16 of drying, EC was reduced by 5 log10 CFU/g for all diameters. Significant differences were observed among casing diameters for S.\n\tThe third experiment demonstrated no difference among casing type or pork trim sprayed with tap water or an antimicrobial prior to grinding in a non-heat treated, dry salami (p>0.05). Pork trim was treated with either tap water or a 2.5% Beefxide spray prior to grinding. The ground pork was stuffed into three casings (natural, collagen, and fibrous), fermented and dried. There was no significant difference between the control and treated sausages for the reduction of EC (p=0.1645), S (p=0.3746), or LM (p=0.1762). There was also no significant difference between casing types within each sausage treatment. A 5 log10 reduction was achieved for S and LM by the end of vacuum packaging (up to 28 d), but EC was not reduced by a 5 log10 reduction by the end of vacuum packaging. EC was reduced by a maximum 4.02 log10 CFU/g in the collagen sausage when treated with the antimicrobial.\n\tThese experiments may be utilized by processors as supporting documentation in HACCP plans, as well as be accepted by the United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) personnel as validation and scientific evidence for use in HACCP plans.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14078], "author_name_tesi": "Mckinney, Samantha Rene", "last_name_ssi": "Mckinney", "middle_name_ssi": "Rene", "first_name_ssi": "Samantha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Campbell", "Catherine Cutter", "Nancy Ostiguy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Campbell, Thesis Advisor", "Catherine Cutter, Committee Member", "Nancy Ostiguy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["E. coli O157:H7", "Salmonella", "L. monocytogenes", "fermented sausages"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Advanced Hybrid Rocket Motor Propulsion Unit For CubeSats", "id": "26625", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11250", "abstract_tesi": "CubeSats continue to become popular for universities and businesses to affordably conduct research in low Earth orbit. Falling within the nanosatellite category, CubeSats typically consist of a 1U, 1.5U, 2U, or 3U standard configuration. A 1U CubeSat is a 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm cube, while 1.5U, 2U, and 3U CubeSats consist of stacked U(s) with a 10 cm x 10 cm square footprint. More recently, 6U CubeSats have been developed in both 6U x 1U and 3U x 2U configurations. Larger CubeSats will continue to be developed as dispenser systems become larger to accommodate the satellites during launch and deployment. To date, CubeSats have been limited by the orbit into which they are deployed, either as an auxiliary payload on a rocket carrying a primary payload to its required orbit or from the International Space Station. With the development of a safe and reliable propulsion system, CubeSats will be capable of performing orbital control maneuvers, such as orbit raising to extend the lifespan of the satellite and provide onboard instruments with additional data collection time. The propulsion unit in the current work was developed in collaboration with The Aerospace Corporation to provide a 6U CubeSat with this ability. The 1U propulsion unit consists of an additively manufactured carbon-filled polyamide structure and integrated nitrous oxide tank with a cartridge-loaded, 3D-printed solid fuel grain of ABS or paraffin/acrylic composition and performance enhancing geometry. Strength testing of the structure material characterized its properties as-received and after exposure to nitrous oxide. A significant plasticizing effect was observed for the material exposed to nitrous oxide. Ultimate tensile strength decreased by over 20% and modulus of elasticity decreased by over 40%, while elongation to break was increased. For this reason, future work will investigate an additively manufactured metal propulsion unit of similar design. Hot-fire testing of various solid fuel grain compositions and geometries was conducted at the Pennsylvania State University\u2019s High Pressure Combustion Laboratory using the Long-Grain Center-Perforated hybrid rocket motor with nitrous oxide. The results of the test series revealed interesting behavior for the additively manufactured paraffin, paraffin/acrylic, ABS, and Windform XT 2.0 fuel grains. Carbon-filled polyamide, Windform XT 2.0, fuel grains exhibited very slow regression rates, as was expected. ABS fuel grains with star-swirl port geometry were found to have increased regression rate over straight port ABS fuel grains, similar to what was found from previous oxygen testing of star-swirl geometry acrylic fuel grains. However, interesting to note was an observed increase in regression rate for white and black colored ABS fuel grains over pure ABS. This could be the result of increased radiation absorption with the added pigments, but due to a lack of provided information from the manufacture about the pigments this cannot be directly concluded. Combustion efficiency results show a decrease for star-swirl geometry fuel grains compared to straight port fuel grains for all ABS samples, while star-swirl geometry appeared to increase combustion efficiency for Windform XT 2.0 fuel grains. Increased regression rate was also observed for paraffin/acrylic diaphragm fuel grains over straight port paraffin. Examination of fired paraffin/acrylic 0.050\u201d diaphragm fuel grains showed chipping of the acrylic diaphragms and resulting uneven regression in the downstream paraffin sections. The paraffin/acrylic 0.100\u201d diaphragm fuel grains better maintained uniform regression due to the increased acrylic diaphragm thickness, however, combustion efficiency decreased significantly compared to that of pure paraffin. An iteration on the diaphragm fuel grain design included one 0.100\u201d acrylic diaphragm with an acrylic mixing section downstream of the diaphragm. This particular fuel grain design was shown to increase combustion efficiency over the original paraffin/acrylic diaphragm fuel grain design and pure paraffin fuel grains.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10791], "author_name_tesi": "Mcknight, Brendan Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Mcknight", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Brendan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["additive manufacturing", "CubeSat", "hybrid rocket motor", "regression rate", "combustion efficiency"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Built of Stone: The Family of Milton S.

This definition implies that form and function will change little over time, but greatly over space, since the vernacular represents the belief patterns of the tradition that produced it.  Because the concept of a vernacular suggests a shared sense of identity within a cultural group, traditional inquiries into vernacular objects have been largely focused on \u201creading\u201d buildings and landscapes as anonymous texts and as tangible manifestations of shared values and behaviors.  Despite recent scholarly efforts to expand traditional areas of inquiry into a methodology less focused on an analysis of form and function to one emphasizing the transmission of societal values over time through performance, the motivations of individuals in designing and placing architecture on the landscape over time remain relatively absent from scholarship. \n     This dissertation interprets the interrelationship between architecture and individual identity, the relationship of buildings to individuals in contemporary society, as well as the meaning individuals attach to the environments they associate with their past through the lens of a single family.  In this study of a narrowly defined Pennsylvania German landscape, I will use Milton S. Hershey and the physical landscape and legacy he created in the town of Hershey as an example of a successful negotiation between tradition and modernity in a changing industrialized landscape.  In creating his model community, Milton Hershey not only realized the creation of a Pennsylvania German cultural landscape, but managed to both transform and modernize that idea through change as well as continuity.\n     In realizing his vision of the model company town, Milton Hershey\u2019s abundant resources and unique brand of practical idealism allowed him to create a physical landscape that incorporated the adaptive reuse of existing properties (including some built by members of the Hershey family) as well as the construction of new buildings.  While Pennsylvania German cultural identity continued to evolve and adapt to New World circumstances throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the cultural landscape constructed by Milton Hershey embodied his own sense of Pennsylvania German cultural identity as well as that of a majority of those already living in the area, even as many of those traditions and customs were absorbed into an emerging national popular culture in the twentieth century.  By appealing to regionally linked traditions and existing societal values, Hershey used the vernacular to help negotiate between a past legacy of Pennsylvania German rural settlement and an industrial future.\n     In the early twenty-first century, Hershey residents continue to struggle with the meaning and relevance of their Pennsylvania German heritage constructed, as it were, through the lens of the Hershey family.  Born in 1857, just before the Civil War, into a traditional Pennsylvania German family, Hershey passed away in 1945, only a few months after the end of World War II.  Milton Hershey and the community he created are ideally suited to this query\u2014his life, because it straddled the transformation of America from an agricultural to industrial society; his town, because it continues to wrestle with the legacy of its founder and the meaning of place in a modern post-industrial society. As the cultural landscape of the Hershey area continues to be transformed and recreated by competing identities, I argue that the vernacular plays a major role in determining the overall appearance of the physical landscape of any community by allowing individuals an outlet to express their identity, values, and ways of looking at the world and to give physical material shape to their intentions through buildings.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10555], "author_name_tesi": "Mcmahon, James Dennis", "last_name_ssi": "Mcmahon", "middle_name_ssi": "Dennis", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "American Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Simon Josef Bronner", "Simon Josef Bronner", "Michael Lee Barton", "Anne Ayer Verplanck", "Jeremy Plant"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Simon Josef Bronner, Dissertation Advisor", "Simon Josef Bronner, Committee Chair", "Michael Lee Barton, Committee Member", "Anne Ayer Verplanck, Committee Member", "Jeremy Plant, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vernacular architecture", "Hershey", "cultural landscape", "material culture", "Pennsylvania German"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Pattern Shaping with Lenses and Grated Surfaces", "id": "15510", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7717", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis is comprised of two distinct studies in the shaping of radiation patterns.

Thus, in yet more recent history humans have developed a keen interest in the health of honey bees and how it relates, directly and indirectly, to their effectiveness as pollinators. Furthermore, other pollinator species have also become of interest to humans due to their own contributions to pollination services. Here we seek to add to a global understanding of bee health by taking a closer look at viruses known to negatively impact honey bee health and suspected to impact the health of other bees, as well. In Chapter 1, we review the literature incriminating viruses as a cause of honey bee colony losses. This includes a breakdown of the different kinds of evidence collected, including correlative evidence, experimental evidence verifying viral pathology, experimental evidence of therapeutic techniques, and the impact of a vector. In Chapter 2 we take a look at the seasonal variance of viruses in Kenyan honey bee colonies and the effect of hive type (Langstroth, Log or Kenyan Top Bar) on colony health as well as swarm preference for 3 different hive types. Briefly, we found that viral infection is higher in the dry season, when the bees are nutritionally stressed, though there seems to be no effect by hive type. Furthermore, swarms preferred the Langstroth hive, and secondly the Log hives. After giving considerations to costs and hive productivity, we recommend a modified Kenyan Top Bar hive may present the best course of action for beekeepers in the Mwingi District of Kenya. Lastly, in Chapter 3, we take a preliminary look at the role that a Bombus impatiens plays in the ecology of a honey bee virus (Deformed Wing virus, DWV). Our results suggest that individuals of this species may not be effective or competent transmitters of this virus. Further studies that improve upon our study design would need to be done to confirm or deny our result.

The perinatal period is important for the development of autonomic neurocircuits required for homeostatic regulations of many visceral functions, including gastric emptying and appetite regulation, and alterations of these neurocircuits may increase the propensity to develop obesity and its related comorbidities. Previous studies have suggested that exposure to a high fat diet during the perinatal period (PNHFD) increases the overall inhibitory tone of gastric-projecting dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) neurons in rats, i.e., the preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that strongly influence gastric tone and motility. Studies from several laboratories, including our own, have shown that the activity of mature gastric-projecting DMV neurons is dampened tonically by \uf06c-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synaptic inputs from the adjacent nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) in pre-obese rats. The neural mechanisms behind this increased inhibition following PNHFD, and physiological outcomes on gastric functions, have yet to be determined. \nThe aims of these studies were to determine the time-course of brainstem vagal neurocircuit development, the actions of PNHFD to disrupt neurocircuit development, and the consequent effects upon gastric-projecting DMV neurons as well as vagal efferent control of gastric tone and motility. This multi-layered study involved the use of whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology recordings from identified DMV neurons in brainstem slices and in-vivo measurement of gastric tone and motility in response to brainstem microinjections, in postnatal (4-8 week old) rats fed either a control diet or a HFD from the late embryonic period onwards. \nThe principle findings of the present studies can be summarized as (i) DMV neurons from both PNHFD and control rats exhibit similar in vivo and in vitro responses to the synaptic (phasic) GABAA receptor antagonist, gabazine, whereas (ii) DMV neurons from PNHFD rats respond to higher concentrations and doses of the non-selective GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline, with a larger increase in action potential firing rate and inward current, as well as increase in gastric tone and motility, (iii) that was independent of changes in extrasynaptic (tonic) GABAA receptor density or function, GABA uptake, or neuroglial regulation of synaptic strength.  Furthermore, our investigations into the time-course of inhibitory brainstem vagal neurocircuit development revealed that (iv) the endogenous developmental shift in the chloride reversal potential of DMV neurons occurs at postnatal day 8, suggesting an upregulation of the K+-Cl- cotransporter, KCC2, around this time, leading to the overall synaptic inhibition of DMV neurons, (v) in the early neonatal stage, inhibitory synaptic inputs to DMV neurons involves the use of both GABA and glycine as neurotransmitters, and (vi) there is a down-regulation of glycine neurotransmission after P13 and the emergence of as the principle inhibitory neurotransmitter into adulthood. Further investigations into the nature of the PNHFD-induced increased inhibitory synaptic input onto brainstem vagal neurons revealed that (vii) mature PNHFD DMV still receive tonic glycinergic synaptic inputs that decrease neuronal excitability and tonically inhibit vagal efferent control of gastric motility and tone. \nThus, the present studies suggest that overnutrition during the perinatal period arrests the developmental decline in glycinergic inhibitory neurotransmission within brainstem vagal neurocircuits such that gastric-projecting DMV neurons retain key aspects of their fetal phenotype into adulthood. This increases the inhibitory synaptic drive onto DMV neurons innervating the proximal gastrointestinal tract, resulting in decreased gastric motility and tone in pre-obese rats. Such changes in brainstem neurocircuit development may underlie the gastric dysmotility and altered upper gastrointestinal reflexes observed in obesity, and may even contribute to the energy imbalance that precedes the development of obesity. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15287], "author_name_tesi": "Mcmenamin, Caitlin Alannah", "last_name_ssi": "Mcmenamin", "middle_name_ssi": "Alannah", "first_name_ssi": "Caitlin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kirsteen Nairn Browning", "Renato A Travagli", "Patricia Mclaughlin", "Charles H Lang", "Ann Ouyang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kirsteen Nairn Browning, Dissertation Advisor", "Renato A Travagli, Committee Chair", "Patricia Mclaughlin, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Ann Ouyang, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Perinatal High Fat Diet (PNHFD)", "Dorsal Motor Nucleus of Vagus (DMV)", "Nucleus of Tractus Solitarius (NTS)"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Gender Differences in Peer Influence and Friend Selection for Adolescent Delinquency, Drinking, and Smoking", "id": "29617", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12680", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous research has confirmed that friend selection and peer influence concurrently explain why adolescents tend to exhibit similar problem behaviors as their friends.

The abandonment of rationality proffers the terms and concepts around which authors understand, structure, and represent their occupation. This largely unrecognized tradition of authorial misrule goes on to serve as a speculative domain for later Middle English authors.

This challenge stems from the dynamic nature of the layer-by-layer build process, which causes a nonuniform thermal history and a complex microstructural history throughout the part. The task of predicting the final microstructure and related properties of the part is nontrivial due to the lack of robust kinetic models for nonisothermal phase transformations, particularly for multiphase alloy systems that undergo multiple simultaneous phase transformations.\n          A computational microstructural model was developed to track the microstructural evolution of the part during the metal additive manufacturing build process. This model is a modified version of the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model for nonisothermal phase transformations and can be applied to any material system that undergoes solid-state phase transformations if its transformation kinetics are known. The transformation kinetics for two common additively manufactured superalloys, Inconel 718 and Ti-6Al-4V, were derived using thermodynamic data and kinetic theory. Using the derived kinetics along with the part\u2019s thermal history as inputs, the microstructural model outputs the phase fraction history of the part during the build. This model was applied to Inconel 718 and Ti-6Al-4V, each built by two different metal additive manufacturing processes: powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition.

One important activity is collaborative information seeking (CIS). CIS takes place when \u201ctwo or more individuals work together to seek needed information in order to satisfy a goal\u201d (Karunakaran & Reddy, 2012). Consequently, CIS can play an important role in team decision-making. Current CIS research has focused on (1) examining the social and interactional aspects of CIS in organizational and other settings and (2) developing technical approaches to support CIS activities. However, most CIS research has overlooked the cognitive aspects of CIS. In particular, there is little research examining CIS from a team cognitive perspective. \n\tOften, the development of team cognition positively improves the team decision-making process (Cooke et al., 2003). Specifically, the development of team mental models, a team cognitive construct, has often been identified as a way to help teams complete their work (Lim & Klein, 2006). However, the relationship of CIS and team cognition has never fully been explored.\n\tIn this dissertation, my four main research objectives were to (a) explore how teams approach CIS; (b) develop a conceptual understanding of team cognition during CIS; (c) understand the impact and affect of a co-located and distributed setting on team\u2019s CIS approaches and the development of team cognition, and (d) develop design guidelines for information technologies that will support multiple CIS approaches and the development of team cognition during CIS. To meet my research objectives, I conducted two separate qualitative laboratory studies of undergraduate student teams engaged in multiple CIS tasks. The first study focused on co-located, synchronous CIS. In this study, I utilized qualitative methods such as cognitive interviews, observations, and concept mapping to examine how teams approached CIS and to identify if and how team cognition developed during CIS activities. The second study examined teams using a collaborative system in a distributed, synchronous CIS environment. The second study employed cognitive interviewing to investigate CIS approaches and team cognition in the distributed environment.\nThrough these studies, I make contributions to three different research fields \u2013 (1) Human Factors, (2) Information Sciences, and (3) Computer Supported Cooperative Work. Specifically, I (1) identify different approaches that teams take to CIS, (2) explain the role and development of team cognition in CIS, and (3) describe how teams approach CIS and develop team cognition in both the co-located and distributed environments. Through this research, I hope to further our empirical understanding of CIS especially in regards to cognition. I also hope to provide some design guidance for the development of more effective CIS tools that account for the role of team cognition.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10279], "author_name_tesi": "Mcneese, Nathaniel James", "last_name_ssi": "Mcneese", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Nathaniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Madhu Reddy", "Dr Madhu Reddy", "Shawn Clark", "Dr Jim Jansen", "Susan Mohammed"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Madhu Reddy, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Madhu Reddy, Committee Chair", "Shawn Clark, Committee Member", "Dr Jim Jansen, Committee Member", "Susan Mohammed, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Collaborative Information Seeking", "Team Cognition", "Team Mental Models"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Design of a Nuclear Inspection Robot: Considering Dimensional, Force, Sensor Packaging, and Thermal Constraints", "id": "27409", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11725", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this thesis is to design a structurally- and environmentally-constrained, tethered and semi-autonomous robot that is able to inspect the interior crawl space around a nuclear dry-storage canister.

Previous research has demonstrated rich glottal jet behavior in normal and disordered phonation. The relevance of these behaviors to glottal aerodynamic resistance and sound generation is not well understood. Improving understanding in these areas provides predictive power for how changes in physiology, through disorder or surgical intervention, affect the effort and quality of voice. The most important contribution of this work is a demonstration that glottal jet inertance is as important as vocal tract inertance.\n\tComputational fluid dynamics simulations were conducted with increasing likeness to the physiological problem of phonation. A post-processing analysis identified Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) from the simulation velocity fields. The LCS enclosed material regions, and the motion of these regions provided the basis of this work. \n\tFirst, canonical aeroacoustic flows were simulated with vortex elements. The LCS identified in these flows were used as control surfaces for aeroacoustic analogies. The motion of material regions were directly related to the sound generated by the flow. Obtaining clear results from more realistic flows proved prohibitively expensive, so the LCS approach yielded no conclusive results concerning phonatory sound production.\n\tFlow in a duct through a rigid axisymmetric constriction was analyzed for a range of conditions (Re = 100-1000). The fluid region extruded through the constriction was identified with LCS analysis. The inertial component of the aerodynamic resistance of the constriction was estimated from the extruded fluid region. The inertial component was found to increase for increasing Reynolds number. Results compared well to a slug model, based on idealized motion of the extruded fluid region.\n\tFinally, post-processing of fluid-structure interaction simulations of flow through an idealized human upper airway was conducted. Two computational domains were studied, one that enforces symmetry of the glottal jet and one that does not. Both domains were two-dimensional. The fluid extruded through the model vocal folds was identified with LCS. The case with enforced symmetry exhibited a narrow jet extending roughly half the length of the model vocal tract. The case allowing jet asymmetry exhibited a glottal jet that extended roughly half the vocal tract width before breaking down. The contribution to the component of aerodynamic resistance associated with glottal jet inertia was estimated for both types of simulations. The usual linear acoustic inertances of the glottis and vocal tract were also computed. The inertance of the jet was found to be the same order of magnitude as the inertance of the vocal tract during vocal fold opening. As the jet developed, jet inertance grew larger than the typical estimates of glottal and vocal tract inertance. By the time of vocal fold closing, jet inertance was roughly two orders of magnitude greater than vocal tract inertance. \n\tThese findings strongly suggest that glottal jet inertance is at least commensurate with that of the vocal tract. This has important implications for the fundamental understanding of normal and disordered phonation. Variability in voice may be due to how glottal jet inertance depends on the richness of the glottal jet behavior. Further work should (1) apply a similar approach to three-dimensional simulations of phonation and (2) address the effect of specific disorders, surgical intervention, or supraglottal geometry on glottal jet inertance.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12862], "author_name_tesi": "Mcphail, Michael Jesse", "last_name_ssi": "Mcphail", "middle_name_ssi": "Jesse", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael H Krane", "Michael H Krane", "William O Hancock", "Keefe B Manning", "Ji Min Lee", "Sid Khosla"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael H Krane, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael H Krane, Committee Chair", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Keefe B Manning, Committee Member", "Ji Min Lee, Outside Member", "Sid Khosla, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Phonation", "Lagranian Coherent Structures", "Aeroacoustics", "Voice", "Speech"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Flux Regulation in Powered Magnets: Enabling Magnetic Resonance Experiments with Pulsed Field Gradients", "id": "22790", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10326", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High magnetic fields can significantly improve the resolution and sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measurements, which presents exciting research opportunities in areas of chemistry, biology, and  material science.

These field fluctuations make powered magnets inviable for high resolution NMR experiments.  Previous work by other researchers have shown that by feeding back measurements of field fluctuations, it is possible to significantly reduce magnetic field variations.  The most recent feedback design uses two sensors, including a pickup coil sensor that is effective to measure and reduce field fluctuations introduced by power supply ripple, and an NMR sensor to measure and reduce field fluctuations originating in variations in the cooling water temperature and flow rate.  Despite these advances in reducing temporal magnetic field fluctuations, the feedback design has two problems.  The first problem is that the feedback design requires further reduction in field fluctuations to allow high resolution NMR experiments.  The second problem is that the feedback scheme does not accommodate the use of pulsed field gradients, which are necessary in many NMR experiments.  This dissertation is presented to address both of these problems with the feedback scheme.  The first goal of this dissertation is to modify and test the feedback design to further reduce magnetic field fluctuations to enable 2D NMR in a powered magnet.  The second goal of this dissertation is to design, synthesize and verify a control method that accommodates the use of pulsed field gradients with the feedback field regulation system.  Challenges to meeting these goals include limited experiment time in powered magnets, insufficient processing power for real-time implementation of algorithms, and coupling of hardware noise into the physical system.\n\n%Powered magnets are capable of producing high fields that can significantly improve the resolution and sensitivity of magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy measurements.  With this improvement in MR measurements, new research opportunities are presented in focus areas of chemistry, biology, and  material science.  Unfortunately, temporal magnetic field fluctuations are introduced into powered magnets by power supply ripple and variations in temperature and flow rate of the cooling water systems, which causes powered magnets to be inviable for most high resolution MR measurements.  The application of cascade feedback control techniques can greatly reduce temporal field fluctuations in powered magnets.  Additionally, many classes of MR experiments, such as diffusion measurements, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and solvent suppression require the use of pulsed field gradients.  The recent iterations of the feedback control system used to attenuate temporal field fluctuations also measures and responds to pulsed field gradient signals.  Not only is the pulsed field gradient signal attenuated by the control system, the controller response to the gradient signal introduces new field fluctuations into the magnetic field.  These ancillary effects of pulsed field gradients on the feedback control system render it impossible to perform pulsed field gradient MR experiments with the field regulation system.  In addition, the cascade field regulation system, composed of a fast inner loop and a slow outer loop, requires further field fluctuation reduction allow more complex MR measurements such as two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) in powered magnets.  The fast inner loop must be modified so that it has increased disturbance rejection over a large frequency band so that it better serves as an antialiasing filter for the outer loop, and so that it does not attenuate low frequency field fluctuations because the inner loop sensor does not provide and accurate measure of field fluctuations in this frequency band.  The outer loop requires increased disturbance rejection at low frequencies and add derivative action to cause the field reach steady state more quickly.

Here, we identified an exon junction complex protein , RBM8a, as a positive regulator of embryonic neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. We determined that RBM8a knockdown (using in utero electroporation) leads to increased migration of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to the cortical plate (CP), depletion of the NPC pool, and a decrease in the number of cells in the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle. Conversely, RBM8a overexpression leads to decreased migration of NPCs to the CP, expansion of the progenitor pool, and increased proliferation. In order to further explore the role of RBM8a in neurogenesis, we developed a conditional knockout mouse. We selectively knocked out RBM8a in neural stem cells, and the resulting mice exhibited microcephaly, early postnatal lethality, and altered distribution of neurons in the neocortex. We then assessed the novel role of RBM8a in the development of GABAergic interneurons in the cortex. We discovered that in addition to the profound phenotypes observed in mice with reduced expression of RBM8a in excitatory neurons previously described in (Mao et al., 2015), Nes-cre;RBM8afl/+mice show a significant decrease in the density of parvalbumin (PV)+ and neuropeptide Y (NPY)+ interneurons in the cortex, and PV+, NPY+ and somatostatin (SST)+ cells are abnormally distributed throughout the cortical layers. To determine the mechanism underlying this phenotype, we injected EdU into  pregnant dams when the pups are E17 to label and quantitate the number of proliferating cells in the medial ganglionic eminence, where interneuron progenitors reside. We found a significant decrease in the number of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. However, we did not observe any change in the number or distribution of Edu+/Nkx2.1+ progenitors (which become cortical interneurons). This indicates that the changes in interneuron number and distribution seen in adolescent mice (P17) are likely due to defects in proliferation migration of Nkx2.11+ progenitors from the GE to the cortex, or changes in cell fate. We then utilized Nkx2.1-cre mice to determine if the interneuron deficits were due to intrinsic changes in the progenitors, or due to cues received from other altered cell types. We determined that knockout of RBM8a in interneuron progenitors alone led to some changes in their distribution, but this effect was significantly less profound as when compared to the deletion of RBM8a from all neural stem cells (NSC)s. Therefore, we concluded that the phenotype is likely caused by some changes in intrinsic properties of Nkx2.1+ interneuron progenitors, but conceivably could also be due to changes in extrinsic cues from excitatory neurons and other cell types. \nTo determine if pyramidal cells of the cortex have normal electrophysiological properties, we conducted spontaneous postsynaptic currents from putative pyramidal cells in the somatosensory cortex of Nes-cre;RBM8afl/+ mice and RBM8afl/+controls. Pyramidal cells of knockout mice show a significant decrease in the spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) frequency, but no changes in sIPSC amplitude, or spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current (sEPSC) frequency or amplitude. This suggests that there are functional deficits in the presynaptic, but not postsynaptic neurons. Deficits could include reduced activity of presynaptic interneurons, reduced number of synapses, or a lower vesicle release probability. Given our findings that these mice have fewer PV+ and NPY+ cells, we posit that cortical interneurons are releasing normal amounts of GABA, indicating that the change in frequency results from the decrease in interneuron number. However, more experiments need to be completed to clarify this point, including but not limited to evaluating miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) and mEPSCs. \nAnalyses of the transcriptome of mice with decreased RBM8a expression, and SH-SY5Y cells with RBM8a overexpressed indicated that RBM8a modulates many developmental pathways, such as the extracellular matrix (ECM) pathway, growth factor signaling and Notch signaling. Additionally, our findings indicate that RBM8a is a moderate regulator of alternative splicing, and regulates transcripts with characteristics predisposing them to degradation via NMD (intron in the 3\u2019 UTR, long 3\u2019 UTR etc.). We further assessed the mechanisms behind the observed phenotypes by quantitative western blotting of synaptic and developmental pathway proteins to determine if any were differentially expressed in RBM8a mutants vs. controls. We identified decreased expression of the GluA1 subunit of AMPA receptors and \u03b23 subunit of GABAA receptors in P17 whole brain lysate, and interestingly a 50% reduction in Notch1 NICD (Notch1 intracellular domain) expression. These results could explain the deficits observed in the knockout mice, however further research is needed to conclusively support this statement. Taken together, these data indicate a critical role for RBM8a in interneuron development, and establish that perturbation of this gene leads to profound developmental defects of the cerebral cortex. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15804], "author_name_tesi": "Mcsweeney, Colleen Patricia", "last_name_ssi": "Mcsweeney", "middle_name_ssi": "Patricia", "first_name_ssi": "Colleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yingwei Mao", "Yingwei Mao", "Bernhard Luscher", "Gong Chen", "David John Vandenbergh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yingwei Mao, Dissertation Advisor", "Yingwei Mao, Committee Chair", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "Gong Chen, Committee Member", "David John Vandenbergh, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rbm8A", "cortex", "corticogenesis", "development", "microcephaly", "autism"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "CONTINOUS SEPARATION OF COMMODITY CHEMICALS FROM PARTIALLY DEOXYGENATED PYROLYSIS OILS VIA FLASH DISTILLATION", "id": "14852tkm5215", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14852", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigated the potential for continuous flash distillation for fractionating partially deoxygenated bio-oils such as tail gas reactive pyrolysis (TGRP) bio-oil to extract the component chemicals of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX), which are critical feedstocks for producing many refinery products.  A model chemical mixture was used to mimic the low-oxygen nature of TGRP bio-oil, as TGRP bio-oil was available in limited quantities.

Other associated pathological changes in the brain consist of degeneration of brain tissue via loss of neurons and neuronal changes associated with loss of synapses and dendritic branch dearborization.  The disease consists of a general progression of cognitive and memory impairment leading to an insidious dementia like state followed by eventual patient fatality.  Above the age of 65 years old the incidence rate of Alzheimer\u2019s increases exponentially with age.  It is believed that one in ten individuals older than the age of 65 and approximately half of those older than 85 years old have been diagnosed with the disease.  Approximately 5 million Americans have AD at the present time and with the increased survival age of the world\u2019s inhabitants it is therefore poised to become a greater public health threat as our population ages. \n\tHistopathological investigation currently is the only approach that can accurately diagnose an individual with Alzheimer\u2019s disease; however these methods can only be completed post mortem.  Methods to noninvasively examine tissue in vivo have been of great interest in the study of AD and other neurological disorders.  Magnetic resonance imaging offers the unique ability to perform detailed in vivo evaluation of neural tissue to aid in this endeavor.  Imaging of beta-amyloid plaques in human Alzheimer\u2019s disease and transgenic models that mimic plaque production has been challenging for AD research.  The development of MR imaging technology capable of visualizing and quantifying AB plaques in the Alzheimer\u2019s brain is critically important for translational and clinical investigations.  Understanding the transverse MR relaxation associated with the neurodegenerative processes in AD would provide insight into future technologies that will aid in clinical studies.  Currently, the histo-pathological basis of image contrast and the relaxation mechanism associated with A\u00e2 plaques is not well understood.  Analysis and comparison between histology of a tissue sample and MRI in a one-to-one fashion is of importance for validating new imaging methods and contrasts, especially in molecular imaging research.  To help in this endeavor, our development of a histological RF coil has been realized and implemented.  Formaldehyde fixed tissue samples are cut on a cryostat, placed between two glass coverslips for positioning inside of the histological coil for MR imaging, then following the scanning protocols are carefully removed and histologically stained.  The experimental data collected with the histological coil demonstrate the feasibility of imaging thin slices of tissue samples and unambiguously co-registering these MR images to various histological staining results.  With the aid of the coil, T2*-weighted images and parametric maps were directly compared to histology stains acquired form a set of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and transgenic APP/PS1 tissue slices.  For AD tissue samples, transverse T2* relaxation due to A\u00e2 plaques is shown to be directly associated with the gradation of iron concentration and to a minor degree with plaque size.  For the transgenic APP/PS1 model, which generates A\u00e2 plaques and aims to mimic pathology, plaque morphology and size were associated with image contrast and transverse relaxation.  It has been assumed within the MR community that MR contrast associated with beta-amyloid plaques is due to iron concentration alone.  However, the contrast due to transgenic plaques with considerably less iron load are equally conspicuous as the human AD plaques in the MR images.  These data suggest a duality in the relaxation mechanism were both high focal iron concentration and highly compact fibrillar beta-amyloid masses cause rapid proton transverse magnetization decay.  For human AD tissue, the former mechanism is likely the dominant source of T2* relaxation; for APP/PS1 animals, the latter is likely the major cause of increased transverse proton relaxation rate in beta-amyloid plaques.  Histological evaluation on the APP plaques and AD plaques demonstrate important differences in iron load and plaque morphology that are hypothesized to be related to differences in transverse relaxation mechanisms.  This insight is essential for understanding the histo-pathological underpinning of MRI measurements associated with A\u00e2 plaques.\n\tTransgenic mouse models that reproduce neuropathology are important in understanding disease etiology and testing new clinical procedures.  Utilization of the transgenic APP/PS1 model brought into the light important dissimilarities between the naturally occurring A\u00e2 plaques found in the AD brain and those engineered to amass in the transgenic model.  Understanding the benefits and disadvantages of the APP/PS1 mouse model is important in considering the outcome from studies involving their usage and eventually transitioning these treatments to the in vivo AD brain.  Using various histological stains and microscopy methods aimed at viewing plaques morphology, iron management and inflammatory response we show that there are distinct differences between the naturally occurring human AD plaques and those found in the APP/PS1 model.  Clear morphological differences in plaque composition and ultra-structure allude to differences in amyloidogenesis and component fibril formation.  Transgenic animal plaques are morphologically distinct from Alzheimer\u2019s plaques as seen in both low magnification traditional microscopy and ultra-high magnification transmission electron microscopy.  Microglial and astrocyte staining shows a differing pattern of inflammatory response being much more pronounced in the AD neural tissue compared to the transgenic tissue.  Iron mismanagement and focal iron deposition is found ubiquitously throughout the AD tissue cortex, with plaques showing a close relationship to iron accumulation within them, and is not seen in the transgenic model.  The data presented here emphasizes pronounced histological grounds for MR relaxation differences between naturally occurring A\u00e2 plagues in the AD brain and those instituted to produce in the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model.  The data suggest that utilization of these transgenic models for various magnetic resonance, histological and pharmacological studies of Alzheimer\u2019s disease should be done with the consideration of these observations.\n\tThe evolution and translation of the MR approaches outlined in this work into the clinical domain to accurately diagnose AD and quantify in vivo beta-amyloid plaques would be advantageous for future medical diagnosis.  The data presented here represents a foundation for understanding the transverse relaxation mechanisms associated with beta-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.  Translating these results to an in vivo clinical setting presents a challenge to the MR community.  Currently the methods presented here are beyond the resolution limitations and time constraints of low field clinical scanners.  However, with advancements in future MR technology there is potential for expanding this research into a valid system.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4028], "author_name_tesi": "Meadowcroft, Mark David", "last_name_ssi": "Meadowcroft", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qing X Yang", "Qing X Yang", "James Robert Connor", "Paul Joseph Eslinger", "Michael Smith", "Robert J Milner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qing X Yang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qing X Yang, Committee Chair", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Paul Joseph Eslinger, Committee Member", "Michael Smith, Committee Member", "Robert J Milner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["APP", "Alzheimer", "PS1", "Iron", "Beta Amyloid", "MRI", "Plaque", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Microscopy", "Histology", "Stain"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "WAR SEASONS:  GLENN KILLINGER, SERVICE FOOTBALL, AND THE BIRTH  OF THE AMERICAN HERO IN POSTWAR AMERICAN CULTURE", "id": "14994tmm5470", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14994", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation examines Glenn Killinger\u2019s career as a three-sport star at Penn State. The thrills and fascinations of his athletic exploits were chronicled by the mass media beginning in 1917 through the 1920s in a way that addressed the central themes of the mythic Great American Novel. Killinger\u2019s personal and public life matched the cultural medley that defined the nation in the first quarter of the twentieth-century. His life plays outs as if it were a Horatio Alger novel, as the anxieties over turn-of-the-century immigration and urbanization, the uncertainty of commercializing formerly amateur sports, social unrest that challenged the status quo, and the resiliency of the individual confronting challenges of World War I, sport, and social alienation. I attempt to present a profoundly moving American success story that offers a glimpse into a chaotic period of military training, combat experience, and athletic valor that gave rise to the American hero.\nSome scholars have provided arguments that the so-called \u201cAmerican hero\u201d was created by a paradigm shift within the field of communications. Others view fitness crazes or lifestyle changes of working-class families motivated by higher paychecks and more leisure time.  While important in fueling sports hysteria in the 1920s, those views fall short of identifying the roles of the Wilson Administration and War Department that monopolized the media\u2019s messaging and used intercollegiate and intramural sports to prepare soldiers for the front lines of World War I. The war, I argue, did more to make sports the cornerstone of American life in the 1920s; thus placing the college [and subsequntially professional) athlete in the category of great American heroes. \nI deconstruct American society during World War I and a few years thereafter into order to show how sports hysteria of the 1920s created America\u2019s first celebrities. By examining this historically important cultural movement, I argue that the notion of the American hero emerged because of six factors: (1) newfound mass media models that included sports journalism, mass circulation of local stories through the Associated Press, and live broadcast radio, (2) the implementation of service sports at army and navy installations in 1917, (3) the creation of the Student Army Training Corps (which kept draft-age men in college by promising officer training in conjunction with a regular degree) and massed athletics (physical education) that mandated every college male participate in two-hours of military drill and one-hour of physical activity per day, (4) gender anxiety brought on by the \u201cintrusion\u201d (author\u2019s quotes) of women into male-dominated areas like the workplace and political arena, (5) the shift from amateur to professional sports, and (6) the modern art of ballyhoo promotion that helped a sports-crazed public replace war heroes with sport celebrities. \nI used four major research methods: (1) archival research, (2) historical reconstruction, (3) content analysis, and (4) oral history collection. Data has been collected from special collection archives, interviews, newspapers, military records, and Killinger family documents that included Glenn Killinger\u2019s unpublished memoir.

Agricultural drought occurs when there is inadequate soil moisture to meet a plant\u2019s needs, ultimately resulting in a reduction in crop yields.  Consequently an accurate drought vulnerability assessment tool should have the ability to account for the sensitivity of crops to soil moisture deficit conditions during critical stages of crop development.  Unfortunately many drought indices and assessment methods widely used today fail to provide an accurate assessment of soil variability across the landscape and may neglect the interaction of crops on soil moisture reserves.  The goal of the research presented in this paper was to develop a long-term agricultural drought risk assessment tool for Pennsylvania that was applicable at the field scale to help farmers make educated decisions based on their potential vulnerability to agricultural drought.  The assessment tool was developed using field based variables and a crop growth model and was structured to have limited data requirements to allow for a regional and statewide implementation.  Because the effects of soil moisture stress on crop yield are specific to the crop variety and the stage of growth during which the stress occurs, this research focused specifically on agricultural drought risk associated with the effects of soil moisture stress on corn. \n\nThe AquaCrop crop simulation model was utilized to simulate the effects of soil moisture stress on corn production under a variety of soil and climate conditions over a span of thirty years.  Although the model was already validated under diverse environmental conditions, a validation study was conducted to evaluate AquaCrop\u2019s ability to capture the relationship between corn growth and the effects of soil moisture stress under Pennsylvania conditions.  Data obtained from previous studies conducted in Rock Springs, PA and Landisville, PA were utilized to evaluate AquaCrop\u2019s ability to simulate the progression of cumulative biomass and grain yield with time, final biomass and harvestable yield, and volumetric water content at six depths.  The results indicated that AquaCrop was able to accurately simulate the progression of cumulative biomass and grain yield with time, with index of agreement values ranging from 0.96 to 0.99.  Comparisons between simulated and measured final biomass and final harvestable yield produced biomass deviations ranging from 2.4 to 20.7%, and yield deviations of 2.9 and 15.3%.  The water balance evaluation indicated that the model showed a tendency to underestimate soil water content at shallower depths.  However, for a model intended to assess a location\u2019s potential vulnerability to drought, a bias towards the underestimation rather than overestimation of soil water content was preferred to encourage the adoption of appropriate drought avoidance practices.  Averaged across all depths the results were consistent with other validation studies of soil water balance models, with RMSE ranging from 1.5 to 9.8 vol%.\n\nSSURGO (Soil Survey Geographic) data were used to satisfy the crop model\u2019s requirement for horizon-specific detailed soil characteristics for each location where corn growth was simulated.  However, the vast quantity of soils contained within the SSURGO database can make it extremely difficult to evaluate all soils at the field scale in a regional or statewide modeling analysis.  A second study was conducted to develop a structured approach of reducing the dimensionality of the SSURGO soils data while still preserving data variability.  Cluster analysis was used to group the 637 agricultural SSURGO soils mapped within the nine county study region using seventeen soil properties considered important for an assessment of a soil\u2019s vulnerability to agricultural drought.  Forty-three clusters were formed and found to be satisfactory using the evaluation criteria of cubic clustering criterion, pseudo F, and pseudo t2 statistics.  A preliminary principal component analysis was conducted to transform the original seventeen correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables to be entered into the cluster analysis.  The first four principal components explained 85.98% of the total variance.  A representative soil was selected for each cluster based on the smallest Euclidean distance to the cluster centroid.  Comparisons of simulated biomass yield were made between the clusters to assess differences and similarities in the behavior of the clusters in an agricultural setting.  Certain clusters showed minimal differences while others showed considerable differences, providing an indication that the soil clusters were able to represent the variability of the original soils in terms of biomass yield.\n\nThe final study utilized the AquaCrop model validated in the first study and the representative soils determined in the second study to simulate the effects of soil moisture deficit conditions for each soil under a variety of climate conditions over a span of thirty years.  The effects of soil moisture stress on corn production were quantified to develop a worst-case scenario baseline drought vulnerability index with the ability to capture the vulnerability of Pennsylvania\u2019s diverse soils to agricultural drought.  An index representing conditions likely to occur once every four years was mapped over a subset of nine Pennsylvania counties to provide farmers with a tool to detect potential problematic conditions.  A relationship was developed between the index and relative yield reductions to put the index in terms more meaningful to farmers.  The relative yield reductions likely to occur once in four years were then mapped over the nine county study area.  The results demonstrated that the drought vulnerability of a given location stems from a complex interaction of both climate and soil properties.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6401], "author_name_tesi": "Mebane, Valerie Jean", "last_name_ssi": "Mebane", "middle_name_ssi": "Jean", "first_name_ssi": "Valerie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rick Lane Day", "Rick Lane Day"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rick Lane Day, Thesis Advisor", "Rick Lane Day, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["crop model", "agricultural drought", "SSURGO soils"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "NEGTIOATING INTERDISIPLINARY TEAMING  \nIN A MIDDLE-LEVEL SCHOOL CONTEXT\n", "id": "6298", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1049", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    Interdisciplinary teaming refers to a team of teachers from various disciplines teaching the same core group of students.  While a body of research exists to support teaming, especially in a middle-level context, teams themselves are rarely afforded the time to reflect on their practice and inclusion on a team.  One of the components of teaming includes interdisciplinary curriculum and instruction which implies an integration of subjects affording students the opportunity to make connections in their learning.\n    As a team teacher for six years, I decided to explore my own team of six teachers in order to gain a better understanding of how one team functions.  I divided the subjects of the study into two groups: Team A refers to the team I studied for the first two years, and Team B refers to teachers, three of whom are new, in the last six months of the study.  The questions I attempt to answer after nearly three years of research including conducting interviews, observing and taking fieldnotes and collecting artifacts are:\n1. How do team teachers understand interdisciplinary teaming in a middle level context?  \n\n2. What are the patterns or characteristics of an interdisciplinary team?\n\n3. How do teams define success and negotiate the culture of teaming?\n\n4. How can a team be more effective? \nAn ethnographic case study, my research understands teams as cultures which were intentionally created as micro-societies within schools.  With unique traditions, procedures and vocabulary, teams can only be measured against themselves. \n    Team effectiveness should be considered by unique, shared goals teams set for themselves.  Three clusters of categories essential to effective teams emerged from the research I conducted with Team 8 Orange.  These include team management, team personnel and team objectives. The four aspects of team management are team leadership, time, and administrative support.  The second cluster, team personnel includes the following qualities: commitment to teaming, personality, communication skills and trustworthiness.  The third and final cluster, team objectives, consists of three aspects: shared goals, interdisciplinary curriculum, and focus on students.  \n    After a description of Team 8 Orange as it relates to each component of effective teaming taken from fieldwork, I conclude Team A could have been more effective while Team B, an effective new team, must remain committed to improvement in order to avoid the fate of Team A. Finally, the study concludes with an analysis of the components as they relate to Team A and B as well as a look at the future of teaming. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1039], "author_name_tesi": "Mecca, Cecelia Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Mecca", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Cecelia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James F Nolan Jr.", "Dana Lynn Mitra", "Jamie Myers", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Dana Lynn Mitra, Committee Member", "Jamie Myers, Committee Chair", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["teaming interdisciplinary curriculum middle school"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE DYNAMIC HERPESVIRUS TEGUMENT:  RECEPTOR BINDING INDUCED RELEASE OF UL16 FROM THE HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS CAPSID\n\n", "id": "9200", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1399", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The complex and multistep process of herpesvirus assembly occurs in numerous cellular compartments, and ultimately concludes with the construction of the mature virion.  Herpes simplex virus (HSV) particles are composed of more than 40 different virally-encoded proteins that comprise three morphologically distinct structures:  the icosahedral nucleocapsid containing the viral DNA; the host-derived lipid envelope with virus-encoded glycoproteins; and the tegument, an assortment of proteins between the nucleocapsid and the envelope.  The specific mechanisms by which these various viral proteins come together to drive the assembly and budding processes are poorly understood.  \nThe focus of this dissertation is UL16, a conserved tegument protein whose function remains a mystery for any herpesvirus.  It has been reported to be capsid-associated, possibly through an interaction with UL21, and may be involved in budding by linking capsids to the membrane-bound tegument protein UL11.  UL16 has been shown to be present in all the major locations that capsids are found (i.e., the nucleus, cytoplasm, and virions), but whether it is actually capsid-associated in each of these has not been reported.  Therefore, capsids were purified from detergent lysates of each compartment, and it was found that UL16 is present on cytoplasmic, not nuclear, capsids.  This cytoplasmic capsid binding did not require an interaction with previously identified binding partners UL21 and UL11.  Additionally, the population of UL16 found on cytoplasmic capsids was added prior to reaching the site of budding. This is due to the fact that unenveloped capsids still contained UL16 in membrane floatation assays, and in experiments with mutant viruses (&#8710;UL36, &#8710;UL37, and gE-/gD-) that are unable to perform final envelopment.  \nWhen extracellular capsids were analyzed using similar lysis conditions, the majority of UL16 (87%) was surprisingly not capsid associated.  These data suggests that the interaction of UL16 with the capsid is transient during egress, and may represent the first example of a herpesvirus maturation event.  Because HSV buds into the acidic compartment of the trans-Golgi network (TGN), the effect of pH on the interaction was examined.  The amount of capsid-associated UL16 dramatically increased when extracellular virions were exposed to mildly-acidic media (pH 5.0-5.5), and this association was fully reversible.  After budding into the TGN, capsid and tegument proteins also encounter an oxidizing environment which is conducive to disulfide bond formation.  UL16 contains 20 cysteines, including two that are conserved within a putative CxxC motif, which are commonly found in protein disulfide isomerases.  Pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a small membrane-permeable compound that covalently modifies free cysteines, restabilizes the UL16-capsid interaction, thereby permitting the complex to be isolated following disruption of virions with NP-40.  \nThe natural trigger for releasing UL16 from extracellular capsids was found to be the binding of HSV to host cells, such that NEM was unable to preserve the interaction of UL16 with the capsid. This internal change was also observed upon binding to immobilized attachment receptors (heparin) in a manner that requires glycoprotein C.  Therefore, the interaction of HSV with its initial cell-attachment proteins induces a rapid and highly efficient structural change in the tegument.  This represents the first evidence for transmission of a signal\u2014from the \u201coutside-in\u201d\u2014across a virus envelope as a result of receptor binding.\nBased on all the available data, UL16 is stably added to capsids prior to their arrival at the site of budding in the cytoplasm.  Subsequently, something destabilizes this capsid interaction during egress (e.g., low pH and oxidizing conditions), so that UL16 is efficiently released from the capsid upon gC-heparan sulfate binding during early entry events.  Where the tegument was once viewed as static layers of proteins, the studies described in this dissertation reveal that this region is more dynamic than previously recognized.    \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1388], "author_name_tesi": "Meckes, David  ", "last_name_ssi": "Meckes", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "David ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Warren Wills", "Richard James Courtney", "Jianming Hu", "Leslie Joan Parent", "John Michael Flanagan Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Warren Wills, Committee Chair", "Richard James Courtney, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member", "John Michael Flanagan Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["glycoprotein", "NEM", "HSV", "capsid", "tegument", "assembly", "herpes", "entry", "virus", "cyteines", "signaling"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "A FRAMEWORK FOR METAMODEL-BASED DESIGN: SUBSYSTEM METAMODEL ASSESSMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES", "id": "5840", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4522", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-08-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of mathematical models to analyze and simulate complex\nreal world systems is widely applied in many scientific and\nengineering domains.

A number of distinct literatures now provide a framework for investigating the hypothesis that the cerebellum contributes to cognition and specifically working memory. First reviewed is evidence from paleontological, comparative and psychological studies demonstrating that the earliest cerebellum-like structures evolved in conjunction with complex senses and presently maintain a role in a wide range of sensory and other nonmotor processes across species. Neuroanatomical studies have revealed several that cortico-cerebellar structural loops integrate an extended network between the frontal and parietal cortices and the cerebellum and findings in modern human development reveal a tight functional relationship between the cerebellum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Studies of executive functions and working memory in neuropsychology and neuroimaging found broad ranging involvement of the cerebellum in many higher order tasks, with pronounced involvement in verbal working memory. These literatures show that the cerebellum has a complex and nuanced functional relationship to the neocortex, but its role in working memory remains poorly explained. For example, the cerebellum\u2019s influence on task performance has not been examined in the context of a distributed functional network during a continuous working memory task. It is a goal of the current thesis to review specific evidence supplied by multiple domains of inquiry that provide a framework for understanding the cerebellum\u2019s role in modern human cognition, especially in executive functions and verbal working memory. Based upon this review, the current study investigated the contribution of the cerebellum to performance in verbal working memory and the relationships between activity in the cerebellum to several cortical regions in the context of a continuous verbal working memory task, the n-back, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and functional connectivity analyses. Reaction time was found to decrease during performance of both verbal working memory tasks. In general, the BOLD signal in the cerebellum was highly related to that in the contralateral prefrontal and parietal cortices. Unified structural equation modeling revealed that cerebellar influences on motor and cognitive regions were equivalent with the exception of the early and late portions of the 2-back task, during which the left cerebellum demonstrated high connectivity with the right prefrontal and parietal cortices. These findings suggest that the cerebellum is highly interactive with cognitive regions during verbal working memory, including regions thought to be involved in cognitive control.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2621], "author_name_tesi": "Medaglia, John Dominic", "last_name_ssi": "Medaglia", "middle_name_ssi": "Dominic", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Frank Gerard Hillary", "Frank Gerard Hillary", "Rick Owen Gilmore", "Peter Andrew Arnett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Frank Gerard Hillary, Thesis Advisor", "Frank Gerard Hillary, Thesis Advisor", "Rick Owen Gilmore, Thesis Advisor", "Peter Andrew Arnett, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["functional connectivity", "fMRI", "cerebellum", "working memory"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The cerebellum's role in WM during recovery from TBI", "id": "22571", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10295", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous studies of WM processing during recovery from traumatic brain injury (TBI) have\nprimarily focused on the nature of functional recruitment of the right dorsolateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate, and inferior parietal cortices following injury.

This type of glass-ceramic was produced by controlled crystallization of a homogeneous SiO2&#8722;TiO2 glass at the eutectic composition. This process resulted in the formation of heterogeneous structures consisting of a very large number of tiny and randomly oriented prolate spheroid crystals of high permittivity and high conductivity TiO2, sparsely distributed in the low permittivity and low conductivity SiO2-rich matrix. The SiO2&#8722;TiO2 glass-ceramics showed dielectric spectra caused by the heterogeneous microstructure. More specifically, the system exhibited a Debye-like dispersion resulting from the convolution of the interfacial polarization contributions of an even mixture of the TiO2 spheroids having their two principal axes randomly oriented along the applied electric field. Another Debye-type dispersion results from the intrinsic dielectric relaxation of the rutile-TiO2 inclusions.

It was found that the inherent dielectric relaxations in the SiO2-matrix are different from those observed in the SiO2&#8722;TiO2 glass-ceramics. These glasses exhibited one dielectric\nrelaxation which originated at the surface of the specimens and was attributed to electrode polarization. A second dielectric relaxation at the lower frequencies originated from bulk effects and was ascribed to the conduction polarization.

Objective: The purposes of these studies were to evaluate the effects of gender on lower extremity (LE) kinematics and make kinematic comparisons between 3 groups of the least, middle, and most amount of LE alignment.  Subjects: Twenty-four healthy subjects (12 males/12 females) between the ages of 18-30 volunteered for this study.  All subjects had a history of at least 1 year of participation in competitive basketball.  Measurements: Measurements of 6 LE alignments: navicular drop (ND), tibial varum (TV), quadriceps angle (QA), genu recurvatum (GR), pelvic tilt (PT), and femoral anteversion (FA) were performed on each subject.  Each alignment was divided into 3 groups of the least (1), middle (2), and most (3) degree of alignment.  All subjects performed 3 sport-related, functional tasks: a vertical jump, a sidestep cut, and a jump stop.  Three-dimensional kinematic data for hip and knee motion were collected.  Specific kinematic variables analyzed were joint angle at initial contact, peak angle, time-to-peak angle (TTP), and total angle change.  Results: Females demonstrated smaller peak hip abduction angles compared to males for the vertical jump and jump stop tasks, and less hip internal rotation angles compared to males at initial contact for the sidestep cut.  Group 3 of FA demonstrated less total hip flexion and more total hip adduction compared to Group 2.  Groups 1 & 3 of FA demonstrated shorter TTP for knee adduction than Group 2.  Group 3 of FA demonstrated shorter TTP for knee internal rotation than Group 2.  Group 1 of GR demonstrated shorter TTP for hip internal rotation than Group 2.  Conclusions: LE alignment contributes to alterations in kinematics during functional tasks and these alterations tend to impart more stress on the knee.

However, the CRS is limited by its incapacity to quantify risk, so the need for a social risk index that takes factors that can effectively manage and mitigate social conflicts into consideration becomes crucial.\n\nBased on the International Council of Mining and Metals, competition for the use of water, land and labor were identified as the major causes of social conflicts in mining operations. This competition can be subdivided into consumption of the strategic resources and the level of interaction between mining operations and local communities. Competition was quantified by the need of these resources by (1) the mining project, (2) population and (3) local business. The level of the interaction between the mine and local communities was quantified by (4) the distance between them, and (5) the mining stage of the operation. For all these five variables, a value between 1 \u2013 10, and a weight (%) that represents the influence of each parameter in social risk was assigned. Then, the use of a mathematical expression provided final result values (score) that helped reveal an estimated measurement of the social risks per strategic resource. Finally, the score obtained for each resource was adjusted according to the results of a previously developed survey that revealed the grade of importance of each resource compared to the others. The final value is then considered the social risk index. This new approach presented for measuring social risk in mining operations is then based on a combination of the qualitative and quantitative research methodologies.\nIndex value results have been compared to real social experiences of eight different gold mine operations. The outcome of this analysis reveals that four of the projects that currently experience serious social conflicts obtained social risk values above 5, while projects with no social conflicts obtained values below 5. Therefore, it can be concluded that the risk index is able to successfully achieve the recognition of projects involved in severe social conflicts, and that a value over 5 can be considered as a potential hazard for future social conflict development.  This study is intended to present a new and different alternative to measure social risk in order to prevent terrible outcomes such as the loss of life and the failure of future mining investments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11383], "author_name_tesi": "Medina, Juan F", "last_name_ssi": "Medina", "middle_name_ssi": "F", "first_name_ssi": "Juan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Antonio Nieto"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Antonio Nieto, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Social risk. qualitative study", "mining operations", "social license to operate"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A SIMULATION APPROACH FOR THE PREDECTIVE CONTROL OF A DISTRIBUTION CENTER\n", "id": "10038", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3708", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents a Simulation for Predictive Control (SimPC) as a decision making tool for improving the operation of non-automated distribution centers (DCs).

MDD is considered complex given the (1) wide range of technologies with diverse intended uses, (2) multiple stakeholders with conflicting objectives, and (3) development environment impacting the development process. However, big part of this complexity is attributed to the highly-regulated nature of these products. Medical devices are regulated worldwide by a wide range of government agencies, with the Unites States recognized as the global leader. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates medical devices to assure that these products are safe and effective before their release into the U.S. market. Therefore, FDA is identified as the first factor influencing the industry decisions and priorities for MDD. \nIn general, published work in this area either addresses the MDD with a specific focus on regulation or provides proposals for various MDD approaches; however, these works are fragmented in that they fail to consider the relationship between the two foci. This research proposes the use of a model-based framework along with Design for X (DfX) concepts to develop a stronger relationship between the development process and the regulations. A model-based framework provides a comprehensive view on the different elements that should be considered for MDD process. DfX methods are recommended to drive the development process with a focus on important objectives, in this case \u2013 the regulations. The number of studies addressing DfX for MDD is limited; however, these methods are relevant to the objectives of developing safe and effective medical devices. Accordingly, this research develops a Design for X (DfX) approach for MDD that incorporates the FDA regulation for medical devices. \nDfX for MDD involves the creation of a product design process model, definition of critical factors by hierarchical levels and development of the Design for FDA (DfFDA) concept. The product design process model provides the model-based framework and a set of formalisms to define the MDD landscape. The model is build from documentation analysis and validated by subject matter experts (SME) and a use case. Critical factors for MDD are defined in this framework and organized based on their relevance on different hierarchical level: organization, development environment, and development process. The critical factors identified at the various hierarchical levels include: (1) organization level: communication and experience of the development team; (2) development environment level: FDA/international regulatory requirements, customer\u2019s demand for cost-saving/cost-effective technology and price-sensitivity, costs \u2013 R&D, clinical research, litigation, and availability of capital funds, coverage and reimbursement requirements, and intellectual property protection issues; and (3) development process level: NPD process completeness and proficiency, preliminary market and financial analysis, customer involvement, and complexity/technical challenge.\nAn additional level is identified, the product level, where an empirical investigation is performed to study the impact of various factors in FDA\u2019s decision time. This analysis identifies critical factors at the product level and is the basis to develop DfFDA. The critical factors identified include regulatory components, product characteristics and the historical reference. Significant regulatory components include the submission types (PMA, traditional 510(k), special 510(k) and abbreviated 510(k)) and the different types of classifications (product codes, risk classification and regulation number). Significant product characteristics included the factors specific to hip devices (cemented, constrained) and generalized factors applicable to most medical devices (intended use, context of use, function and material). The importance of historical reference, as an indication of various types of experience, showed the significance of company's experience with FDA, and FDA's experience in terms of product codes and product characteristics (body part, function, material and et cetera).\nThe proposition of a product design process model and analysis of critical factors are both integrated into DfX for MDD. In this process DfX methods applicable to MDD and overlapping with FDA objectives are identified. The DfX methods identified include: Design for Validation (DfV), Design for Reliability (DfR), Design for Quality (DfQ), Design for Manufacturing (DfM), Design for Assembly (DfA) and Design for Usability (DfU). The DfFDA concept is proposed to extend on the existing concepts in order to increase awareness about regulatory compliance and promote designers to consider the regulations throughout the MDD process. The proposed DfFDA provides guidelines based on the analysis of critical factors. The defined guidelines includes both generalized and product specific guidelines. Generalized guidelines  focuses on the (1) consideration of FDA early and throughout the development process, (2) use of effective communication with FDA, (3) consideration of human factors, (4) consideration of standards and guidance documents, and (5) explosion of FDA resources while being attentive to changes. These guidelines are further divided into the hierarchical framework, with impact to the organization (1 and 2), development environment (4 and 5), and development process (3). Product specific guidelines, at the product level of the hierarchical framework, include highlights of the importance of product codes and the development of a predictive model (R2 of 40% and 35%) for FDA\u2019s decision time. DfFDA complements the DfX framework for medical devices.\nIn summary, DfX for MDD is proposed as an aid for designers to proactively use in handling the complexities of MDD. DfX for MDD is intended to help as (1) training material/best practices, (2) framework for process improvement (to enhance completeness and environment considerations such as the regulations), (3) process guideline for implementation, and (4) assistance for regulatory compliance.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7099], "author_name_tesi": "Medina, Lourdes A.", "last_name_ssi": "Medina", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Lourdes", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Allen Wysk", "Gul Kremer", "Richard Allen Wysk", "Gul Kremer", "Andris Freivalds", "Irene Johnston Petrick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Allen Wysk, Dissertation Advisor", "Gul Kremer, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Chair", "Gul Kremer, Committee Chair", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "Irene Johnston Petrick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["design", "medical devices", "conceptual framework", "critical factors", "Design for X", "FDA"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "I Only Have Eyes For You: Three Case Studies in Rock 'n' Roll, Fandom, and Pop Art", "id": "16247", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8101", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Rock and roll was a crucial ingredient of Pop art.

Of particular concern is the total energy that can be stored by the source, as it limits the range of the vehicle, and the maximum power that can be delivered by the source, as it limits the rate at which the vehicle can move. In most of today\u2019s unmanned ground vehicles or mobile robots, a single battery pack is used to supply the low power sensor/control systems and the high power traction system. The use of a single battery pack has the merit of simplicity but forces a tradeoff between vehicle range and rate capabilities. Current research efforts to improve energy management for these vehicles have focused on sharing power demands among sources having different energy and power capabilities. The Hybrid Power and Energy for Robots (HyPER) architecture was developed for this purpose. Most power systems are specific to the application and cannot readily accommodate the addition of new sources. In this project, an improved architecture for hybrid power systems containing heterogeneous energy sources has been developed from the HyPER architecture. This architecture is applicable in a large range of systems and can accommodate the addition of new energy sources automatically. An important feature of this architecture is that it ensures the stability of the system through a combination of feedback linearization and self-configuration. The effectiveness of the architecture has been demonstrated through a [small-scale] prototype system.

Despite substantial progress, the distribution of slip on specific faults remains poorly understood.  However, studies of surface process response to tectonics over the last several decades have found that responses can be quantified in relation to the magnitude of perturbation.  In particular, numerous studies suggest that fluvial systems developed above growing folds exhibit strong correlations with uplift rate.  Here, we build on these studies to develop a quantitative, empirical calibration of the scaling between channel steepness index (ksn \u2013 a measure of channel gradient normalized for drainage area) and uplift rate; we derive a geometric model of uplift rate using data of Lav\u00e9 and Avouac (2000) and analyze channel profiles using a 30m DEM derived from SRTM data.  Our analysis confirms a linear relationship between uplift rate and ksn; we apply this calibration to regions of similar lithology along the Baisahi anticline in western Nepal.  At the Baisahi Anticline channel profiles exhibit smooth profiles with similar concavity, consistent with spatially uniform uplift rates above a planar ramp in the Main Frontal Thrust fault (MFT).  Channel steepness indices along the western anticline are invariant with position along the anticline, suggesting a uniform uplift rate of 9 mm/yr \u00b1 2 mm/yr.  Along the eastern portion of the anticline, steepness indices increase systematically from west to east, suggesting that uplift rates increase toward the east.  However, structural data suggest that this reflects an increase in the dip of the fault at depth.  Our analysis suggests that the Baisahi anticline absorbs 19 mm/yr \u00b1 3 mm/yr of active shortening.  The Baisahi Anticline includes streams both within the lithology of the Bagmati calibration site and streams in the Upper Siwaliks.  This allows us to create a secondary calibration that includes the scaling relationship between the Upper Siwaliks and uplift, which is distinct from the relationship see in the Lower and Middle Siwaliks. We then apply this secondary calibration to the Janauri Anticline of North-Western India. The mean shortening rate at the Janaui Anticline is ~6 mm/yr, 1/3 the shortening rate at Baisahi.  This is consistent with geodetic studies that suggest a decrease in shortening rates from east to west along the Himalaya as a result of the counter-clockwise rotation of the Indian Plate with respect to the Eurasian Plate. Our results demonstrate how local calibration of channel profile adjustment to uplift rate can be used to place constraints on active deformation in regions where other geomorphic markers are sparse or absent.  In addition, we find that geologic shortening rates determined with stream profile analyses nearly match geodetic rates, indicating that a majority of shortening in the Sub-Himalaya is ultimately accommodated on the MFT.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10558], "author_name_tesi": "Meghani, Nooreen Amina", "last_name_ssi": "Meghani", "middle_name_ssi": "Amina", "first_name_ssi": "Nooreen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Kirby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Kirby, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["geomorphology", "stream channel incision", "Sub-Himalaya", "Main Frontal Thrust Fault", "Siwalik Hills"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Impact of Triclosan on Genetic Diversity in Artificial Green Roof Microbial Communities", "id": "25038", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10993", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Low-impact development (LID) is a cost effective engineering strategy using natural features to manage stormwater runoff. Green roofs, vegetated rooftops, are an emerging LID strategy that not only manage stormwater runoff, but also minimize energy costs, improve aesthetics, provide wildlife habitats, and reduce the urban heat index. Recycled and reused materials offer additional improvements to LID techniques by repurposing waste diverted from landfills. Waste tires can be shredded to provide an artificial growth medium on green roofs. LID strategies can be further enhanced by reusing greywater (GW) to irrigate an artificial growth medium of recycled rubber supplemented with compost (RM). Artificial soils are less expensive and more lightweight than commercially available soils, better accommodating the weight bearing limit of buildings. Additionally, GW reuse helps to conserve potable water, reducing water scarcity. GW often contains triclosan, an antimicrobial found in personal care products that can select for resistant organisms. Previous studies support the use of RM, but the impact of greywater and triclosan on microbial communities in RM has yet to be investigated. In this study, the effects of greywater irrigation on microbial community genomic and phenotypic diversity were compared in RM and commercially available green roof media (CM). A mixture of ryegrass and Kentucky bluegrass were grown in each medium and watered with either GW or greywater with triclosan (GWT).

Most notably, DFFB is responsible for the heat transfer during the blowdown and reflood portions of the postulated loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA). Such analyses require the accurate predictions of the heat transfer resulting from the non-equilibrium conditions present in DFFB. A total of six,\ninterrelated heat transfer paths need to be modeled accurately in order to quantify DFFB\nheat transfer. Within the nuclear industry, transient safety analysis codes, such as\nCOBRA-TF, are used to ensure the safety of the reactor under various transient and accident scenarios.\n\nAn extensive literature review of DFFB heat transfer highlighted a number of correlative, phenomenological, and mechanistic models. The Forslund-Rohsenow model is most commonly implemented throughout the nuclear industry. However, several of the models suggested by Forslund and Rohsenow to model DFFB phenomena are either inapplicable for nuclear reactors or do not provide an accurate physical representation of\nthe true situation. Deficiencies among other DFFB heat transfer models in their applicability to nuclear reactors or in their computational expenses motivated the development of a mechanistically based DFFB model which accounted for each heat transfer mechanism explicitly.\n\nThe heat transfer resulting from dispersed droplets contacting the heated wall in DFFB was often neglected in previous models. In this work, a first-principles approach was implemented to quantify the heat transfer attributed to direct contact. Lagrangian droplet trajectory calculations incorporating realistic radial vapor velocity and temperature profiles were performed to determine if droplets could contact the heated\nwall based upon the local conditions. These calculations were performed over a droplet\nsize spectrum accounting for various droplet diameter effects. When contact was achieved, the heat transfer was quantified by coupling the mass flux of droplets contacting the wall with a mechanistic direct contact heat transfer coefficient. Unlike currently used methods, the proposed DFFB model shows the correct trends with respect to local vapor mass flux and wall superheats.\n\nThe proposed DFFB model also extends previous models to predict the radiative and interfacial heat transfer. A nodal radiative heat flux model was adapted to account for the radiative heat transfer among the droplet size spectrum. The interfacial heat transfer provided by the dispersed droplets was predicted by adapting the Lee-Ryley model to account for the varying droplet velocity and interfacial area across the droplet size spectrum in addition to the vapor temperature distribution.\n\nA novel method was developed as part of the Lagrangian trajectory calculations to\ncapture the convective enhancement due to the dispersed droplets intermittently altering\nthe vapor temperature distribution. Following the development of the proposed DFFB heat transfer model, it was implemented within the existing framework of COBRA-TF. Effective heat transfer coefficients were utilized as a means of preserving the DFFB heat transfer contributions within COBRA-TF.\n\nThe proposed DFFB model was assessed using data from 118 steady-state experiments in four separate facilities. Comparisons between the predictions of COBRA-TF utilizing the original and proposed DFFB models show significant improvements.\n\nOver all of the assessment cases, the proposed DFFB model reduced the root mean square error by 32.55 K. More significantly, the proposed model was more precise as it reduced the standard deviation in the wall temperature prediction error by 32.34 K. \n\nThroughout the assessment cases, the proposed DFFB model predicted both the magnitude and trend seen in the experimental data better than the original model based upon Forslund-Rohsenow. These results provided confidence that the proposed model reflects the underlying physics governing the DFFB heat transfer components and can be used in place of existing models in nuclear reactor safety analysis codes as a means to improve the accuracy in current large break LOCA simulations that include DFFB conditions.\n\nOverall, the proposed DFFB model marks a step-change in the use of mechanistically based DFFB models in reactor safety analysis codes. It also provides a functional modeling package which improves the predictive capabilities of nuclear\nreactor safety-analysis codes and serves as a starting point for future research and\ndevelopment in DFFB.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4157], "author_name_tesi": "Meholic, Michael James", "last_name_ssi": "Meholic", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Cengiz Camci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fan Bill B Cheung, Dissertation Advisor", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Chair", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Member", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mechanistic modeling", "DFFB", "heat transfer", "film boiling", "dispersed flow", "post-CHF", "COBRA-TF"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Performance Characteristics of Charged Ultrafiltration Membranes: Fundamental Studies and Applications", "id": "7125", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "424", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\nUltrafiltration is used extensively in the biotechnology and food industries for protein concentration and buffer exchange.  Although several recent studies have demonstrated the importance of electrostatic interactions in ultrafiltration, there is little data available on the role of the nature and the number of charge groups on the overall membrane performance characteristics.  The overall objective of this thesis was to develop a more quantitative understanding of the effects of the membrane surface charge density, the nature of the functional charge groups, and the spacer arm length on protein transport and fluid flow during ultrafiltration. \nElectrically-charged ultrafiltration membranes were generated by chemical modification of commercially-available composite regenerated cellulose membranes using a variety of chemistries.  A new framework was developed to analyze the performance characteristics of the different ultrafiltration membranes, analogous to the \u201cRobeson Plot\u201d used to analyze the performance of gas separation membranes.  This framework captures the inherent trade-off between hydraulic permeability and membrane selectivity, providing a quantitative method for evaluating the performance of ultrafiltration membranes. \nThe effects of membrane surface charge density on protein transport, hydraulic permeability, and separation of binary protein mixtures was studied using a series of surface-modified cellulose membranes, with the charge density controlled by varying the extent of addition of a quaternary amine functionality.  The transmission of positively charged cytochrome c decreased by a factor of 100 as the membrane zeta potential was increased from 0.3 to 6.6 mV due to the strong electrostatic exclusion of the like-charged protein.  The protein sieving data were in good agreement with a partitioning model accounting for electrostatic effects, while the hydraulic permeability data were consistent with a flow model accounting for the effects of counter-electroosmosis.  \nThese electrically-charged membranes also provided very high resolution for the separation of myoglobin and lysozyme.  High selectivity could be achieved with moderately charged membranes by using very low ionic strength solutions, while the more heavily charged membranes provided high selectivity up to salt concentrations of 40 mM.  These results clearly demonstrate the potential of using membrane charge to design effective protein purification processes.  Limited data obtained with a commercially relevant feedstock showed that these charged membranes could be used to significantly reduce the concentration of host cell proteins in the purification of a monoclonal antibody product.    \n\tA variety of novel ultrafiltration membranes were synthesized with multiple charge groups along the spacer arm.  These membranes provide very high performance characteristics.  In addition, the results provide important insights into the affects of the spacer arm length and the nature of the functional group on protein transmission and fluid flow.  These results not only demonstrate the capabilities of electrically-charged ultrafiltration membranes for bioprocessing applications, they also suggest a variety of strategies for the development of new classes of charged membranes with greatly enhanced performance. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [418], "author_name_tesi": "Mehta, Amit ", "last_name_ssi": "Mehta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney", "Wayne Roger Curtis", "Darrell Velegol", "Andrew Ewing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Wayne Roger Curtis, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Andrew Ewing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Biotechnology", "Bioseparation", "Ultrafiltration", "Protein Purification", "Charged Membrane", "Permeability", "Selectivity", "Bioprocessing"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "APPLYING SYSTEMS THINKING TO DEVELOP A DESIGN SPACE AND BUSINESS STRATEGY EXPLORATION TOOL FOR TECHNOLOGY-BASED VENTURES IN DEVELOPING COMMUNITIES\n", "id": "12621", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1300", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the last five years there has been a significant rise in the number of academic and extra-curricular programs that focus on developing technology-based long-term or infrastructure projects in economically underserved communities around the world. These ventures often fail because of disconnects between the designer, the implementer, and the end-user. There is a growing trend towards curricular and extra-curricular programs and student clubs that focus on appropriate technology-based projects to address the needs of marginalized communities. It is of crucial importance to the success of the venture to identify the optimum distribution of various kinds of equity that may be shared by the communities and partnering organizations. This thesis describes the Equilibrium Spot (E-Spot) Model, a method for identifying the appropriate stakeholders within a venture and defining their roles and responsibilities towards the venture. This model is the basis for the E-Spot Canvas, a design space and business strategy exploration tool. The canvas facilitates collective thinking amongst stakeholders to match project resource requirements with time, money, sweat, and other equities that can be expended by them to sustain their project socially, economically, and environmentally. \n\tThe E-Spot Canvas serves three roles: 1) an educational tool for studying and practicing systems thinking; 2) an entrepreneurial tool for developing equitable business and implementation strategies; and 3) an ethical reflection tool for understanding motivations and incentives of various stakeholders and making decisions that optimize short-term and long-term benefit and minimize the risk for everyone involved. This thesis concerns the development and validation of the E-Spot Model and Canvas. The E-Spot Canvas is based on the systems-thinking tenets of interdependence, holism, multifinality, equifinality, differentiation, regulation, abstraction, and leverage points. I have delved into systems theory to compile and synthesize definitions of these tenets and have explained the linkages from a conceptual and practical perspective. I have piloted the E-Spot Canvas with about 80 students in various Humanitarian Engineering and Social Entrepreneurship (HESE) classes to obtain feedback and to refine it. Observations from fieldwork on HESE ventures in Kenya, Tanzania, and India have also been integrated into my entire endeavor. Three case studies have been presented in this thesis: a biogas digester, Kochia windmill project and Husk Power Systems (HPS).

The importance of novel computational optical imaging schemes which aim to overcome the limitations of conventional imaging techniques by leveraging the availability of computational resources and the vast body of literature in computational signal processing is emphasized. In particular the computational techniques of compressive sensing and two dimensional phase retrieval are introduced in the broad context as inversion techniques suitable for optical applications including coherent anti-Stokes Raman holography, non-linear spectroscopy, and ultrashort pulse characterization. It is shown that both computational techniques seek to improve key signal metrics such as higher signal to noise ratio (SNR) and better resolution than can be obtained traditionally within the specific imaging modality.\nCoherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) holography is a novel imaging modality which combines the principles of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering and holography to provide label-free, chemical selective, scanning-free, and single shot 3D imaging modality. Compressive CARS holography is introduced as a sparsity constrained holographic image reconstruction technique to enhance the optical sectioning capability of CARS holography by suppressing out-of-focus background noise inherent in 3D images processed from a typical single 2D hologram. The advantages of compressive sensing guided signal acquisition strategy in optical spectroscopy is presented by proposing \u2018compressive multi-heterodyne optical spectroscopy\u2019 as a novel technique for ultra-high resolution frequency comb spectroscopy. Using numerical simulations, our proposed compressive frequency comb spectroscopy technique is shown to be well-suited for recording narrow line spectra at ultra-high sampling over broad spectral range by leveraging sparsity inherent in such spectra.\nWe next present applications of phase retrieval in optical imaging and spectroscopy. In particular we use 2D phase retrieval technique to enhance the resolution of sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy (SFG-VS) whose unique surface selectivity enables qualitative and quantitative study of chemical species at surfaces/interfaces. Specifically, our key contribution is that we show that our 2D phase retrieval based inversion algorithm enables measurement of characteristic molecular vibrational spectra of air/dimethyl sulfoxide interface at resolutions significantly better than that achievable in conventional SFG-VS acquisition system. Lastly, we address the limitation of the commonly used pulse characterization technique: frequency resolved optical gating (FROG) to spatio-temporally characterize the ultrafast pulse. Using a simple spectral holographic recording technique, we present a modified 2D phase retrieval based algorithm to measure the spectral phase at every spatial location in the vicinity of focus of an objective and thereby track the spatio-temporal evolution of the pulse along its optical axis.

Principal among these have been been a lack of good models for predicting soot formation and effective means to capture turbulence--chemistry interactions in soot subprocesses.   Uncertainties in measurement and prediction of soot properties has also been a problem.  Radiative heat transfer becomes important in combustion environments due to the very high temperatures encountered and has not yet been studied in sufficient detail in the case of luminous (i.e., sooting) flames.  A comprehensive approach for modeling turbulent reacting flows, including detailed chemistry, radiation and soot models with detailed closures for turbulence--chemistry interactions (TCI) and turbulence--radiation interactions (TRI) is developed in this work.   A review of up-to-date literature on turbulent combustion modeling, turbulence-radiation interactions and soot modeling is given.  A transported probability density function (PDF) approach is used to model turbulence--chemistry interactions and extended to include soot formation. Nongray gas and soot radiation is modeled using a photon Monte Carlo (PMC) method coupled with the PDF method.   Soot formation is modeled based on the method of moments (MOM) approach with interpolative closure.  \n\n\nOptimal soot submodel parameters are identified based on comparison of model predictions with experimental data from various laminar premixed and (opposed) diffusion flames.  These parameters (including gas-phase chemistry) are applied to turbulent flames without further ``tuning.'  Six turbulent jet flames with Reynolds numbers varying from 6700 to 15000,  varying fuel types -- pure ethylene, 90% methane-10% ethylene blend and different oxygen concentrations in the oxidizer stream from 21% O2 (air) to 55% O2, are simulated.  The predicted soot volume fractions, temperature and radiative wall fluxes (when available) are compared with experiments.  All the simulations are carried out with a single set of parameters for all models involved, without specific adjustments.  Very encouraging agreement is found for most of the quantities, representing a significant step forward in modeling turbulent sooting flames.  A detailed analysis of the radiation characteristics of these flames is also undertaken.  It is found that emission TRI was generally important for all the flames.  In the laboratory scale flames, including TRI increases the radiative loss from the flame by up to 90%.    Absorption TRI is found to be unimportant in laboratory-scale flames, but becomes important in the large (industrial scale) flame that was studied numerically.  \n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5319], "author_name_tesi": "Mehta, Ranjan S.", "last_name_ssi": "Mehta", "middle_name_ssi": "S.", "first_name_ssi": "Ranjan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael F Modest", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Stephen R Turns", "Padma Raghavan", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael F Modest, Committee Chair", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Chair", "Stephen R Turns, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Combustion", "Turbulent Flames", "Radiation", "Soot Formation", "PDF Methods", "Turbulence-Radiation Interactions", "Turbulence-Chemistry Interactions", "Method of Moments"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Design, Analysis, and Applications of Cellular Contact-Aided Compliant Mechanisms", "id": "10905", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6446", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A new class of compliant mechanisms utilizing the benefits of cellular geometry and\ncontact are addressed in this work.

Experiments are conducted to validate\nthe models, and good agreement is found. Size optimization is carried out to\nmaximize the stress relief and the overall strain.\n\nTwo main applications are considered in the present work. One application consists\nof a morphing aircraft skin for adaptive structures. Different material models\nsuch as linearly elastic and multi-linear elastic are examined. For linearly elastic\nmaterials, contact-induced stress-relief is advantageous and for nonlinear elastic\nmaterials, reduction of transverse deflection due to contact is useful.

One general approach through the entire dissertation is to theoretically analyze these novel piezoelectric composite systems, optimize composite structure design and develop fabrication/measurement strategies for real biomedical/industry applications.\n\nTwo types of piezoelectric composite systems will be discussed in this dissertation: (i) magnetoelectric (ME) sensors and ME sensor based 1st order gradiometer system for biomagnetic liver susceptometry (BLS); and (ii) ceramic/polymer piezocomposite acoustic transducer system for logging while dilling (LWD).\n\nThe ultra high sensitivity of piezoelectric sensors makes them good candidates for medical ultrasonic image and diagnostics. However, lacking of efficiently coupling between the magnetic and electric signals prevent them from being used for biomagnetic detection. ME sensors open up the opportunities for non-invasive room temperature magnetic diagnostic imaging. In this dissertation, we will first study sensor configurations to meet the requirements of biomedical applications, such as possible detection of neutron signal brain image and tissue iron detection.\n\nVery sensitive magnetometers are highly desired for neutron signal brain image. Besides longitudinal or transverse type ME composites, shear mode resonance operation could provide magnetic sensors with ultra high sensitivity.  Equivalent circuit analysis of shear piezomagnetic/shear piezoelectric (S-S) mode resonance sensor is carried out in this dissertation. The modeling results reveal the potential of such a S-S high Q-factor ME sensor to achieve an exceptional high ME coefficient and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), e.g., the sensors at resonance of RF frequency (> MHz) exhibits a ME coefficient of 175,000 V/ cm\u30fbOe and SNR of 4.4\u00d71011 \u221aHz/Oe.\n\nFor iron detection in tissue, strong DC bias magnetic field (0.5 T or higher) exists while the AC biomagnetic signal is very weak ( 10nT or lower). Hence ultra sensitive ME sensor with high dynamic range is required. An ME sensor based 1st order gradiometer structure with an equivalent magnetic noise of 0.45 nT/Hz1/2 at 1 Hz is then presented. In addition to this, a prototype ME gradiometer based magnetoelectric liver susceptometry was built and tested with liver phantoms. The preliminary measurement shows a linear response in the iron concentrations from normal iron dose(0.05mg/g-liver) to 5mg/g-liver -iron over load (100\u00d7overdose). The demonstration of ME gradiometer based magnetometer opens the possibility for compact size, portable, economical room temperature systems for quantitative tissue iron determination.\n\nBesides ME sensors and ME sensor based biomagnetic diagnostic systems, piezoelectric composite systems are also studied for industrial acoustic logging, such as LWD, in this dissertation. The working conditions for the LWD piezoelectric composite transducers are rather harsh: (i) High working pressure; (ii) High working temperature; (iii) Strong vibrations between 2 Hz and 1 kHz from drilling practice; (iv) Corrosive gas and drilling fluids. In this case, a well packaged transducer system is required and there are two research objectives in developing piezoelectric composite transducer system. The first research objective is to optimize piezoelectric receiver design with finite element analysis (FEA). Improving fabrication techniques and establishing characterization protocols suitable for LWD applications are also part of the research objectives.\n\nA composite configuration to increase the sensitivity is proposed and then electric serial/parallel connections to further improve the signal to noise ratio (SNR) and impedance matching to the receiving electronics is discussed. In addition to the design optimization, fabrication process of receiver transducer under extreme conditions is also very challenging compared with the conventional piezoelectric transducer fabrication methods. Fabrication details on high strength vacuum epoxy bonding is given after piezocomposite receiver design strategies and optimization. Finally an anticorrosion high pressure thermal cycle characterization protocol simulating the real working conditions is provided. The design optimization and fabrication process provide some guidelines for the novel piezoelectric composite logging system design.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11250], "author_name_tesi": "Mei, Lei ", "last_name_ssi": "Mei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Qing X Yang", "Zhiwen Liu", "Mehdi Kiani", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Qing X Yang, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Mehdi Kiani, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["piezoelectric", "magnetostrictive", "magnetic sensor", "transducer", "iron detection", "logging while drilling"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "First-principles Thermodynamics of Phase Transition: from Metal to Oxide ", "id": "12662", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7007", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many interesting phenomena in physics, geosciences, and materials science are directly related to phase transitions, such as ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, and multiferroicity, which can be induced by factors such as temperature, pressure, and strain. Various aspects of phase transitions have been studied such as thermodynamics, kinetics, and crystallography. The present dissertation focuses on thermodynamics which dictates not only equilibrium states of materials, but also the driving force for phase transitions. With the advancement of density functional theory and computing technology, quantum mechanical first-principles calculations have become a powerful tool for materials design. In this work, density functional theory based first-principles calculations coupled with ab initio molecular dynamics and CALPHAD (CALculation of PHase Diagram) methods are applied to study thermodynamics of phase transitions and aid materials design in three systems from elemental metal to complex oxides: Ti, TiO2, and BiFeO3.\n\nTi and Ti-based alloys are widely used in numerous applications due to its exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, high temperature performance, and corrosion resistance. The mechanical properties of Ti alloys can be greatly improved by controlling the crystal structures present. Pressure is a very important variable in causing phase transitions in this element, and some of the pressure-induced phases can be retained in a metastable form after removal of pressure. In this work, the pressure-induced phase transitions and equilibrium pressure-temperature phase diagrams of Ti are studied using first-principles calculations. The phase stabilities of \u03b3- and \u03b4-Ti phases under hydrostatic compression are clarified from a systematic study of pressures using various equation-of-state fittings and direct first-principles calculations. Due to the dynamical instability of \u03b2-Ti at low-temperature, ab intio molecular dynamics simulations together with thermodynamic integration are used to explore the hcp/bcc free energy difference and the phase transition along Burgers paths. The thermal electronic entropy is found to play a critical role in the stabilization of bcc Ti at high-temperature.\n\nTiO2 possesses a rich phase diagram with many polymorphs. The recently discovered high-pressure cotunnite and cubic phases of TiO2 show great promises for ultra-hard materials and future-generation solar cells, due to their large bulk modulus and excellent optical properties, respectively. Their phase stabilities at ambient conditions are, however, not clear. In this work, a complete study of the phase stabilities of all TiO2 polymorphs is provided. The calculated phonons show that all high-pressure phases, except the cubic phase, are dynamically stable at ambient pressure, indicating cotunnite phase might be quenched to ambient conditions. Meanwhile, it is predicted that fluorite TiO2 is dynamically stable at high pressures and can be assigned as the synthesized cubic phase. The equilibrium pressure-temperature phase diagram of TiO2 is determined from the calculated Gibbs energies, which provides useful information to the synthesis of the high-pressure phases of TiO2.\n\nMultiferroic material BiFeO3 is a promising material for lead-free piezoelectric applications. High quality multiferroic BiFeO3 films are, however, difficult to obtain due to its small processing window. With coupled first-principles calculations and CALPHAD method, the growth conditions for BiFeO3 thin films are explored by thermodynamic calculations. The formation enthalpy of BiFeO3 predicted by first-principles calculations is used to study the phase equilibrium and chemical potential-temperature phase diagram. The chemical potential of Bi is predicted to be useful in tuning the stability window and tailoring the processing conditions of BiFeO3. Furthermore, the effect of epitaxial strain on the structure and properties of BiFeO3 is studied by first-principles calculations to understand strain-induced morphotropic phase boundary in BiFeO3. A first-order rhombohedral-like to tetragonal-like phase transition is predicted at a critical compressive strain of 5.15%, and this isosymmetric phase transition enables the coexistence of these two phases and the morphotropic phase boundary behavior reported in the strained BiFeO3 films.\n\nThis work provides an in-depth study of the mechanisms of the pressure-, temperature- and strain-induced phase transitions in three selected materials. An improved understanding of the thermodynamics of phase transitions and the conditions of phase stability would help to further optimize the properties and improve the performances of these materials.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7004], "author_name_tesi": "Mei, Zhigang ", "last_name_ssi": "Mei", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhigang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu", "Long Qing Chen", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Clive A Randall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["First-principles", "thermodynamics", "phase transitions", "Ti", "TiO2", "BiFeO3"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "TEACHERS' BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES TOWARD APPROACHES TO CHARACTER EDUCATION", "id": "8639", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1014", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nCharacter education has always had a role in public education. Currently, many states\u2019 Departments of Education hold standards that reflect principles that relate to character or values. Here, a review of the approaches was provided as insight into the ways teachers are being asked to instruct students about character in the classroom, with the rationale for this character education being fashioned by politicians, philosophers, and researchers. Classroom pedagogical approaches address curricula and activities that either focus on teaching character or integrate character into other academic subject approaches. The cultural/school approach implies an environmental approach to character education that utilizes teachable moments, classroom and school rules, and discipline.  \nThe purpose of this study was to examine teachers\u2019 beliefs and attitudes toward approaches to character education, and establish components that teachers identified as necessary for effective character development and character education programs. A Grounded Theory tradition guided this research, using interviews with 30 teachers. Data analysis included: questioning, comparisons, meanings of words, looking at language (in vivo), time, and using metaphors and similes. \nThe participants\u2019 responses were developed into seven themes related to character and character education: terminology, as the law, roles, unification, simplification of implementation, authenticity and teachable moments, and subcultures. Terminology affected all other themes depending on participants\u2019 views about character and those responsible for teaching it. The themes as the law and roles investigated how character education is imposed at times on schools and how teachers view their roles, parents\u2019 roles, and a collective role of those who interact with students. Unification, simplification, and authenticity explore how character education is infused into schools and curricula. Subcultures respond differently to the infusion of the various approaches to character education.\nTeachers expressed a spectrum of beliefs and attitudes about character education. With regard to implementation, curricula should be relevant and practical. Most teachers found scripted and \u201ccanned programs\u201d character education curricula to be useful when used as resources at the elementary school level and irrelevant at the high school level. More importantly, teachers need to authentically incorporate the development of character into the school day and give time to this issue.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1004], "author_name_tesi": "Meidl, Christopher Joel", "last_name_ssi": "Meidl", "middle_name_ssi": "Joel", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Daniel Yawkey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Daniel Yawkey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["character education"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Teachers' Dissonance With Curriculum Planning for Linguistically and Culturally Diverse Students", "id": "9819", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6349", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Historically, efforts to address the educational needs of linguistically and culturally diverse students (LCD) children have been inadequate. Currently, NCLB along with high-stakes testing, standards and objectives based education LCD students are performing below their peers (Weil, 1998). Classroom teachers, caught in the middle, are charged with the responsibility to raise test scores, plan curriculum, motivate students, and provide a welcoming learning environment for all students. Here, teachers\u2019 beliefs about meeting the needs of LCD students amidst NCLB were explored, in relation to curriculum planning. \n\tA review of constructivist theory, curriculum theory, and culturally relevant pedagogy was provided as insight into to how teachers\u2019 beliefs are constructed, the role of curriculum, and approaches towards meeting academic needs of LCD students. A Case Study approach guided this research, using interviews, observations, and document analysis. Data analysis included coding and categorizing the data, while looking for major themes to emerge. Participant responses along with observational field notes and documents were developed into three major themes and several subthemes.\n\t The major themes that emerged from the study were: dissonance, individualized pedagogy and redefined expectations for teaching and learning. Data from participant statements and researcher observations, illuminate the dissonance between teachers\u2019 beliefs about district mandated pacing schedule, deficiencies in students\u2019 prior knowledge, and pedagogical beliefs. Dissonance was defined as the discord between meeting student academic needs while adhering to the mandated curriculum and pacing guide.  From this case study, dissonance led to a redefined philosophy of teaching and learning as a means to reconcile the discord or to find equilibrium. According to the data, teachers unknowingly sought out ways to resolve dissonance through a process of individualizing pedagogy. The individualized pedagogical approaches were identified as curriculum adaptation and/or curriculum integration. Due to the factors creating dissonance, teachers attempted to meet student academic needs by redefining their expectations for teaching and learning as a result of personal experiences, individual constructs teaching and learning, and the district mandated pacing schedule. The notion of redefined expectations for teaching and learning are directly linked to the influence of the pacing schedule, state and local assessments, perceptions of student social and academic needs, and their own beliefs about teaching and learning.\n\tTeachers expressed a spectrum of beliefs about their role, the classroom, and meeting the needs of linguistically and culturally diverse students. The participants found the pacing guide useful but left little room for creativity and did not acknowledge the needs of their students. Often times the curriculum was not relevant and practical due to the backgrounds of the students. As a result, teachers implemented what they found to be for their students by adjusting the curriculum. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6349], "author_name_tesi": "Meidl, Tynisha  Denea", "last_name_ssi": "Meidl", "middle_name_ssi": "Denea", "first_name_ssi": "Tynisha ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ladislaus M Semali", "Ladislaus M Semali", "Jamie Myers", "Esther Susana Prins", "Patrick Willard Shannon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ladislaus M Semali, Dissertation Advisor", "Ladislaus M Semali, Committee Chair", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Esther Susana Prins, Committee Member", "Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["linguistically and culturally diverse students", "curriculum", "dissonance"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "\"Shifts in Thinking\" in Arts Teachers' Narratives: Documentation as Inquiry and Artifact", "id": "16253", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8051", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this narrative inquiry, I analyzed art and music teachers\u2019 stories of professional learning as they engaged in the study of their teaching practice in a collaborative inquiry group (CIG). During two years of data collection, I examined stories that arts teachers told when describing classroom photographs, images of student work, video recordings of teaching, written reflections, course descriptions, lesson plans, and other forms of documentation that they generated for the purpose of conveying their experiences to members of our CIG. My narrative analysis was focused on teachers\u2019 indications of shifts in thinking about teaching and learning.\nParticipants were 10 art and music teachers who met in a collaborative inquiry group that was organized by a continuing education program and funded by a federal grant. I was both the facilitator of the CIG and narrative researcher. Our group met monthly from 2009\u20132011 to form a network of support, share experiences, learn to use new digital technology, inquire about teaching and learning as specific to art and music education, and to design and customize professional learning for continuing education course credit. Participants elected to focus their collaborative inquiry on investigations related to student-led learning, choice-based student learning, and inquiry as a framework for learning in the arts. \nChapters 4 through 7 are groupings of narrative data and analytic discussion that explore teachers\u2019 narratives as indications of shifting, moving, and becoming in spaces of inquiry as professional learning. My interpretive discussion as narrative inquiry is represented in various narrative, literary, and visual forms throughout this dissertation. These arts-based forms include descriptive prose, found poetry, researcher memos, images, interim texts, and dramatic scenes/play scripts. \nThe multiplicity of people, objects, time, and spaces of interaction are represented by narrative fragments interwoven to create complex narrative intertextures that retain the nuances of each teacher\u2019s individual experiences but share a common narrative thread, topic, or theme. I developed a methodological and theoretical toolset for crafting multivocal narrative intertextures after studying and adapting the methods of several qualitative inquirers who have constructed intricate narrative research texts as constellations, juxtapositions, and assemblages of narratives that explore polyphonic perspectives (Conle, 1996; Craig, 2007; Glesne, 1997; Hasebe-Ludt, Leggo, & Chambers 2009; Heydon, 2010; Prendergast, 2006; Reilly, 2011).\nThree theoretical perspectives informed my data analysis and interpretation: actor-network theory (Fenwick & Edwards, 2010, 2012), smooth and striated space (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987), and knowledge in the making (Ellsworth, 2005). I used these theories as conceptual tools to build on what Clandinin and Connelly (2000) referred to as the three-dimensional narrative inquiry space (described in Chapter 2). These three theories aided my analysis and interpretations of the interactions among (a) participants, ideas, narratives, digital objects, and material artifacts, (b) physical and virtual places and the processes where teaching and learning take place, and (c) ambiguous spaces of sensation, thinking, and reflection that can be conveyed through sharing of artifacts and other visual and textual chronicles of experience. The nuanced meanings of the conceptual vocabulary drawn from each theory specifically supported my analysis of participants\u2019 shifts. These shifts were not limited to shifts in thinking but also included shifts in practice, shifts in the arrangement of classroom spaces, and the notion of shifting as part of an ongoing process of professional learning as inquiry in the context of a CIG.\nThis research describes how shifts in thinking and practice can be seen and understood by teachers in a CIG through visual and written documentation with accompanying storied reflections that chronicle experiences in relation to specific teaching contexts. Pre-service and in-service arts teachers are likely to locate implications within these narratives for tailoring professional learning in community by documenting experiences and sharing reflections as specific to unique teaching contexts. \nIn the final chapter, I synthesize three key implications in relation to theoretical discussion: (a) documentation as inquiry and artifact when objects are linked to stories, (b) teachers reflect on shifts in pedagogy in relation to a digital object, and (c) self-directed/group-supported inquiry in flexible spaces of interaction supports shifts in thinking.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7996], "author_name_tesi": "Meier, Mary Elizabeth ", "last_name_ssi": "Meier", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mary Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Treat Keifer Boyd", "Karen Treat Keifer Boyd", "Wanda B Knight", "Kimberly Anne Powell", "Stephanie Cayot Serriere"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Treat Keifer Boyd, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Treat Keifer Boyd, Committee Chair", "Wanda B Knight, Committee Member", "Kimberly Anne Powell, Committee Member", "Stephanie Cayot Serriere, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["narrative inquiry", "art education", "professional learning", "teachers", "collaborative inquiry group", "arts", "digital technology"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "DIFFERENTIAL STACKELBERG GAMES AND THEIR APPLICATION TO DYNAMIC PRICING, PRODUCTION PLANNING NETWORK DESIGN, AND LOGISTICS", "id": "18978", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8499", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recently, Stackelberg games have been employed by many economists who use game\ntheory concepts to solve dynamic competitive service sector problems such as dynamic\npricing, production planning, logistics, supply chain management, and transportation\nnetwork \u0087ow prediction and control.

The following case-study at a commercial swine finishing operation near Danville, Pennsylvania, USA was conducted to evaluate the operational and economic feasibility of a novel manure management system in conjunction with an anaerobic digester.  Investment capital for the system was provided in part by the producer and by public and private grants. The system utilized under-floor manure storage pits to collect manure for delivery to a digester, and then stored post-digested manure (digestate) in under-floor storage within the same swine houses. Positioning of manure collection pits under swine dunging areas in two large-pen 2200-head buildings allowed for the collection of 75% of total manure volume, which was moved to the digester. Digester-produced biogas content was approximately 28% carbon dioxide and 72% methane. No additional post-digestion manure storage construction was necessary at the farm. The cost-savings of electricity produced from combustion of biogas (monthly value of US $477.10) was nearly equal to the producer\u2019s debt service for capital investment required for the construction of the manure handling and digester system (monthly payment of US $478.54). Debt service did not include grant funds. Monitoring of air quality indicators both before and after the introduction of digestate to under-floor manure storage pits in swine housing resulted in no observations of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or methane (CH4) concentrations above critical safety levels. No recorded concentrations of oxygen (O2) were below critical entry guideline levels. Hourly mean ammonia (NH3) concentrations at pig level (0.15 m above the floor) before digestate was present in the buildings were higher (P<0.05) compared to when digestate was present (24 \u00b1 2.8 ppm vs. 17 \u00b1 1.0 ppm). During steady-state digester operation the minimum ventilation system for the swine buildings was changed from manure pit ventilation to an end-wall fan on a timer. Hourly mean NH3 concentrations at pig level were higher (P<0.05) after fan removal (37 \u00b1 0.9) than when pit fans were present (17 \u00b1 1.0 ppm). Swine group average daily gain, feed-to-gain ratio and culls and mortalities information from the case farm were compared to that of two other farms.  Average daily gain of pigs on the case farm was lower (P < 0.05) than that of another farm receiving feeder pigs from the same sow units.  Feed efficiency and a combination of culls and mortalities were statistically similar among three farms receiving pigs from the same sow units. We conclude that the novel manure collection system used on this farm can eliminate the need of a post-digester storage facility and reduce the cost for electricity for a commercial swine enterprise. Electric cost-savings made the combined digestion and manure collection system at this location were more affordable than that of a conventional digestion system. External funding and low interest financing were necessary in order for finance payments to be offset by electric cost-savings.  Air quality measures did not indicate that the introduction of digestate into under-floor manure pits caused degradations of air quality at pig level. Because of the variations in management no clear effects could be determined from this manure treatment system on the growth performance of pigs in these buildings.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5176], "author_name_tesi": "Meinen, Robert James", "last_name_ssi": "Meinen", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Kephart"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Kephart, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["methane", "Anaerobic digestion", "manure", "swine", "biogas"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Beta To Alpha Transformations In Nickel Aluminum Bronzes At Low Undercoolings", "id": "17503", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8422", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The results presented in this dissertation represent the most detailed account of the bcc\u21c4fcc (\u03b2\u2192\u03b1) transformation in a system that is non-ferrous.

The method developed used a laser in a novel way for providing fiduciary markers, and the use of freely accessible software permitted a straightforward method of generating the 3-D reconstruction.\n\nIn terms of the intragranular bcc\u2192fcc transformation, the results cover the spectrum of nucleation, growth, and coarsening and we have proposed a single mechanism that, at the very least, is operative in all three stages; that mechanism is sympathetic nucleation. For example, it has been found that following the initial inclusion nucleation event, the entire transformation proceeds via sympathetic nucleation of two particular types, facet-to-facet and end-to-end. Somewhat surprisingly, we are the first to recognize the equivalence of facet-to-facet sympathetic nucleation and the homogeneous nucleation of growth ledges. We may thus model both nucleation and growth in terms of a single mechanism. What is even more intriguing, we may exploit facet-to-facet and end-to-end sympathetic nucleation to propose a mechanism of precipitate coarsening, the replacement of fine distributions of small precipitates by a much coarser distribution of large precipitates. This coarsening reaction occurs as the sympathetically nucleated rod-like particles start to tile space, creating large (20-50\u00b5m wide) rod-like colonies from the initial (\u22431\u00b5m wide) inclusion nucleated rods.\nOur research on sympathetic nucleation in this system has an impact outside the narrow confines of the nickel-aluminum bronze that we used as a model material. For the first time, sympathetic nucleation has been unambiguously identified. Even though Aaronson and Wells first proposed the existence of sympathetic nucleation over 50 years ago, the evidence presented in its favor was always suspect, there was always at least one counter-claim that could explain the observed experimental images; in terms of impingement, polygonization, and the proximity of grain boundaries. We have shown, unequivocally, that impingement cannot produce the microstructures that we developed. Likewise, polygonization is not a problem, and the large beta grain size that we employed in the early stages of the reaction obviates any worries with regard to the interference of grain boundaries. Our crystallographic data from the orientation imaging microscope (OIM) are fully consistent with our model, which predicts that large rod-based colonies, which comprise several hundred sympathetically nucleated entities is, to all intents and purposes, a single crystal.\n\nWe have documented two fundamentally distinct grain boundary morphology types, the allotriomorph and the secondary Widmanst\u00e4tten side-rod. The only distinguishing feature of the grain boundary allotriomorph is the fact that its growth rate within the boundary is much greater than its growth normal to the boundary and an approximately lenticular shape is not uncommon. Secondary Widmanst\u00e4tten side-rods develop with the same growth direction as the intragranular Widmanst\u00e4tten rods, i.e. \u3008111\u3009_\u03b2. Thus far, we have been unable to distinguish fully between the two predominant models for the formation of Widmanst\u00e4tten side-arms; that due to Townsend and Kirkaldy which is based on interfacial fluctuations that eventually develop into side-arms, and that due to Phelan and colleagues which is based, somewhat coincidentally on sympathetic nucleation. However, we do propose that the thickening of the grain boundary side-rods occurs by heterogeneous facet-to-facet sympathetic nucleation and that the lengthening of the grain boundary side-rods occurs by end-to-end sympathetic nucleation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8334], "author_name_tesi": "Meinert, Kenneth C", "last_name_ssi": "Meinert", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Raymond Howell", "Paul Raymond Howell", "Richard Martukanitz", "James Hansell Adair", "Zi Kiu Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Raymond Howell, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Raymond Howell, Committee Chair", "Richard Martukanitz, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Zi Kiu Liu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nickel Aluminum Bronze", "Sympathetic Nucleation", "BCC-FCC Transformation", "3-D Reconstruction", "Inclusion Nucleation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "VELOCITY DEPENDENCE OF FATIGUE CRACK GROWTH MECHANISMS \nIN NANOCRYSTALLINE PLATINUM\n", "id": "8494", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5101", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Thin films are present in virtually every corner of industry, from holding our banking information on a thin magnetic strip, to lining the insides of our soda bottles as invisible diffusion barriers, to acting as switches and actuators in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) barely visible to the naked eye. Material selection is of prime importance to the end-function of a thin film. Noble metals are a set of metals which have excellent resistance to oxidation, and their high electrical conductivity makes them ideal candidates for use in several MEMS applications. These applications often require the films to be mechanically loaded time and time again, and it is expected that they function reliably throughout their lifetime. The material\u2019s response to fatigue must therefore be evaluated in order to ensure that these thin films behave as expected. \n     Thin film mechanical testing specimens were fabricated as free-standing, 430nm platinum films having primarily (111) oriented columnar grains roughly 25-40 nm in diameter on a 20 nm titanium adhesion layer. These specimens had dog-bone geometry and a notch at the center of the gauge length, allowing for the localization of plastic deformation. The films were established to be fully dense (i.e. no voids or cracks) and no interphase regions between the grains were found. Further analysis confirmed purity of the platinum structural film within the detectability limits of the techniques. A tensile test conducted on one specimen established an upper bound for the ultimate tensile strength of 3.4 GPa, consistent with yield strength values found by nanoindentation and tensile testing studies conducted by others. Four constant stress amplitude (load ratio &#963;min/&#963;max= R = 0.1, sinusoidal waveforms at 1 Hz) fatigue tests were also conducted. An extremely limited range of stable fatigue crack growth was observed (< 3 MPa &#8730;m) as well as an order of magnitude reduction in Kmax (4.88 MPa &#8730;m) when compared to microcrystalline platinum. The power law exponent , m, associated with the crack growth rates was ~10.5, significantly larger than the microcrystalline platinum at ~3. This study also shows that crack closure does not affect crack advance, and that at low crack growth rates, fatigue damage localizes at grain boundaries, creating intergranular failure surfaces, but transitions to a transgranular crack path at higher velocities. The limited span of stable fatigue crack growth of the nanocrystalline platinum, in addition to the large m value suggests that the crack growth rate behavior of the nanocrystalline film is more similar to a ceramic or ordered intermetallic than that of a pure bulk metal. This research shows that the atomistic simulations and experimental observations of crack advance in nanograined metals may not be effectively generalized to other pure metal systems such as platinum.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5075], "author_name_tesi": "Meirom, Roi Arie", "last_name_ssi": "Meirom", "middle_name_ssi": "Arie", "first_name_ssi": "Roi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Muhlstein", "Dr Christopher Muhlstein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Muhlstein, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Christopher Muhlstein, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanomaterials", "Fatigue", "MEMS", "Platinum", "Thin Films"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Mechanical Behavior of Nanocrystalline Platinum Thin Films", "id": "11764", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13274", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ever since the realization that an increase in grain boundary volume contributes to the strengthening of metals, there has been a drive to reduce the grain size of polycrystalline metals. The creation of materials with finer and finer grain sizes has led to the development of new fabrication techniques, and metals with grain size in the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnano\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (~1\u00c3\u201410-9 m) regime are now commonplace. These days, nanocrystalline metals are used in a variety of nonstructural and structural applications. Insuring the durability and reliability of structural, nanograined, metallic films requires an in-depth understanding of their mechanical properties. This study focuses on establishing the mechanical properties of nanocrystalline platinum thin films, with a substantial emphasis on the cyclic fatigue behavior.\n     Thin film mechanical testing specimens were fabricated of nanocrystalline platinum in two film thicknesses. Various analysis techniques established these films to be composed of fully dense (111) oriented columnar grains roughly 15-35 nm in size of at least 99.99% pure platinum.. An annealing process allowed for the modification of the grain morphology such that the columnar grains were reduced to a more polycrystalline morphology; grains were still vertically elongated, but multiple 14-42 nm sized grains were present through the thickness of the annealed films. Creep testing of all free-standing specimens determined that the mechanical properties of the films are not significantly time dependent, in agreement with nanoindentation studies of identical films adhered to a silicon substrate. Tension testing indicated that the films are mechanically robust, with as-received, columnar films having yield and ultimate tensile strengths higher than 1 GPa and a large strain to failure of ~0.03. Annealed films maintained their strength but lost their ductility, displaying a strain to failure of ~0.01, consistent with their altered grain morphology. Scanning and transmission electron transmission based fractography revealed that failure was the result of ductile void-rupture processes and that the grain morphology of these specimens was stable in spite of the high stresses involved.\n      Fatigue tests were conducted on ~500 nm films with central notches and resulted in a high power law exponent of ~10.5, and a fracture toughness of about ~5 MPa &#8730;m. This behavior is more reminiscent of the fatigue behavior of brittle ceramic systems than that of ductile metallic such as the micrograined form of the platinum, which had a power law exponent of ~3.3, and approximately an order of magnitude greater fracture toughness. Fractography revealed that the fatigue crack path exhibited two different crack advance modes. At low crack growth rates, grain coarsening and intergranular crack advance dominated while at high crack growth rates, typical ductile transgranular in the absence of grain coarsening dominated, and at intermediate rates, both crack advance modes were witnessed. A large portion of the study was devoted to characterizing the reasons for and mechanisms behind these observations and dependencies on specimen thickness and grain morphology followed using ~1 &#956;m specimens, both columnar and polycrystalline. Further testing of films revealed that the fatigue crack growth rate behavior is largely dictated by specimen thickness, as ~1 &#956;m specimens displayed a much larger range of fatigue crack growth (~20 MPa &#8730;m) and a more typical power law exponent of 3.9-4.2. Although the fatigue behavior of the platinum films has a strong dependence on the thickness of the films, the fracture mode in the films did not show the same dependence with the ~1 &#956;m columnar specimens displaying a similar range of the crack growth modes. The polycrystalline samples, however, displayed a shift in the transition from the intergranular mode to the transgranular mode, and thus a link between the crack advance modes and the grain morphology was formed. Finite element modeling of an elastic anisotropic single crystal of platinum was utilized to quantify stresses in the vicinity of crack tips. Shear stress magnitudes along slip directions indicated that through-thickness slip is preferred over in-plane slip under certain conditions, and is dependent on both vicinity to crack tip and grain orientation.

The mechanisms by which genes are duplicated and the content of a genome is rearranged are of interest in both the biomedical and biological communities. Additionally, the evolutionary dynamics of these structural variations have become a topic of great interest in the post-genomic era. The research presented in this thesis examines the origin and evolution of duplicated genes and chromosomal rearrangements using the model organisms of the Drosophila genus. The effects of chromosomal inversions on meiosis were examined in D. pseudoobscura, and it was found that they do not affect the segregation of homologs. Recently duplicated genes were identified in the D. pseudoobscura genome. The mechanisms responsible for the duplications were determined, as was the amount of selective constraint on different classes of genes. Duplicated genes were also used to study the evolutionary dynamics of sex chromosomes. Positive selection appears to be more effective on X-linked, as opposed to autosomal, derived copies of duplicated genes. Additionally, duplicated genes tend to move off the X chromosomes of most Drosophila species. The forces responsible for this pattern depend on the species in question as well as the sex-bias of the gene that is duplicated. Finally, genes that are duplicated off of new X chromosomes are under less selective constraint than those duplicated off of other chromosome arms. These results indicate that the evolutionary dynamics of duplicated genes depend on a wide variety of factors, including: the mechanism by which a gene is duplicated, the chromosomal context into which it is duplicated, and the type of gene that is duplicated. No single predictor determines whether a duplicated gene is selectively preserved, however multiple properties of a duplicated gene influence its evolutionary trajectory.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5276], "author_name_tesi": "Meisel, Richard P", "last_name_ssi": "Meisel", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Claude W De Pamphilis", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Hiroshi Akashi", "Bruce A Mc Pheron", "Wojciech Makalowski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Claude W De Pamphilis, Committee Chair", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member", "Hiroshi Akashi, Committee Member", "Bruce A Mc Pheron, Committee Member", "Wojciech Makalowski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["population genetics", "genomics", "chromosomal rearrangement", "gene duplication", "Drosophila", "meiotic drive", "sex chromosomes"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Influence of Small Schools High School Redesign on Teachers' Collective Efficacy Beliefs\n\n\n", "id": "9393", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigated the effects of a widely advocated organizational reform for secondary schools, the small school model, on the collective efficacy beliefs of teachers.

A subsequent Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of N-Boc-pyrrole-2-boronic acid 67 with a chloroimidazopyridine 82 furnished tricycle 88. After some experimentation, the optimal conditions found for the dibromination of pyrrole 88 was to treat with Br2 in an acetic acid/methanol solvent mixture at 0 \u00baC to give ageladine A in 17% yield. \nWe have recently completed a more efficient biogenetically-inspired, second generation total synthesis of ageladine A. Key transformations in this second synthesis included an effective 6&#960;-2-azatriene electrocyclization of triene 128 to provide the desired imidazopyridine 129, which contained the imidazopyridine core of the marine metabolite.

Unfortunately, treatment of vinyl chloride 380 with sodium hypochlorite in acetic acid/acetone did not give the desired &#945;-chloroketone 381, but afforded 3-chloroindole product 383 via a retro-Mannich fragmentation process.\nIn a revised strategy, ethylenol ether diene 404 successfully underwent RCM to yield the desired cyclic enol ether 405, which was then converted to the corresponding &#945;-chloroketone 410 in high yield.

Once completed, the task of building an experimental setup that facilitated the measurement of each of these variables became important.  Many data sets, 288 specifically, were recorded using this controlled test setup.  Measurements were taken during all seasons of the year and during all types of weather and temperatures, mirroring real world conditions.\nField data was also obtained using existing cathodic protection systems located in facilities across Pennsylvania and Ohio.

Eighty percent of the experimental data was used to train the system while the remaining twenty percent was used to test the system.  After the final weights had been calculated by the network, the field data was tested in the network.  The output became the adjusted voltage which could be directly compared to the required \u2013850mV.\nThe back propagation neural network chosen for this project proved to be very useful.  The network outputs of the training and testing phases were all within 4% of the actual outputs measured using the experimental tank.

The success of multiple WRF deterministic forecasts during the BAMEX campaign suggested that deterministic numerical weather prediction of convective-scale processes had come to fruition. Large variability in evolution and mode of convection and the environment of ensemble members prove the contrary, highlighting the limit of practical predictability given realistic initial condition uncertainties provided by the EnKF analysis.\n\nEven though most members forecast severe convective weather over a broad area, some of the members produce bow echoes very similar to that observed while others perform poorly, either producing the wrong convective mode or wrong intensity. Given strong spatial and temporal variability in the environment, it is found that commonly used severe storm predictors based on single soundings (e.g., CAPE, CIN, low-level shear) have very limited capability in forecasting this bow echo event. Nevertheless, averaging of 10 good members versus 10 poor members provides a clear difference in storm evolution, with environments of good members having stronger CAPE and shear along with an upper-level shortwave and the development of a squall line, while poor members having weaker CAPE and shear, along with a weaker upper-level shortwave forming back-building MCSs.\n\nTwo distinct storm modes within the ensemble indicate a bifurcation point between two regimes that is associated with upscale error growth due to moist convection.

In essence, the ensemble forecast and additional sensitivity experiments demonstrated that: (1) this storms predictability has a practical limit given realistic initial condition spread and its predictability can be improved with more accurate initial conditions; (2) if the storms initial conditions are near bifurcation points, there may be an intrinsic limit.

The computational efficiency and real-time low error wind field retrieval of the new simplified coplane retrieval algorithm make this a competitive method for observation generation for TC prediction.

Anxiety usually has an effect on a person\u2019s well-being and unfortunately, it may be an adverse effect.  Anxiety can affect aspects of people\u2019s lives that are of the utmost importance to them including learning and performance in educational settings.  As a nursing instructor, I teach student nurses in a baccalaureate program of nursing that prepares students to become professional registered nurses.  I encounter student nurses who experience anxiety while learning in the clinical setting.\n     Hence, the primary purpose of this interpretive Heideggerian heuristic phenomenological study was to examine student nurses\u2019 perception of anxiety in the clinical setting.  More specifically, to investigate how student nurses make meaning of, interpret, and perceive their anxiety in the clinical setting.  It was also the intent of this research study to investigate how student nurses contextualize, and/or understand their anxiety in the clinical setting.  Situated cognition theory is the theoretical framework for this research study.  The participants are from two baccalaureate programs of nursing in northeastern Pennsylvania.\n     This research study helps nurse educators to understand the meaning of anxiety in student nurses in the clinical setting.  Research has shown that anxiety is a factor in student nurses leaving nursing education programs.  If nurse educators can better understand the anxiety of student nurses, they will be able to develop curricula and educational interventions to minimize the anxiety of student nurses and enhance learning in the clinical setting.  \n     The main method of data collection for this research study was in-depth, unstructured face-to-face interviews with 7 student nurse participants which were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim.  A secondary source of data collection from these same participants was the creation of an artform where the student nurses expressed their anxiety artistically.  This metaphor creation was accompanied by a focus group interview which also was tape recorded and transcribed verbatim.  Additional secondary sources of data collection were documents such as clinical worksheets, journals, pictures, and artforms.  The student nurses were asked if they have such documents to help them make meaning of their anxiety in the clinical setting.  Field notes were used as a supplement to data collection.  \n     The data were analyzed using a thematic analysis.  Seven themes emerged from the data and were reported in the rich descriptive words of the participants:  \n(a) Experiencing Inexperience, (b) Being Demeaned, (c) Being Exposed, (d) Unrealistic Expectations, (e) Being Abandoned, (f) Sensing Difference, and (g) Being Uncertain of Ability. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5704], "author_name_tesi": "Melincavage, Sharon Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Melincavage", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Sharon", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Daniele D Flannery", "Judith E Hupcey", "Samuel William Monismith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Chair", "Daniele D Flannery, Committee Member", "Judith E Hupcey, Committee Member", "Samuel William Monismith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["anxiety", "student nurses", "clinical setting", "nursing education", "phenomenology", "qualitative"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Photoelectron Spectroscopy Investigations on the Stability, Energetics, and Dynamics of Gas-phase p-block Clusters\n", "id": "12438", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2743", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Through the use of mass spectrometry and photoelectron spectroscopy, as well as theoretical calculations, the studies within this dissertation investigate the geometric and electronic structures of small clusters of p-block elements. There is a focus on identifying cluster stoichiometries that exhibit enhanced stability, as part of a synergistic collaboration to build assembled nanomaterials out of cluster building blocks. Further, the work in this dissertation reveals the guiding principles governing cluster behavior in the small size regime and various theoretical models are used to rationalize the enhanced stability of certain clusters.\nInvestigations of AlnX (n = 1-6, X = As, Sb) clusters establish that Al3As and Al3Sb are planar, all-metal, aromatic molecules, while Al5As and Al5Sb are spherical clusters that possess large energy gaps due to closed electronic shells. The stability of these molecules is subtly affected by the identity of the non-aluminum atom, and this leads to a tunability of cluster properties. These ideas are developed through additional studies on lead-indium clusters, in which it is shown that both aromatic and closed electronic shell species are present, but that lead often drives the geometries towards close-packed arrangements. Thus, by controlling the amount of lead within the cluster, one can control the geometry. Additionally, within the lead-indium system a thorough investigation of Pb2In2 and PbIn3- reveals new rules for all-metal aromaticity, showing that despite large electronegativity differences of the constituent atoms and different geometric arrangements, aromatic character can be preserved in heavy p-block clusters, in contrast to the lighter aluminum analogs. \nTo further explore the behavior of the heavy p-block clusters, experiment and theory are used to reveal remarkable similarities in the electronic structures of PbxSby- and BixSny- clusters. It is found that the energy and ordering of electrons within these clusters is not affected by the identity of the nuclear core. Thus, the properties of one cluster (or assembled material) may be mimicked through a substitution of different elements. \nFinally, this dissertation describes the invention of a new method for determining the angular momentum character of molecular orbitals. Photoelectron imaging experiments coupled with calculations reveal the degree of s-p hybridization in the valence electrons of small aluminum clusters. The Al3- cluster possesses a large degree of s-p hybridization, while Al4- is completely unhybridized. Further, the degree of hybridization continues to vary markedly for larger clusters. This work represents the first demonstration of an experimental technique that can directly probe the level of hybridization within molecular orbitals.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2738], "author_name_tesi": "Melko, Joshua Jennings", "last_name_ssi": "Melko", "middle_name_ssi": "Jennings", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Nicholas Winograd", "Ayusman Sen", "Robert John Santoro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Chair", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Assembled Nanomaterials", "Clusters", "Photoelectron Spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Peculiar Whiteness: White Racial Anxiety in Southern Literature", "id": "28108", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12313", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The past quarter century has born witness to a vast critical output in the field of whiteness studies, as multiple scholars in disparate fields have analyzed the ways in which whiteness operates as a systematic power structure that, for centuries, has created and upheld an uneven relationship between whites and non-whites, granting the former tangible benefits in political, socioeconomic, and moral power. That many scholars working on whiteness have located the importance of examining southern literature through the focused lens of critical race analysis should come as no surprise. From the decades before the Civil War, when the idea of a literature that was at least partially distinct from a larger sense of American literature arose, southern literature has had racial concerns staunchly at its front and center.\n\tWhat is perhaps less readily apparent is the number of similarities found in analytic works in the fields of whiteness studies and southern studies. Chief among these is the insistence and move toward a less homogeneous, totalizing view of the terms \u201cwhite(s),\u201d \u201cwhiteness,\u201d \u201cSouth(s)\u201d and \u201csouthern.\u201d Southern literature has long been a record of the experiences of both the region\u2019s white and black residents. While literary criticism has taken into account the ways in which authors have depicted the South\u2019s particular racial concerns, considering the framework provided by whiteness studies scholars opens broader avenues for critical exploration. Specifically, I investigate the ways in which both black and white authors from the post Reconstruction period through the Civil Rights era depicted white racial anxiety. White anxiety is a central tenet of the South\u2019s peculiar brand of racism. What makes southern white anxiety different from \u2018normal\u2019 or \u2018normative\u2019 white anxiety is this weight of being southern; in addition to nostalgia associated with the Lost Cause mentality, the southerner is faced with generations of being viewed as and viewing others as being somehow separate from America at large, a nation within a nation, to echo W. J. Cash. \t\t \n\tOver the course of my introduction and six chapters I interrogate a multitude of depictions of \u2018normative\u2019 whiteness: after a contextual introduction, my first chapter joins recent critical conversations on plantation literature, specifically elements of nostalgia in works by Joel Chandler Harris and Thomas Nelson Page, contrasting their work with that of Charles Chesnutt\u2019s conjure stories. In Chapter 2, I discuss the race-baiting Thomas Dixon and Sutton Griggs, whose novel The Hindered Hand is a direct response to Dixon. In my third and fourth chapters, I discuss the important of \u2018white trash\u2019: first in William Faulkner\u2019s Snopes Trilogy, then in the work of Erskine Caldwell, especially his photojournalist work You Have Seen Their Faces. Chapter 5 discusses various southern memoirs, juxtaposing the conservative Lanterns on the Levee by William Alexander Percy and Richard Wright\u2019s famed Black Boy and Killers of the Dream by Lillian Smith, a scathing indictment of segregation. The final chapter discusses elements of foreignness and disability in the works of Flannery O\u2019Connor and Carson McCullers, specifically the former\u2019s short story \u201cGood Country People\u201d and the latter\u2019s novel The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. My conclusion offers a case study in popular music with emphasis on The Clash and Lynyrd Skynyrd, before turning toward recent southern literature, specifically the works of Randall Kenan and Monique Truong, to emphasize that white anxiety is an ever prevalent concern in southern letters for a broad spectrum of authors writing about vastly disparate cultural experiences.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11691], "author_name_tesi": "Mellette, Thomas Justin", "last_name_ssi": "Mellette", "middle_name_ssi": "Justin", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aldon Lynn Nielsen", "Shirley Moody", "Linda Furgerson Selzer", "Anthony Edward Kaye"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aldon Lynn Nielsen, Dissertation Advisor", "Shirley Moody, Committee Member", "Linda Furgerson Selzer, Committee Member", "Anthony Edward Kaye, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["American Literature", "Southern Literature", "Whiteness Studies"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Maintaining the Job Search Goal Against Obstacles: A Within- and Between-person Study", "id": "26025", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11330", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To determine how individuals maintain their focal goal(s) over time in the face of obstacles and distractions, the current study theorized goal maintenance as a dynamic, self-regulated process and examined this process in the context of the job search.

In South America, there are three key diseases: black pod, caused by <i>Phytophthora</i> spp.; frosty pod, caused by <i>Moniliophthora roreri</i>; and witches\u2019 broom, caused by <i>Moniliophthora perniciosa</i>. Although chemical control options exist, farmers typically only use cultural disease management such as phytosanitary pruning. Agrochemical use can be problematic in the developing countries where cacao is grown due to large risks to human health and the environment. There has been increased interest in the use of biological control for management of cacao diseases due to problems associated with pesticide use as well as consumer desire for organic chocolate. Fungal species have been the main focus for research on biological control of cacao diseases, while cacao-associated bacteria have been nearly ignored. Previous research demonstrated that a <i>Bacillus</i> sp. from tomato was capable of endophytically colonizing cacao foliage and reduced disease severity of <i>Phytophthora capsici</i> in detached leaf assays. The previous success of research utilizing bacterial endophytes lead to an investigation on endospore-forming bacterial endophytes associated with cacao tissue.  \nThe present research focused on obtaining and screening endospore-forming cacao bacterial endophytes for their ability to suppress diseases. Approximately 70 isolates were obtained and screened for characteristics of elite biological control agents, such as chitinase production, ability to colonize clean plants, and disease suppression. From these isolates, four were tested in a two-year field study on biological control of witches\u2019 broom disease at INIAP in Pichilingue, Ecuador. In this trial, application of <i>Bacillus pumilus</i> isolate ET consistently reduced disease severity of witches\u2019 broom, when bacteria were applied three times a year and phytosanitary pruning was conducted at the end of each season.  Along with this study, it was determined that applied bacterial endophytes persisted in cacao foliage throughout the dry season (6 month period) when applied at the season onset. Bacterial endophytes persisted in the rainy season, but needed to be re-applied midway through the six month season to maintain adequate population levels. In addition to research on suppression of witches\u2019 broom, these four bacterial isolates were tested for their ability to suppress cacao pod disease and cherelle wilt in two cacao genotypes: \u2018Nacional\u2019 and \u2018CCN51\u2019. <i>Bacillus pumilus</i> ET reduced cherelle wilt in both genotypes, indicating the presence of a biological component associated with what was once thought to be a physiological condition. None of the four tested isolates reduced diseases on cacao pods, but application of <i>B</i>. <i>pumilus</i> ET increased the overall number of healthy pods in the first two months of the four month experiment. These successful field results indicate the positive potential for the use of native endophytic bacteria to manage cacao diseases.  \nFurther research was conducted to determine the modes of action of the biological control agents as well as whether endophytic bacteria could successfully be combined with endophytic <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. currently being tested as biological control agents of cacao diseases. Antibiosis studies indicated that <i>B</i>. <i>pumilus</i> ET was antagonistic to <i>P</i>. <i>capsici</i> and <i>M</i>. <i>roreri</i>, but not <i>M</i>. <i>perniciosa</i> in plate antagonism studies. Research was conducted using quantitative real time PCR (Q-PCR) to determine whether colonization of endophytic Bacillus spp. activated the expression of cacao expressed sequence tags (ESTs) related to defense. Research indicated that colonization of cacao seedlings with bacterial endophytes activated the expression of cacao ESTs related to plant defense, such as chitinases, pathogenesis-related proteins, and lipoxygenase. Another mode of action that was tested was to determine whether application of endophytic species displaced native endophytes, which were likely neutral in terms of plant health. Analysis of microbial communities utilizing automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) indicated that application of potential biological control agents did not impact the community of native <i>Bacillus</i> spp. or the overall bacterial community during the sampled periods. Overall, the suppression of disease caused by <i>B</i>. <i>pumilus</i> ET was likely due to a combination of chitinase production, induced resistance, and potentially antibiosis. Additional research demonstrated that bacterial endophytes could successfully exist with endophytic <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. when applied either to seeds or foliage. <i>Bacillus</i> spp. persisted in roots (when applied to seeds only), stems, and foliage, while <i>Trichoderma</i> spp. persisted in roots and stems. These species were capable of co-existing in the same niche, therefore could likely be used together in the field. In conclusion, the results reported here indicate that <i>B</i>. <i>pumilus</i> ET would likely make an excellent biological control agent, due to its multiple modes of action and ability to be combined with endophytic <i>Trichoderma</i> spp.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5224], "author_name_tesi": "Melnick, Rachel L", "last_name_ssi": "Melnick", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Anthony Backman", "Paul Anthony Backman", "Bryan James Bailey", "Roger Tai Koide", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco", "Gary William Moorman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Anthony Backman, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Anthony Backman, Committee Chair", "Bryan James Bailey, Committee Member", "Roger Tai Koide, Committee Member", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco, Committee Member", "Gary William Moorman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cacao", "Tricoderma", "bacterial endophytes. biological control", "Bacillus"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "A multi-faceted approach towards improving the performance of silicon electrodes for next-generation lithium-ion batteries", "id": "25046", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11202", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although lithium-ion battery technology has been the catalyst in enabling modern electric vehicle, mobile device, and large-scale energy storage technology, the increasing power demands by end-users has motivated research in developing the next-generation of lithium-ion batteries. This next generation of batteries will need to achieve higher energy and power densities, while remaining chemically stable. Silicon-based active material has been proposed as a solution in achieving superior battery performance, as it can offer a lithium storage capacity (4200 mAh/g) tenfold higher than the carbonaceous electrodes employed in commercial Li-ion cells, while also offering superior safety characteristics. Unfortunately, the higher lithium storage capacity translates into an immense volume expansion (300 - 400%) upon lithiation, and thus the mechanical integrity and electrochemical performance of the electrodes are very unstable. Within the past decade, the performance of Si-based electrodes has been greatly improved as active material morphologies, polymer binders, electrolyte additives, and theoretical models have provided solutions in alleviating the stresses and strains generated during Si lithiation/delithiation. A multi-faceted solution pathway is enacted in this research to develop a Si-based electrode that can achieve cycling performance relevant to industrial application, while also offering insight on the influence of several aspects of the Si-based electrode design on cycling performance. From this investigation, a Si-based electrode has been developed with carbon-coated silicon monoxide active material and polyacrylic acid polymer binder, both of which offer several complimentary attributes that enable a moderately stable cycling performance at high active mass loading while offering a gravimetric and areal lithium capacity magnitude relevant to industrial applications.

With this in mind, this study investigated the effects of inlets on interfacial structures of vertical-downward co-current air-water two-phase flow. Experiments were performed in a test facility that allows for the investigation of three different types of vertical downward inlets, namely: two-phase mixture injector without flow straightener (Type A), two-phase mixture injector with flow straightener (Type B), and 90\u00b0 horizontal-to-vertical downward elbow (Type C). The effects of each inlet on global and local two-phase flow parameters are investigated in detail. Experiment results showed that the Type A inlet induces high rotation and turbulence in the mixture flow that leads to significant coalescence of the bubbles near the centerline of the pipe cross-section. The implementation of the flow straightener in the Type B inlet reduces the rotation and promotes the formation of uniform profiles of local two-phase flow parameters. For the Type C inlet, the creation of secondary flow in the elbow causes the bubbles to migrate to the inner curvature of the elbow resulting in the formation of asymmetrical distributions of void fraction and interfacial area concentration immediately downstream of the elbow inlet. An assessment of the available pressure loss models was performed. It was found that the Lockhart-Martinelli correlation can predict the pressure drop for the Type A, B, and C inlets with an average percent difference of 4.5%, 1%, and 3.4%, respectively, of the experimental data. Furthermore, the Minor Loss model evaluated for the Type C inlet predicts the pressure drop across the elbow with an average percent difference of 1.6%. In view of the one-dimensional transport of two-phase flow parameters, a model is proposed to characterize the dissipation region of the effects induced by the vertical-downward elbow inlet.

By promoting outcrossing, SI systems allow plants to avoid self-fertilization and the detrimental effects associated with inbreeding.  Solanum carolinense has a fully functional SI system but, unlike most self-incompatible plants, it is a weed that inhabits disturbed sites. Self-incompatibility is uncommon in weedy and invasive species because disturbed habitats require frequent episodes of colonization, effective population sizes are small, and habitats are often short-lived.  This thesis research uses molecular and ecological data to assess the level of variation in the strength of SI in two natural populations of S. carolinense.  A series of controlled pollinations were carried out in the greenhouse, and we determined that the ability to self-fertilize changes with floral age and the presence of developing fruits, suggesting that the SI response in horsenettle may have a labile component.  We isolated and identified the S-alleles in plants from two large populations of S. carolinense growing in Maryland and Pennsylvania.   We found that these two populations harbor a low diversity of S-alleles (10 and 6 S-alleles, respectively).  In addition, alleles S8 and S18 were highly overrepresented in these populations. A two-generation greenhouse study was performed to determine whether variation in the strength of SI is due to the existence of weak and strong S-alleles.  Allele S9 is able to set significantly more self seed than the other S-alleles found in the population we sampled, and that its ability to self is not dependent on interactions with other S-alleles.  We also examined the extent of inbreeding depression in this population of horsenettle.  Under greenhouse conditions, selfed progeny produced fewer flowers and set fewer seed when compared to outcrossed progeny.  Under field conditions, outcrossed progeny grew faster and had slightly higher levels of herbivory than selfed progeny.  We also found that selfed progeny that are homozygous at the S-locus produced fewer flowers and set fewer seeds than selfed progeny that are heterozygous at the S-locus.  Solanum carolinense seems to display a mixed mating system, which may be important in the colonization and establishment of natural populations of weedy species with a fully functional SI system.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2717], "author_name_tesi": "Mena-Ali, Jorge Ivan", "last_name_ssi": "Mena-Ali", "middle_name_ssi": "Ivan", "first_name_ssi": "Jorge", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew George Stephenson", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Katriona Shea", "Teh Hui Kao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Chair", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member", "Katriona Shea, Committee Member", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["breakdown in SI", "inbreeding depression", "Self-incompatibility", "Solanum", "invasive weed"]}]
