First, it is assumed that when reading a persuasive message, readers first use primitive, direct appraisal of the message as it pertains to them. This appraisal leads to the secondary, more detailed assessment of cognitive and emotional reactions to the message. Finally, as long as the cognitive and emotional responses are relevant to the message, they are expected to promote a general judgment on message persuasiveness. Second, this dissertation adopts the conceptualization that message elements are classified to content, style, and structure. With this classification, this dissertation tests matching effects of message styles, gain-loss framing and visual image. Specifically, it examines how these two are matched with each other through valence or motivation. Chapter 1 introduces these ideas of the appraisal model of persuasion process, message elements, and style elements\u2019 effects.\nChapters 2 and 3 discuss theoretical accounts, empirical findings, and current issues associated with two styles. In Chapter 2, research on gain-loss framing is reviewed. Prospect theory is first reviewed as origin of framing research. Other theories, such as detection-prevention framework, negativity bias, and fear appeal, are also discussed. In the section of empirical evidence, meta-analyses that found no meaningful difference between gain- and loss-framed messages are presented. Based on the theories and evidence, I suggest three issues to reconsider framing effects and to direct ways to overcome current problems in framing research. Research questions and hypotheses are presented next.    \nChapter 3 centers on another stylistic feature, visual image. This chapter defines visual image as well as reviews empirical findings and theories. The empirical findings are summarized with four categories; attention, memorability, emotion, and persuasion. Dual coding theory and exemplification theory are reviewed to account for why visual image may affect message outcomes. Same as the review on framing effects, current issues associated with visual image are discussed next. The issues include facial expressions of emotion, emotional contagion, and verbal-visual consistency. With this review, research questions are formed.\nChapter 4 reports the research method, results, discussion, and limitation of Study 1. With an experiment (N = 455), Study 1 tested the framing-image matching effects with valence. Specifically, the consistent messages were the combinations of gain-positive face image and loss-negative face image. The combinations of the inconsistent message were reversed; gain-negative face image and loss-positive face image. Also, no image condition was employed to set a comparison point. Two topics of free travel to Puerto Rico and free tablet PC were manipulated for this test. The findings confirmed the persuasion process: Message styles affect persuasion via perceived framing, emotion, and dominant cognition. The result further showed that the effect of consistency matching was not different from that of no-image message, but the inconsistency matching produced a significant difference.\nStudy 2 (N = 424) in Chapter 5 examines another matching effect; motivation matching between framing and image. Further it compares the direction and valence models that differently predict persuasion directions of emotion. With the same free travel topic, visual images were manipulated to match motivational depictions of framing, such as gain-happy face and loss-sad face. In the mismatch condition, gain-contented face and loss-angry face were used. The result found that visual image alone was not effective to arouse target emotions, but framing and image together evoked discrete emotions. These emotions showed individual effect on persuasion, which was consistent with the direction model.\nChapter 5 presents a general discussion and conclusion. The findings from two studies are summarized and implications of this dissertation are discussed. Specifically, this chapter briefly details the ways in which this dissertation may inform future research on message style effects communication and persuasion process.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9547], "author_name_tesi": "Seo, Ki Won ", "last_name_ssi": "Seo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ki Won", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Dillard", "Denise Haunani Solomon", "Fuyuan Shen", "Mary Beth Oliver"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Dillard, Dissertation Advisor", "Denise Haunani Solomon, Committee Member", "Fuyuan Shen, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Oliver, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["persuasion", "message style", "message framing", "visual image", "emotion"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The impact of managerial overconfidence on the relationship between equity-based compensation and strategic risk-taking in the U.S. restaurant industry", "id": "15446", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7737", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to examine 1) the effects of different forms of CEO equity-based compensation (EBC) on strategic risk-taking (SRT), 2) the moderating effect of CEO overconfidence on the relationship between EBC and SRT in the U.S. restaurant industry. In particular, these effects are investigated under two decision situations: 1) gain situation where CEOs perceive increase in the accumulated value of EBC as gain, 2) loss situation where CEOs perceive decrease in the accumulated value of EBC as loss. Neither the main effect between EBC and SRT nor the moderating effect of overconfidence has been empirically tested in the hospitality literature. Based on behavioral agency model (BAM) and prospect theory, this study incorporated a behavioral perspective into the analyses of the association between EBC and SRT. The sample of this study consists of 54 CEOs in 42 publicly traded U.S. restaurant companies during the period of 1992 to 2010. To control for potential cross-sectional and serial correlations, both clustered standard errors and fixed-effects model were used to analyze the data. Our results found evidence supporting BAM arguments that stock options did not promote risk-taking at high levels of value when CEOs are loss averse. Further, we found the positive moderating effect of overconfidence, suggesting that overconfident CEOs may be less sensitive to loss and thus, less susceptible to risk aversion bias. Using a behavioral perspective, the findings of this study could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between EBC and SRT in the U.S. restaurant industry.

The main idea of ACO came from the ants\u2019 communicative behavior. Ants communicate with each other through pheromone, which is a kind of chemical substance in insects. An important behavior of ant colonies is the foraging behavior. Ants deposit some amount of pheromone during their trip from their nest to a food source. Deposited pheromone forms a pheromone trail. Ants prefer to choose paths with higher pheromone. This simple behavior allows them to find the shortest path between their nest and a food source when many paths exist. Inspired by such behavior, the ACO algorithm has been successfully used to solve the traveling salesman problem and other NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems such as vehicle routing and scheduling.\nIn this research, ant colony optimization is applied to solve three well-known NP-hard problems: the Steiner tree problem in an undirected graph, the Steiner arborescence problem in a directed graph, and the job-shop scheduling problem with the makespan objective. \nAlthough the ACO algorithm has achieved success in solving various combinatorial optimization problems, it has not been applied to solve the two well-known NP-hard problems: the Steiner tree problem in an undirected graph (STP) and the Steiner arborescence problem in a directed graph (SAP). \tThe first part of this research uses the ACO algorithm to solve large-scale versions of STP and SAP. The objective of both STP and SAP is to find the shortest tree containing a subset of nodes, called terminal nodes. For STP, a proposed two-phase procedure solves the problem. In the first-phase, existing graph reduction rules decrease the size of the original graph. The second-phase, based on the ACO algorithm, iteratively attempts to generate improved trees by adjusting the pheromone values of edges to generate an optimal or near-optimal solution. The ACO algorithm finds the best known solutions for 56 out of 78 test problems. Moreover, this algorithm provides better results in the test problems than other metaheuristic algorithms. For SAP, a similar two-phase procedure is developed. The ACO algorithm obtains the best known solutions for all test problems.\nIn the case of the job-shop scheduling problem, the ACO algorithm has been applied to for job-shop scheduling problems (JSSP) with the makespan objective, but with results not as satisfactory as other metaheuristic algorithms. This algorithm has produced good solutions in various application areas, but they have not succeeded in certain cases due to a stagnation situation in which the same solutions are repeatedly generated. In 2004, Blum and Dorigo proposed a max-min ant colony optimization (MMACO) to prevent the stagnation of the general ACO algorithm. This research uses a max-min ant colony strategy to solve the JSSP with the objective of minimizing makespan. Moreover, in order to find near optimal or optimal solutions efficiently, the Storer et al.\u2019s methodology which is known to be the one of the best heuristic algorithms is implemented in the framework of the MMACO algorithm. The MMACO with use of the Storer et al.\u2019s methodology finds better solutions than the best known solutions for 6 test problems. In the 73 test problems, the average relative error from the best known solutions is 1.14%.\t\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4508], "author_name_tesi": "Seo, Minseok ", "last_name_ssi": "Seo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Minseok", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Jose Ventura", "Jose Antonio Ventura", "M Jeya Chandra", "Tao Yao", "Paul Peter Jovanis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Jose Ventura, Dissertation Advisor", "Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Chair", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "Paul Peter Jovanis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["job-shop scheduling problem", "Steiner tree problem", "ant colony optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A multi-functional role of zinc transporter ZnT2 in mammary gland zinc metabolism \n\n", "id": "13719", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7060", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "  Breast milk is the best source of nutrition for infants, providing all necessary nutrients for optimal growth and development through the first 6 months of life. As a result, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for infants during the first 6 months of life. To nourish the infant, the mammary gland must produce and secrete an adequate amount of nutrients into milk. Zinc (Zn) is a critical nutrient during postnatal development. As an essential micronutrient, Zn is required for key cellular, biological processes such as DNA and protein synthesis, mitosis and cell division, cell signaling, ATP biogenesis and apoptosis. When infants do not get adequate Zn in their diet, it can result in severe Zn deficiency such as impaired growth, compromised immune function, cognition deficits and death. As a result, the mammary gland normally transfers a tremendous amount of Zn (~1-3 mg Zn/d) into milk to nourish the developing infant. Interestingly, milk Zn levels are highly variable between mothers, which is presumably independent of their nutritional status, leaving a sub-population of infants susceptible to Zn deficiency. We do not currently understand how the mammary gland transfers most nutrients into milk. Therefore, understanding how the mammary gland transfers nutrients such as Zn into milk will have a major impact on infant health and development.\n  We previously determined that the Zn transporter ZnT2 plays a major role in mammary gland Zn secretion into milk during lactation. We identified a mutation in ZnT2 in lactating women which resulted in severe Zn deficiency in their breastfed infants (\u201ctransient neonatal Zn deficiency\u201d). This genetic defect reduced Zn secretion into milk in afflicted women by ~75%. Our studies indicated that ZnT2 facilitates Zn accumulation into vesicles that are secreted from mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and thereby participates in Zn transfer into milk. In addition to playing a major role in Zn secretion during lactation, we also found that ZnT2 can be found in non-lactating mammary gland and non-secreting MECs. This implicates ZnT2 in a role(s) in Zn metabolism independent of its role in Zn secretion into milk. The primary goal of my dissertation research is to understand the function of ZnT2 in the mammary gland and to determine if genetic variation in ZnT2 is associated with the variability observed in milk Zn concentration in lactating women.\nIn study 1, we determined that ZnT2 is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane and acts as an auxiliary Zn importer into mitochondria in MECs. This is the first documentation of a specific Zn transporter directly functioning in mitochondria. Importantly, the expansion of mitochondrial Zn pools by ZnT2 over-expression significantly reduced ATP biogenesis and mitochondrial oxidation concurrent with increased apoptosis, confirming a functional role for ZnT2-mediated Zn import into mitochondria. These studies suggest that the mammary gland requires novel, specialized mechanisms to modulate mitochondrial-specific functions.\n  Prolactin (PRL) plays critical roles in regulating milk production and secretion, increasing nutrient transport into the mammary gland and maintaining a secretory phenotype. Our previous studies determined that PRL increases ZnT2 transcription through activation of the Jak2/STAT5 signaling pathway. We also determined that PRL stimulation post-translationally re-localizes ZnT2 to the cell membrane to facilitate Zn secretion into milk. However, Zn secretion must return to baseline to tightly control the amount of Zn secreted into milk. The precise mechanism(s) that regulates the transfer of Zn into milk is not well understood. Therefore, in study 2, we determined that following accumulation at the cell membrane, PRL activated ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of ZnT2 to repress Zn secretion from MECs. This provides insight into novel mechanisms through which nutrient transport into milk is tightly regulated to provide optimal nutrition to the nursing infant. \n  In study 3, we determined that genetic variation in ZnT2 plays a determinant role in Zn secretion and mammary cell function. We characterized two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ZnT2. SNP1 substitutes Leu23Pro, mis-localizes ZnT2 to lysosomes into which it hyper-accumulates Zn and abrogates Zn secretion from MECs. SNP2 substitutes Arg340Cys, mis-localizes to the Golgi apparatus, activates oxidative stress and increases Zn secretion from MECs. These results elegantly highlight the interplay between genetics and the regulation of key nutrients in breast metabolism, and more importantly, genetic variation in ZnT2 may have physiological implications with respect to critical modulation of mammary gland Zn metabolism. \n  Our in vitro findings in study 3 led to the hypothesis that genetic variation in ZnT2 may play a determinant role in the significant variability observed in milk Zn levels in women. In study 4, we conducted a preliminary study in which we collected breast milk samples from 45 lactating women, analyzed milk Zn levels and then extracted DNA directly from milk. We screened for SNPs in ZnT2 that we had characterized previously to explore the relationship between genetic variation in ZnT2 and milk Zn levels. Due to the small sample size, we did not find an association between two specific SNPs of ZnT2 and milk Zn levels. However, conducting human studies in a larger sample size will allow us to identify women whose infants may be at risk for Zn deficiency and who may benefit from Zn supplementation to provide optimal nutrient for the developing infant. In addition, defects in mammary gland Zn metabolism are associated with breast dysfunction, thus these studies warrant further investigation into the relationship between genetic variation in key Zn management proteins and breast disease.\n  In summary, this body of work determined that ZnT2 plays a multi-functional role in mammary gland Zn metabolism. ZnT2 imports Zn into mitochondria in mammary cells, which modulates key mitochondrial function such as bioenergetics and apoptosis to regulate mammary cell metabolism. In addition, ZnT2 plays a major role in Zn secretion during lactation and this process is primarily regulated by the lactogenic hormone PRL. Genetic variation in ZnT2 results in defects in mammary cell function and milk Zn secretion. Together, these studies implicate ZnT2 as a major modulator of mammary gland biology and understanding the function and regulation of ZnT2 may have major implications towards improving our understanding the mammary gland Zn metabolism with respect to human health and disease. \n\n\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7053], "author_name_tesi": "Seo, Young Ah ", "last_name_ssi": "Seo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Young Ah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shannon Leanne Kelleher", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Gary J Fosmire", "Troy Ott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Dissertation Advisor", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Gary J Fosmire, Committee Member", "Troy Ott, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["zinc", "zinc transporter", "mammary gland", "mitochondria", "prolactin", "genetic variation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Impact of Oxygen Enrichment on Soot Properties and Soot Oxidative Reactivity", "id": "10916", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2299", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Heavy duty diesel engines have been key power generators in transportation and power plants around the world. However, the hazardous pollutants emitted from diesel engines have driven their emissions to be regulated in increasingly stringent ways. Among the pollutants, particulate matter (PM) has long been studied as to why it is generated during the combustion process and how it can be effectively reduced via fuel injection strategy, fuel modifications and after-treatment systems. In order to meet current and future standards, diesel particulate filter (DPF) systems have become the primary means to remove PM.\nDPF systems involve particulate filtration from the exhaust and subsequent burn-off of the filtered particulates. Consequently, the effects of engine operation and fuel formulation on particulate oxidation have been of great interest because of the relevance to the application of DPF systems. Previous studies showed that physical and chemical properties of soot, which are represented by the volatile organic fraction of the particulate matter, and the crystalline structure, O and H content and surface oxygen functional groups of the primary soot particles, are significantly affected by engine operations and fuel formulations. Furthermore, the soot properties are observed to have a great impact on soot oxidative reactivity. In spite of the efforts to elucidate certain soot properties affecting soot oxidative reactivity, there are few investigations made on the influence of the combustion process on soot oxidative reactivity. Since oxygen enrichment has a great effect on the combustion process, various oxygen concentrations were examined in a diesel engine and a diffusion flame burner to determine the impact of oxygen enrichment on soot properties. \nOxygen addition to the engine was carried out by intake oxygen enrichment and by fuel oxygenation at low load and high load. The analyses of heat release rates and cylinder temperatures indicate that the effect of oxygen enrichment is more appreciable at high load than at low load. Correspondingly, there are more noticeable changes in crystalline structure and oxidative reactivity of soot from high load than of soot from low load. However, surface O content and oxygen functional groups are shown to have mixed results without any consistency at low and high loads with oxygen enrichment. In addition, soot generated from high load with intake oxygen enrichment is observed to contain some metallic species, while soot from low load has little or no metallic species. Although the higher temperature induced by higher oxygen concentration was thought to be a main factor affecting the oxidation of lubricating oil, it is shown that there should be a synergistic effect of high oxygen concentration and high temperature in order to accelerate the oxidation of lubricating oil. There might be an effect of soot crystalline structure on soot oxidative reactivity, but the major influence on the reactivity is shown to be closely related to the amounts of metallic species present in soot due to the catalytic role of metallic species in soot oxidation.\nIn order to better understand the effect of soot properties on soot oxidative reactivity, a diffusion flame burner was employed at various oxygen concentrations. There is a clear inverse relation observed between adiabatic flame temperature and soot oxidative reactivity. However, detailed experiments suggest that the primary factors impacting soot oxidative reactivity are the soot inception time and the soot oxidation process. The earlier soot is formed, the less reactive soot becomes. Accordingly, ethylene-derived soot is shown to be less reactive than n-heptane-derived soot under the same carbon flow rate and the same adiabatic flame temperature, because soot is formed at an earlier stage with ethylene than with n-heptane. In addition, increasing oxygen concentration in the oxidizer stream made soot less reactive, because not only is the soot inception time shortend by the increase in the flame temperature, but also the soot oxidation process is enhanced by increased abundance of oxidizing gases during the combustion process. From these results, it is concluded that the reason why soot derived from oxygenated fuel (a mixture of 70 vol. % n-heptane and 30 vol. % monoglyme) is more reactive than soot from n-heptane fuel is related to the lengthened soot inception time caused by reduced soot precursor particles.\nRaman spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction (XRD), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and near edge x-ray absorption structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) showed that the crystalline order of soot is strongly related to soot oxidative reactivity. However, the trend in the crystalline order of soot is observed to be opposite for soot from the diffusion flame burner and soot from the diesel engine with increasing oxygen concentration. Interestingly, engine soot from high load becomes less ordered in its crystalline structure with increasing oxygen concentration in spite of increasing cylinder temperature, which is contradictory with others\u2019 results. From the study with the diffusion flame burner, it is suggested that since soot precursor particles are oxidized by abundant amounts of oxidizing gases at high temperature, there is a limitation for soot precursor particles to transform to soot particles, which delays soot inception time, resulting in reducing the crystalline order of soot. \nIt is difficult to evaluate the effect of surface O content on soot oxidative reactivity in the case of diesel soot, but the study on flame soot clearly indicates that surface O content correlates with soot oxidative reactivity. A detailed XPS study suggests that C-O groups in alcohol, and carboxylic anhydride and/or ester groups are the most abundant on the soot surface, and upon oxidation C=O groups and COOH groups increase gradually in their relative ratios, whereas C-O groups, and carboxylic anhydride and/or ester groups decrease. Also, it is suggested that soot oxidative reactivity depends more on the active sites that remain in the soot structure than on surface oxygen functional groups. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2279], "author_name_tesi": "Seong, Hee Je ", "last_name_ssi": "Seong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hee Je", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Angela Lueking", "Randy Lee Vander Wal", "Richard A Yetter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Dissertation Advisor", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Chair", "Angela Lueking, Committee Member", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["oxygen enrichment", "soot properties", "soot oxidative reactivity", "diesel engines", "diffusion flame burners", "DPF"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A dedramatized Minor Cinema: regional perspectives by Central American women", "id": "19000", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9112", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cinema has helped shape a collective sense of belonging for decades, as it renders particular depictions of local accounts.

The field data is obtained from downhole pressure gauges (DHPGs) which are installed at a significant distance above perforations. The ANN is trained first to predict pressure drop between the DHPG and wellhead, and then adapted to predict true flowing sandface pressure (PSF). In order to validate the ANN predictions of true PSF, history matching studies are conducted on the field. \n\tThe ANN designed in this study is a feedforward-backpropagation network, and requires supervised learning. During training, wellhead pressures (PWH), fluid rates, static well parameters, and node-to-node lengths, and functional links are used as inputs, and output is DHPG reading. To adapt the same network to \u2018extrapolation\u2019- that is, prediction of pressures outside the training range, with greater well deviation in the section between gauges and perforations, adapted normalization parameters had to be applied to the training data. To validate ANN predictions of PSF, three history matching studies were conducted. First, bottomhole pressure (PBH) behavior is matched to uncorrected DHPG data, then lift-table corrected PWH behavior is matched to PWH history, and lastly, PBH behavior is matched to ANN-corrected \u2018true\u2019 PSF history. The reservoir property distributions that produce satisfactory history matches for each stage are compared against the properties taken from whole cores, and the match to ANN-corrected PSF history proves to be the most reasonable match.\n\tWhile the ANN proved highly successful in predicting pressure drop between wellhead and DHPG, the \u2018true\u2019 PSF predictions show some irregularities and are not reliable under all conditions, due to the extrapolation of the prediction outside the range of the original training data. However, use of the ANN predictions along with good engineering judgment in a history matching study demonstrated a more reasonable reservoir property distribution than alternatives. Furthermore, the training process identified strong dependence of pressure drop on the average deviation parameter, as observed from weights. Additionally, the success of the training process demonstrates that the ANN is robust to the nonlinearities that cause difficulty in application of classic semi-empirical lift correlations in highly deviated gas condensate wells such as unsteady liquid holdup, slugging, and transitioning flow regimes.\n\tThe contributions of this work are diverse. In addition to the design and validation of an artificial expert system to model flowing frictional pressure drop in wells that are unreliably modeled by other means, weaknesses of the other methods are identified in the process. These include the deviation parameter applied to the ANN training data (absent from existing correlations) and the significance of phase change within the production tubing identified by internal inconsistencies among semi-empirical correlations in liquid holdup and flow regime calculations. The importance of the ANN\u2019s predictions are validated by their application to a history matching study, and the ANN proves useful in an extrapolation mode, unlike the more common interpolation mode often used in similar applications.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1653], "author_name_tesi": "Seren, Doruk ", "last_name_ssi": "Seren", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Doruk", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Production Engineering", "Reservoir Engineering", "Artificial Neural Networks", "ANN"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF TRINEXAPAC-ETHYL AND CULTIVATION ON THE DIVOT RESISTANCE OF KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS CULTIVARS\n\n\n", "id": "8714", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6200", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Divots on athletic fields negatively affect playing quality and can result in injuries to athletes.  A divot is a piece of turf partially or completely gouged out of surrounding turf by an athlete wearing studded footwear.  Divots occur most often in sports that require rapid changes of direction, such as football.  Excessive divoting indicates a playing surface with low surface stability.  Low surface stability can affect the integrity of the game as players will lose footing frequently.  It also affects the aesthetic quality of the surface.\n\nProfessional and collegiate athletic field rootzones are often constructed with a high percentage of sand, which increases drainage and minimizes the effects of compaction.  However, because sand-based rootzones do not have high amounts of silt and clay, soil cohesion is low.  As a result, the stability of sand-based rootzones is largely determined by the surface and below-ground biomass of the turfgrass stand.  Excessive foot traffic on athletic fields causes a loss of both shoot and root density and, therefore, biomass is reduced.  As turfgrass biomass is reduced, the network of tillers, roots, rhizomes, and stolons weakens, reducing surface stability.  \n\nApplications of the plant growth regulator trinexapac-ethyl (TE) have been reported to increase tiller density and affect the rooting of Kentucky bluegrass (KBG) (Poa pratensis L.).   Increased turfgrass density and rooting may increase divot resistance.  \nPractitioners have reported increased root and rhizome growth through a combination of vertical mowing and core cultivation.  These cultural practices may stimulate an increase in below ground biomass by severing existing roots and rhizomes and creating voids into which roots can grow.  This additional growth may increase divot resistance.\n\nThe objectives of this research were to 1) determine the effects of two TE treatment regimes and cultivation on the divot resistance of nine KBG cultivars under varying levels of simulated traffic and 2) determine if measured turfgrass properties including ground cover, tiller density, below-ground biomass, and shear strength are related to divot resistance. \n\nThe TE application regimes included applying TE monthly from May-July and May-Oct.  The final application for the May-July regime coincided with the beginning of a typical football season and the onset of traffic simulation in this experiment.  Plots treated under this regime returned to normal (uninhibited) growth for the duration of the simulated traffic period, which ended in late Oct.  Plots managed under the May-Oct. regime continued to receive TE applications throughout the simulated traffic period.  \n\nThe cultivation treatment, which included a combination of vertical mowing and core cultivation, was performed in early May.  The vertical mower blades penetrated approximately 1.3 cm below the soil surface in order to sever existing roots and rhizomes.  Core cultivation was performed immediately after vertical mowing.  Following the cultivation treatment, sand topdressing was applied to a depth of 0.95 cm over the entire plot area.\n\nNine cultivars of KBG were established on a sand-based rootzone in 2001.  The cultivars included \u2018Baron\u2019, \u2018Langara\u2019, \u2018Limousine\u2019, \u2018Midnight\u2019, \u2018Princeton 105\u2019 (\u2018P105\u2019), \u2018Penn State A\u2019, \u2018Penn State B\u2019, \u2018Rugby II\u2019, and \u2018Touchdown\u2019.\n\nSimulated traffic was applied to the test area from late July through late Oct. using the Brinkman traffic simulator.  Traffic levels included no (0 passes/week), medium (6 passes/week), and high traffic (12 passes/week).  \n\nIn Nov. of 2006 and 2007, divots were created using a device consisting of a weighted pendulum with a golf club head attached to one end (PENNSWING).  The size of each divot was then measured.  Small divots indicated high divot resistance.  \n\nSeveral KBG cultivars exhibited differences in divot size.  Plots of Limousine, Rugby II, and P105 produced the smallest divots (26.6, 29.2, and 30.0 cm, respectively) while plots of Midnight and Penn State B produced the largest divots (35.3 and 35.4 cm, respectively).  Other cultivars performed similarly, with differences in divot lengths of less than 2 cm.  \nPlots treated with TE from May-July were the only plots to produce smaller divots than the control in both 2006 and 2007, and, therefore, had the highest divot resistance of all plots.  This increase in divot resistance was consistent at each traffic level.  This treatment also increased tiller density and below-ground biomass.  In 2007, plots managed under this treatment regime measured highest in shear strength.  No treatments affected turfgrass ground cover compared to the control.  \n\nDivots on plots treated with TE from May-Oct. measured shorter in divot size than the control in 2006, but had no effect in 2007.   This treatment increased tiller density in both years; however, below-ground biomass, shear strength and turfgrass ground cover ratings did not differ from the control in either year.\n\nThe cultivation treatment resulted in smaller divots than the control in 2007, but divot size was not different from the control in 2006.  The improvements in divot resistance were less than improvements observed with TE applied from May-July.  Under no traffic, plots receiving the cultivation treatment had similar divot size compared to the untrafficked control; however, the benefits of the cultivation treatment were most evident at the high traffic level.  The cultivation treatment did not affect ground cover, tiller density, below-ground biomass, or shear strength.   \n\nThe shear vane device was included in this experiment to measure shear strength as well as to determine if it is a viable option for determining divot resistance.  While a significant relationship was reported between measurements obtained using the shear vane and  PENNSWING, greater differences among applied treatments and cultivars were reported using PENNSWING.  Therefore, while the shear vane gave an indication of divot resistance, PENNSWING was better able to detect differences in divot resistance among both applied treatments and cultivars in this experiment.\n\nFew research studies have investigated the potential for TE use on athletic fields.  The goal of this project was to determine if TE applications improved ground cover and divot resistance.  The effects of cultivation practices on divot resistance were also evaluated as well as the divot resistance of various KBG cultivars.  Under the conditions of this study, TE applied from May-July was the only applied treatment to improve divot resistance compared to the control in both years.  The other applied treatments produced inconsistent divot resistance results, with each treatment improving divot resistance in only one of two years.  Field managers with KBG fields that receive little play from May\u2013July should consider using TE through July in order to reduce divoting.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6191], "author_name_tesi": "Serensits, Thomas ", "last_name_ssi": "Serensits", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Scott Mc Nitt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Scott Mc Nitt, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["trinexapac-ethyl", "divot", "Kentucky bluegrass", "athletic field"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ENDOPHILIN B2:  AN ENDOCYTIC AND AUTOPHAGIC REGULATOR", "id": "13973jws5736", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13973", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation employed genetic approaches to study the impact of endophilin B2 on apoptosis, autophagy, and endocytic trafficking, which when disrupted can be associated with a variety of disorders including cancer and neurodegeneration. The endophilin family of proteins (including the endophilin A and endophilin B subfamilies) contains an amino-terminal Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (N-Bar) domain that induces membrane curvature, and a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain that facilitates protein-protein interactions. Endophilin B1 (SH3GLB1/Bif-1) is a positive regulator of endosome maturation, autophagy, apoptosis, and mitochondrial dynamics, but its major binding partner and fellow family member endophilin B2 (SH3GLB2) has not been as extensively studied. \nTo help understand the physiological role of endophilin B2 in-vivo, we generated knock-out mice. Endophilin B2 was found not to be essential for embryonic development as mice were born at expected Mendelian ratios and did not exhibit any overt physiological defects during development. Regardless of the lack of disease phenotypes, further work revealed that tissue expression of endophilin B2 is similar to that of endophilin B1. We also found that isoforms of endophilin B2 are differentially expressed in a tissue specific manner. \nWe then tested the hypothesis that endophilin B2 is not redundant to the functions of endophilin B1. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from knock-out mice, we explored the role of endophilin B2 in mitochondrial apoptosis, endocytosis, endosome maturation, and autophagy. We found that endophilin B2 was not essential for mitochondrial apoptosis resulting from over-expression of pro-apoptotic proteins or treatment of cytotoxic agents. Lack of endophilin B2 also failed to affect MEF mitochondrial dynamics studied via cell fusion assays. Using fluorescently-labeled dextran, we determined that ablation of endophilin B2 had no effect on endocytic internalization, but did decrease the acidification of endosomes assessed by dextran particles conjugated with a pH sensitive fluorescent dye. To further evaluate the role of endophilin B2 as a regulator of endocytic maturation, MEFs were infected with influenza-A virus. Endophilin B2 could localize with incoming viral particles, and decreased endophilin B2 expression reduced the amount of viral genome replication that took place in the nuclei of cells. Finally, we used CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology in HeLa cells to delete endophilin B2. This attenuated the degradation of stimulated epithelial growth factor receptors (EGFR) by delaying the delivery of the receptor to lysosomes.\nSince autophagy is highly dependent upon the endocytic pathway, we further sought to determine if endophilin B2 is an autophagic regulator. We induced autophagic flux through nutrient deprivation in endophilin B2 deficient HeLa cells where loss of endophilin B2 was observed to decrease autophagic flux potentially through the ineffective delivery of material to lysosomes. Re-expression of endophilin B2 in MEFs was observed to restore autophagic flux, confirming the impact of endophilin B2 on the autophagy pathway. In addition, we identified that the endophilin B2 can interact with the class-III phosphoinositide 3-kinase complex involved in phospholipid formation. This observation may explain, at least partially, the observed results with endosome and autophagosome maturation.\nIn summary, this dissertation has found new roles for endophilin B2 in endosome maturation and autophagic flux, while showing that it is not critical for endocytosis, mitochondrial apoptosis, and mitochondrial dynamics.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14263], "author_name_tesi": "Serfass, Jacob M", "last_name_ssi": "Serfass", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Jacob", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong-Gang Wang", "Hong-Gang Wang", "Richard B.

This thesis describes my investigations into two major functions of the SAGA complex: 1) its recruitment of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and 2) its histone acetyl transferase activity (HAT) on a nucleosome substrate.  My experiments show that the SAGA complex utilizes the Spt8 and possibly Ada1 subunits to bind the TATA-binding protein (TBP).  This is the first time that Ada1 has been identified as a potential SAGA subunit that interacts directly with TBP.  In contrast, Spt3, a strong genetic candidate for interacting with TBP, does not bind TBP on its own.  However, in the context of the SAGA complex, Spt3 contributes to the overall interaction between TBP and SAGA.  \n\nSequence analysis indicates a putative WD40 domain repeats within the C-terminal region of Spt8.  These putative WD40 repeats are apparently sufficient for the interaction with TBP.  Unexpectedly, I find that Spt8 or the SAGA complex binding to TBP competes with TBP dimer formation.  Furthermore, the association of Spt8 or the SAGA complex with TBP prevents TBP binding to the TATA box DNA, suggesting that Spt8 binds to the concave surface of TBP.  Based on these results, I propose a hand off model that can explain why the SAGA complex is able to act alternatively as a corepressor or a coactivator.  The hand off model also explains why the SAGA complex is not found localized to the core promoter in vivo.   \n\nI have also investigated the requirement of the Gcn5 bromodomain for nucleosomal acetylation function by the trimeric Ada3/Ada2/Gcn5 SAGA subcomplex or the intact SAGA complex.  My mutational analyses show three basic residues, K415, R419, and K422 that lie on the surface of the bromodomain, are necessary for the nucleosomal acetylation of the Ada3/Ada2/Gcn5 complex.  Interestingly, the spatially distinct peptide binding pocket of the bromodomain is not necessary for the HAT function of the trimeric subcomplex.  The Gcn5 bromodomain is also required for the global acetylation of histone H3 in yeast cells. \n\nSpt8, Spt3, and possibly Ada1 SAGA subunits function to regulate interaction with TBP, whereas the Gcn5 bromodomain is required for nucleosomal acetylation of the trimeric Ada3/Ada2/Gcn5 or the SAGA complexes.

This is especially true in areas characterized by low development, such as north-central PA where roads act as the major source of land modification and fragmentation. Roads may affect wildlife through multiple mechanisms, including fragmentation, alteration of habitat structure, and traffic disturbance. Our goal was to determine whether and how bird communities differ between roadside and off road surveys and identify which road-characteristics are associated with the largest changes in forest bird communities.\nDuring the 2015 and 2016 breeding seasons, we conducted point counts at 1088 locations within public forest lands in north central Pennsylvania. At each of these point count locations we recorded elevation, distance to nearest stream, as well as forest cover type proportion within 100m of the point count center. We used these variables to control for possible differences between forest interior and road points. We found that road points tended to occur at lower elevations and closer to streams than forest interior points. Forest interior points tended to have higher proportions of hemlock than road points, while road points had higher proportions of oak and other conifers.\nThe road characteristics we measured were road presence, road type, width of canopy opening, width and composition of vegetation adjacent to the road; and ground, understory, and midstory cover at the forest edge. We ran comparison tests to determine if road characteristics varied by road type. Paved roads differed from the other two road types. They tended to create larger openings in the forest canopy, have larger roadside buffers, and a higher proportion of herbaceous vegetation present in the roadside buffer than dirt or gravel roads.\nWe analyzed our point count survey data using multi-species occupancy models, allowing us to determine how average road effects differed among different species-groups. The presence of a road was associated with higher occupancy of human-associated species with a mean estimated effect size (logistic regression coefficients for the effect road presence on occupancy) of 0.699 (95% Credible Interval (CI): 0.240 to 1.137). The effect of the road on occupancy of human associated species differed among the road types with paved roads being associated with the largest increase in occupancy (: 0.929, 95% CI 0.201 to 1.590) and dirt roads with the smallest (: 0.568, 95% CI: 0.211 to 0.954). Dirt roads were also associated with higher occupancy of forest generalist species, with a mean effect size of 0.322 (95% CI: 0.034 to 0.604). Gravel and paved roads were not associated with a change in occupancy for forest generalist species. Paved roads were associated with lower occupancy of forest interior species (: -0.327, 95% CI: -0.632 to -0.091). Dirt and gravel roads were not associated with a change in occupancy for forest interior species. Road type was not associated with changes in occupancy of edge/early successional species.\nIn addition to the type of road, the width of the canopy opening and the width of the vegetation bordering the road, as well as the composition of the vegetation, were correlated with changes in occupancy. As canopy openings became wider and the width of the adjacent roadside buffer became wider, occupancy rates of forest interior species declined with mean estimated effect sizes of -0.025 (95% CI: 0.049 \u2013 -0.002) and -0.026 (95% CI: -0.049 to -0.003) respectively, while both were associated with increases in occupancy for edge/early successional species (: 0.077, 95% CI: 0.030 \u2013 0.121; \u03b2: 0.061, 95% CI: 0.017 to 0.103 respectively). Forest generalists and human associated species did not see a change in occupancy associated with increasing canopy opening or roadside buffer width.\nMoving from the road corridor into the forest edge, the amount of ground cover was associated with increases in occupancy for edge/early successional and human associated species (: 0.404, 95% CI 0.188 to 0.611; : 0.230, 95% CI 0.074 to 0.394 respectively). Increasing vegetative coverage within the understory was associated with an increase in occupancy for edge/early successional species with a mean effect size of 0.308 (95% CI: 0.105 to 0.509). Occupancy of the forest interior and forest generalist groups did not differ with changes in the amount and composition of vegetation within the forest edge. Our study found that the composition of forest birds differed between points with roads and those without roads and that large paved roads were associated with the largest change in occupancy. Roads that create larger openings are associated with lower occupancies of forest interior species and higher occupancies of edge/early successional species. Just the presence of a road is associated with higher occupancies of human associated species.\nOur results have implications for avian monitoring programs that occur on roads.  For example, many large-scale bird monitoring programs utilize roadside surveys to collect their data in a quick and efficient way. As occupancy levels differ between road and interior points, in remote areas where roads are less common, these surveys may not adequately reflect the composition of the species within the surrounding landscape. To reduce this bias, large scale monitoring programs should attempt to focus their survey routes on small unpaved roads to decrease roadside survey bias.\nIn core forested areas, road development is ongoing to facilitate forest management, access to areas for hunting and recreation, as well as for oil and gas development. Most of the roads in these areas are smaller unpaved roads, but the increasing expansion of natural gas development in north central Pennsylvania\u2019s large forested areas is associated with more roads, many of which are large and paved.  Overtime, these may be associated with decreasing occupancy of forest interior species and increasing occupancy of human-associated and edge/early successional species. Based on our study, when new roads are needed, we suggest utilizing small unpaved roads to minimize the negative impacts to forest interior species as well as minimize the influx of human-associated species into the interior forest.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16137], "author_name_tesi": "Serno, Kimberly Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Serno", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham", "David Miller", "Matthew Marshall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham, Thesis Advisor", "David Miller, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew Marshall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Birds", "Multispecies occupancy models", "roads", "core forest", "forests", "fragmentation", "habitat degradation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Teaching Open-ended Partner Focused Questions to Adolescents with Asperger's Syndrome to Enhance Their Communicative Competence", "id": "13882", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7416", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Social dysfunction has been called the most central and disabling feature of Asperger Syndrome (AS).

Their high dielectric breakdown strength makes glass an ideal candidate for use in high energy density capacitors for pulsed power applications.\nIt has been observed in recent studies that a commercial alkali-free boroaluminosilicate glass, Schott AF45TM, exhibits a dielectric breakdown strength of 12-13 MV/cm. In order to successfully measure the dielectric breakdown strength of this glass, samples 5-30 microns thick were used during testing. It was desirable to continue testing glass below 5 microns thick in the pursuit of measuring the intrinsic dielectric breakdown strength. In this study, thin film deposition was used to produce glass less than 5 microns thick. Because of a built-in thickness gradient in the films across the wafer surface, each sample provided a range of thicknesses to measure.\nAF45 was used as the target material. RF magnetron sputtering was chosen over other deposition techniques, such as evaporation or chemical vapor deposition, because of its ability to sputter insulators, the ability to use a piece of commercial glass as the target material, the increased film density and good compositional control.  \nSeveral characterization techniques were used to understand the properties of the films. The films were examined with field emission scanning electron microscopy and observed to be microstructure free. The composition, measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, differed from that of the bulk glass. The films also appear to have a significant amount of water included in the structure and a lower density based on spectra obtained from Fourier transfer infrared spectroscopy measurments.\nThe dielectric breakdown strength of the films was measured to be 9.5-10 MV/cm, about 20% lower then the dielectric breakdown strength of the thinnest sample of bulk glass. The decreased breakdown strength measured for the thin films is attributed to several factors. The presence of water and the low density of the films can allow for charge to pass through the glass films more easily than in the bulk. Microstructural defects such as voids and impurities within the deposited film, electrodes and especially at the film/electrode interface, are obvious candidates based upon previous work with bulk dielectrics.

Subjects were a convenience sample of 215 nursing students aged 18 to 59 years old (M = 31.54) who had enrolled in the ADN programs offered by the five colleges in the college system in 2004. Research questions explored the relationships among demographic, financial, and academic variables, and program completion. A data collection sheet was designed to facilitate the systematic collection of data for each student in the study. Data were gathered, abstracted, or computed from several sources. Information was obtained from individual student files, class records, college transcripts, and institutional records. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square, t-tests, and backward stepwise logistic regression. \n           Race/ethnicity, financial aid, cumulative pre-requisite grade point average, combined with HESI math and reading comprehension scores, English, psychology, and biology grades were shown to significantly predict the successful completion of the ADN program. Students of White-Non-Hispanic origin were more likely than students of a different race/ethnicity to successfully complete the nursing program. Students who successfully completed the nursing program had higher scores on both components of the HESI test, higher academic GPAs for all courses, and higher cumulative pre-requisite grade point averages than students who did not complete the program. Furthermore, students who received some form of financial aid were more likely to successfully complete the nursing program than were students who had not received financial assistance. Cumulative pre-requisite grade point average, HESI reading comprehension score, and Biology 2402 GPA predicted program completion. Cumulative pre-requisite grade point average was the strongest predictor of program completion. \n           Based on study results, administrators and faculty should work together to design and implement an institution-specific comprehensive retention plan with suitable interventions.

Mass extinction is considered a governing influence on the diversification, migration, and ecological innovation of biota.  Diverse and widespread clades are often obliterated at extinction boundaries and previously obscure taxa sometimes rise to prominence in the wake of extinction. While much is known about the proximate causes and consequences of mass extinction, relatively less study has focused on subsequent recovery periods, especially on timescales of tens of millions of years.  Climate change is also considered a fundamental force that shaped the origination and distribution of taxa, however relatively few studies have tested this correlation in deep time.  The Upper Cretaceous through lower Paleogene (84 - 46 Ma) Gulf Coastal Plain of the United States (GCP; Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Texas) contain the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction and a global warming event at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary known to have affected marine organisms.  I analyzed molluscan-dominated assemblages to better understand how these forces shaped the diversity and ecological characteristics of assemblages at the local and regional level.  I also derived temperature estimates from mollusk shells to assess how climate change affected these organisms.  Because of vagaries in the architecture of the fossil record, biases must first be accounted for to remove the spurious effects of preservation and unequal sampling.  By doing so, this dissertation represents a synoptic treatment of the diversity and ecological trends of GCP marine assemblages in the 20 million years following the K-Pg extinction.\n\tAbundance data were collected from bulk samples, museum collections, and the literature, resulting in a data matrix of 153 samples, 1494 taxa, and 52,585 individuals spanning ~14 fossiliferous horizons in the GCP during the Paleocene to middle Eocene (65.5 \u2013 46.6 Ma).  These faunas are dominated by molluscs (bivalves and gastropods) with less common bryozoans, corals, echinoderms, and brachiopods.  A subset of these data contains body size measurements.  Geochemical data were analyzed from two late Paleocene units and one early Eocene unit.\n\tChapter 1, published in Geology (Sessa et al., 2009), examines the effect of temporally heterogeneous lithification on recovery patterns following the K-Pg extinction.  Lithification has been advanced as a potential bias on diversity patterns, and this is one of the first studies to quantify the magnitude of this bias.  Lithified units are significantly less diverse than their unlithified counterparts, primarily because small taxa are obscured in lithified rocks. In the GCP, this bias results in the artificial protraction of the K-Pg recovery interval by 7 Myr.\n\tChapter 2 explores the climatic and water mass properties of the GCP during the late Paleocene through early Eocene, a period of extreme global warmth.  Temperature estimates from the oxygen isotopes of bivalve shells show a 3\u00b0C increase from the late Paleocene through early Eocene.   Carbon isotopic profiles from bivalve shells suggest that the GCP water mass became progressively more stratified through this interval. While climatic changes had little effect on the diversity and ecology of assemblages (Chapter 3), the results of Chapter 2 are significant for the calibration and validation of models that reconstruct past greenhouse climates.\n\tChapter 3 analyzes the diversity, ecological structure, and turnover patterns of Late Cretaceous and early Paleogene assemblages.  After accounting for unequal sampling intensity, bin duration, and preservation, I found that regional GCP diversity recovered to pre-extinction values in ~2.7 Myr, nearly 20 Myr sooner than suggested by unstandardized estimates.  The ecological composition of assemblages was also changed by the K-Pg extinction and was tightly correlated to periods of diversity recovery, expansion, and subsequent equilibrium.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2534], "author_name_tesi": "Sessa, Jocelyn Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Sessa", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Jocelyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Patzkowsky", "Mark Patzkowsky", "Timothy J.

Such identity construction and reconstruction can occur through mediated or unmediated means.  Within the context of this study, adult identity development through unmediated learning within digital spaces is analyzed.  Specific to this study is Black natural hair care blogs (BNHCBs) that developed at the precipice of the \u201cnatural hair\u201d movement, which inspires Black women to wear their hair in its natural (i.e., non-chemically process or straightened, kinky/curly) state.  To this, Black feminists, such as bell hooks, argue that the natural hair movement is also a movement of resistance to maintain the status quo, especially Eurocentric standards of beauty.  This counterhegemonic perspective can greatly impact one\u2019s learning and identity development, specifically within the context of digital spaces, such as YouTube, Facebook, and various blogs that support dynamic, user-generated content.  As such, this qualitative research study examines Black female identity development through the medium of blogging within the online learning communities of BNHCBs.  In particular, this is a qualitative media content analysis (QMCA) and critical discourse analysis (CDA) of blog posts and comments from BNHCBs.  Additional sources of data are in-depth, semi-structured interviews with blog commenters (i.e., blog readers who post comments).  The following questions guide this study: (1) What discursive practices do the bloggers use to facilitate identity formation and critical consciousness in their readers, as a means of engaging in resistance?; (2) What discursive practices do the blog commenters use in response to the bloggers\u2019 practices that indicate identity formation and critical consciousness toward resistance?; and (3) How do the blog commenters\u2019 online personalities align with their offline personalities?  \nThe findings related to the first two research questions are organized in four principles related to the analyzed BNHCBs.  First, is the politics of representation, which highlight the themes of: (a) the importance of Black affinity spaces; (b) the fetishizing of Black women\u2019s bodies; and (c) the deconstruction of the angry Black woman trope.  Second, is the critical analysis of popular culture and media that highlights: (a) the lack of self-ethnic reflectors of Black women and (b) deconstructs the commodification of natural hair.  Third, is the BNHCBs as a journalistic sociopolitical intervention, which emphasizes: (a) Black women\u2019s sense of agency; (b) the normalization of natural hair; and (c) critical reflection of media messages.  Fourth, is the dialogic exchange of information on BNHCBs manifested in: (a) initiating and maintaining conversations and (b) positioning blog commenters as the experts.  Moreover, the analysis of participant interviews and their recent blog posts attend to the third research question, and not only manifest the same four principles identified above but also demonstrate how closely the participants\u2019 online and offline identities align.  \nThe study ends with implications of the findings for theory and practice within the field of lifelong learning and adult education. It also outlines the limitations of the study and makes suggestions for future research.

There is an immediate need for fast-response capacitors with decreased volume, weight, and cost for pulsed power applications and power distribution systems. This research challenge is dominated by energy density. Energy density is directly related to dielectric properties such as dielectric polarization, conductivity and breakdown strength of the capacitor dielectric. This research work correlates processing and microstructure of single and multiple component dielectric films with their dielectric properties. The inorganic materials studied in this dissertation include zirconium oxide (ZrO<sub>2</sub>) and tantalum pentoxide (Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) reactive sputtered films. Film crystallization & structure was studied as a function of sputtering growth variables such as sputtering power, sputtering pressure, source frequency, oxygen pressure, substrate temperature, substrate material, and post-deposition annealing temperature. Polycrystalline phase of ZrO<sub>2</sub> and amorphous phase of Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> were obtained for most sputtering growth variables. \nAlthough the amorphous films have lower permittivity (32 for amorphous & 51 for polycrystalline at 1 kHz), they also have lower AC and DC conductivities (3.4\u00d710<sup>-8</sup> S/m for amorphous & 12.2\u00d710<sup>-8</sup> S/m for polycrystalline at 1 kHz), which result in high breakdown strength than polycrystalline films. Amorphous Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> films are found to be ideal for high-energy density capacitors with energy density of 14 J/cm<sup>3</sup> because of their high permittivity, low leakage current density, and high dielectric breakdown strength. Oxide films were combined with different polymers (polyvinyldene flouride-triflouroethylene, polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate) to produce two different kinds of laminate composites \u2013 oxide on polymer and polymer on oxide. Permittivity and conductivity differences in the polymer and oxide films result in an impedance contrast of generally greater than 100 between the constituents. Low and high field dielectric properties were characterized for both laminate composites. All the dielectric films were characterized by impedance spectroscopy at frequencies ranging from 10 mHz to 1 MHz at different temperatures. Complex impedance and modulus analyses were used to resolve the contributions of individual microstructural features (such as grain, grain boundary & interface) from the overall film and composite electrical properties. Activation energies related to electro-active regions (grain boundary ~1.1 eV, grain ~0.5 eV) in the film structure were also determined from the temperature dependent impedances. The overall polarization of composite was higher by at least 25% than the sum of the polarizations from the individual layers for all composites. Plasma processed Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-Polypropylene laminate composite resulted in breakdown strength of ~870 MV/m, which approximately 10% higher breakdown strength than its highest breakdown constituent (~775 MV/m). These improved properties were attributed to bulk polymer modification, interface charge blocking/trapping and impedance contrast within the composite. The effect of impedance contrast on breakdown strength was modeled through permittivity contrast using Monte Carlo method. The breakdown model explored the electrostatic effects of adding a high permittivity barrier within an existing dielectric on the breakdown tree. The model also provided knowledge on various breakdown tree characteristics such as speed and shape. The Monte Carlo simulation results suggest that the experimentally observed impedance contrast of 1000 between the layers of the laminate composite can result in improved breakdown strength.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2143], "author_name_tesi": "Sethi, Guneet ", "last_name_ssi": "Sethi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Guneet", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan", "Michael T Lanagan", "Mark William Horn", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "S Ashok", "Eugene Furman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Chair", "Mark William Horn, Committee Chair", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "S Ashok, Committee Member", "Eugene Furman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["monte carlo", "energy density", "dielectric breakdown", "zirconium oxide", "laminate composites", "tantalum pentoxide", "thin films", "modeling", "PVDF", "polypropylene", "capacitors", "pulsed power"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Caring for the Aging Baby Boomers: An Assessment of the Separation Behavior of Direct Care Workers in Long Term Care", "id": "11346", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4600", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Background: The rise in the number of elderly due to aging baby boomers and increased life expectancy has led to an increase in the demand for long term care. Less availability of family and friends to provide this care has additionally increased the reliance on paid (formal) caregivers, also called direct care workers, to provide these services. Problems related to high turnover among the direct care workforce has complicated the issues related to higher demand for long term care.\n\nObjectives: The purpose of this research is to contribute to the understanding of the separation behavior of direct care workers to inform policies and practices that might help reduce turnover and improve recruitment among these workers. The two objectives of this dissertation are to 1) assess the nature of direct care worker separation by understanding its relationship to job tenure and 2) determine what factors are associated with the risk of direct care worker separation. \n\nData: The employment data on direct care workers collected as part of Better Jobs Better Care (BJBC) \u2013 a five-state demonstration implemented to improve direct care workers\u2019 jobs \u2013 is used as the primary source of data. Additional measures on organizational characteristics, job design practices, and market factors are obtained from a clinical manager survey (also collected as part of the BJBC) and Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nStudy sample: The analytic sample for the study has 74 long term care providers and 7,395 direct care workers. Forty-six percent of direct care workers in the sample terminate their employment during some time in the 18 months of the observation window. Of the 46 percent, 31 percentage points are worker-initiated quits compared with 15 percentage points due to layoffs, discharges, and other separations.\n\nMethods: The dissertation utilizes the worker employment data to construct employment event histories and conduct survival analysis to address the two research objectives. The Kaplan-Meier and grouped methods of describing the distribution of event data are used to assess the tenure dependence of direct care worker separation. To assess the factors associated with direct care worker separation, we use the Cox proportional hazard method of survival analysis.\n\nFindings:  Direct care workers in long term care face the highest risk of separation during the first nine months of employment, and nearly half of the newly hired workers are lost during this period. Organizational practices \u2013 both compensation and job design \u2013 play a significant role in reducing the risk of separation among direct care workers. However, when distinguished by reason, types of separation are distinct processes and the factors associated with each type of separation are different.\n\nImplications: These findings suggest the importance of directing attention toward short-tenured employees to address the issue of high turnover among the direct care workforce. The findings also guide both policy makers and practice managers on what practices are instrumental in reducing direct care worker separation. However, treating separation as a homogenous construct can fail to provide appropriate solution to the problem and it is important to first identify the reason for high separation and then address the problem by utilizing the appropriate practices.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4567], "author_name_tesi": "Setia, Monika ", "last_name_ssi": "Setia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Monika", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Kemper", "Peter Kemper", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "John Raymond Moran Jr.", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook", "Joseph Vasey", "France Weaver"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Kemper, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter Kemper, Committee Chair", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Member", "John Raymond Moran Jr., Committee Member", "Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Committee Member", "Joseph Vasey, Committee Member", "France Weaver, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Long term care", "direct care workers", "worker turnover", "survival analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Social Networks and the Exchange Economy in Rural Mozambique: A Study of Off-farm Labor and Crop Marketing Behaviors", "id": "19983", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9461", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Of the 3 billion living in rural areas in less developed regions of the world, approximately 1.2 billion people live in extreme poverty (The Economist, 2013; World Bank, 2013), and 70% of the 1.2 billion people have some dependency on agriculture (Cleaver, 2012). In sub-Saharan Africa, 47% of the population lives in extreme poverty (United Nations, 2012), 66% of the total population lives in rural areas, and more than 90% depend on agriculture for their livelihoods (Asfaw et al., 2010). Unfortunately, subsistence agriculture operates as a safety net for the poor population rather than as a driver of economic growth (World Bank, 2005). To combat extreme poverty, greater economic growth and income equality will be required (Chandy et al., 2013) and this may be achieved through poverty reduction strategies that target the productivity, profitability, and sustainability of poor farm households (Asfaw et al., 2010). By promoting rural economic growth, to include farm and off-farm opportunities, households can directly benefit from increased food security and incomes (Cord, 2002). \nMany economic activities in developing countries are influenced by non-market interactions with family, friends, and acquaintances. These mutually beneficial relationships require an investment of limited household resources such as time and money away from productive activities but in the long run may expand household resources (Bolin et al., 2003). Previous studies have found that social networks affect household incomes (di Falco and Bulte, 2011; Haddad and Maluccio, 2003; Narayan and Pritchett, 1999), agricultural technology adoption (Bandiera and Rasul, 2006; Isham, 2002), employment and credit (Munshi, 2011; Wahba and Zenou, 2005), productivity (Fafchamps and Minten, 2002), and risk sharing (Fafchamps, 2011). This dissertation investigates the influence of social networks on economic behavior of agricultural households in rural Mozambique. Specifically, the dissertation has two research objectives: 1) to better understand the effect of social networks on male and female labor allocation and off-farm work choices, and 2) to determine if social networks impact agricultural marketing behaviors of rural agricultural households.\nThis dissertation uses an ex ante baseline socioeconomic questionnaire administered to Mozambican households by the Institute for Agricultural Research of Mozambique (IIAM) and Pennsylvania State University (PSU) as part of a multidisciplinary project funded by the McKnight Foundation. The project aims to improve food security and agro-ecosystem sustainability through the development and diffusion of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) bred to grow well in low phosphorous soils of Africa. Face-to-face interviews were conducted between August 2008 and August 2009 in eight villages throughout Central and Northern Mozambique. As a baseline study, the interviews provided an initial picture of household composition, labor allocation, agricultural production and technology adoption (including beans), and social networks. \nTo achieve objective 1, a series of models are estimated to better understand the interrelationships between social networks and labor allocation and off-farm work decisions. A bivariate probit model is used to simultaneously estimate labor participation models for adult male and female respondents when both are present in the household. The bivariate probit model tests for jointness in decision-making between adult males and females in dual-headed households. Next, separate univariate probit models are used on the full sample to estimate models of labor participation decisions for adult male and female respondents. To test for the endogeneity of ego networks, a probit model with continuous endogenous regressors (IV probit) is included to model the off-farm labor participation decisions of adult males and females. Lastly, a multivariate probit is used to model off-farm work choices, particularly hired farm labor, non-farm wage labor, and non-farm self-employment. \nIn the bivariate probit analysis, the statistical insignificance of the cross equation correlation and the failure to reject the Wald test statistic for the hypothesis that the two equations are independent implies non-jointness in decision-making (at least for this sample). Therefore, the labor participation decision for men and women is estimated with two separate univariate probit models. \nResults from the univariate probit analysis indicate that men and women rely on different ego network types to access off-farm labor. In Mozambique, having more friends (friendship ego network size) positively affects women\u2019s off-farm labor participation; however, kin ego network size is not a statistically significant predictor of off-farm labor. For men, the opposite is true, friendship ego networks are not statistically significant predictors of off-farm labor but larger kin ego networks positively affect the off-farm labor participation decision. Results show that, regardless of network type, both men and women benefit from knowing more people (total ego network size). However, given a total network size, an increase in the proportion of contacts who are kin has the opposite effects on men and women. For women, a more kin homogenous total ego network reduces the probability of off-farm employment whereas for males, a more kin homogenous total ego network size increases the likelihood of off-farm employment. Additionally, results show that age is a statistically significant predictor of female off-farm labor participation. Also, education in Mozambique seems to result in different outcomes for men and women. More education among women reduces their likelihood of off-farm labor participation but increases men\u2019s probability of working in off-farm labor. \nThe multivariate probit analysis extends the off-farm labor participation model to look at the different off-farm work choices for men and women. Results from the multivariate probit indicate the use of different ego network types to access high and low wage off-farm labor. The results show that women who are self-employed and/or have higher wage non-farm jobs also have smaller friendship ego networks. For men, friendship ego networks are not statistically significant predictors of the different off-farm work choices. However, having more relatives in the village (kin ego network) increases access to work on others\u2019 farms. Knowing more people (total ego network size) does not result in favorable labor outcomes for men and women; women with larger total ego network are less likely to be self-employed and both men and women with larger total ego networks are more likely to be employed in low wage work on others\u2019 farms. A greater proportion of kin in total ego networks reduces women\u2019s employment in hired farm labor and increases the likelihood of employment in non-farm wage labor. For men, the opposite is true; more kin homogeneous total ego networks positively affects employment on others\u2019 farms as well as non-farm self-employment. In addition to the ego network results, the multivariate probit indicates that increased education reduces women\u2019s dependence on low wage hired farm labor but does not result in increased access to higher wage non-farm labor or self-employment. More than education, women benefit from improved health. Healthier women are less likely to be self-employed and more likely to participate in higher wage non-farm labor. For men, the opposite is true; improved health is not a statistically significant predictor of any of the off-farm work choices, however, increased education positively affects male participation non-farm self-employment. Other notable results include the negative effect of farm size on male participation in hired farm labor as well as the negative effect of distance to the nearest city/town on female participation in non-farm wage labor employment and self-employment. \nTo achieve objective 2, a double hurdle model is used to determine the effect of social networks on the market participation decision and value of sales for agricultural households. Three separate double hurdle models are estimated to study marketing behavior of three crops: beans, maize, and other crops. To test for and correct for potential endogeneity, a control function method is used. Interpretation of the results includes marginal effects of the independent variables on the probability of participating in crop markets as well as the conditional average partial effect on the expected value of sales for crops and the unconditional average partial effect on the expected value of sales.\nResults from the double hurdle models indicate the importance of who you know and how many people you know for agricultural marketing behavior. Households with more relatives in the village (kin ego network size) are more likely to participate in maize and other crop markets. Furthermore, unconditional on market participation, an increase in kin ego networks positively affects sales of other crops. With regards to friendship ego networks, households with more friends 1) have lower bean sales (conditional and unconditional on market participation), 2) are less likely to participate in maize markets, and 3) have lower maize sales (conditional and unconditional on market participation). Results for total ego network size also indicate that there are advantages and disadvantages to knowing more people as kin or friends. Total ego network size has a negative influence on bean sales (both conditional and unconditional on market participation), as well as a negative effect on maize market participation and maize sales (conditional and unconditional on market participation). With regards to other crops, knowing more people (total ego networks) positively affects participation in other crop markets and increases sales of other crops among the full sample (unconditional on market participation). \nOther notable results include household characteristics, farm characteristics as well as transaction costs. Age is an important determinant of the value of sales of beans, maize, and other crops. Conditional on market participation, age of the decision-maker displays a curvilinear relationship with sales of beans and other crops, whereas, unconditional on market participation, age of head has a curvilinear relationship with maize sales. The household composition variables are statistically significant predictors of agricultural marketing behavior with the only exception being the number of children (ages 14 or less). Households with a head in excellent/good health are less likely to market maize, but have greater bean and maize sales (among market participating households). Interestingly, unconditional on market participation, excellent/good health status increases bean sales but reduces maize sales. The negative effects of health on the full sample suggest that maize is marketed out of necessity (in difficult times) but is typically stored/consumed by the household. Farm characteristics are found to contribute to the marketing behavior of agricultural households. The size of land available has a positive influence on bean market participation and, unconditional on market participation, also positively affects bean sales. Households able to rely on extension services are more likely to participate in bean markets and, unconditional on market participation, have greater bean sales. For maize, once the market participation decision has been made, accessibility of extension services increases maize sales. Of the fixed transaction costs, only education is a statistically significant predictor of the market participation decision. Results show that better educated decision-makers are more likely to participate in maize and other crop markets. Lastly, variable transaction costs are found to contribute to both the market participation decision and the value of sales. A greater distance to the nearest city/town increases the likelihood of bean market participation but reduces participation in markets for other crops. Furthermore, the distance variable positively affects bean sales and negatively affects sales of other goods (conditional and unconditional on market participation). The transportation variable indicates that ownership of a bicycle, motorcycle, or cart positively affects the likelihood of participation in other crop markets as well as positively affects the value of sales of bean and maize. \nRegarding implications for policy, results indicate that there are gender differences in access to off-farm work choices. Better educated women are less likely to access higher wage off-farm jobs (self-employment and non-farm wage labor). Therefore, it is important to have policies that will facilitate (better educated) women\u2019s access to higher wage jobs. Potentially, this may include access to credit and providing basic finance and managerial skills to promote self-employment ventures for women. With regards to social networks, results for Mozambican women indicate that friendship ego network size and total ego network size are important for accessing low wage work on others\u2019 farms but restrict access to higher wage non-farm labor. The results suggest that Mozambican women with larger friendship ego networks or larger total ego networks are negatively affected by social norms regarding their roles in the household. Economic empowerment programs for women could potentially change perceptions of women and their roles in the household as well as improve their off-farm work choices. Potentially, economic empowerment programs may include assistance in starting own businesses, accessing credit, as well as educating women with basic finance and managerial skills.\n\tWith regards to agricultural marketing, it is important to formulate policy conclusion based on the overall goal of the project: to improve food security through the development and diffusion of common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) bred to grow well in low phosphorous soils of Africa. Results suggest that, among market participating households, excellent/good health status increases sales, however,  it was shown (with regards to maize) that healthier decision-makers are less likely to participate in agricultural markets and more importantly, unconditional on market participation, an improvement in health would reduce (maize) sales. Therefore, in the long run, investments in health have the potential to decrease sales of (maize) surplus and promote greater household food security. Additionally, the introduction of the new bean seeds should be coupled with policies promoting greater access to land and extension services. Greater access to land for cultivation may potentially include helping smallholder farms secure land rights. On the other hand, greater access to extension services may include holding demonstrations and field days to educate more farmers at once on the new bean seeds as well as targeting extension service to organized groups. Likewise ownership of a bicycle, motorcycle, or cart reduced variable transaction costs and resulted in higher sales of agricultural goods. Assuming households are able to produce surplus beans, it is important to support bicycle distribution programs that potentially could lower variable transaction costs and increase household incomes from bean sales. Lastly, better connected households (total ego networks) had lower maize and bean sales but greater sales of other crops suggesting that information sharing and cooperation takes place for certain crop types. Therefore, it is important to promote membership in associations and other organized groups for specific crops that may help promote trust, as well as to reduce search and transaction costs. With regards to kin ego networks, households with stronger social ties (kin ego network) were more likely to participate in maize and other crop markets as well as to report greater sales of other crops. The positive effect of kin ego networks indicates the importance of social support mechanisms for participation in agricultural markets. Therefore, programs supporting smallholder farmers market participation should mimic support mechanisms of kin networks to remove the risks associated with market participation (i.e., provide timely and accurate market information, provide assistance when faced with crises, etc.). \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9252], "author_name_tesi": "Sevilla, Luis Eduardo", "last_name_ssi": "Sevilla", "middle_name_ssi": "Eduardo", "first_name_ssi": "Luis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis", "Ann Rachel Tickamyer", "David Gerard Abler", "Stephan J Goetz", "Gary King", "Rhonda Belue"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jill Leslie Findeis, Dissertation Advisor", "Ann Rachel Tickamyer, Committee Chair", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Member", "Gary King, Committee Member", "Rhonda Belue, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Social networks", "off-farm labor", "off-farm work choices", "agricultural marketing behavior", "Mozambique"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Seismic velocity variations under island arcs: examples from the Philippines and Montserrat (Lesser Antilles)\n\n", "id": "10285", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6510", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Island arcs are geologically active and important structures. From a short-term perspective, they are a major source of seismic and volcanic hazards. From a longer-term perspective, arc processes are most likely a key component in the production of continental lithosphere. They are also the focus of numerous Geoscience investigations. In this thesis I investigate the seismic structure of island arcs at a regional (hundreds of kilometer) and a local (10's of km) scale. My goal in this work is to contribute to our efforts to understand the origin and evolution of these geologically important structures. I focus seismic imaging methods on two regions, the Philippine Island region and the northern Lesser Antilles island of Montserrat.\nThe Philippine Island Arc (PIA) is commonly regarded as a complex structure in which subduction zones border its sides and the intra-arc, sinistral Philippine Fault System transects throughout its length. The arc is seismically active and volcanic activity spans almost the entire arc. While several studies provide a wealth of information on the tectonic and the geodynamic settings of PIA, few have looked carefully into the subsurface because they were limited by the availability of digital seismic data. For this reason, important data gaps exist, in particular the details of the subsurface seismic velocity structure. The recent deployments of relatively dense digital seismic stations offer an opportunity to conduct a detailed study on the arc's velocity structure. Data from this new seismic network are used to determine the three-dimensional (3-D) velocity structure of the PIA by applying the P\u2013wave travel time tomography. \nA broad distribution of source depths and the arc-wide distribution of seismic stations allow tomographic imaging of structures down to 450 km depth with spatial resolution of about ~50 km resolution. The prominent features of the tomographic images include the low velocity zones correlating with the overlying volcanic structures and high velocity zones that more or less coincide with the Wadati-Benioff zones of the subduction zones. The slabs are imaged as 2\u20136% faster than the mantle velocity values of the IASP91 model. They commonly extend deeper than the seismicity suggesting that they penetrate aseismically to greater depths. Shallow low-velocity anomalies correlate with the fore-arc and intra-arc basins, in the mantle wedge at the top of the slabs, deep in the upper mantle, as well as the segments of the Philippine Fault Zones. \nImages of island arc structure are generally limited to the high, narrow frequency bands employed in active-source seismic experiments or smoothed over substantially in low-frequency global and regional tomography. A second focus of the work in this thesis is the imaging the regional\u2013 and local\u2013scale structure of an active arc, the island of Montserrat, located in the northern Lesser Antilles arc. I use receiver functions and local-earthquake generated P-wave arrival times to estimate the first-order subsurface seismic structure in the vicinity of the island. The receiver functions provide information on the first-order shear velocity and Poisson's ratio of the crust. Although the precise sharpness of the crust-mantle transition is not resolved, this study can limit its thickness to less than ~4 km. The estimated mean crustal thickness of ~30 km and the observations suggest that the crust may be slightly thinner northwest of the island (~26\u201330 km) than it is to the south (~30\u201334 km). The high P\u2013wave speed and Poisson's ratio indicate a generally mafic lower crust, with rocks of intermediate composition not precluded in the upper part of the lower crust. We did not find evidence for a thick high-speed lower crust (>7.4 km/s) as has been inferred in some other arcs. P-wave travel times are used to image the upper crust of the island, which includes the actively erupting Soufri\u00e8re Hills Volcano. As with many studies of the island, imaging deeper than about 5\u2013to\u20136 km beneath the volcano is very difficult because of limited ray coverage at depth. The earthquake-produced travel times primarily sample and illuminate the low-velocity upper regions of the island. The results are generally consistent with the results from recent active-source work imaging beneath the island.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6509], "author_name_tesi": "Sevilla, Winchelle Ian ", "last_name_ssi": "Sevilla", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Winchelle Ian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles James Ammon", "Charles James Ammon", "Maureen Feineman", "Barry Voight", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles James Ammon, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles James Ammon, Committee Chair", "Maureen Feineman, Committee Member", "Barry Voight, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["subduction zones", "Philippines", "Montserrat", "tomography", "receiver functions", "island arcs"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "movement Education: Pre-service Teachers' Perceptions Of Its Benefits And Their Competence In Integrating It Across The Curriculum   ", "id": "21099", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9719", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the pre-service teachers\u2019 (PT) perceptions about movement education, perceived benefits from participating in a 12-week movement education module, and confidence and competency to incorporate movement into curriculum after experiencing the module.

Sparse signal\nprocessing and representation is the outcome of this line of research which has many\napplications in information processing and has shown signi\fcant improvement in\nreal-world applications such as recovery, classi\fcation, clustering, super resolution,\netc. This vast influence of sparse signal processing in real-world problems raises\na signi\fcant need in developing novel sparse signal representation algorithms to\nobtain more robust systems. In such algorithms, a few open challenges remain in\n(a) efficiently posing sparsity on signals that can capture the structure of underlying\nsignal and (b) the design of tractable algorithms that can recover signals under\naforementioned sparse models.\nIn this dissertation, we try to view the signal recovery problem from these\nviewpoints. First, we address the sparse signal recovery problem from a Bayesian\nperspective where sparsity is enforced on reconstruction coefficients via probabilistic\npriors. In particular, we focus on a variant of spike and slab prior, which is\nknown to be the gold standard to encourage sparsity. The optimization problem resulting\nfrom this model has broad applicability in recovery and regression problems\nand is known to be a hard non-convex problem whose existing solutions involve\nsimplifying assumptions and/or relaxations. We propose an approach called Iterative\nConvex Refi\fnement (ICR) that aims to solve the aforementioned optimization\nproblem directly allowing for greater generality in the sparse structure. Essentially,\nICR solves a sequence of convex optimization problems such that sequence\nof solutions converges to a sub-optimal solution of the original hard optimization\nproblem. We propose two versions of our algorithm: (a) an unconstrained version,\nand (b) with a non-negativity constraint on sparse coefficients, which may be required\nin some real-world problems. Many signal processing problems in computer\nvision and recognition world can bene\ft from ICR. These include face recognition\nin surveillance applications, object detection and classi\fcation in the video, image\ncompression and recovery, image quality enhancement etc.\nOn the other hand, one of the most signi\fcant challenges in image processing\nis the enhancement of image quality. To address this challenge we aim to recover\nsignals by using the prior structural knowledge about them. In particular, we pose\nphysically meaningful probabilistic priors to promote sparsity on reconstruction\ncoefficients or design parameters of the problem. This has a variety of applications\nin signal and image processing including but not limited to regression, denoising,\ninverse problems, demosaicking and super-resolution. In particular, sparsity constrained\nsingle image super-resolution (SR) has been of much recent interest. A\ntypical approach involves sparsely representing patches in a low resolution input\nimage via a dictionary of example LR patches, and then using the coe\u000ecients of\nthis representation to generate the high-resolution output via an analogous HR\ndictionary.\nIn this dissertation, we propose extension of the SR problem which is twofold:\n(1) extension of sparsity-based SR problems to multiple color channels by taking\nprior knowledge about the color information into account. Edge similarities\namongst RGB color bands are exploited as cross-channel correlation constraints.\nThese additional constraints lead to a new optimization problem, which is not\neasily solvable; however, a tractable solution is proposed to solve it efficiently.\nMoreover, to fully exploit the complementary information among color channels, a\ndictionary learning method is also proposed speci\fcally to learn color dictionaries\nthat encourage edge similarities (2) Tackle the super-resolution problem from a\ndeep learning standpoint and provide deep network structures designed for superresolution.\nA step further in this line of research is to integrate sparsifying priors\ninto deep networks and investigate their impact on the performance especially in\nabsence of abundant training.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16199], "author_name_tesi": "Seyed Mousavi, Hojjat ", "last_name_ssi": "Seyed Mousavi", "first_name_ssi": "Hojjat", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vishal Monga", "Vishal Monga", "Robert Collins", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "William Evan Higgins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vishal Monga, Dissertation Advisor", "Vishal Monga, Committee Chair", "Robert Collins, Committee Member", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Member", "William Evan Higgins, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["image proccessing", "signal processing", "super resolution", "deep learning", "sparse coding", "sparssity", "optimization", "convex"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "FROM THE TEACHERS\u2019 EYES: AN ETNOGRAPHIC-CASE STUDY ON DEVELOPING MODELS OF INFORMAL FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS (IFA) AND UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGES TO EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION IN SCIENCE CLASSROOMS\n", "id": "11848", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "593", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The emphasis on socio-cultural theories of learning has required the understanding of multi-dimensional, dynamic and social nature of acquiring the scientific knowledge and practices.

The data of the study included (a) teachers\u2019 responses to history of teaching questionnaire (b) video and audio records of teachers\u2019 assessment practices during two different scientific projects (c) video and audio records of ethnographic interviews with teachers during their reflections on their practices, and (d) field notes taken by the researcher to understand the assessment culture of the school. The analytical tools from sociolinguistics (e.g., transcripts and event maps) were prepared and discourse analysis based in an ethnographic perspective was used to analyze the data. Moreover, Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) was also introduced as an alternative data analysis framework for understanding the role of division of labor among the elements of the community on the challenges and the outcomes of IFA practices. \nThe findings from the analysis of the classroom discourse showed three different types of IFA cycles: connected, non-connected, and repeating. The analysis of the teachers\u2019 reflections showed that the effectiveness of these cycles did not only depend on whether the cycles were connected, but also on other variables such as the phase of the lessons and student\u2019s identities and abilities. Teachers\u2019 reflections during researcher-teacher meetings on the concept and the aims of IFA improved through the use of academic literature on IFA and video-cases of their own practice. Teachers also reflected on the challenges for effective implementations of IFA and they emphasized challenges due to the division of labor among the classroom participants and the open nature of scientific knowledge. Through participation in the study, the teachers helped develop an IFA model for middle school science classrooms designed to capture the complex nature of teacher-student interaction. This model can be used for further analysis of IFA activity and professional development activities focused on assessment practices. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [590], "author_name_tesi": "Sezen, Asli ", "last_name_ssi": "Sezen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Asli", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gregory John Kelly", "Gregory John Kelly", "Carla Zembal Saul", "Hoi Kin Suen", "Susan G Strauss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gregory John Kelly, Dissertation Advisor", "Gregory John Kelly, Committee Chair", "Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Member", "Hoi Kin Suen, Committee Member", "Susan G Strauss, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["discourse analysis", "assessment", "science teacher education", "CHAT"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Interactions of the invasive thistle <i>Carduus nutans</i> and its biocontrol agent <i>Rhinocyllus conicus</i> in heterogeneous environments\n", "id": "7428", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7003", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<p>How herbivores locate and select their host plants is of fundamental importance in a variety of basic and applied ecological fields, including spatial population dynamics, invasive species management and biological control.

Weevils were more likely to leave small patches, and more likely to disperse to large patches. There was no significant effect of patch size and plant density on the number of weevils resighted per plant.</p>\n<p>Plant level characteristics, such as flower head diameter, plant height and total number of heads on a plant, were found to be important determinants of <i>R. conicus</i> oviposition response; no patch level characteristics were significant predictors of attack. In a related study, the effect of management practices, such as availability of plant resources, mowing, and abundance of the biocontrol agent <i>R. conicus</i> and their interaction on the oviposition response were also investigated. While an abundance of the biocontrol agent led to an increase in the number of eggs per flower head, this positive effect was eliminated by mowing. Fertilizer addition did not have an effect on <i>R. conicus</i> attack rates. As before, oviposition rates were found to increase significantly with flower head diameter, and there was a small positive effect of plant height.

The behavioral response of <i>R. conicus</i> to <i>C. nutans</i> olfactory cues in the presence or absence of feeding weevil conspecifics, and also to two key life stages, bolting plants and rosettes, were investigated. <i>Rhinocyllus conicus</i> showed a preference for bolting <i>C. nutans</i> both in the presence and absence of weevil conspecifics.</p> \n<p>Colonization and establishment of the insect herbivore relative to the patch dynamics of its host strongly determine the success or failure of biological control efforts. The thesis concludes with a model that explores the thistle - herbivore dynamics in a metapopulation context. This framework will allow the empirical results to be extrapolated to larger spatial and temporal scales. The results of the baseline model show that the proportion of the landscape occupied by <i>C. nutans</i> decreases in the presence of <i>R. conicus</i>, though it predicts a lower proportion of attacked patches of <i>C. nutans</i> than actually occurs in central Pennsylvania. This model does not yet take into account the detailed results of the empirical work in this thesis; however it is a useful starting point for exploring these issues at larger scales.</p> \n<p>In conclusion this thesis shows for the first time that <i>R. conicus</i> moves further than previously known, locates its host based on characteristics of the host patch, but oviposits in response to plant characteristics.

In fact, the contributions of vision to reaching accuracy were first described over a century ago in a seminal monograph by Woodworth (1899), which differentiated between the use of vision for planning and for on-line corrections. Today, this distinction remains a central issue in the study of sensory contributions to movement.  Some evidence has suggested that the differences in performance between limbs results from specialization of the dominant hemisphere for visual-mediated correction processes, although results from empirical studies are inconsistent.  Additionally, the way in which visual information is used for planning and on-line corrections, within a limb, remains largely unknown. Thus, the experiments presented in this dissertation were designed to 1) determine whether handedness emerges as a result of more efficient or faster visual feedback processing in the dominant hemisphere, 2) examine what aspects of visual error information mediate on-line corrections within a limb, and 3) investigate how sensory information that is detected during the course of motion is used to update planning of subsequent movements, as occurs during visual-motor adaptation.  The results of these experiments revealed that dominant arm performance advantages during reaching are not dependent on visual-mediated correction processes, but instead reflect the predictions of the \u201cdynamic dominance\u201d hypothesis.  This hypothesis proposes that the non-dominant and dominant limb/hemisphere systems have become specialized for controlling limb impedance and task dynamics, respectively.

From Kepler, we now have a population of \u223c4,700 planet candidates and \u223c 3000 eclipsing binaries with measured light curves, from which we can begin to characterize the distribution of stars and planets to tease out relationships between planet properties and host star properties in a robust statistical manner. The results of these investigations constrain proposed planet formation theories. This dissertation analyzes three particular sub-populations observed by Kepler that are well suited for hierarchical inference to characterize their population properties. First, we investigate the eccentricity distribution for a sample of short-period planet candidates from Kepler, where both the transit and occultation are observed for each system. This sub- sample lends a rare opportunity for tractable inference of its eccentricity distribution, exposing at least two populations within the eccentricity distribution and potential correlations of the eccentricity with host star metallicity and planet radius. Secondly, we investigate the mass-radius-eccentricity relation for a sample of near-resonant planet-pairs from Kepler. This study greatly improves upon previous research of constraining the mass-radius relation for small planets. Furthermore, we explore the period-eccentricity distribution of eclipsing binary stars from Kepler. We find that \u223c 72% of EBs below \u223c 11 days are very circularized, where as \u223c 87% of EBs above \u223c 11 days can take on a wide range in eccentricity values including some with significant eccentricities.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11430], "author_name_tesi": "Shabram, Megan Iris", "last_name_ssi": "Shabram", "middle_name_ssi": "Iris", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Ford", "Steinn Sigurdsson", "Ronald Lynn Gilliland", "Kevin Luhman", "Christopher Howard House"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Ford, Dissertation Advisor", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Committee Member", "Ronald Lynn Gilliland, Committee Member", "Kevin Luhman, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["exoplanets", "planet formation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Television as an Instrument of Social Change: Examining Involvement, Musical Performance, and Viewer Effects", "id": "21130", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9777", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using the entertainment-education (EE) perspective (Singhal & Rogers, 2004), this study examined the impact of entertainment television featuring social issues. The central question asked whether this content can lead to favorable attitudes, behavioral intentions, and helping behavior. Previous research has identified three possible mechanisms associated with EE effects: character, narrative, and emotional involvement (Murphy et al., 2011). Employing an experiment, involvement models were analyzed. Character involvement results revealed that identification predicted efficacy and behavioral intentions and that efficacy predicted behavioral intentions and behavior. Narrative involvement findings showed that transportation predicted decreased counterarguing and favorable empathic attitudes. Empathic attitudes led to behavioral intentions and behavior predicted empathic attitudes, decreased counterarguing, and behavioral intentions. Emotional involvement results revealed that elevation predicted behavioral intentions, positive feelings toward the focal group, and empathic attitudes. Furthermore, positive feelings predicted empathic attitudes and behavior, empathic attitudes predicted behavioral intentions, and behavioral intentions predicted behavior.\nAnother primary question concerned which involvement mechanism could best be attributed to the process of attitude and behavior change. With no clear distinction found, the involvement mechanisms and their subsequent variables were combined into an overarching EE model. When combined, elevation predicted behavioral intentions and transportation predicted decreased counterarguing and efficacy, but identification failed to have any impact. Empathic attitudes predicted behavioral intentions and decreased counterarguing predicted behavior. Efficacy, a significant component of the combined model, predicted behavioral intentions, behavior, and empathic attitudes.\nThe final question focused on understanding how music presentation plays a role within television content via the involvement mechanisms. Exposing participants to one of four types of music presentation (musical performance, original song, instrumental, or no music), results indicated that there was no overall effect for music presentation. However, when compared to the control condition, the music performance condition predicted identification, transportation, and elevation and the original song condition predicted transportation and elevation. Significant findings for the music presentation conditions were obtained in the combined model; however, the musical performance condition no longer predicted identification and the original song condition no longer predicted elevation.

Two distinct studies of translational diffusion were performed.  The first focuses on solutions prepared in 1-alkyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imde ionic liquids ([Prn1][Tf2N], n=3,4, and10) with quasi-spherical solutes, such as methane, ammonium, and tetramethylsilane.  The second study entails measurement of self-diffusion coefficients in homologous series of neat ionic liquids: 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, [CnC1im][Tf2N] and [(n-2)mCn-1C1im][Tf2N] n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.  The majority of the measurements of translational diffusion were carried out using a Bruker AV-III-850 NMR spectrometer with a Diff-30 probe with triple axis gradients using a longitudinal-eddy-current delay stimulated echo NMR pulse sequence.\n\t The Stokes-Einstein (SE) model is a starting point for understanding the solute diffusion coefficients measured.  While the SE model can often predict diffusion coefficients that are close to experimental values, there are several factors that can lead to deviations.  The primary simplification of this model is to treat the solvent as a structureless continuum, thereby implicitly assuming that the solute is much larger than the size of the solvent molecules.  Since ionic liquids are typically larger than conventional solvents, deviations from SE predictions are commonly observed for smaller solutes translating in ionic liquids.  In addition to size, intermolecular interactions between the solute and solvent hinder the diffusion, leading to deviations.  In the first translational diffusion study, charged and uncharged quasi-spherical solutes with various sizes were chosen to better understand deviations from SE predictions.  By selecting these types of probes, shape effects are minimized and any deviation would be attributed to the fiction coefficient of the solute.  The data collected here were important in verifying the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations of these same systems.  These simulations were able to provide new insight into the mechanisms of diffusion of small neutral and charged solutes in ionic liquids.\n\tTranslational diffusion experiments were also performed on two series of neat ionic liquids which differed in either having a linear or branched alkyl chain on the cation.  These liquids were provided by the Quitevis group from Texas Tech University.  From their findings, it was observed that ionic liquids with the same composition but different alkyl chain connectivity exhibited large deviations in viscosity at certain chain lengths, while other physical properties, such as density, remained consistent. The self-diffusion coefficients of the cations and anions of two homologous series of neat ionic liquids were investigated to determine if analogous behavior was observed when compared to the viscosity.    \n\tRotational diffusion studies analyzed dilute solutions of p-xylene-d10 (pXy0), 1,4-dimethylpyridinium-d7 hexafluorophosphate (DMPy+), and p-tolunitrile-d7 (CMBz\u00b5) in 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Im41][BF4]).  For rotational diffusion experiments, data were collected using the DPX-300 spectrometer with a broadband multinuclear probe in addition to the AV-III-850.  The pulse sequence used in these experiments was the inversion recovery for deuterium.\n\tDetermining rotational correlation times,\u03c4_c, from deuterium longitudinal relaxation, \u00acT1, is often oversimplified to the point of inaccuracy as a result of assuming exponential relaxation of rotational correlations.  Factors such as symmetry and structure lead to molecules possessing several unique rotations and thus rotational correlation functions will have much more complex functional forms.  In a previous study, correlation times for the rotational dynamics of benzene in ionic liquids were studied by fitting NMR data with the aid of MD simulations, eliminating the need for simplification.  In the present study, the same type of analysis was used to determine rotational correlation times for probes having similar size and shape, but very different solvent interactions. The goal was to investigate the effect intermolecular interactions have on rotational diffusion.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11096], "author_name_tesi": "Shadeck, Michael Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Shadeck", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Maroncelli", "Karl Todd Mueller", "William George Noid", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Maroncelli, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Todd Mueller, Thesis Advisor", "William George Noid, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Diffusion", "Ionic Liquids", "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance", "Translational Diffusion", "Rotational Diffusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EVERY CASE A SHEET OF MUSIC: A NEW METHOD OF VISUALIZING INFORMAL ACTIVITY POCKETS WITHIN THE SPATIAL ORDER OF HOME", "id": "14372aks5924", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14372", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Secondary transitional spaces play an important role in shaping the informal activity pockets at home, which will then make the experience of the built environment different from its primary functions.

This is however only possible if the main obstacle, the alkali silica reaction (ASR), is properly addressed and the ASR damage is mitigated.\nASR is a deleterious reaction that occurs between meta-stable silicate phases of aggregates and hydroxyl ions present in the pore solution of portland cement concrete. With the overall goal of developing effective methods to mitigate ASR in concrete containing recycled glass, the research objectives of this PhD study are: 1- To understand the mechanisms through which fly ash controls ASR in accelerated\nmortar bar test (AMBT). 2- To investigate the beneficial effects of high alkali content glass powder towards ASR mitigation and elucidate the underlying ASR controlling mechanisms in AMBT 3- To perform a preliminary study of the feasibility of using Al(OH)3 as a cement replacement to control ASR. As one potential mechanism, the effect of Al on the dissolution rate of glass aggregates in alkaline solutions is further researched. To achieve the first objective, a series of experiments were designed to assess different potential ASR mitigation mechanisms with the aid of computer modeling coupled with advanced material characterization techniques. Various properties (e.g., pore solution composition, ion diffusion coefficient,\npore size distribution, strength, ASR gel production and its composition) of mortars with the minimum required fly ash dosage were compared with 100% portland cement mortars. The findings revealed that fly ash mainly reduces the ASR expansion of mortars, by reducing the rate of ingress of the attacking hydroxyl ions from the external alkali bath. This was linked to the pore refinement occurred due to pozzolanic reaction of fly ash. With a numerical study, simulating the adsorption of alkalis by cement hydration products as a sink term, it was shown that alkali binding was also effective. Application of fly ash increased tensile strength of the mortars and thus, could enhance their resistance against cracking. Variation in ASR gel composition and alkali dilution were found to have minor effect in AMBT conditions. Finally, a new mechanism was introduced and validated in which fly ash to reduce ASR by\nrepressing the dissolution rate of silicate aggregates which occurs due to reduction of the effective hydroxyl ion to aggregate surface ratio. To achieve the second research objective, four types of glass powder (GP) with different sizes were experimented in AMBT. An approximately linear relationship was obtained between GP size and the required dosage to mitigate ASR. A set of material characterization techniques was designed to shed light\non the ASR suppressing effects of GP. The findings revealed that cement replacement by glass powder leads to a decrease in the pH of the pore solution even if alkalis are released from the glass powder. Based on charge balance, it was speculated that some alkalis were present in non-ionic form which do not increase the pore solution\u2019s pH and promote ASR. Application of glass powder leads to a significant reduction in the rate of ion transport from the external bath. During the test, portlandite content of GP\nmortar decreased due to the pozzolanic reaction which led to a reduction in the average pore size of the binder phase of GP mortar. GP enhanced the tensile strength of the mortars which could be beneficial in ASR mitigation.\nFinally, to achieve the third research objective, the replacement of 20% weight of cement with Al(OH)3 powder was shown to suppress ASR expansion during ASTM C1260 test. The study was then focused on one possible mechanism through which Al(OH)3 can mitigate ASR. The effect of soluble Al on the rate of silicate glass dissolution, at high pH was studied. Corrosion of glass slides in alkaline solutions\nsignificantly decreased in presence of Al in the solution. The cause of this phenomenon was further investigated and related to formation of a semi-crystalline Al-Si (zeolite) layer at the surface of glass slides as well as Al-poisoning of silica surface. Based on experimental results, it is speculated that the latter mechanism is more significant in reducing glass dissolution rate and the protective action of the zeolite layer is likely to be less effective. The presence of sufficient dissolved Al was found to be essential for minimizing the dissolution rate of silicate glass.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8058], "author_name_tesi": "Shafaatian, Seyedmohammadhadi ", "last_name_ssi": "Shafaatian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seyedmohammadhadi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farshad Rajabipour", "William D Burgos", "Carlo G Pantano", "Barry Earl Scheetz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farshad Rajabipour, Dissertation Advisor", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member", "Barry Earl Scheetz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Concrete", "Alkali-Silica Reaction", "Glass", "Recycle"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Creature Comforts: The Exchange and Consumption of Sugar, Tobacco, and other Everyday Stimulants during the Great War", "id": "23651", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "10732", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project explores the mobilization efforts undertaken during the First World War in their broadest sense.

In these applications, where space is at a premium, DMFCs are seen as a good fit, due in large part to the high theoretical energy density of DMFCs, directly related to the liquid nature of methanol fuel. However, DMFCs suffer from a practical energy density far lower than the theoretical value. A significant factor leading to this discrepancy is the inability of DMFCs to directly and efficiently use concentrated fuel. Because methanol and water react on a one-to-one molar basis in the methanol oxidation reaction in the anode, and because three moles of water are produced by the oxygen reduction reaction in the cathode for every one mole consumed in the anode, fuel (methanol) and water management are intricately tied together. In the work presented, a 1D, two-phase computational model is used to first explain fundamentally this intricate coupling between fuel and water management, and specifically how it relates to proper membrane electrode assembly (MEA) design. Next, a theoretical explanation is given as to how the inclusion of a hydrophobic anode micro-porous layer (MPL) is effective in reducing water crossover to the cathode, which is a prerequisite for the use of more highly concentrated fuel. Following this, a novel MEA design is described, incorporating an anode transport barrier, which in conjunction with the anode MPL facilitates the direct and efficient use of concentrated methanol fuel.

With the rising popularity of peer-to-peer platforms such as Uber and AirBnB within the past decade, the present research provides preliminary evidence of a reversed endowment effect within peer-to-peer rentals. In two studies presented in this thesis, we present evidence that this reversal is driven at least in part by a unique lack of psychological loss for those renting out their possessions as compared to those selling their possessions. Further and contrary to our predictions, we find that Exchange Providers, those who own a possession with the sole purpose of renting it out to make money, exhibit higher price valuations for their possessions than Co-Consumption Providers, individuals who both personally use their possession as well as rent it out to make money. Together, this research contributes not only to literature on the endowment effect, but also adds much needed clarity to our growing understanding of peer-to-peer renting.

For wildlife this has meant loss of connectivity of previously continuous habitat. Countries and private entities have employed a number of different strategies in order to set aside and create habitat for its animal populations. With the international prominence given wildlife conservation in sub-Saharan Africa, private landowners have been increasingly managing their lands as wildlife habitat, in essence setting up private reserves which are used either for consumptive or non-consumptive tourism.\n\nThis thesis examines ecological change in and around the first private game reserve in Tanzania, how the surrounding communities perceive these changes, and the current state of the relationship between the reserve and the communities. This is a unique examination because there have been no studies into the community dynamics that surround private conservation in Tanzania and indeed, very few studies have deeply examined this topic in sub-Saharan Africa more broadly.\n\nLand cover and change was assessed via remote sensing, repeat vegetation sampling (plot & transect), repeat photography, and key informant interviews. Community perceptions were assessed through focus group discussions, semi-structured interviews, and ethnography.\n\nLand cover of the ranch was determined to be a mix of dry savanna grassland and woodland, with biomass having rebounded after widespread previous disturbance episodes, but still experiencing signs of ongoing disturbance. The land cover of the villages was found to be a mosaic of agriculture and mix of heavily grazed grassland and woodland. Community perceptions of the landscape were filtered through the lens of their respective livelihoods and revolved primarily around emphasizing the value of a \u201cproductive landscape.\u201d The definition of the productive landscape varied depending on the individual or group\u2019s primary livelihood system. The relationship between the ranch and the villages is one marked by misunderstandings and resentment, though there are hopeful areas where growth is occurring.\n\nAdditionally, this thesis seeks to contribute to current efforts to examine the theoretical and methodological space between land change science and political ecology, two subfields of geography. The study combined quantifiable ecological land change data with community narratives of land change as a way of building a more robust interdisciplinary understanding of how the landscape and community has changed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10850], "author_name_tesi": "Shaffner, Paul Walter", "last_name_ssi": "Shaffner", "middle_name_ssi": "Walter", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian King"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian King, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Africa", "Tanzania", "Kilimanjaro", "Ndarakwai", "Conservation", "Geography", "Political Ecology", "Land Change Science", "Dry Savanna", "Ecology"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Unsupervised Identification of Tissues in Zebrafish", "id": "28718", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12410", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project is a part of the medical imaging research going on at Hershey Medical \nCenter.

The decomposition studies were conducted using an existing confined rapid thermolysis chamber, to which the FTIR and ToFMS systems were interfaced to allow in situ measurements of the evolved gas-phase species. The evolved gas-phase species were also allowed to condense on a glass plate. This residue, as well as the residue that remained on the foil in the confined region, were pressed into KBr pellets and examined ex situ using FTIR transmission spectroscopy. The experiments were conducted in an inert environment at atmospheric pressure. Small quantities of the sample were subjected to heating rates of 2000 K/s. The energetic material of interest is triaminoguanidinium azotetrazolate (TAGzT). To understand its behavior, guanidinium azotetrazolate (GzT) was also examined. The decomposition of GzT and TAGzT begins within the azotetrazolate dianion, releasing nitrogen. GzT decomposition produces chain-branching reactions resulting in a nearly explosive event. Once the explosive event has occurred, the remaining products continue to release gaseous ammonia via secondary reactions. Decomposition of TAGzT on the other hand, occurs at a much slower rate than GzT and at lower temperatures. The early phase of TAGzT decomposition involves release of hydrazine, but it ends when the AzT dianion is completely consumed. The TAGzT decomposition produces the 5-azido-tetrazole as one of the major decomposition products, in addition to NH3 and N2.

LGL leukemia is characterized by accumulation of cytotoxic cells in blood and infiltration in bone marrow and other tissues.  Leukemic LGL could arise from expansion of either CD3+ CD8+ T-cells (T-cell LGL leukemia or T-LGL leukemia) or those arising from CD3- natural killer (NK)-cells (NK-cell LGL leukemia or NK-LGL leukemia).  LGL leukemia is a rare disorder consisting of less than 5% of non-B cell leukemia.  Clinically, LGL leukemia can manifest along a spectrum of disorders ranging from slowly progressing indolent disorder to an aggressive leukemia that could be fatal within months.  About fifty percent of LGL leukemia patients also present with variety of autoimmune conditions, rheumatoid arthritis being the most common one. \nNormally, following antigen clearance, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) become sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis resulting in activation-induced cell death (AICD).  In contrast, the leukemic LGLs are resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis.  It is believed that constitutively active survival signals keep leukemic LGLs alive in the face of functional Fas-apoptotic machinery.  Previously, constitutive activation of Jak-Stat signaling pathway, PI3k-Akt pathway, and Ras-Mek-Erk signaling pathways have been described in leukemic LGL.\nIn this study, we identified unique gene signature from PBMC of thirty LGL leukemia patients.  Pathway-based analysis of gene signature identified that sphingolipid metabolism and signaling are differentially regulated in leukemic LGL.  We also showed that unlike CD8+  cells from healthy donors, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor S1P5 (EDG8) is the predominant S1P-receptor (S1PR) leukemic LGL.  Disruption of balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic sphingolipids (also known as sphingolipid rheostat) leads to selective induction of apoptosis in leukemic LGL.  We further showed that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-mediated signaling induces resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis in normal activated PBMC.  On the other hand, inhibition of S1P-mediated signaling by FTY720 restored Fas-sensitivity in leukemic LGL.  Collectively these results suggest that S1P-S1P5 mediated signaling may contribute to abnormal survival of leukemic LGL that is mediated by G\u00e112 signaling.\nWe further investigated how FTY720 induced cell death in leukemic LGL.  FTY720 induced cell death in leukemic LGL that is insensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX) suggesting a role of G\u00e112/13-mediated signaling in survival of leukemic LGL.  FTY720-mediated cell death is independent of sodium orthovanadate or okadaic acid (OA) suggesting that FTY720 mediates cell death independent of phosphatases.  Our results indicate that FTY720-mediated cell death in leukemic LGL was independent of action of extrinsic- or intrinsic caspase cascades suggesting a possibility that FTY720 mediated apoptosis-like programmed cell death rather than classical apoptosis.  FTY720 damaged mitochondrial membrane prior to induction of cell death and downregulated MCL1 independent of STAT3 activity in one patient sample but not in others.  \nFTY720 is a novel immunomodulatory agent currently being evaluated for post renal transplant patients and in patients with autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis.  Recent work has identified its role as a novel antineoplastic drug as well.  Due to significant association of LGL leukemia with autoimmune conditions, it is possible that FTY720 may be of therapeutic benefit to these patients.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4424], "author_name_tesi": "Shah, Mithun Vinod", "last_name_ssi": "Shah", "middle_name_ssi": "Vinod", "first_name_ssi": "Mithun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Paul Loughran", "\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\"", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby", "Gary Alan Clawson", "Edward Joseph Gunther"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Paul Loughran, Dissertation Advisor", "\"Thomas P Loughran, Jr\", Committee Chair", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby, Committee Chair", "Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Member", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["SPHINGOLIPID", "LGL LEUKEMIA", "FTY720"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Formal Methods for Genomic Data Integration", "id": "6666", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4654", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The rapid growth of life sciences research and the associated literature over the past decade, the rapid expansion of biological databases, and invention of high throughput techniques that permit collection of data on many genes and proteins simultaneously have created an acute need for new computational tools to support the biologist in collecting, evaluating and integrating large amounts of information of many disparate kinds. This thesis presents methods for the representation, manipulation and conceptual integration of diverse biological data with prior biological knowledge to facilitate both, interpretation of data and evaluation of hypotheses.\n \nWe have developed a tool (called CLENCH) that assists in the interpretation of gene-lists resulting from microarray data analysis, by integrating and visualizing Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and transcription factor binding site information with gene expression data. During the development of CLENCH, it became evident that developing a unified framework for representing prior knowledge and information can increase our ability to integrate new data with existing knowledge.\n\nIn subsequent work, we developed the HyBrow (Hypothesis Browser) system as a prototype tool for designing hypotheses and evaluating them for consistency with existing knowledge. HyBrow consists of a conceptual framework with the ability to represent diverse biological information types, an ontology for describing biological processes at different levels of detail, a database to query information in the ontology, and programs to design, evaluate and revise hypotheses. We demonstrate the HyBrow prototype using the galactose gene network in Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a test system.\n\nAlong with the increase in available information, knowledgebases, which provide structured descriptions of biological processes, are proliferating rapidly. In order to support computer-aided information integration tools like HyBrow, a knowledgebase should be trustworthy and it should structure information in a sufficiently expressive manner to represent biological systems at multiple scales. We extend and adapt the conceptual framework underlying HyBrow and use it to verify the trustworthiness and usefulness of the Reactome knowledgebase.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4620], "author_name_tesi": "Shah, Nigam ", "last_name_ssi": "Shah", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nigam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nina Fedoroff", "Mark Shriver", "Wojciech Makalowski", "Francesca Chiaromonte", "Gustavo A Stolovitzky"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nina Fedoroff, Committee Chair", "Mark Shriver, Committee Member", "Wojciech Makalowski, Committee Member", "Francesca Chiaromonte, Committee Member", "Gustavo A Stolovitzky, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microarray", "ontology", "modeling biological processes", "knowledgebases"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Using Hierarchical Bayesian Optimization to Learn and Exploit the Dependency Structures of Combinatorial Many-Objective Decision Problems", "id": "10650", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5110", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis analyzes multiobjective d-dimensional knapsack problems (MOd-KP) within a comparative analysis of three multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs): the &#949;-nondominated sorted genetic algorithm II (&#949;-NSGAII), the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm 2 (SPEA2) and the &#949;-nondominated hierarchical Bayesian optimization algorithm (&#949;-hBOA).

Performance of the &#949;-hBOA suggests that probabilistic model building evolutionary algorithms have significant promise for expanding the size and scope of challenging multiobjective problems that can be explored.\n\nA major benefit of the &#949;-hBOA is that while solving problems it provides users with interesting hypotheses on the controls and dependencies impacting their system's performance across many-objectives, simultaneously. Efficient methods of exploiting and presenting the statistical information captured in the &#949;-hBOA's Bayesian network models has significant potential to enhance the formulation and solution of environmental monitoring problems. This thesis explores the conditional dependency structure of one such environmental monitoring problem and provides interesting hypotheses on the relationships and controls impacting how alternative sampling strategies can attain near optimal tradeoffs. The thesis contributes a visualization framework to understand the value of information within the evolving Bayesian networks and presents a significant contribution towards ambitions in the fields of machine learning, optimization, and artificial intelligence. The comprehensive analysis of the Bayesian networks provides the potential for advancing our observational hypotheses while simultaneously helping to overcome the computational barriers limiting our use of Pareto efficiency as an integrated measure of the value of information when designing environmental observation networks.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5084], "author_name_tesi": "Shah, Ruchit Aswin", "last_name_ssi": "Shah", "middle_name_ssi": "Aswin", "first_name_ssi": "Ruchit", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Patrick Reed", "Patrick M Reed", "Timothy William Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Patrick Reed, Thesis Advisor", "Patrick M Reed, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Combinatorial optimization", "Multiobjective optimization", "Knapsack problem", "Probabilistic model building evolutionary algorith", "Hierarchical Bayesian networks", "Visual Analytics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Microsatellites as inducers of genome instability:  Studies into the mechanisms of replication and repair of repetitive DNA\n", "id": "10468", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5727", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Genomic instability is a hallmark of tumor initiation and progression.  A tumor genome can contain both gross chromosomal alterations as well as multiple submicroscopic nucleotide changes.  Indeed, it is well established that multiple mutations are necessary for a cell to become tumorigenic.  In this dissertation, I have studied two major cellular processes that, under normal circumstances, largely suppress the initial events that favor these alterations.  These two processes are DNA replication, which duplicates the genome in order to fully distribute all genetic information to two daughter cells, and DNA mismatch repair, which corrects a subset of errors that occur during replication.  \n\nDNA replication is an extremely accurate process where, on average, mutations occur once every 109-1010 base pairs during cell division.  The central proteins for replication are DNA polymerases which travel along the template DNA while extending nascent DNA by nucleotide addition.  While the vast majority of DNA is in the right-handed double helix form, many other conformations can exist within particular sequence arrangements.  These non-canonical structures can impede the polymerase and stall replication until secondary mechanisms restart the process.  Specific chromosomal areas have been found that are especially prone to replicative stress.  These areas, termed common fragile sites (CFS), exhibit chromosomal gaps and breaks during replicative challenge and may represent a mechanism for initiating genomic instability.  Chromosomal breaks are a prerequisite for alterations such as translocations, large deletions, and amplifications found in advanced tumor cells.  CFS are also among the last regions to be replicated during culture of healthy untreated cells.  Studies have determined that the majority of CFS are AT rich, a property believed to cause increased torsional stress and DNA secondary structure formation.  This finding has lead to the hypothesis that CFS expression (breakage) may be due, in part, to stalling of the polymerase complex.  \n\nAlthough DNA replication is a very accurate process on average, certain regions \u2013 e.g., microsatellites \u2013 have a very high error rate.  Microsatellites are short, repetitive elements in the DNA consisting of 1-6 bases per repeat unit.  The repetitive nature of these sequences can provoke length alterations due to strand slippage events during replication.  The human DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, a specialized repair mechanism, plays a major role in post-replicative repair of DNA polymerization errors.  Loss of this pathway results in hereditary cancers characterized by microsatellite instability.\n\nIn this dissertation, I first describe our studies of hPMS2, a component of MMR, and observe its role in error correction of mono-, di-, and tetranucleotide repeat motifs.  Alterations at mono- and dinucleotide microsatellites have been extensively used to diagnose hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, while tetranucleotide microsatellites have been utilized for the detection of another, mechanistically different type of instability termed EMAST.  While microsatellite alterations may be a general consequence of genomic instability post tumor initiation, they may also directly promote tumor progression.  Using a shuttle vector assay in human cells, I determined that the mutation rate of vectors containing [G/C]10 or [GT/CA]10 alleles was elevated 20-fold to 40-fold in hPMS2-deficient cells, relative to an hPMS2-expressing cell line.  In contrast, a 6-fold or 12-fold relative mutation rate increase was observed in [TTTC/AAAG]9 and [TTCC/AAGG]9-containing vectors, respectively.  These data demonstrate that the corrective ability of the MMR complex containing PMS2 is more protective of tetranucleotide expansions than deletions.  hPMS2 also displays a sequence bias, wherein [TTCC/AAGG] sequences are stabilized to a greater extent than [TTTC/AAAG].  These results have the potential to add greater accuracy to microsatellite panels used for cancer diagnosis by the addition of highly mutable alleles.\n\nIn chapter 3, I focus on the mechanism of CFS expression by determining sequence specific effects on polymerase progression.  I have chosen to study DNA polymerase delta (pol &#948;) as it is suggested to be primarily involved in lagging strand synthesis, and secondary structure formation is more likely on the lagging strand, since the DNA is more often single stranded.  I have also extended these findings by studying the DNA polymerase alpha-primase complex due to its emerging role in synchronizing leading/lagging strand synthesis as well as checkpoint signaling upon fork arrest.  Using in vitro primer extension assays, I found that specific cis-acting sequence elements perturb DNA elongation, causing inconsistent DNA synthesis rates between regions on the same strand and between complementary strands. Both polymerases were significantly inhibited in regions containing hairpins and microsatellites, [AT/TA]24 and [A/T]19-28, compared with a control region with minimal secondary structure.  In cell-free extracts, stalling was eliminated at smaller hairpins, but persisted in larger hairpins and microsatellites. These data support a model whereby CFS expression during cellular stress is due to a combination of factors, including the density of specific DNA secondary structures within a genomic region and asymmetric rates of strand synthesis.\n\nFinally, I describe the ability of the Werner helicase to aid polymerase progression and prevent polymerase stalling within CFS.  Since WRN contains multiple enzymatic activities and has been shown to be necessary for preventing chromosomal breaks within CFS, I sought to determine whether WRN aids CFS replication simply by unwinding DNA secondary structure or through an alternate pathway.  Using defined WRN fragments, I conclude that WRN can enhance pol &#948; processivity with and without functional helicase activity possibly as a result of direct binding and stimulation of the polymerase/PCNA complex.\n\nOverall, the work described in this dissertation offers novel insight into the role of microsatellites as predeterminants of cancer.  The significance of microsatellites within inherently unstable genomic areas was elucidated and a potential mechanism that assists replication within these areas was discovered.  The use of this information has vast therapeutic potential, including the induction of instability in cancer cells or modification of current gene therapy approaches to reduce negative side effects.   Finally, studies into the mechanisms that govern the maintenance and repair of microsatellites showed important repair biases that can be exploited for genetic counseling and cancer diagnosis.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5721], "author_name_tesi": "Shah, Sandeep ", "last_name_ssi": "Shah", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sandeep", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kristin Ann Eckert", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Gavin Peter Robertson", "Sergei A Grigoryev", "Leslie Joan Parent", "Lisa M Shantz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kristin Ann Eckert, Dissertation Advisor", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Chair", "Gavin Peter Robertson, Committee Member", "Sergei A Grigoryev, Committee Member", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["primer extension", "polymerase", "WRN", "replication", "FRA16D", "PMS2", "Mismatch Repair", "Fragile sites", "HNPCC", "mutation bias"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "One Year versus Two Years of an Enhanced Preschool Program: Impact on Academic and Cognitive Outcomes through Third Grade\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9700", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2212", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A large body of evidence indicates the positive influence of preschool programming on child outcomes. However, few studies have examined the impact of attending one versus two years of preschool on children\u2019s academic achievement and executive function (EF) skills even though such investigations could inform public policy and help dispense scarce resources in an efficient manner. This study assessed the differential benefit of attending one versus two years of an enhanced preschool program in Pennsylvania\u2019s Harrisburg School District on 339 disadvantaged children\u2019s academic (receptive vocabulary, reading and math) and EF (working memory and set-shifting) outcomes through third grade. As this study was quasi-experimental, propensity score modeling was utilized to control for selection biases between the two groups. \nIntercept differences from multi-level growth curve modeling (accounting for nesting by preschool classroom) revealed that two year attendees scored significantly higher on measures assessing reading at first grade, math at first and second grade and receptive vocabulary at first, second and third grade. On EF measures, two year attendees performed significantly better on measures assessing working memory at first and second grade and set-shifting at first, second and third grade. Multi-level growth curve models also indicated that two year attendees demonstrated better school readiness at kindergarten on all academic measures and differences in the slope revealed that they maintained this advantage until third grade on reading and receptive vocabulary. For math, one year attendees grew at a slightly faster rate after kindergarten and \u2018caught up\u2019 to the scores of the two year attendees by third grade. For EF, two year attendees demonstrated significantly higher working memory and set-shifting at first grade and this advantage was maintained over time. Also, regardless of preschool dosage, both groups were performing either at or within one standard deviation of the normative mean in elementary school. \nResults from latent class growth models demonstrated that attending preschool for two years significantly reduced the likelihood of membership in low performing trajectories on receptive vocabulary, math, working memory and set-shifting; this indicates that attending this enhanced preschool program for two years was especially beneficial for those who were most at risk of poor performance. \nLogistic regression was used to assess the impact of preschool dosage on grade retention and receipt of special education services.  Combining these two sources assessing need for additional services, results demonstrated that two year attendees showed less need for additional services in elementary school; specifically, two year attendees were half as likely to be retained or to require special education services by third grade. \nIn summary, participating in two years of enhanced preschool had a positive influence on child outcomes through third grade indicating that providing two years of high-quality preschool to at-risk children could be one way to reduce the achievement gap for disadvantaged children.

Based on their biogenesis and functions, endogenous small RNAs can be divided into many categories and subcategories. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent the most well-annotated type of small RNAs that regulate gene expression via transcript cleavage or translational repression. However, MIRNAs only contribute to a minor fraction of all the expressed small RNAs in plants. Small RNA genes other than MIRNAs remain poorly annotated, which limits complete elucidation of their regulatory roles. Furthermore, inconsistent MIRNA discovery methodologies in published studies have resulted in widespread discrepancies among existing annotations. To address these issues, and to improve current understanding of small RNA gene functions, we developed robust methodologies for de novo annotation of plant small RNA genes. Our comprehensive small RNA loci discovery based on deep sequencing data and small RNA biogenesis patterns provided refinement of existing MIRNA annotations and their functions in the basal land plant Physcomitrella patens. We also identified numerous P. patens siRNA loci producing almost equal mixture of 23-24 nt small RNAs, confirming that the heterochromatic siRNA pathway is present in the bryophyte lineage. Our de novo annotation of small RNA genes in Amborella trichopoda, the basal-most lineage of flowering plants, revealed a striking predominance of lineage-specific, intronic 23-24 nt MIRNAs and hairpin RNAs that has not been reported in any plants so far. Most of these non-canonical MIRNAs lacked easily identifiable targets in the transcriptome, suggesting these may have functions other than sequence-dependent targeting. In the monocot rice, 24 nt long intronic miRNAs function in RNA dependent DNA methylation. It is possible that A. trichopoda 23-24 nt MIRNAs function in a similar way, and such non-canonical miRNA pathways may have been retained in specific lineages of flowering plants. At least 19 A. trichopoda miRNA families were broadly conserved across land plants, and most of these also had conserved targets. These findings confirmed the presence of all major small RNA gene classes in the basal lineage of flowering plants, as well as the existence of species-specific diversities in small RNA populations expressed in non-model plants. Finally, we explored the potential exchange of endogenous small RNAs between parasitic plants and their hosts. Parasitic plants intimately connect to their hosts through a specialized feeding organ called haustoria. Bidirectional exchange of thousands of mRNAs between the stem parasite C. campestris and its hosts have been previously reported. Host-induced gene silencing has also been shown in several parasitic species including Cuscuta and Triphysaria versicolor (root parasite). De novo annotation of small RNA genes from C. campestris - A. thaliana associations revealed an unprecedented abundance of 22 nt parasite miRNAs in the haustorial interface. Several of these interface-induced C. campestris miRNAs directed slicing of six host mRNAs and triggered secondary siRNA production specifically in interface. Among these targets, Botrytis Induced Kinase 1 (BIK1) encodes a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase and functions in in plant immunity. Another target, Sieve-Element-Occlusion-Related 1 (SEOR1) encodes a protein thought to be involved in sealing phloem sieve elements after wounding. Additionally, mRNAs encoding three auxin receptors, TIR1, AFB2, and AFB3 were targeted by a C. campestris miRNA and showed a unique pattern of secondary siRNA production in parasite-host interface. Such secondary siRNA production depended on host machinery for RNA interference. Growth of C. campestris on seor1 mutant significantly increased parasite biomass accumulation compared to wild type. Furthermore, interface-induced parasite miRNA-directed cleavage of host TIR1/AFB was also detected in C. campestris -N. benthamiana. Our findings thus confirm conserved trans-species targeting by C. campestris miRNAs across the haustorial interface, and the potential roles of these miRNAs as virulence factors in plant parasitism.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15999], "author_name_tesi": "Shahid, Saima ", "last_name_ssi": "Shahid", "first_name_ssi": "Saima", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Axtell", "Michael Axtell", "Claude Walker Depamphilis", "Gabriele Brigitte Monshausen", "Philip C.

However, inferior performance is frequently attained mainly due to the need for Garbage Collection (GC). GC in flash memory is the process of identifying and clearing the blocks of unneeded data to create space for the new data to be allocated. GC is a high-latency operation and once it is scheduled for service to a block of a plane in a flash chip, it can increase latency for later arriving I/O requests to the same plane. Apart from that, the consequent high latency also keep other planes of the same chip, that are not involved in this GC, idle for a long time.

Among different approaches that have been used to modify surface properties, plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition is discussed in this dissertation. This work focuses on adapting plasma polymer coating on the surface of micro- and nano-sized particles in a dry environment. Plasma deposited polymer on the surface of nanoparticles improves their physical and chemical properties, and also provides a barrier for encapsulation, protection, and also a source to attach new organic functional groups to change the chemistry of the surface. Another important achievement of this work is introducing a very novel condition to produce responsive particles in the plasma. Deposition process in plasma can be controlled by different parameters such as reactor pressure, hydrocarbon flow rate, and plasma generator power. Here, conditions to produce thin-films or synthesis of responsive nanoparticles are discussed.\n\nCore-shell nanostructures were synthesized by plasma deposition in a radio-frequency plasma reactor. Silica and KCl nanoparticles are encapsulated by deposition of isopropanol-based films of amorphous hydrogenated carbon. By controlling the deposition time, under constant deposition rate of 1 nm/min, particles are encapsulated in a layer of plasma polymer with thickness between 15 and 100 nm. Films are robust, chemically inert, and thermally stable up to 250 C. The permeability of the shells is determined by depositing films of various thickness onto KCl nanoparticles and monitoring the dissolution of the core in aqueous solution. The dissolution profile is characterized by an initial rapid release, followed by a slow release that lasts up to 30 days for the thickest films. The profile is analyzed by Fickian diffusion through a spherical matrix. We find that this model captures very accurately the entire release profile except for the first 12 hours during which, the dissolution rate is higher than that predicted by the model. The overall diffusion coefficient for the dissolution of KCl is 3*10^-21.\n\nWetting characteristics of nanoparticles are also tuned using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition technique. The plasma polymer coating impart the properties of the precursors used in the plasma technique, without the requirement for nanoparticle surface preparation. For a range of chosen precursors, the water contact angle of a sessile droplet on coated copper oxide nanoparticles is shown to vary from 54 to 76, 92, and 108 degrees. Stable suspensions of coated nanoparticles are fabricated and are studied to be used as nanofluids. These fluids that contain fine nanoparticles are widely used as heat transfer liquid because of their thermal conductivity enhancement due to the existence of the particles. Thermal conductivity of stable suspensions of silica and copper oxide is studied for different nanofluids with polar and non-polar solvents, oils and refrigerants, as their base fluid.\n\nHydrophobic coatings are tailored as a passivating thin-film for aluminum nanoparticles as well. Since they repel water, no thick oxide layer can form on their surfaces. Coated particles are kept in a harsh environment with high humidity and their aluminum content is measured using thermogravimetric analysis. Experimental data reveals that particles are protected against contamination and oxidation. Aluminum particles are the prime candidate as an additive to propellent, combustibles, and explosives due to their high enthalpy of combustion. Deposition of plasma polymer coating also improves their combustion by releasing high energy at elevated temperatures.\n\nHydrocarbon plasmas are known to produce particles and films consisting of cross-linked amorphous hydrogenated carbon. Here, we document the formation of liquid-like particles which subsequently solidify via a process that releases hydrogen and produces a solid microbubble with micron-size diameter, nanometer-size shell thickness, and high volume fraction, in excess of 90%. These materials are produced in a toluene plasma under conditions that promote low degree of cross-linking (low power, high pressure). Liquid-like droplets produced under these conditions are seen to blow up in TEM under irradiation by the electron beam and to produce solid bubbles with diameter of about 3 micrometers. The solid-to-liquid transformation is also observed under laser irradiation of sufficient power, as well as under heating. We present evidence that the formation of these microbubbles is due to solidification of the liquid-like precursor that is accompanied by release of hydrogen. This mechanism is confirmed by a simple model that provides quantitative description of the particle size before and after solidification.

Specifically the wetting behavior of a droplet on a grooved surface was studied in two different length scales: nano-scale simulation using molecular dynamics (MD) and macro-scale modeling by minimizing expressions for the free energies of various droplet wetting modes. The main advantage of our proposed model is that it accounts for pinning/de-pinning of the contact line at step edges, a feature that is not captured by the Cassie and Wenzel models.  We also accounted for the effects of gravity (via the Bond number) on various wetting configurations that can occur. Using free-energy minimization, we constructed phase diagrams depicting the dependence of the wetting modes (including the number of surface grooves involved in the wetting configuration) and their corresponding contact angles on the geometrical parameters characterizing the patterned surface.  In the limit of vanishing Bond number, the predicted wetting modes and contact angles become independent of drop size if the geometrical parameters are scaled with drop radius. To investigate the relevance of nanoscale simulations to wetting on macroscopic patterned surfaces, we employed MD to simulate the wetting of Lennard-Jones cylindrical droplets on surfaces patterned with grooves. Using a systematic surface parameter study, we found that, similar to macro-scale, the radius of the droplet is an appropriate length scale at nanoscale where the gravity does not play a significant role. Drop-size-independent wetting phase diagrams were constructed representing the possible equilibrium  wetting configurations of a droplet as a function of surface geometry. Unlike macroscopic model, MD simulations exhibit wetting-mode multiplicity in the regions neighboring wetting-mode boundaries predicted by the model. This is likely due to a large free-energy barrier separating wetting states. Using forward flux sampling, we quantified the rate of theses wetting transitions and the corresponding energy-barriers. Our results show that surface topology play a significant role in determining the kinetic and equilibrium wetting characteristics of the surfaces. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9130], "author_name_tesi": "Shahraz, Azar ", "last_name_ssi": "Shahraz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Azar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "Ali Borhan", "Richard Hogg", "Themis Matsoukas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Dissertation Advisor", "Ali Borhan, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Hogg, Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wetting", "molecular dynamics", "surface topology", "free-energy barrier", "forward flux sampling"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Spatial and Temporal Analysis of Renewable Power Generation Portfolios", "id": "15201mys5724", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15201", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The increase in renewable energy nameplate capacity has resulted in significant rise in net electricity generation from renewable sources. This increased renewable power penetration results in higher renewable integration cost. Since renewable generation technologies are weather dependent and their output cannot be predicted without uncertainty, the system operator needs to hold a larger portfolio of back-up power to maintain system reliability. One of the most common methods to address this drawback, is to spread wind turbines over space which tends to reduce output variability; this happens as distance between the turbines increases, the correlation between them decreases.\nIn this study we are interested in studying the variability of interconnected wind farms over different spatial and temporal scales. The focus is mainly on analyzing the benefits of aggregation of wind generators over multiple spatial and temporal scales. We will also study the benefits of hybrid wind and solar systems and quantify the benefits of such systems. First, we incorporate a variance minimizing algorithm that sequentially connects wind farms. Our aim is to find the relationship between geographical scale and variance minimizing number of wind farms over different temporal scales. Our results show that the number of wind farms required to achieve minimum output volatility grows with spatial scale of aggregation. Further, we find that optimizing wind farm deployment to achieve output variance minimization over one-time scale does not imply minimizing output variance over other time scales.\nFurther, we use the mean variance portfolio (MVP) theory to create optimal portfolios of wind and solar generators over various spatial and temporal scales. Our results indicate that using MVP will increase wind and solar capacity value. We observed that adding solar to wind portfolios will increase the capacity value of the portfolio and decrease portfolio risk. Creating portfolios in larger geographic areas and in regions with better renewable resources will decrease portfolio risk. \nFinally, we study the capacity value of wind and solar resources in electricity capacity markets. We consider different policy structures and analyze their benefits and shortcomings. A new measure is introduced that considers the spatial variability of wind and solar generators and has the potential to increase system reliability and generators\u2019 revenue from capacity markets.

For instance, production shortages, missed deadlines, delays in receiving and dispatch of shipments, and order changes are more or less ubiquitous. If service level requirements (SLR) are associated with the successful implementation of the plans, these discrepancies between the planned and the executed can be expensive. In the business world, SLRs such as fill rates, on time delivery, zero defects, are associated with the successful implementation of the plans-and the discrepancies are expensive. The causes of these discrepancies can be attributed to poor planning or execution, or the occurrence of unplanned \u201cevents\u201d-event management (EM) attempts to limit the losses incurred due to some of these \u201cevents\u201d categories. The intelligent sense-response approach for EM focuses on the control theoretic approach. \n\nConcepts developed within the realms of process control have proven that closed loop systems have superior performance in terms of maintaining the SLR and rejecting disturbances than the corresponding open loop systems. It is an extension of this concept, i.e., tighter integration between planning and execution through both feed forward and feedback mechanisms that the intelligent sense-response approach presented in this dissertation aims to exploit for performance enhancement of supply chains. Responding to the identified discrepancies is an important component of the proposed approach, and a bulk of this dissertation focuses on algorithms for efficient response. The rest of the dissertation focuses on the integration of the sensing capabilities that the supply chains are currently equipped with, with the proposed response mechanisms.\n\nThe first part of the dissertation proposes the aggregate high fidelity modeling (AHFM) approach for planning and replanning that provides evaluated responses to identified discrepancies with the objective of minimizing the losses as well as impact of the event on the SLRs of the system. AHFM aggregates the flexibility/redundancies that are available at various stages of planning and optimally assigns the resource/time from the aggregate pool to compensate the impact of the disturbance and problems. A solution approach for the AHFM approach, the computational complexity of which scales linearly or is polynomial is also presented. The second section of the dissertation discusses the integration of the AHFM approach with the sensing capabilities of the supply chain. \n\nThe formulation and solution of AHFM has been explored in several domains: manufacturing, air travel and food processing have been considered. Early investigation into these problem domains has yielded remarkable improvements in performance (up to 30% improvement in a discrete manufacturing environment, 84% improvement in process industries and up to 25% improvement in fleet scheduling). For the case study taken up for the IBM supply chain, the indicated improvements are of 27%. While these improvement percentages cannot be generalized for evaluating gains from implementing AHFM, the examples illustrate that at least in some cases, the magnitude of potential profits cannot be ignored-specially when this improvement comes at little extra cost. In addition, preliminary results of AHFM indicate that the technique yields feasible solution to problems that were considered infeasible.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4621], "author_name_tesi": "Shaikh, Nazrul Islam", "last_name_ssi": "Shaikh", "middle_name_ssi": "Islam", "first_name_ssi": "Nazrul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu", "Richard Allen Wysk", "Arvind Rangaswamy", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "Dr Gautam Natarajan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu, Committee Chair", "Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Member", "Arvind Rangaswamy, Committee Member", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Member", "Dr Gautam Natarajan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Production Planning", "Exception Analytics"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "How Female Faculty Negotiate the Tensions between Personal Aspirations and Socio-culturally Based Expectations in Academia ", "id": "28022", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12275", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined how female faculty in a university commission for women negotiate the tensions between personal career aspirations and socio-culturally based expectations in academia.

However, little is known about the relationship between the variations in weed management practices and the biodiversity of weedy species in organic agriculture.  Specifically, how does the spatial distribution and diversity of weedy species vary in relation to diversity in weed management practices?  Species identification, vegetative samples, and farmer interviews took place on 20 farms in southwestern Wisconsin to explore how the landscape structures spatial variation in weedy species and how weed management practices respond accordingly.  Southwestern Wisconsin, known as the driftless region, is an area of unglaciated hilly terrain with a high density of organic farms.  Because of the area\u2019s topography and landscaped diversity I hypothesize that weedy species would be spatially distributed according to environmental characteristics (e.g. soil type and moisture), as well as land uses (e.g. pasture vs. crop fields).  This study finds weed species distribution to be independent of environmental variables, but significantly correlated with field type (pasture vs. corn).  This difference may be inherent to the ecology of each field, but more significantly indicates the importance of management.  Further research on current weed management techniques and distribution of weedy species on organic farms will enable researchers, extension agents, certifiers, and others to better facilitate the transition to organic agriculture.  Successful transitions are paramount in light of continued growth of the organic sector in the U.S. and would not only help farmers produce higher yields (and therefore be economically viable), but also uphold the environmental and social-ecological goals of the organic movement.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [540], "author_name_tesi": "Shamey, Anna ", "last_name_ssi": "Shamey", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Stephen Zimmerer", "Karl Stephen Zimmerer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Stephen Zimmerer, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Stephen Zimmerer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["organic dairy", "weed species", "weed management", "Wisconsin"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ASSESSMENT OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS\u2019 RISK PERCEPTION AND VISUAL ATTENTION TO IMPROVE SAFETY IN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY", "id": "14422sqs6063", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14422", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recently, the construction industry has implemented different approaches to improve safety among construction workers, however; only a few of them have focused on human factors.

Emerging evidence has implicated PPARbeta in the regulation of cholesterol and glucose homeostasis, fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and heart, epithelial differentiation, skin and colon carcinogenesis. However, functional roles of the receptor in the liver remain elusive. Recent studies suggested that PPARbeta can potentiate liver toxicity by inducing hepatic stellate cell proliferation and fibrogenesis. On the other hand, it has been reported that PPARbeta attenuates liver toxicity induced by methionine-and-choline-deficient-diet and could also prevent hepatocarcinogenesis by inhibiting hepatic oval cell proliferation. Combined, the role of PPARbeta in liver toxicity remains to be thoroughly evaluated. Preliminary results on colon carcinogenesis from our laboratory identified a potential role of PPARbeta in attenuating azoxymethane (AOM)-induced liver toxicity, suggested by the formation of preneoplasic lesions in AOM-treated PPARbeta-null mouse livers but not in the wild-type. The current study examines the hypothesis that PPARbeta ameliorates chemically-induced hepatotoxicity in mice. When wild-type and PPARbeta-null mice were treated with the liver-specific toxicant carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), exacerbated liver toxicity as indicated by more pathological lesions, elevated serum ALT, hepatic TNFalpha and SMAalpha expression was found in PPARbeta-null mice by comparison to similarly-treated wild-type, suggesting that the receptor is protective against chemically-induced liver toxicity. cDNA microarray analysis identified a large number of  pro-inflammatory genes to be more induced by CCl4 in PPARbeta-null livers as compared to the wild-type. In addition, NF-kappaB activation was markedly augmented in response to CCl4 in the absence of PPARbeta, as measured by p65 immunohistochemical staining and NF-kappaB gel shift assay. These findings suggest that PPARbeta attenuates CCl4-induced liver toxicity by interfering with pro-inflammatory gene signaling, particularly NF-kappaB. Subsequently, the effect of ligand activation of PPARbeta on CCl4-induced liver toxicity was examined. Ligand activation of the receptor by a high-affinity ligand, GW0742 caused a significant down-regulation of serum ALT, hepatic TNFalpha and a few of NF-kappaB target genes in CCl4-treated wild-type mice but not in PPARbeta-null mice, suggesting that ligand activation of PPARbeta provides further protection against CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity. To better understand PPARbeta-mediated attenuation of liver toxicity on the cellular level, primary hepatocytes were isolated from wild-type and PPARbeta-null mouse livers, cultured with IL-1beta coupled with different concentrations of GW0742. The expression of mRNA encoding TNFalpha was considerably higher in PPARbeta-null primary hepatocytes as compared to the wild-type in response to IL-1beta, but was not influenced by GW0742 treatments. Subsequently, hepatic stellate cells were isolated from mouse livers of the two genotypes and studied in vitro. Cell proliferation was significantly enhanced in PPARbeta-null hepatic stellate cells by comparison to the wild-type, suggesting that the receptor inhibits hepatic stellate cell growth. However, ligand activation of PPARbeta failed to elicit any consistent effect on gene expression profile in hepatic stellate cells from either genotype. Collectively, this study provides the first piece of evidence that constitutive expression as well as ligand-activated PPARbeta attenuates chemically-induced liver toxicity. This occurs likely via the disruption of pro-inflammatory gene signaling by the receptor. Hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells do not seem to individually mediate the anti-toxic effects of PPARbeta, however the interaction between them as well as the role of other cell types in the liver needs to be determined. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6621], "author_name_tesi": "Shan, Weiwei ", "last_name_ssi": "Shan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Weiwei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Gary H Perdew", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Harriet C Isom"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member", "Harriet C Isom, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["liver toxicity", "inflammation", "peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta", "NF-kappaB signaling"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THERMAL AND VENTILATION PERFORMANCE OF COMBINED PASSIVE CHILLED BEAM \u2013 DISPLACEMENT VENTILATION SYSTEMS", "id": "14082wfs5093", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14082", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chilled beam systems provide sensible cooling in the occupied space using chilled water flowing through modular beams mounted to a ceiling.

The study results reveal that the thermal and ventilation performance can vary significantly with type of ventilation strategy, type of air supply diffuser, PCB cooling output and supply air temperature. However, arrangement of heat sources has a marginal effect on the performance of combined PCB-DV systems. With a PCB cooling output of 50% of the total cooling load and the supply air temperature of 19-20 \u2103, the combined PCB-DV system can achieve the best performance in terms of energy use, ventilation effectiveness, and occupant thermal comfort.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14235], "author_name_tesi": "Shan, Wenyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Shan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenyu", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donghyun Rim", "William P Bahnfleth", "James Freihaut"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donghyun Rim, Thesis Advisor", "William P Bahnfleth, Committee Member", "James Freihaut, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["air conditioning", "mixing ventilation", "displacement ventilation", "computational fluid dynamics", "ventilation effectiveness", "thermal comfort"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Flexible Matrix Composites: Dynamic Characterization, Modeling, and Potential for Driveshaft Applications\n", "id": "7258", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6785", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Flexible matrix composites (FMCs) utilize the high elongation capability of elastomers such as polyurethane to withstand large strains in the direction transverse to the fiber reinforcement while retaining strength and stiffness in the longitudinal direction.  FMCs are highly anisotropic and can therefore be tailored to achieve distinctive mechanical characteristics that are difficult to obtain using conventional rigid matrix composites.  In the current study, the potential of using an FMC to construct a flexurally-soft, torsionally-stiff driveshaft is examined.  The FMC selected for the current investigation is a carbon fiber/polyurethane matrix material system.  Both quasi-static and dynamic tests have been performed to characterize the properties of the FMC material.  By modeling viscoelastic FMC lamina properties with a fractional derivative approach, a novel damping model that accounts for the frequency and temperature dependence of the FMC material is developed.  This is the first time fractional derivative model has been applied to a fiber composite.  Good agreement between the damping model and experimental data for angle-ply tubes was obtained.  Based on the validated damping model, a self-heating model to predict the temperature increase caused by internal damping of a FMC shaft under misaligned rotation is also proposed.  A laboratory-scale, misaligned FMC shaft rotation test stand was built to validate the proposed model.  Good agreement is shown between the self-heating model predictions and experiment results.  This model can be valuable in the selection of constituent materials for FMCs and also in the design of FMC shafts.

Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are particularly promising because of the central role of silicon in semiconductor industry. SiNWs would allow device fabrication with high density and their high surface to volume ratio offers high sensitivity. In addition, the possible quantum confinement in SiNWs may further enhance device performances and open windows for exploiting fundamental properties. Intense researches have been carried out in SiNW growth and device fabrication. However, there are still challenges in SiNW growth controls, such as size, number, shape, position, orientation, and inter-wire spacings. To make devices from these SiNWs, post-growth processing steps are needed, such as SiNW collecting, picking, positioning, aligning, and assembling. Due to the extremely small size of SiNWs, there are also challenges in SiNW device fabrication.\n\nTo solve these challenges in both SiNW growth control and device fabrication, we introduced a novel self-assembling \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d approach. Our approach combined vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) nanowire growth mechanism and pre-fabricated nanochannel template. The VLS growth mechanism offers the ability of controlling nanowire size and shape by nanochannel templates. The pre-fabricated nanochannel template guides nanowire growth and offers good SiNW growth control. SiNWs and silicon nanoribbons (SiNRs) with different sizes have been successfully grown in our nanochannel templates. Characterizations on their size, shape, composition, and crystallinity of the SiNW/Rs have confirmed that our \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d approach offers good controls on crystalline SiNW/Rs size, shape, number, orientation, position, and inter-wire spacing. So our approach solved the challenges in SiNW growth control.\n\nOur grow-in-place approach also solved the challenges in SiNW device fabrication. We introduced two versions of nanochannel templates. The first one is the encapsulated/long nanochannel template. The nanochannels in these templates are long and SiNW/Rs grow inside these nanochannels. The grown SiNW/Rs are totally confined by the nanochannels, which offer total and precise control on SiNW growth. The electrodes can be built-in to the templates before SiNW growth. The growing SiNWs are self-positioned, self-assembled, and self-contacted with the built-in electrodes. After SiNW growth, SiNW devices are ready, without any post-growth processing and fabrication steps. The second one is the extruded/short nanochannel template. The nanochannels in these templates are short, only \u201cnurse\u201d the initial growth of SiNWs, and guide SiNW growth out of nanochannels. SiNWs are fixed by the extruded/short nanochannels for easy device fabrications. So there are no post-growth device fabrication difficulties. SiNW transistors have been successfully fabricated from our grow-in-place SiNWs. The transistors showed high performances with on/off ratio of 6 order of magnitude and subthreshold slope of 130 mV/dec. In addition, a new accumulation type transistor model and configuration were proposed to build device model and extract carrier mobility.\n\nAs a summary, our novel \u201cgrown-in-place\u201d approach allows us to produce self-assembled and self-positioned crystalline SiNW/R devices directly from a silicon precursor gas (e.g., SiH4), without any intervening silicon material formation or collection, positioning, assembling steps. Our approach offers a way to make size controllable, position-controllable, contacted nanowires in an environmentally safe way and to assemble the nanowires into rational device geometries. These templates can be an integral component of the final devices and can provide contacts, interconnects, and passivation/encapsulation. The approach results in self-assembly of the SiNW/Rs into interconnected devices without any \u201cpick-and-place\u201d or printing steps, thereby avoiding the most serious problems encountered in process control, assembly, contacting, and integration of SiNW/Rs for IC applications. The approach we have developed is also environmentally safe since the fabricated nanowires are always confined and only the exact number needed is fabricated. In addition, the application of our approach is not limited in SiNW growth control and transistor fabrication. Nanowires from other materials, such as Ge and ZnO2, and other devices, such as sensors, could also be developed from our grow-in-place approach.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6864], "author_name_tesi": "Shan, Yinghui ", "last_name_ssi": "Shan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yinghui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash", "S Ashok", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Osama O Awadelkarim", "Jian Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Joseph Fonash, Committee Chair", "S Ashok, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Grow-in-Place", "Self-assembling", "Transistor", "Silicon Nanowire", "Nanochannel Template"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "INTEGRATED BUSINESS PROCESS ADAPTATION: TOWARDS FRICTION-FREE BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS COLLABORATION\n", "id": "12308", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6995", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One key issue in process-aware E-commerce collaboration is the orchestration of business processes of multiple business partners throughout a supply chain network in an automated and seamless way. Since each partner has its own internal processes with different control flow structures and message interfaces, the real challenge lies in verifying the correctness of process collaboration, and reconciling conflicts in an automated manner to make collaboration successful. The purpose of business process adaptation is to mediate the communication between independent processes to overcome their mismatches and incompatibilities. This dissertation proposes a new framework and efficient algorithms for creating integrated adapters for business process composition. For the control flow adaptation, we propose a structural analysis of patterns which we show is more efficient than existing approaches. Furthermore, we propose algorithms based on message pair analysis and integer programming to create an optimal adapter in both synchronous and asynchronous communication. These algorithms are designed to handle more general cases involving M messages and N processes (M, N > 2). For message adaptation, we identify a set of extendible message adaptation patterns to solve typical message mismatches. Finally we show algorithms to integrate individual message adaptation patterns with control flow adapters to create a complete adapter for multiple processes. All algorithms were implemented in a Java-based prototype system, and results of validation test and performance experiments are reported.

Among numerous methodologies developed in the past few decades, transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation has been demonstrated as one of the most efficient methods. In this particular area, two directions of research can be found. One is the exploration of unsaturated prochiral molecules that can serve as hydrogenation substrates and produce important chiral product using current available catalysts. On the other hand, the continuous development of novel chiral ligands, usually phosphorus containing ligands, also plays a key role in improving the efficiency of this methodology. It is interesting to note that an important discovery in one direction can frequently promote the studies in the other. These two directions are also the main focuses of this dissertation. From chapter 2 to chapter 4, three kinds of challenging substrates were studied in transition metal-catalyzed hydrogenation reaction and important chiral products were obtained in good yields and selectivities. In chapter 2, A highly enantioselective synthesis of arylglycine derivatives through Rh-bisphosphine catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation is presented. The stable N-PMP protected &#945;-aryl imino esters were synthesized from the corresponding &#945;-ketoesters in high yields. Using a rhodium catalyst with an electron rich and rigid Rh-TangPhos, high ee values have been achieved in the hydrogenation of N-PMP protected &#945;-aryl imino esters. An efficient Pd-bisphosphine catalyzed hydrogenation of unfunctionalized N-tosylimines is presented in chapter 3. N-tosylimines could be synthesized from corresponding ketones exclusively in E configuration and readily served as substrates for asymmetric hydrogenation. Excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) and conversions (up to >99%) could be achieved when Pd(OCOCF3)2 complexed with an electron-rich rigid chiral bisphosphine, TangPhos, was employed. A variety of aromatic, aliphatic and cyclic chiral amines can be prepared from this methodology.  In chapter 4, two &#946;-receptor agonists (-)-denopamine and (-)-arbutamine were prepared in good yields and enantioselectivities via asymmetric hydrogenation of unprotected amino ketones for the first time using Rh catalysts bearing electron-rich phosphine ligands. A series of &#61537;-primary and secondary amino ketones were synthesized and hydrogenated to produce various 1,2-amino alcohols in good yields and enantioselectivies. This Rh-electron rich phosphine catalyzed asymmetric hyderogenation represents one of the most promising and convenient approaches to the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amino alcohols. Despite the high diversity of chiral phosphorus ligands and their great achievement on various transformations, most of them are extremely air sensitive. The tedious synthesis and handling procedures limit them from being widely used in industrial applications. Progress in the development of new generation of air stable secondary phosphine oxide (SPO) ligands is presented in chapter 5. A series of highly active and air stable SPO ligands were prepared and the preliminary results in transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation were reported.

This thesis dealt with the use of microfiltration (MF) for treatment and reuse of laundry wastewater. The most important issues with respect to laundry water reuse are treated water quality, membrane fouling, and cost and energy consumption. Only the first two of these issues were addressed in this thesis. This thesis was focused on developing methods to improve performance of the Army\u2019s full-scale Shower Water Reuse System (SWRS), specifically for treating and reusing laundry wastewater. The SWRS uses pretreatment with pre-filtration (15 \u03bcm steel mesh), MF (0.2 \u03bcm PVDF), reverse osmosis (RO), and Granular activated carbon (GAC). Based on the information from the Army and their contractors, the major problem in using the SWRS for laundry wastewater was fouling of the MF. Therefore the objectives were to investigate the effects of coagulants for improving MF performance and for removal of contaminants.\nCoagulation has been used prior to MF for decreasing membrane fouling, enhancing MF flux, and improving removal of contaminants. There are problems in employing conventional coagulants (e.g., alum and ferric chloride) for treating laundry wastewater due to the difficulties in achieving effective coagulation at high pH, high total suspended solids (TSS), and high chemical oxygen demand (COD). In particular, the very high doses of inorganic coagulants that are required for these water quality conditions result in voluminous sludge production, which is inappropriate prior to membrane treatment. As a result cationic polyelectrolytes were investigated.\nThe effects of different cationic polymers on laundry wastewater treatment were first investigated using batch coagulation/precipitation with sedimentation (without membrane filtration), evaluating Zeta Potential (ZP) changes and removal of COD, TSS, turbidity, and total phosphorus (TP). Subsequently, the influence of cationic polymers on MF performance was studied by measuring specific resistance and cake compressibility. Based on these initial experiments, a commercial poly-quaternary amine containing epichlorohydrin dimethylamine (Epi-DMA) was selected as the best polymer based on successful neutralization of contaminant charge and low specific resistance on polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) MF over a broad range of pH and coagulant dose. The initial experiments also demonstrated that Epi-DMA was effective for removal of contaminants\nV\nafter sedimentation, e.g., 63% of COD, 77% of TSS, 96% of turbidity, and 26% of TP were removed.\nSubsequent bench-scale experiments focused on evaluating the effects of Epi-DMA on reducing membrane fouling and increasing critical flux, defined as the maximum flux for which trans-membrane pressure (TMP) increased linearly with permeate flux. Epi-DMA coagulation significantly increased the critical flux from 50 L m-2h-1 for the raw sample to 510 L m-2h-1 for the charge neutralization (CN) condition. Epi-DMA additions also substantially decreased resistance to filtration over a broad range of coagulant doses, including doses less than 50% of that required for CN.\nThe effects of Epi-DMA on MF of laundry wastewater were further investigated by conducting multi-cycle tests with backwashing every 15 min. These bench-scale experiments were run at 50 L m-2h-1, which is a typical membrane flux used in full-scale MF operations. The multi-cycle experiments demonstrated that increases in the trans-membrane pressure (TMP) that occurred during each cycle were nearly eliminated by the backwash for under-dosing (UD) and CN conditions, but that TMP increases during over-dosing (OD) coagulation conditions were not eliminated during backwash.\nFinally, the use of Epi-DMA was tested on the full-scale SWRS, which was set up outside the Penn State laundry facility. The setup included two 3000 gal bladders. Laundry wastewater was pumped from the laundry facility into the bladders and Epi-DMA was introduced into the bladders prior to the pre-treatment. The effects on the down-stream membrane units were investigated. The tests were performed over a range of Epi-DMA doses including no coagulant, UD, CN, and OD. The tests demonstrated that negligible fouling of the MF occurred, but serious fouling was observed in the RO unit. Formation of inorganic precipitates was suspected as the main reason for RO failure. The full-scale MF without coagulant did not foul as much as the bench-scale MF experiments had indicated. This could have been due to more rigorous backwashing with the SWRS or due to retention of partially coagulated solids in the bladders despite inter-experiment flushing with tap water. Issues regarding MF and RO behavior in the full-scale SWRS are currently under investigation and some conclusions are reported in this thesis.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6634], "author_name_tesi": "Shang, Xia ", "last_name_ssi": "Shang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey", "Rachel Alice Brennan", "Fred Scott Cannon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian Dempsey, Thesis Advisor", "Rachel Alice Brennan, Thesis Advisor", "Fred Scott Cannon, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["water reuse", "laundry wastewater", "micro-filtration", "cationic polymer", "coagulation", "RO fouling"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development of an Optimized Lambert Problem Solver for Targeting Elliptical Orbits", "id": "17560", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8386", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis investigates the solution of Lambert\u2019s Problem for targets in elliptical orbits.

Water withdrawals and consumptive uses are increasing in the Susquehanna River Basin as a result of natural gas extraction activities, which has the potential to alter hydrologic conditions. Investigations of water withdrawal impacts on biological communities have been performed elsewhere, but remain largely understudied in the Susquehanna Basin.\nIn 2011 the natural gas industry accounted for 8.2 % of the total consumptive water use in the Susquehanna Basin. This percentage is far less than electrical generation (73.3 %), which is the top consumptive user in the Susquehanna Basin, but roughly equivalent to manufacturing and water supply operations (6.6 and 7.0 %, respectively). Twelve active natural gas industry water withdrawals were identified in three distinct stream types for this study. Analysis of daily water use data indicates actual water use is far below approved quantities. Additionally, withdrawals in large warm-water streams have been operating longer than withdrawals in mid-size coldwater and headwater streams, respectively. Further, withdrawals from headwater streams removed the largest proportion of water relative to streamflow. Fish and benthic macroinvertebrate community data were collected upstream and downstream of 12 active natural gas industry water withdrawals and three reference sites where no withdrawals were present in the watershed. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination plots of community abundance data revealed that for fish and macroinvertebrates, upstream and downstream sites on the same stream were more similar than upstream-upstream or downstream-downstream sites on different streams that were host to similar communities. Regression analysis showed that site-level variables (e.g., land use and drainage area) were more important than withdrawal metrics in explaining variation in fish and macroinvertebrate metrics previously shown to be sensitive to hydrologic alteration. Results suggested the threshold at which fish and macroinvertebrate communities lose resilience to hydrologic alteration has not yet been reached at study sites in the Susquehanna Basin, potentially due to relatively low withdrawal quantities and protective measures such as passby flow restrictions, which require water withdrawals to cease when flows drops below a predetermined low flow threshold.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8595], "author_name_tesi": "Shank, Matthew Kenneth", "last_name_ssi": "Shank", "middle_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Susquehanna River", "water withdrawal", "consumptive use", "fluvial specialist", "erosional", "natural gas industry", "mixed effect model"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "High Power Evaluation of Textured Piezoelectric Ceramics for SONAR Projectors", "id": "14640aqs6075", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14640", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Textured ceramics of the relaxor ferroelectric [(1-x)Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)-O3-xPbTiO3] (PMN-PT or PMNT) have shown piezoelectric properties suitable for high power SONAR projectors.

This work attempted to devise a set of experiments to quickly characterize the electromechanical performance of these materials in relevant devices in order to provide feedback to both the material developers and the user community. In this effort, the performance of textured PMNT and Manganese doped PMNT (Mn:PMNT) was compared to conventional lead zirconate titanate (PZT) ceramics.\nTwo primary transducer designs were investigated: the Langevin sandwich and the Tonpilz. Modeling was first carried out through the GiD-ATILA finite element software package to predict the transducer behavior in air and in water. Transducers were then fabricated using piezoelectric rings of dimensions specified by the modeling results. The Langevin sandwich transducers underwent a a series of preload and temperature tests, monitoring key electromechanical properties over a range of preload stresses and temperatures. Results from this experiment showed significantly reduced d33 (660pC/N for PMNT and 410pC/N for Mn:PMNT), lower k33 (0.38 for PMNT and <0.35 for Mn:PMNT), and increased resonance frequency shifts as a function of stress (>6% for PMNT and Mn:PMNT at 25MPa) compared to the modeling results.\nTonpilz transducers were fabricated and tested in air and in water using the anechoic test facility and high pressure test facility at the Applied Research Laboratory (ARL) at Pennsylvania State University. Small signal measurements in air showed similar poor electromechanical material properties for PMNT and Mn:PMNT as the sandwich transducers. Linearity and harmonic distortion measurements in water revealed reduced source levels, increased harmonic distortion, and unstable behavior at high drive levels both on and off resonance for PMNT and Mn:PMNT compared to modeled results. Isothermal measurements were made at 50 deg C and source levels were monitored as a function of duty cycle. PZT4 and PZT8 showed source levels greater than 5dB higher compared to PMNT and Mn:PMNT for all duty cycles measured. The primary cause for lower than expected performance from textured PMNT can be traced back to the increased PT composition and reduced texture fraction in the material (30% and 85%, respectively). This elevated PT concentration resulted in increased thermal instability at lower temperatures, resulting in domain reconfiguration and poorer electromechanical properties at the operating temperatures for these experiments. The reduced texture fraction decreased the piezoelectric response in PMNT, causing reductions in the expected source levels produced from the devices. The results found from this work suggest modifications need to be made to the PT composition and texture fraction in the textured materials in order to unlock the true potential for use in high power SONAR projectors. Despite these results, the method used to rapidly fabricate, test, and evaluate the performance of these SONAR projectors could be directly used to carry out similar device evaluations for different piezoelectric materials, providing rapid feedback to the material developers in order to optimize material properties for future studies of textured piezoelectric ceramics.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15748], "author_name_tesi": "Shankar, Arjun K", "last_name_ssi": "Shankar", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Arjun", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Joseph Meyer Jr.", "Russell Charles Burkhardt", "Stephen Thompson", "Daniel C Brown Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Joseph Meyer Jr., Thesis Advisor", "Russell Charles Burkhardt, Committee Member", "Stephen Thompson, Committee Member", "Daniel C Brown Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["SONAR", "Acoustics", "Underwater", "Textured", "Piezoelectric", "Ceramics", "High Power", "Projector", "Transducer", "Tonpilz", "Relaxor", "Langevin Sandwich", "PZT", "PMNT"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Effect of Architecture and Doping on the Photoelectrochemical Properties of Titania Nanotubes", "id": "7500", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3686", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "N-type nanocrystalline titania has attracted significant attention in the scientific community for its unique properties such as size quantization effects, large specific surface area and the possibility of large-scale use in high-efficiency semiconducting photo-electrochemical cells. While the nanocrystalline titania typically used in photoelectrochemical cells is prepared from a colloidal sol of nanoparticles, the titania nanotubes in the present study are robust immobilized structures grown anodically upright to form a compact self-organized non-particulate film. \n\nThis dissertation investigates the effect of the formation parameters such as the anodization potential, the concentration of water and fluoride species in the anodization electrolyte, the nature of the cation, the anodization temperature and the nature of the solvent used on the architecture of TiO2 nanotube arrays fabricated by anodization of a starting Ti foil in a fluoride ion containing electrolyte. By varying the nature of the anodization electrolyte, an unprecedented degree of control over the architecture of TiO2 nanotube arrays has been achieved. Nanotube arrays ranging from 0.1 \u00ecm to 100 \u00ecm in length, wall-thickness from 6 nm to 34 nm and pore diameters ranging from 12 nm to 250 nm were fabricated.  While the nanotube length in all-aqueous electrolytes is limited to less than 10 \u00ecm, nanotube lengths as great as 360 \u00ecm were obtained by employing organic solvents in conjunction with water.  The fast formation of very long high-aspect ratio TiO2 nanotubes in electrolytes containing formamide and ethylene glycol are considered in terms of a growth model.  It is suggested that faster high field ionic conduction through a thinner barrier layer is responsible for the higher growth rates observed in electrolytes containing formamide and ethylene glycol.  \n\nAlso examined are the photoelectrochemical properties that result as a consequence of the nanotubular architecture of TiO2. The magnitude of the anodic photocurrents obtained from the nanotube photoelectrodes under band-gap illumination are significantly higher than that reported for any other form of nanocrystalline titania.  Open circuit voltage decay experiments revealed that the electron recombination lifetimes in titania nanotube array photo-electrodes are superior to those in nanoparticulate electrodes of similar thickness and as a consequence, the nanotubular electrodes are expected to have superior charge collection efficiencies.  Under band-gap illumination, 30 \u00ecm long TiO2 nanotube array based photoanodes performed photo-assisted water splitting at an efficiency as high as 16.25 %.   Anionic doping of TiO2 nanotube arrays has been investigated as a technique to extend the photoresponse of titania into the visible region with emphasis on the carbon and nitrogen as dopants.  An electrochemical doping technique was successful in introducing a nitrogen doping level as high as 12 % with nitrogen occupying the photo-electrochemically useful substitutional sites in the TiO2 lattice instead of the more typical interstitial sites. \n\nThe nanotube arrays have an extremely large internal surface area compared to a planar surface.  TiO2 nanotube arrays 20 \u00ecm in length and with a pore diameter of 90 nm are found to have an internal surface area 3000 times that of a planar unstructured film.  Dye sensitized solar cells using different architectures and dyes have been constructed and photoconversion efficiencies as high as 6.9 % have been demonstrated.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3666], "author_name_tesi": "Shankar, Karthik ", "last_name_ssi": "Shankar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Karthik", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig A Grimes", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig A Grimes, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Photovoltaic", "Nanotubes", "Anodization", "Electrochemical", "formamide", "protophilic solvents", "solar cells", "dye sensitized", "photocatalyst", "quantum efficiency", "Incident Photon Conversion Efficiency", "Flame Annealing", "Anionic Doping", "Electron Transport in TiO2", "Open circuit voltage decay technique", "high surface area nanostructures", "ordered heterojunction"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Cavitation Modeling on the Automotive Torque Converter using Computational Fluid Dynamics with a Mixing Plane Approach", "id": "22407", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9051", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The automotive torque converter is a fluid coupling device used to transfer power, with multiplication of torque, from the engine to the transmission.

However, technology to form solution processed thin films has not kept pace with recent demands. The focus of this thesis is to study mist deposition as an alternate thin film deposition method for a broad range of applications with emphasis the deposition and on non-relief patterning of thin films. Three different classes of materials including enhanced metal organic decomposition dielectrics, small molecule organic solutions and inorganic nanocrystal quantum dot dispersions are investigated.\nDeposition kinetics of all the materials was studied first. Effects of process parameters, substrate surface properties and material properties on film morphology were studied. Results obtained indicate that evolution of surface charge on the substrate can impede or enhance the growth of the film laterally and vertically. Deposition time resulted in a linear growth in thickness for all the materials and smooth films. Electrical potential applied to the substrate was found to enhance deposition of the metal organic decomposition dielectrics and small molecule organic solutions while inhibiting film growth of the colloidal dispersions. Also, thickness of the deposited film was observed to scale directly with the material concentration. Deposition of CdSe nanocrystal quantum dots on polyethylsulfone (PES) flexible substrates was also demonstrated.\nElectrical properties of the small molecule organic solutions and the inorganic nanocrystal quantum dots were evaluated by fabricating light emitting diodes. Organic light emitting diodes fabricated using mist deposition emitted blue light with a maximum brightness of 3000 cd/m2 and luminous efficiency of 6.7 cd/A. Light emitting diodes fabricated with the inorganic nanocrystal quantum dots emitted red light at a maximum brightness of 1000 cd/m2 and a luminous efficiency of 1.5 cd/A. \nExperiments on patterning dielectric films by area selective deposition were carried out. Two approaches to patterning, first by utilizing the surface energy variations of the substrate materials and second by functionalizing the surface through the growth of a self assembled monolayer were investigated. Films were successfully patterned by both approaches. Results show that the ability of the precursor to form a dipole and the moisture content of the substrate surface are the two main drivers of area selective deposition for the first approach. In the latter approach, length of exposure of the self assembled monolayer to ultra violet light was found to determine patternability.\nNanocrystal quantum dot dispersions were patterned by deposition through a mechanical mask. The conductivity of the mask itself was found to be a factor for film deposition. Masks made of a polyamide insulating material allowed film deposition while conducting steel masks prevented deposition. Evaporation rate of the solvent in the liquid precursor distorts the shape of the intended pattern. A mechanism for explaining this effect is proposed. CdSe nanocrystal quantum dot arrays of square patterns of sides 500 \u00b5m and 200 \u00b5m were successfully mist deposited through a mechanical mask. Finally lines of widths 200 \u00b5m, 500 \u00b5m, 1000 \u00b5m, 1500 \u00b5m and length 0.75 mm were patterned using a polyamide mask on glass and PES flexible substrates.\nFinally a new mask was designed for future fabrication of nanocrystal quantum dot displays and recommendations for further studies are made.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3637], "author_name_tesi": "Shanmugasundaram, Karthikeyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Shanmugasundaram", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Karthikeyan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Jian Xu", "William Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Chair", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["selective deposition", "shadow mask patterning", "liquid precursor thin films", "solution processed thin films", "mist deposition", "quantum dot LED"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Algorithmic Approaches for Enhancing Speedup, Energy and Resiliency Measures of Sparse Scientific Computations", "id": "15740", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7932", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High performance computing systems have increasingly complex node and network architectures including non-uniform memory subsystems, heterogeneous processors and hierarchical interconnects. The performance of scientific applications that run on such systems depends on several factors including memory access pattern, memory bandwidth, load balancing and resiliency. Consequently, optimizing the performance of scientific applications for high performance computing systems is challenging. We seek to address this challenge for applications involving sparse scientific computations because such computations form the basis for solving many large-scale models of physical phenomena. In this thesis, we seek to understand the interplay between sparse scientific applications and hardware, and develop algorithmic approaches to improve performance measures and resiliency for sparse scientific computations.\n\nWe organize the thesis into two parts. The first part concerns developing algorithmic approaches to enhance the performance of sparse scientific computations and has two main contributions: (i) a new sparse matrix representation and a corresponding sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMV) algorithm that enhances performance of the SpMV operation and (ii) speedup-aware processor partitioning algorithms to manage sparse scientific workloads efficiently. The second part concerns analyzing the impact of transient errors on sparse scientific computing and developing a fault tolerant algorithm, and has two main results: (i) characterizing the impact of a single transient error on iterative methods and (ii) a new sparse checksum encoded algorithm-based fault tolerance technique for the preconditioned conjugate gradients method. \n\n\nIn Chapter 2, we focus on SpMV, which is at the heart of many scientific applications involving sparse linear system solution. We develop a new sparse matrix representation and a corresponding SpMV algorithm that exploits the dense substructures that are inherently present in many sparse matrices derived from partial differential equation models. We show that our SpMV algorithm reduces the total number of load operations and enhances locality in accesses to the vector, consequently, improving the SpMV performance on average by a third compared to the traditional compressed sparse row scheme on the Intel Nehalem processor. \n\n\nIn Chapter 3, we consider improving the performance sparse scientific workloads that are commonly executed on high performance computing systems. We observe many applications in such workloads do not scale linearly with the number of cores, providing diminishing gains in execution time for larger numbers of cores. For a workload comprising multiple such applications, it is beneficial from system perspective to reduce system energy consumption and decrease workload completion time. We develop speedup-aware processor partitioning algorithms that exploit individual application scaling features and optimize processor allocations per application. Our results indicate that the speedup-aware algorithms can reduce workload completion time by as much as half and decrease the total energy consumption of the workload by more than half on 128 cores of the Intel Nehalem processor, compared to executing each application within the workload on all 128 cores one after the other.\n\nIn Chapter 4, we analyze the impact of silent data corruption due to a single transient error on sparse scientific computations, in particular, on sparse linear system solution. Transient errors result in bit flips in memory and errors in logic circuit output, leaving the computing system state corrupt. We provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of a single transient error on sparse linear system solution. Our analysis indicates that a single transient error during an SpMV operation can corrupt the entire resultant vector in a relatively short sequence of SpMV operations. Furthermore, our evaluations show that execution time of sparse linear system solution could increase by a factor as high as 200 or more, in the event of a transient error. \n\nIn Chapter 5, we focus on enhancing the resiliency of sparse linear system solution. We develop a new sparse checksum encoded algorithm-based fault tolerance technique for the preconditioned conjugate gradients (PCG) method, a widely used method for sparse linear system solution. We prove that our technique detects a single error in all the key operations within the method, including SpMV, vector operations and the application of a preconditioner through sparse triangular solution, when the linear system has a coefficient matrix that is symmetric positive definite and strictly diagonally dominant. Additionally, the overheads of using our fault tolerance technique are low, eleven percent on average in the event of no error and three percent in the event of a single error within PCG, when compared to having no fault tolerance for the PCG method. \n\nOur thesis demonstrates an opportunity space to optimize sparse scientific applications for performance and resiliency on HPC systems. We develop new algorithmic formulations that enhance performance and resiliency of sparse scientific computations. Looking forward, we expect the opportunity space to grow with evolving applications and hardware, and much work remains to be done in optimizing scientific applications for various performance measures.

Due to the unique characteristics of sensor networks, such as limited system resources and large-scale deployment, traditional security and privacy solutions cannot be applied to them.\n\nThe goal of this dissertation is to provide ways to deal with security and privacy attacks on sensor networks.\nFirst, we design and evaluate solutions for local, passive, external attackers. Traditionally, dummy messages are used to hide the event source. To reduce the message overhead, we propose a cross-layer solution utilizing beacons at the MAC layer. In this solution, the event information is first propagated several hops through a MAC-layer beacon. Then, it is propagated in the routing layer to the destination to avoid further beacon delay.\nSecond, to defend against global, passive, and external attackers, dummy messages are used. To reduce the event notification delay, we propose a FitProbRate scheme based on a statistically strong source anonymity model. Our analysis and simulation results show that this scheme, besides providing provable privacy, significantly reduces real event reporting latency compared to other schemes.\nTo reduce the network traffic, we select some sensors as proxies that proactively filter dummy messages on their way to the base station. Since the problem of optimal proxy placement is NP-hard, we employ local search heuristics. We propose a Proxy-based Filtering Scheme and a Tree-based Filtering Scheme to accurately locate proxies. Simulation results show that our schemes not only quickly find nearly optimal proxy placement, but also significantly reduce message overhead and improve message delivery ratio.\nFinally, we study the internal attacker in data-centric sensor networks (DCS) and present $p$DCS, a privacy-enhanced DCS network that offers different levels of data privacy based on different cryptographic keys. In addition, we propose several query optimization techniques based on the Euclidean Steiner\nTree and Keyed Bloom Filter to minimize the query overhead while\nproviding certain query privacy. Detailed analysis and simulations show that the Keyed Bloom Filter scheme can significantly reduce message overhead with the same level of query delay and maintain a very high level of query privacy.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4407], "author_name_tesi": "Shao, Min ", "last_name_ssi": "Shao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Tom F.

A systematic random sampling method was used to select participant teachers from the population. A questionnaire was constructed and used to collect data from selected teachers. The questionnaire included five parts, in which 41 items measured current and desired knowledge/skills regarding curriculum and instruction. Those 41 questions were divided into six categories: planning and management, curriculum and innovative teaching, adopting competency-based education, teaching methods and activities, evaluating and assessing, and educational technology. Thirteen factors related to curriculum reform were presented in the instrument and the respondents were asked to rate the top three. Attitudes and perceptions toward reform policies and strategies as well as training programs were included in two sections in the instrument. \n\nThe questionnaire was translated into Chinese and validated both in China and at Penn State University.

Data were input and analyzed through SPSS. \nThe results from the study showed that the average age of the teachers surveyed was 36 years old, with 14 years of work experience and 13 years of teaching experience.

When multiple treatments are implemented together, multiplying individual CMFs is a common way to estimate the overall reduction on crashes quantitatively, carrying with an assumption of statistical independence of the treatments. The validity of the assumption of treatment independence has not been studied extensively. \n  When interaction among treatments exists, it is inappropriate to assume independence of the treatments. The inappropriate use of CMF multiplication is likely to cause errors in the estimation of the magnitude of the safety effects of the treatment (i.e. CMF). This research develops a methodology to identify and quantify the presence of interaction between countermeasures. Differences in safety effectiveness estimates are developed so as to better understand the implications of treatment interaction on safety. \n  The cross-sectional modeling approach using negative binomial models was adopted to estimate the effect on CMFs of countermeasure interaction. This research analyzes the interaction using Generalized Linear Models (GLM) with an underlying negative binomial distribution. After careful selection and screening of predictor variables, a series of models with independent CMFs are compared to a comparable series without the assumption of treatment independence (i.e. with two-way interaction terms).\n  This dissertation consists of three papers. For the first paper in Chapter 2, the methodology is applied to rural multi-lane highways by studying the potential interactions among lane width, right should width and median type. These roadway countermeasures interact with each other throughout the cross-section of rural multilane highways in terms of their association with safety performance. Chapter 3 studies a more homogeneous type of road environment, rural two-lane highways, with three different treatment combinations that were selected from the countermeasures throughout roadway, roadside, and alignment elements, including horizontal curve density and access density. Two types of interactions, categorical by categorical and categorical by continuous interactions, were developed and analyzed in the research. All treatment combinations have demonstrated the existence of interactions with the significance on interaction terms. For the last paper in Chapter 4, the interactive effects on limited access facilities (i.e. interstate freeways) were explored to see how the interaction of a same pair of treatments (e.g. lane width and shoulder width) vary across different road facilities (i.e. rural multilane and interstate freeways). The treatment combinations that are tested for independence include lane width, right shoulder width, and median type. The comparison of the GLM models demonstrates the existence of significant interactive effects.\n  The findings of all papers have achieved the research objectives to develop a feasible method for examining treatment independence and to demonstrate the influences of interaction in CMFs by effectively estimating the combined safety effectiveness with interactions. The differences in CMF with and without interaction are shown to lead to the divergences of conclusions for predicting and assessing the combined treatment effects. It is necessary to be aware and examine the independence of multiple treatments when potential interactions exist; neglecting interactions should be avoided to prevent the combined treatment effects from being incorrectly estimated. The findings of this dissertation are expected to bring contributions to the field by enhancing the quality of safety estimation with the application of CMFs, and therefore provide innovative yet reliable tools and methods for roadway safety improvement.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11066], "author_name_tesi": "Shao, Yen-wen ", "last_name_ssi": "Shao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yen-wen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Peter Jovanis", "Paul Peter Jovanis", "Eric Todd Donnell", "Martin T Pietrucha", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Peter Jovanis, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Peter Jovanis, Committee Chair", "Eric Todd Donnell, Committee Member", "Martin T Pietrucha, Committee Member", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["countermeasure", "interaction", "crash estimation", "Crash Modification Factor", "CMF", "multiple treatments", "safety effectiveness"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Tasking the soft sensor: using cues to direct visual attention \n", "id": "9851", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "361", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Maintaining awareness in an ever-changing environment is a difficult task.

Each year, malaria kills more than 500,000 people (mostly children under the age of five), while another 3.3 billion remain at risk. At the core of many complex issues surrounding malaria control and eradication is the biology of the mosquito vector, which is quite sensitive to shifts in a number of environmental variables, such as temperature, humidity, nutrition, and land use changes. An integrative perspective of the variation in mosquito biology and ecology is crucial to our understanding of malaria transmission, especially in the context of a changing climate. Here, we examine how environmental variability across the mosquito life cycle affects mosquito life history, malaria parasite development, and ultimate disease transmission risk.\n\tWe found that variability in larval food quantity results in considerable changes in both larval and adult mosquito traits. Reduction of larval nutrients greatly extends the time until adult emergence, and habitats with less food produce about 25% fewer adult females than habitats with optimal amounts of food. Females that emerge from nutritionally-stressed habitats have higher rates of mortality, are less likely to mate and lay eggs, and exhibit longer intervals between blood meals (which dictates the number of probable infectious bites a mosquito may transmit in her lifetime). We also observed an effect of larval food quantity on the intensity of infection when mosquitoes were exposed to the rodent malaria Plasmodium yoelii, but there was no change in overall parasite prevalence. However, the changes in life history traits alone led to a 70% reduction in vectorial capacity in females from low food larval environments compared to those from optimal food environments.\n\tWhen we infected females from similar dietary regimes with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, we observed that parasite prevalence in adults from reduced food environments is generally lower, and that parasite development in low-food females is up to two days slower than in females from high-food larval environments. We assessed malaria transmission potential using an epidemiological model that focuses on mosquito mortality and parasite development over time. Our results show that, over a 30-day period, transmission potential is increased by 330% in a population of females emerging from high larval food environments compared to an equivalently sized population of females that experienced nutritional stress as larvae.\nWe observed more complex effects on transmission potential when we integrated two types of environmental variation at the larval stage (food quantity and temperature).  The optimum temperature for larval and adult mosquito fitness and development of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum within the mosquito vector is generally considered to be approximately 27\u00baC. However, we found that adult females from hot (32\u00b0C), high larval food environments had the lowest mortality rates when transferred back to the \u201coptimum\u201d 27\u00baC, while the highest biting rate was observed in adult females from cool (22\u00b0C), high larval food environments. These results suggest that there is no \u201coptimum\u201d larval mosquito habitat, but rather, that different habitats optimize different traits. We also found that, despite the common assumption that larger mosquitoes make better malaria vectors, vectorial capacity is only weakly correlated with size, and is far more heavily impacted by the differences in larval environment that generate the observed variation in female size.\nFinally, we exposed mosquitoes infected with P. falciparum to seven temperatures ranging from 18\u00b0C to 34\u00b0C. We found that the transmission potential of mosquitoes was highest in mid-range environments (24-27\u00b0C), while transmission potential decreases steeply on both sides of this optimum range, and no infectious mosquitoes were observed at 18\u00baC. Our results challenge previous predictions of parasite development thresholds at both the cool and warm ends of the temperature spectrum.  Our findings also suggest that malaria transmission in some endemic areas may decrease as temperatures warm, which contrast many previous predictions that a warming climate will enhance malaria transmission in endemic areas. However, the geographic area that is optimal for malaria transmission may expand, as previously cooler temperatures warm towards a thermal optimum. Overall, our results demonstrate that a more nuanced understanding of how environmental variation shapes mosquito biology and ecology is crucial in order to make optimum use of current vector control resources and to develop innovative, more sustainable control strategies for the future.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13049], "author_name_tesi": "Shapiro, Lillian Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Shapiro", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Lillian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew B.

Yet, empirical evidence regarding the mechanisms by which plant pathogens are transmitted by insects is sparse. In this dissertation, I take a systems biology approach to understanding ecological and molecular interactions driving the emergence of the bacterial phytopathogen Erwinia tracheiphila, a microbe with exceptional economic importance and a highly restricted host range. Induced changes in the emission of plant volatiles\u2014airborne chemicals released by plants that serve as key foraging cues for insects but are not well characterized in response to pathogen infection. In the field and greenhouse, I found that E. tracheiphila induced a unique volatile blend from foliage, and caused a reduction in the emission of floral volatiles. The co-occurring viral pathogen Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus suppressed both leaf and floral volatiles. Behavioral assays found these volatile differences had effects on vector attraction and were important for beetle recruitment to E. tracheiphila infected plants and dispersal to healthy ones, and that few beetles were recruited to virus infected plants. Controlled inoculations show that healthy and ZYMV infected plants are equally susceptible to E. tracheiphila infection, and so vector behavior is largely driving lack of coinfection of the two pathogens in the same host plant that is often documented in the field. Next, I developed a qPCR method to clarify uncertainty in rates of E. tracheiphila colonization of beetle vectors exposed by feeding on wilting leaf tissue. I found that E. tracheiphila does not colonize beetles very efficiently: While at least 80% of beetles are exposed to E. tracheiphila at both short (3 hr) and long (24 hr) exposures, the longer exposure results in significantly higher long-term retention rates. Quantitative changes in bacterial titre in frass and whole beetles also show that transmission is not simply mechanical, and that E. tracheiphila exhibits complex colonization dynamics of the beetle\u2019s digestive tract characterized by attachment, growth, and shedding phases. Finally, I analyze the genome of E. tracheiphila and find it has undergone extensive recombination and pseudogenization compared to the closest sequenced relative, and contains many putatively horizontally transferred genes. Phylogenetic and comparative data suggest E. tracheiphila is undergoing rapid evolution and may have recently experienced a host jump to squash. Taken together, these studies provide an ecological mechanism for transmission from infected to healthy plants; a quantitative description of how beetles are colonized and consequences for transmission; and a genome analysis hypothesizing factors influencing E. tracheiphila emergence as a squash pathogen and persistently transmitted insect symbiont.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8176], "author_name_tesi": "Shapiro, Lori Rachel", "last_name_ssi": "Shapiro", "middle_name_ssi": "Rachel", "first_name_ssi": "Lori", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark C Mescher", "Consuelo M De Moraes", "Andrew George Stephenson", "Shelby Jay Fleischer", "Eric Thomas Harvill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark C Mescher, Dissertation Advisor", "Consuelo M De Moraes, Committee Member", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Member", "Shelby Jay Fleischer, Committee Member", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Plant volatiles", "Erwinia tracheiphila", "Zucchini Yellow Mosaic Virus", "Acalymma vittatum", "Chrysomelidae", "disease ecology"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "AN EXPLORATION OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND COGNITIVE PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENTIATION OF SELF\n", "id": "11328", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4065", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of this study was to examine tenets of Bowen family system theory that proposed that differentiation of self occurs on both physiological and behavioral levels.

The portion sizes of many commonly consumed foods have also increased substantially during this period and large portions may be contributing to the obesity epidemic. Previous research has shown that doubling the portion size of an entr\u00e9e can significantly increase children\u2019s intake at a meal. However little is known about how increasing entr\u00e9e portion size, from small to very large affects children\u2019s intake and eating behavior. \nObjectives: 1) To test a) how increasing portion size increased entr\u00e9e intake, number of entr\u00e9e bites, time spent eating the entr\u00e9e or estimated bite size, b) whether these relations differed by child\u2019s weight status and c) whether number of entr\u00e9e bites, or time spent eating the entr\u00e9e predicted children\u2019s entr\u00e9e intake; 2) to investigate changes in eating rate from the beginning to the end of a lunch session and whether changes in eating rate were related to children\u2019s weight status; and 3) to test a) whether self-served entr\u00e9e size was related to children\u2019s weight status, and whether there was any difference between 400g condition and self-served condition with regards to entr\u00e9e consumption and b) whether children\u2019s estimated bite size or number of bites differed by weight status during this condition.\nMethods: Participants were 17 3 to 5-year-old children. A within-subject design was used to evaluate food consumption during a series of six lunches, in which 100, 160, 220, 280, 340 and 400 g entr\u00e9es were served in one random order. Each child\u2019s eating behavior was recorded by two cameras during the lunch. Two trained coders recorded the number of entr\u00e9e bites taken by each child; inter-rater reliability was .99. Estimated bite size of an entr\u00e9e was defined as total grams of entr\u00e9e consumed divided by total number of bites taken. Time spent eating the entr\u00e9e was calculated by subtracting the time at the last bite of the entr\u00e9e from the time at the first bite. To calculate eating rate, the data from 340g portion lunch was used and changes in eating rate during the entire 20 minutes of lunch time were investigated across four five-minute intervals. Children\u2019s food consumption and eating behavior was assessed during one lunch of self-served condition. Age and sex-specific BMI percentiles were calculated.\nResults: As portion size increased from 100 to 400 g, a significant interaction was found between BMI percentiles and portion size to predict entr\u00e9e consumption. Children with higher BMI percentiles showed greater increases in entr\u00e9e consumption with increasing portion size. Given the low variability in g intake of the entr\u00e9e among participants within the two smallest portions, the analyses were also conducted excluding the 100g and 160g portions. The interaction of portion size and BMI percentiles was no longer significant. However, BMI percentiles and portion size were significant predictors of entr\u00e9e intake. A significant interaction was found between BMI percentiles and portion size on number of entr\u00e9e bites, such that children with higher BMI percentiles had greater increases in the number of entr\u00e9e bites when portion size increased. No significant interactions were found between BMI percentiles and portion size to predict time spent eating the entr\u00e9e or estimated bite size. There was a significant main effect of portion size on time spent eating the entr\u00e9e and bite size. Number of entr\u00e9e bites and time spent eating the entr\u00e9e were significant predictors of entr\u00e9e intake. Eating rate decreased from the beginning to the end of the meal and the changes in eating rate were moderated by BMI percentiles, with overweight children failing to show significant decreases in eating rate. In self-served condition, overweight children showed greater entr\u00e9e intake and greater number of entr\u00e9e bites than non-overweight children. The grams of the entr\u00e9e that were self-served and the proportions of food eaten to food served did not differ between overweight and normal weight children. No significant differences in intake were found between self-served and 400g portion condition.\nDiscussion: Increasing portion size across a wide range of portions increased children\u2019s entr\u00e9e intake by increasing number of entr\u00e9e bites, and time spent eating the entr\u00e9e. A moderating effect of weight status was noted for entr\u00e9e intake and number of bites, suggesting that children with higher BMI percentiles are more responsive to the larger portions by eating more and taking greater number of entr\u00e9e bites. Number of entr\u00e9e bites, and time spent eating the entr\u00e9e predicted children\u2019s entr\u00e9e intake, illustrating how these increased behavioral responses to the increased portion size may lead to greater entr\u00e9e intake. Unlike normal weight children whose eating rate slowed as the meal progressed, overweight children\u2019s eating rate did not slow significantly during the course of the meal, suggesting that deficient satiation may have been responsible for greater intake of overweight children. Findings from self-served condition were similar to those from portion size manipulation in which overweight children showed greater intake and number of entr\u00e9e bites. These findings are not consistent with those of previous studies, which have shown that allowing children to self-serve portions mitigates effects of large portions. This research suggests that increasing portion size may increase children\u2019s intake via changes in number of entr\u00e9e bites and time spent eating the entr\u00e9e and also suggests the possibility that children with higher BMI percentiles may be more responsive to large portions. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4512], "author_name_tesi": "Sharafi, Mastaneh ", "last_name_ssi": "Sharafi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mastaneh", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leann L Birch", "Leann L Birch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leann L Birch, Thesis Advisor", "Leann L Birch, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["children", "obesity", "portion size", "eating behavior"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "INDUCTION OF MACROPHAGE ARGINASE I EXPRESSION BY RON AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PROMOTING SYNGENEIC TUMOR GROWTH\n", "id": "10502", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1557", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the innate immune response, macrophages play a role as the first line of defense against microbial infection through phagocytosis and secretion of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS).  The adaptive immune response is primed through antigen presentation by macrophages, which then respond to T cell cytokines that further aid in the clearance of pathogenic insult.  Following clearance of pathogens, macrophages downregulate the inflammatory response of both the innate and adaptive branches of immunity, and this is coupled with the upregulation of genes that promote resolution of inflammation.  Macrophage regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase and arginase I expression have long been studied as prototypic markers of classical (inflammatory) versus alternative (anti-inflammatory) macrophage activation.  Dampening of classical activation by the Ron receptor tyrosine kinase in macrophages has been well characterized in the murine model of septic shock where Ron-/- mice produce elevated levels of IFN\u00e3 and succumb to death while wild-type animals survive.  Conversely, it has been demonstrated that the Ron receptor tips the balance of macrophage activation away from the classically activated phenotype and promotes hallmarks of alternative macrophage activation, including arginase I expression.  \nIn this dissertation, we first set out to determine the mechanism by which arginase I is regulated by Ron.  We demonstrate that, while IL-4 and the ligand for the Ron receptor, MSP, both enhance arginase I expression in macrophages, MSP induction of the arginase I promoter occurs at sites independent from those induced by IL-4.  MSP, but not IL-4, induces potent MAPK activation in primary macrophages and, through systematic mutagenesis, we demonstrate that induction of the arginase I promoter in response to MSP is mediated by an AP-1 binding site located 433bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS).  In contrast, IL-4 induces arginase I expression through a Stat6 site located ~2.9kb upstream of the TSS.  The role of these sites in vivo in primary macrophages is supported by results from ChIP analysis demonstrating enhanced binding of Fos to the AP-1 site following MSP, but not IL-4 stimulation, and the enhanced binding of Stat6 primarily by IL-4 or to a lesser extent by MSP.  These data suggest that MSP and IL-4 induce arginase I expression in macrophages by both shared and divergent mechanisms.\nWhile alternative macrophage activation of arginase I is important in altering the inflammatory response to pathogens and in promoting wound healing, tumor development hijacks elevated expression of arginase I in macrophages as a means of enhancing tumor growth.  Because Ron alters the balance between classically and alternatively activated macrophages, we hypothesized that activation of Ron on macrophages would promote tumor growth by enhancing arginase I expression.  Here, we find that growth of the syngeneic tumors 3LL, B16-F10, and EG.7 is reduced in Ron-/- mice.  Concurrently, Ron-/- mice exhibit reduced induction of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) as well as cytokines produced upon tumor onset that promote the recruitment of MDSCs to the tumor microenvironment, where they differentiate into tumor associated macrophages (TAMs).  While the overall percentage of TAMs associated with the tumors are not affected by the absence of Ron, expression of arginase I by these cells is severely reduced in Ron-/- mice.  However, Ron expression was not detected on TAMs, suggesting an indirect mechanism by which Ron promotes enhanced arginase I expression in TAMs.  MDSCs and TAMs inhibit T cell activity in a manner dependent on arginase I expression.  Consistent with these observations, we demonstrate that Ron-/- tumor bearing mice (TBM) harbor increased numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells.  In addition, splenocytes from Ron-/- TBM produce increased levels of IFN\u00e3 and decreased levels of IL-10 in response to mitogenic challenge, and exhibit increased proliferation to allogeneic challenge in a mixed lymphocyte reaction.  Together, these findings suggest that Ron modulates the immune response to tumor challenge such that the absence of Ron in the tumor microenvironment enhances tumor immunity and reduces tumor growth.  \nTaken together, the work presented in this dissertation demonstrates that Ron induces the expression of arginase I in macrophages in vitro and in vivo via both direct and indirect mechanisms.  The ability of Ron to promote arginase I expression in vivo likely plays a protective role in response to inflammation and infection, but promotes tumor growth by inhibiting T cell activity.  These results indicate that the activation or inhibition of Ron could have potential therapeutic effects in the treatment of chronic inflammation or tumorigenesis, respectively.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1541], "author_name_tesi": "Sharda, Daniel Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Sharda", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Robert Paulson", "Adam Bleier Glick", "K Sandeep Praubu", "Yanming Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Pamela Hankey Giblin, Dissertation Advisor", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Chair", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Adam Bleier Glick, Committee Member", "K Sandeep Praubu, Committee Member", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["macrophage activation", "tumorigenesis", "arginase", "RTK", "Ron", "MSP", "IL-4"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ROOT ANATOMICAL MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN HOST PLANT CONTROL OF ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL COLONIZATION\n", "id": "9577", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2911", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mycorrhizal host plants are widely known to be capable of controlling the degree to which their root systems are colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.  Previous studies to elucidate mechanisms involved in host plant control of colonization have not considered root anatomical changes as potential control mechanisms.  Here, I examined three root anatomical variables hypothesized to influence mycorrhizal colonization: the percentage of root length with a suberized hypodermis, the distribution of hypodermal passage cells, and the percentage of root volume as intercellular air space.  \nTo test whether changes in these root anatomical variables influence mycorrhizal colonization, interspecific variation in each trait was correlated with mycorrhizal colonization in a diverse assortment of plant species.  Hypodermal passage cell distribution was the only variable capable of influencing mycorrhizal colonization via its effect on fungal penetration point formation.  Mycorrhizal colonization was not found to be significantly influenced by either the percentage of root length suberized or the percentage of root volume as intercellular air space.  \n Next, I evaluated the effect of P treatment on each of these variables in order to explore whether they might be potential mechanisms involved in phosphorus-mediated control of mycorrhizal colonization.  Fifteen species from 13 families were grown at two P availabilities, and the effect of plant P concentration on each variable was assessed.  When each plant species was analyzed as a replicate, only the distribution of passage cells was significantly affected by P status; high P plants possessed a reduced percentage of root length with passage cells.  Other examined traits did not respond significantly to P status, and individual species responses to P treatment varied widely.  I conclude that, while no single anatomical mechanism appears to be responsible in all species, in species with passage cells, altering the percentage of root length with passage cells could serve as one mechanism for P-mediated control of mycorrhizal colonization. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2905], "author_name_tesi": "Sharda, Jori Nerissa", "last_name_ssi": "Sharda", "middle_name_ssi": "Nerissa", "first_name_ssi": "Jori", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David M Sylvia", "Jonathan Paul Lynch", "David Eissenstat", "Roger Tai Koide"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David M Sylvia, Committee Member", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Member", "David Eissenstat, Committee Member", "Roger Tai Koide, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["hypodermal passage cells", "arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization", "root anatomy", "hypodermal suberization", "phosphorus", "intercellular air space"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Addressing Power, Performance and End-to-end Qos in Emerging Multicores through system-wide Resource Management", "id": "18387", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8867", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multicores are now ubiquitous, owing to the benefits they bring over single core architectures including improved performance, lower power consumption and reduced design complexity. Several resources ranging from the cores themselves to multiple levels of on-chip caches and off-chip memory bandwidth are typically shared in a multicore processor. Prudent management of these shared resources for achieving predictable performance and optimizing energy efficiency is critical and thus, has received considerable attention in recent times. In my research study, I have been focusing on proposing novel schemes to dynamically manage various available shared resources in emerging multiocres, while targeting three main goals: (1) Maximizing the overall system performance and (2) Meeting end-to-end QoS targets defined by the system administrator (3) Optimizing power and energy consumption. We consider a wide range of available resources including cors, shared caches, off-chip memory bandwidth, on-chip communication resources and power budgets. Further, towards achieving our goals, we employ {\\em formal control theory} as a powerful tool to provide the high-level performance targets through dynamically managing and partitioning the shared resources.\n\nProviding end-to-end QoS in future multicores is essential for supporting wide-spread adoption of multicore architectures in virtualized servers and cloud computing systems. An initial step towards such an end-to-end QoS support in multicores is to ensure that at least the major computational and memory resources on-chip are managed efficiently in a coordinated fashion. In this dissertation we propose a platform for end-to-end on-chip resource management in multicore processors. Assuming that each application specifies a performance target/SLA, the main objective is to dynamically provision sufficient on-chip resources to applications for achieving the specified targets. We employ a feedback based system, designed as a Single-Input, Multiple-Output (SIMO) controller with an Auto-Regressive-Moving-Average (ARMA) model, to capture the behaviors of different applications.\n\n\nDynamic management of the shared resources in multicore systems with the goal of maximizing the overall system performance is another main part of this dissertation. As we move towards many-core systems, interference in shared cache continues to increase, making shared cache management an important issue in increasing overall system performance. As a part of my research, we propose a dynamic cache management scheme for multiprogrammed, multithreaded applications, with the objective of obtaining maximum performance for both individual applications and the multithreaded workload mix. From an architectural side, in parallel to increasing core counts, network-on-chip (NoC) is becoming one of the critical shared components which determine the overall performance, energy consumption and reliability of emerging multicore systems. In my research, targeting Network-on-Chip (NoC) based multicores, we propose two network prioritization schemes that can cooperatively improve performance by reducing end-to-end memory access latencies. In our another work on NoCs, focusing on a heterogenous NoC in which each router has (potentially) a different processing delay, we propose a process variation-aware source routing scheme to enhance the performance of the communications in the NoC based system. Our scheme assigns a route to each communication of an incoming application, considering the processing latencies of the routers resulting from process variation as well as the communications that already exist in the network to reduce traffic congestion.\n\nPower and energy consumption in multicores is another important area that we target in my research. In one of the sections of this dissertation, targeting NoC based multicores, we propose a two-level power budget distribution mechanism, called PEPON, where the first level distributes the overall power budget of the multicore system among various types of on-chip resources like the cores, caches, and NoC, and the second level determines the allocation of power to individual instances of each type of resource. Both these distributions are oriented towards maximizing workload performance without exceeding the specified power budget.\n\nAs the memory system is a large contributor to the energy consumption of a server, there have been prior efforts to reduce the power and energy consumption of the memory system. DVFS schemes have been used to reduce the memory power, but they come with a performance penalty. In my research study, we propose HiPEMM, a high performance DVFS mechanism that intelligently reduces memory power by dynamically scaling individual memory channel frequencies. Our strategy also involves clustering the running applications based on their sensitivity to memory latency, and assigning memory channels to the application clusters.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8712], "author_name_tesi": "Sharifi, Akbar ", "last_name_ssi": "Sharifi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Akbar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Chitaranjan Das", "Padma Raghavan", "Qian Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Dissertation Advisor", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Chair", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multicore Systems", "Resource Management", "Power", "Performance", "End-to-End QoS"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DROP DEFORMATION AND BREAKUP IN CONFINED FLOWS OF VISCOELASTIC TWO-PHASE SYSTEMS", "id": "11783", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6022", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Deformation and breakup of fluid particles translating through capillaries of different cross-section are investigated experimentally for systems in which either the drop or the suspending fluid is rheologically complex. Capillaries with circular, square/rectangular, and periodically-varying cross-sections are considered, and the effect of the confining geometry on breakup behavior is examined.  Experimental observations of the steady drop shape and mobility are reported for various polymer concentrations in the rheologically complex phase in order to identify the effect of elasticity on fluid particle deformation and breakup. \nViscoelastic effects on fluid particle deformation are examined over a wide range of elasticity numbers. Elasticity of the suspending fluid is found to produce steady cusped tails at the trailing end of bubbles, similar to that reported by other investigators for the free rise of large bubbles in a viscoelastic suspending fluid. Elasticity of the drop fluid is found to hinder drop deformation while elasticity of the suspending fluid seems to have a non-monotonic effect on drop deformation. Qualitatively similar effects of elasticity were observed for both cylindrical and rectangular channels. For the periodically-constricted capillary, elasticity in either phase (drop or suspending fluid) is found to enhance deformation. \nThe effects of capillary number, drop size and viscosity ratio on the relative drop mobility in different capillaries are also examined. The steady relative velocity of the drop is found to be an increasing function of capillary number that approaches a constant value for sufficiently large capillary numbers. Drop mobility is retarded by increasing drop phase elasticity in all of the capillary geometries considered. Suspending fluid elasticity on the other hand, has a favorable effect on drop mobility in a periodically-constricted capillary, and a non-monotonic effect on drop mobility in both cylindrical and rectangular channels.\n\nTwo distinct modes of drop breakup were observed for pressure-driven motion of viscoelastic drops through a Newtonian suspending fluid within a cylindrical capillary; growing re-entrant cavity and rim-streaming. We observed a double tip-streaming mode of drop breakup in the rectangular channel, and re-entrant cusp streaming in the square channel. For both the cylindrical tube and the rectangular channel, increasing the elasticity of the drop phase (by increasing the polymer concentration) initially facilitated drop breakup, and shifted the onset of drop breakup to smaller drop sizes. As the elasticity number was increased beyond about 0.5, however, the onset of drop breakup was delayed to larger drop sizes due to the concomitant increase in the viscosity of the drop phase. In the periodically-constricted capillary, the tail pinch-off and re-entrant cusp modes of drop breakup were observed for weakly elastic and moderately/strongly elastic systems, respectively. For pressure-driven motion of Newtonian drops through a viscoelastic suspending fluid, the tail-streaming and tail pinch-off breakup mechanisms were observed in the cylindrical and periodically-constricted capillaries, respectively, while no breakup was observed in the rectangular channel over the range of parameter values considered in the experiments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6014], "author_name_tesi": "Sharifi Khobdeh, Shirin ", "last_name_ssi": "Sharifi Khobdeh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shirin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ali Borhan", "Ali Borhan", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "Michael John Janik", "Themis Matsoukas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ali Borhan, Dissertation Advisor", "Ali Borhan, Committee Chair", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DROP DEFORMATION", "DROP BREAKUP", "CONFINED FLOWS", "VISCOELASTIC TWO-PHASE SYSTEMS"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Corrosion Issues in High-level Nuclear Waste Containers", "id": "18973", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8946", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation different aspects of corrosion and electrochemistry of copper, candidate canister material in Scandinavian high-level nuclear waste disposal program, including the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reactions that are predicted to occur in the practical system have been studied. \n\n\tA comprehensive thermodynamic study of copper in contact with granitic groundwater of the type and composition that is expected in the Forsmark repository in Sweden has been performed.  Our primary objective was to ascertain whether copper would exist in the thermodynamically immune state in the repository, in which case corrosion could not occur and the issue of corrosion in the assessment of the storage technology would be moot.  In spite of the fact that metallic copper has been found to exist for geological times in granitic geological formations, copper is well-known to be activated from the immune state to corrode by specific species that may exist in the environment.  The principal activator of copper is known to be sulfur in its various forms, including sulfide (H2S, HS-, S2-), polysulfide (H2Sx, HSx-, Sx2-), poly sulfur thiosulfate (SxO32-), and polythionates (SxO62-).  A comprehensive study of this aspect of copper chemistry has never been reported, and yet an understanding of this issue is vital for assessing whether copper is a suitable material for fabricating canisters for the disposal of HLNW.  Our study identifies and explores those species that activate copper; these species include sulfur-containing entities as well as other, non-sulfur species that may be present in the repository. \n\n\t The effects of temperature, solution pH, and hydrogen pressure on the kinetics of the hydrogen electrode reaction (HER) on copper in borate buffer solution have been studied by means of steady-state polarization measurements, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).  In order to obtain electrokinetic parameters, such as the exchange current density and the cathodic Tafel slope, two stages of optimization have been performed.  From the optimization process, the activation energy (Eac) of the HER on copper was obtained as \u224832 kJ mol-1.  Moreover, the mechanism of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on copper in mildly alkaline media has been studied by means of EIS over the frequency range of 0.01 Hz \u2264 f \u2264 5 kHz.  The impedance spectra were modeled using a mechanism based upon the Volmer-Heyrovsky-Tafel steps for hydrogen evolution and by considering the reactions involved in hydrogen atom and hydroxyl group adsorption on the copper surface.  A single set of kinetic parameters, including the rate constants and transfer coefficient, have been derived for each pH by optimization of the mechanistic model on the experimental impedance (EIS) data.  It is postulated that the HER proceeds through the Volmer-Heyrovsky-Tafel mechanism with the Volmer reaction being the rate-determining step.\n\nThe kinetics of growth of the passive sulfide film on copper in deaerated aqueous sodium chloride solution as a function of applied potential, sulfide species concentrations and temperature were explored by means of potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The electronic and compositional properties of the passive layer were investigated with Mott-Schottky analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It is found that metal vacancies are predominant defects in the barrier layer which is in agreement with the p-type character of the film observed experimentally. A point defect model (PDM) for formation and dissolution of the passive sulfide film on copper is proposed. Finally, the behavior of the system interpreted in terms of reaction mechanisms and kinetic parameters extracted from the experimental impedance data by mathematical optimization using a genetic algorithm approach. The diffusion coefficient of cation vacancies is obtained directly from optimization of the proposed model onto the EIS experimental data and was found to be essentially independent from the applied potential within the passive range. The diffusivity of the predominance defects (cation vacancies) found to increase with increase in solution temperature from approx. 10-13 (cm2 s-1) at 25 oC to 10-11 (cm2 S-1) at 75oC. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8784], "author_name_tesi": "Sharifiasl, Samin ", "last_name_ssi": "Sharifiasl", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Samin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald", "Digby D Macdonald", "James Hansell Adair", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald", "Gary Lynn Messing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald, Dissertation Advisor", "Digby D Macdonald, Committee Chair", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Member", "Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Passivity", "Corrosion", "High-level nuclear waste", "Sulfide", "Thermodynamics", "Kinetics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Combined State of Charge and State of Health Estimation for Lithium-ion Batteries", "id": "15498", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7253", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis examines the challenges faced in combined State of Charge(SoC) - State of Health(SoH) estimation for lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries.

A brief survey of the literature is done for the state-of-the-art in battery state estimation and control with respect to the above stated parameters. Estimation of SoC, capacity and resistance over an extended period of use is studied using a first order equivalent circuit model to demonstrate the fundamental challenges faced in simultaneous estimation.

The objectives are achieved by controlling the dispersion and alignment of unfunctionalized and functionalized CNFs and CNTs. The process of ultrasonic agitation was used to disperse nanofillers in epoxy resin. The dispersed nanofillers were aligned using alternating current electric field (AC). \n\nContinuous use of ultrasonic agitation reduced the lengths, and increased the degree of dispersion of CNFs and CNTs. The parameters of the ultrasonic agitation process were optimized to minimize the reduction in CNF and CNT lengths while achieving good dispersion of CNFs and CNTs in the resin. The composites manufactured with well dispersed CNFs and CNTs increased the elastic modulus as expected based on the theory of short fiber reinforced composites. \n\nThe alignment and chaining of CNFs and CNTs dispersed in resin were investigated by experiments and modeling. The assembly of chains was found to depend on the frequency of AC electric field used. The mechanism of CNF/CNT chain assembly and growth in a low viscosity epoxy was investigated by developing a finite element model of a chain attached to an electrode. The model includes the combined effects of electrostatic and electro-hydrodynamic forces on chain morphology. The electro-hydrodynamic forces are modeled using the theory of AC electroosmosis. Predictions of the model are compared to experimental results. The experiments were conducted on a CNF/epoxide/curative mixture by applying an AC field at frequencies ranging from 100 \u2013 100,000 Hz. Predictions of the model qualitatively capture the variations of chain morphology and growth rate as functions of AC frequency. Higher frequencies promote a more uniform and denser network of chains. The rate of growth of chains is highest at an intermediate frequency. A uniform network of chains was observed at frequencies of 1 kHz and greater in the experiments.
