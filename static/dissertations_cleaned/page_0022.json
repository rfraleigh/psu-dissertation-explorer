This thesis engages with those calls through an examination of the work of peace in Liberia. This discussion of the work of peace in Liberia particularly highlights and draws from the rich history, and emotional and material labor, of women working for peace in both public and private spaces. The research draws from two months of ethnographic work and qualitative interviews with members the Liberian women\u2019s peace movement, as well as others in government and civil society who work on peace. Throughout this grounded analysis I explore numerous meanings of \u2018the work of peace\u2019: peace as a process, a lived reality, an emotion, a platform for women\u2019s advocacy, a livelihood in the peacebuilding and aid economy, and as a geopolitical identifier and framework for the broad transformation of society in the \u2018postwar\u2019. In examining the expansive transformations that are ushered in during the postwar in the name of building peace, I will point to the ways \u2018peace\u2019 can not only passively mask structural violence, but also the way \u2018peace\u2019 discourses and institutions can actively quell claims for justice and equality. Throughout this thesis, I will draw heavily from the insights of feminist geopolitics in order to demonstrate the importance of attending to the ways peace is experienced and mutually constituted across multiple scales and spaces. Additionally, speaking to the feminist concern for imagining and offering alternative geographies, I suggest that engaging in a process of conceptualizing peace may work as a unique tool, pushing us beyond endless critiques of violence to imagining new and better realities.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7914], "author_name_tesi": "Christian, Jenna Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Christian", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Jenna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lorraine Dowler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lorraine Dowler, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["women", "peace", "violence", "feminist geopolitics", "gender", "Liberia"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Global Sensitivity Analysis of the GEOS-Chem Chemical Transport Model for Six NASA Field Campaigns", "id": "14601kec5366", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14601", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Global chemical transport models are popular tools within the air chemistry community to both assess our understanding of air chemical processes and to provide a platform to predict how atmospheric composition may respond to future changes. However, there are errors and uncertainties in almost all model inputs, such as emissions, chemistry, and meteorology rendering modeled results likewise uncertain. Thus a detailed analysis of model uncertainties and sensitivity of modeled results to its inputs are required to qualify and improve these predictions.\n\nUsing a global sensitivity method involving the simultaneous perturbation of many chemical transport model input factors, we find the model uncertainty for ozone (O3), hydroxyl radical (OH), and hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) mixing ratios and apportion this uncertainty to model inputs including emissions, meteorology, and chemistry using the Random Sampling-High Dimensional Model Representation (RS-HMDR) global sensitivity analysis method for the DC-8 flight tracks corresponding to six NASA aircraft field campaigns. These campaigns took place from 1999 to 2008 in locations stretching from the South Pacific to the North American Arctic and from East Asia to the North Atlantic. \n\nIn general, we find modeled and measured oxidant mixing ratios to agree once uncertainties in both are taken into account with some notable exceptions. Notably, these exceptions include ozone during the Houston flights of the INTEX-B campaign, HO2 for the flights over the northernmost Pacific Ocean during INTEX-B, low altitude ozone and HO2 during TRACE-P, and ozone in a few of the vertical bins for PEM-Tropics B. For ozone and OH, modeled mixing ratios for most locations were most sensitive to a bevy of emissions, notably lightning NOx, various surface NOx sources, carbon monoxide, and isoprene. This means that lessening model uncertainties for these species in these regions will likely require improving emissions inventories. HO2 mixing ratios were most sensitive to CO and isoprene emissions as well as the aerosol uptake of HO2. In the case of some Arctic flights, we found HO2 and OH to be overwhelmingly sensitive to the aerosol uptake of HO2 with this one factor contributing upwards of 75 % of the total uncertainty in HO2. With the dominance of this one factor in the sensitivity of HOx mixing ratios for this region, improving the modeled characterization of HOx in this domain will require it being addressed. Across most campaigns, we find better model-measurement agreement with lower rates of aerosol uptake and lower lightning NOx emissions suggesting both may need to be reduced.\n\nFor almost all campaigns the same seven factors were responsible for the majority of the model ensemble uncertainty for ozone, OH, and HO2: surface NOx emissions, carbon monoxide emissions, lightning NOx emissions, aerosol uptake of HO2, isoprene emissions, the reaction rate of NO2 + OH, and the photolysis rate of NO2. The frequency of these factors among the most sensitive factors in each campaign suggests that the applicability of these results may extend beyond the specific regions covered by the respective campaigns. In order to achieve appreciable future progress in decreasing modeled oxidant uncertainty, addressing these seven factors is likely required.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15932], "author_name_tesi": "Christian, Kenneth Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Christian", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Henry Brune", "William Henry Brune", "Kenneth James Davis", "Anne Thompson", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Jingqiu Mao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Henry Brune, Dissertation Advisor", "William Henry Brune, Committee Chair", "Kenneth James Davis, Committee Member", "Anne Thompson, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Outside Member", "Jingqiu Mao, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["global sensitivity analysis", "atmospheric chemistry", "chemical transport model", "ozone", "oxidant", "sensitivity analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Development of a Trailing-Edge Noise Prediction\nMethod using the Non-Linear Disturbance\nEquations", "id": "22822", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4041", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Currently, the methods available for wind turbine noise prediction are either based on empirical data or require unrealistic computational costs. Although these methods are very valuable, a computationally efficient tool that is based on first principles is needed. The present research proposes a hybrid computational aeroacoustics approach for predicting turbulent-boundary-layer, trailing-edge (TBL-TE) noise. TBL-TE is of interest because it is a dominant source in the total broadband spectrum of wind turbine aerodynamic noise. The proposed method solves the Non-Linear Disturbance Equations (NLDE) for the unsteady flow field in the vicinity of the airfoil trailing edge. Then the noise at a location in far-field location is found by passing the NLDE solution to the aeroacoustics propagation code, PSU-WOPWOP. In this thesis, recent progress made with the development of the NLDE flow solver, TANDEM (Turbulence And Noise using the Disturbance Equation Method) is presented. Test cases are shown to validate the code.

Here we present observations and model results that aim to advance our understanding of the ice/bed interface of ice sheets and glaciers by examining possible grounding line retreat scenarios of a large marine-based West Antarctic glacier, investigating subglacial hydrology under a stable West Antarctic ice stream, and directly instrumenting the basal interface of Engabreen (a large, maritime glacier in northern Norway). First, we use airborne laser altimetry and ice-penetrating radar data to map the surface and subglacial topography of the grounding zone of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica which is especially prone to the marine ice sheet instability as it is grounded up to 2.6 km below sea level on bedrock that deepens inland and is currently losing mass. Our results show that the glacier is currently grounded on a bedrock sill, that there is at least one more coherent, large amplitude bedrock sill \u223c10 km inland from the current grounding line, and also that basal crevassing and high basal reflectivity persist several kilometers inland from the grounding line. This suggests that warm ocean water may penetrate beyond the grounding zone. We use a coupled 2-dimensional ice stream/ice shelf/ocean plume model to examine the sensitivity of the glacier to ocean melt by weakening the grounding zone via propagation of basal melt inland of the grounding line and reducing the strength of the glacier\u2019s bed. The model results suggest that if basal melt occurs across a grounding zone, and not a single grounding point, the glacier is extremely sensi- tive to local topography and that a grounding zone wider than a critical bedrock bump size will allow rapid retreat of the glacier on the \u223c500 year timescale. The critical size of the bedrock bump is dependent on the relative amplitude of other bedrock sills on the same flowline, but is as small as 6 km which is similar in size to the observed grounding zone on Thwaites Glacier. In the second portion of this thesis, we present the results of kinematic GPS and ice-penetrating radar surveys of Subglacial Lake Whillans, an active subglacial lake under Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica. The lake is manifested on the surface as a \u223c15 m depression in its low-stand state. Radar imaging of the subglacial lake, although indicating wet conditions, is consistent with a water column depth of only \u223c6 m. A steep ridge in basal topography that is coincident with a strong contrast in relative basal reflectivity (\u223c6 dB) appears to currently confine the lake. Mapped hydropotential shows that the lake cannot drain via a simple flotation model; however, an increase in water column thickness by \u223c5 m is sufficient to allow drainage via a buoyant cantilever effect. Thus Subglacial Lake Whillans acts as a temporary water storage basin beneath Whillans Ice Stream. Finally, we present a series of observations from Engabreen, a mountain glacier in northern Norway, where we can directly instrument the bed of the glacier via access provided by hydropower tunnels. Passive seismic data illustrate that the glacier can transition from a mode where a considerable portion of the basal motion is accommodated via stick-slip motion to one where basal sliding dominates with only a modest change in basal water input from surface melt (< 1 m3/s change in subglacial water flux). We also present observations of a \u201cspring speed-up\u201d event or the first introduction of substantial meltwater to the glacier\u2019s bed at the beginning of the melt season. This is subglacially manifested as a 400 kPa subglacial water pressure pulse accompanied initially by a long-period seismic signal followed by high frequency seismic signal indicative of basal cracking. We interpret this as the arrival of a large horizontal force, the glacier beginning to accelerate forward, followed by a large vertical signal, the arrival of the water pulse. Similar, but lower amplitude signals, that occur after the initial event suggest that the glacier basal hydrology system continues to dynamically reorganize in response to input forcing from surface meltwater or precipitation. Therefore hysteresis may need to be incorporated into glacier models as results to input forcing may depend on the prior organization of the glacier\u2019s subglacial hydraulic system.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7152], "author_name_tesi": "Christianson, Knut Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Christianson", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "Knut", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Richard B Alley", "Peter Christopher Lafemina", "Derrick J Lampkin", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard B Alley, Committee Member", "Peter Christopher Lafemina, Committee Member", "Derrick J Lampkin, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["glaciers", "ice sheets", "geophysics", "ice-penetrating radar", "GPS"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Biogeographic, Functional, and Phylogenetic Consequences of the Pliocene to Modern in the Western Atlantic", "id": "14269mlc392", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14269", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is no historical analog for the concentrations of CO2 in Earth\u2019s atmosphere \u2013 to find one, we must turn to the geologic record. The mid-Pliocene (~3 Ma) is the last interval when pCO2 matched today\u2019s value of 400 ppm. As our climate moves back to a more Pliocene-like state, studying the Pliocene allows us to forecast potential changes in Earth systems.\n\t\nWe use Pliocene to modern mollusks to understand how climate change affected ecosystems in three ways: the biogeography of species and genera, the taxonomic and functional patterns of the extinction, and the evolutionary consequences of extinction and range restriction. Using these, we hope to predict large scale patterns of biotic change as climate warms.\n\t\nWe compiled a dataset of fossil and modern species and genera from the literature to reconstruct biogeography from the Pliocene to modern. We found that a prominent feature of modern biogeography, the biogeographic boundary near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, was established in the Pleistocene in response to the deflection of the Gulf Stream Current near Cape Hatteras. This caused a sharp temperature break, leading to the exclusion of southern-affiliated taxa north of Cape Hatteras.\n\t\nWe also collected a new dataset of mollusks from Plio-Pleistocene sites north of Cape Hatteras to assess the taxonomic and functional patterns of extinction. We found that while species turnover is large across the Plio-Pleistocene, functional communities remain similar across the extinction. This contrasts with the Plio-Pleistocene transition in the Caribbean, where major functional changes occurred. This is likely because habitats north of Cape Hatteras did not change greatly after the Pliocene, suggesting that large functional changes would occur if there was a shift in habitats.\n\t\nLastly, we used molecular and morphological data to create a phylogeny of extinct and extant members of the bivalve family Luciniade. Our results showed that more lucinid phylogenetic diversity was lost in communities north of Florida, which is important because high values of phylogenetic diversity are associated with ecosystem stability. We also showed that the lucinids were range restricted after the Pliocene, and would be expected to expand north when climate warms.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15155], "author_name_tesi": "Christie, Max Lawrence", "last_name_ssi": "Christie", "middle_name_ssi": "Lawrence", "first_name_ssi": "Max", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark E Patzkowsky", "Mark E Patzkowsky", "Peter Daniel Wilf", "Timothy Bralower", "Todd C Lajeunesse"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark E Patzkowsky, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark E Patzkowsky, Committee Chair", "Peter Daniel Wilf, Committee Member", "Timothy Bralower, Committee Member", "Todd C Lajeunesse, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pliocene", "Pleistocene", "Mollusk", "Coastal Plain", "Plio-Pleistocene Extinction", "Phylogenetics", "Functional Ecology", "Biogeography"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "JUDEO-SPANISH AND THE JEWISH COMMUNITY OF 21ST CENTURY THESSALONIKI: ETHNIC LANGUAGE SHIFT IN THE MAINTENANCE OF ETHNO CULTURAL IDENTITY", "id": "9013", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6153", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this research is to delve further into the relationship between language and ethnic identity.

Do other markers of ethnicity, both linguistic and non linguistic, emerge to sustain ethnicity? This research employs the case of Judeo-Spanish, the longtime associated language of the Jews of Thessaloniki, Greece, to examine these principle research questions. Participants include members of the Jewish community and are divided into three generational groups in order to establish trends and transformations based on generation. In conjunction with the historical, social and political considerations that frame this community, participant questionnaire and interview responses form the database from which the analysis and interpretation derive.

Linear and nonlinear QR models have been studied extensively, while recent research focuses on the single index quantile regression (SIQR) model. Compared to the single index mean regression (SIMR)  problem, the fitting and the asymptotic theory of the SIQR model are more complicated due to the lack of closed form expressions for estimators of conditional quantiles. Consequently, existing methods are necessarily iterative. We propose a non-iterative estimation algorithm, and derive the asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimator under heteroscedasticity. For identifiability, we use a parametrization that sets the first coefficient to 1 instead of the typical condition which restricts the norm of the parametric component. This distinction is more than simply cosmetic as it affects, in a critical way, the correspondence between the estimator derived and the asymptotic theory.\n\nThe ubiquity of high dimensional data has led to a number of variable selection methods for linear/nonlinear QR models and, recently, for the SIQR model. We propose a new algorithm for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation applicable also for heteroscedastic data.  The proposed algorithm, which is non-iterative,  consists of two steps.  Step 1 performs an initial variable selection method. Step 2 uses the results of Step 1 to obtain better estimation of the conditional quantiles and, using them, to perform simultaneous variable selection and estimation of the parametric component of the SIQR model. It is shown that the initial variable selection method of Step 1 consistently estimates the relevant variables, and that the estimated parametric component derived in Step 2 satisfies the oracle property.  \n\nFurthermore, QR is particularly relevant for the analysis of censored survival data as an alternative to proportional hazards and the accelerated failure time models. Such data occur frequently in biostatistics, environmental sciences, social sciences and econometrics. There is a large body of work for linear/nonlinear QR models for censored data, but it is only recently that the SIQR model has received some attention. However, the only existing method for fitting the SIQR model uses an iterative algorithm and no asymptotic theory for the resulting estimator of the Euclidean parameter is given. We propose a new non-iterative estimation algorithm, and derive the asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimator under heteroscedasticity.

The measured energy density of the terpolymers is higher than 9 J/cm3. Due to their high dielectric constant, the polarization response of the terpolymers saturates at an electric field much lower than their breakdown field, which results in highly nonlinear dielectric response with electric field and lower energy density than expected. This result suggests that high dielectric constant may not be desirable to obtain high energy density and materials with lower dielectric constant than the terpolymers, in which the early polarization saturation can be avoided, can have higher energy density.

Various variable selection methods have been proposed for high dimensional data where feature dimension p increases with sample size n at polynomial rates. In ultrahigh dimensional setting, p is allowed to grow with n at an exponential rate. Instead of jointly selecting active covariates, a more effective approach is to incorporate screening rule that aims at filtering out unimportant covariates through marginal regression techniques. This thesis is concerned with feature screening methods for ultrahigh dimensional longitudinal data. Such data occur frequently in longitudinal genetic studies, where phenotypes and some covariates are measured repeatedly over a certain time period. Along with the genetic measurements, longitudinal genetic studies provide valuable resources for exploring primary genetic and environmental factors that influence complex phenotypes over time. The proposed statistical methods in this work allow us not only to identify genetic determinants of common complex disease, but also to understand at which stage of human life do the genetic determinants become important. \n\nIn Chapter 3, we propose a new feature screening procedure for ultrahigh dimensional time-varying coefficient models. We present an effective screening rule based on marginal B-spline regression that incorporates time-varying variance and within-subject correlations. We show that under certain conditions, this procedure possesses sure screening property, and the false selection rates can be controlled. We demonstrate how within subject variability can be harnessed for increasing screening accuracy by Monte Carlo simulation studies. Furthermore, we illustrate the proposed screening rule via an empirical analysis of the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) data. Our empirical analysis clearly shows that the proposed approach is especially useful for such studies as children change quite extensively over a four-year period with highly nonlinear patterns. \n\nIn Chapter 4, we study screening rules for ultrahigh dimensional covariates that are potentially associated with random effects. Mixed effects models are popular for taking into account the dependence structure of longitudinal data, as subject-specific random effects can explicitly account for within-subject correlation. We propose a two-step screening procedure for generalized varying-coefficient mixed effects models. The two-step procedure screens fixed effects first and then random effects. We conduct simulation studies to assess the finite sample performance of this two-step screening approach for continuous response with linear regression, binary response with logistic regression, count response with Poisson regression, and ordinal response with proportional-odds cumulative logit model. In real data application, we apply this procedure to data from Framingham Heart Study (FHS), and explore the genetic and environmental effects on body mass index (BMI), obesity and blood pressure in three separate analyses. Our results confirm some findings from previous studies, and also identify genetic markers with highly significant effects and interesting time-dependent patterns that worth further exploration.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12321], "author_name_tesi": "Chu, Wanghuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Chu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wanghuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Runze Li", "Runze Li", "Matthew Reimherr", "Lingzhou Xue", "Donna Coffman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Runze Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Runze Li, Committee Chair", "Matthew Reimherr, Committee Member", "Lingzhou Xue, Committee Member", "Donna Coffman, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Feature screening", "ultra-high dimensional data", "longitudinal genetic study"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": " RETELLING THE STORY OF HUA MU-LAN: MILITARY EXPERIENCES OF UNIFORMED WOMEN FROM ONE TAIWANESE SERVICE ACADEMY\n\n\n\n", "id": "6800", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6744", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project, a qualitative inquiry founded on feminist research practices, was initiated by the enigma that emerged from observations of why cadet women's outstanding performance on an average at a Taiwanese service academy did not usually lead them to successful upward mobility in rank and a longer stay upon entering the Taiwanese armed forces. Thirteen Taiwanese servicewomen from the service academy, 7 alumnae and 6 cadets, voluntarily participated in the study. Of significance are their lived military experiences as narrated in approximately 2-hour open-ended interviews that took place between December 2004 and January 2005, as well as in informal conversations that began more than a year ago. \nThese women's narratives reflect the gendered inequalities in the Taiwanese armed forces and require our scrutiny. For example, military policies carefully plan the utilization of women\u00a1\u00a6s labor force in order not to violate the fundamentally masculine characteristic of warfare. Accordingly, this sex-based exclusion is at play through discursive practices, and so despite their capabilities servicewomen are assumed to be weak, assigned to combat support roles, and rarely granted the position of commander. These situations combine to deny women\u00a1\u00a6s advancement and promotion within the military, given that the commander position is not only a push toward promotion but necessary to achieve status in the higher ranks. Furthermore, the gender quota system in the Taiwanese military has continuously kept the number of servicewomen under 5%. As a result, the small numbers of servicewomen are more likely to be perceived as tokens in the armed forces.\nThe study reveals that the 13 Taiwanese servicewomen at times demonstrated some of the allegedly masculine characteristics required of a soldier, such as perseverance, intelligence, determination, authority, and rationality, and demonstrated feminine qualities on others. This highlights the complexity and fluidity of women\u00a1\u00a6s subjectivity in gender performance, and suggests that the military profession has less to do with notions of maleness and femaleness. Moreover, as the Taiwanese government seriously considers national long-term development and idealism of democracy and equality, it should employ service members based on their competence and not on sexual biological differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6739], "author_name_tesi": "Chu, Yun-Fen ", "last_name_ssi": "Chu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yun-Fen", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marnina Gonick", "Lorraine Dowler", "Jamie Myers", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marnina Gonick, Committee Chair", "Lorraine Dowler, Committee Member", "Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gender performance", "the gendered division of labor", "Taiwanese servicewomen", "nationalism", "Confucianism", "subjective experiences", "subject positions"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "A DESCRIPTIVE CASE STUDY OF THE IMPACT OF A PROFESSOR TEACHING STRATEGIES ON TAIWANESE COLLEGE STUDENTS' PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGE INTERPRETATIONS\n\n\n", "id": "6717", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1223", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this descriptive case study, I investigated the impact of a Taiwanese college professor\u2019s teaching strategies on Taiwanese students who were learning to interpret photographs in his undergraduate photography appreciation course.

This noise modulated covert communication system (NMCC) is based\non the use of heterodyne correlation techniques to inject coherence into a random noise\nsignal. The BPSK-modulated signal to be transmitted containing the carrier is mixed with\nband-limited UWB random noise signal. The frequency range of the UWB noise signal is\nappropriately chosen so that the lower sideband of the mixing process falls over the same\nfrequency range. Thus, the dispersive effects caused by the atmosphere and other factors\nare significantly reduced since both polarization channels operate over the same\nfrequency band.\n\n   In military communications, the communication system will suffer interference\nfrom ambient noise, jamming from hostile force and multi-path.

Which insect elicitors can be recognized by plants and which plant proteins are involved in plant defense against insects are two big questions for plant scientists. In this dissertation, I would like to address these two questions by using maize (Zea mays) and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) as a model system. Although chewing insects cause extensive mechanical damage to plants, this does not account for the entire effect of herbivory. Caterpillar oral secretions, including saliva and regurgitant, trigger herbivore defense responses in plants. Several herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) have been found in insect regurgitant. However, there is an argument whether caterpillar larvae actually regurgitate on maize leaves during feeding on maize. Thus, I examined fall armyworm larval saliva to determine if it is an important elicitor of herbivore defenses in maize. Analyses indicated that very little regurgitant was deposited on the maize leaf during caterpillar feeding. Furthermore, caterpillar regurgitant failed to trigger plant defense-related genes in maize. Whereas, leaf tissue immunoblots indicated that glucose oxidase, an abundant saliva protein, was deposited on the leaf when caterpillars fed there. The effect of caterpillar saliva on maize defense gene expression was determined by allowing ablated (no saliva) and non-ablated (saliva present) caterpillars to feed in the maize whorl. The results showed that feeding by unablated caterpillars significantly increased the expression of plant genes involved in jasmonate biosynthesis pathway and direct defenses. Furthermore, saliva-induced bioassay showed that compared to plants fed on unablated larvae, plants fed by ablated larvae did not induce sufficient direct defense to significantly retard larval growth. Furthermore, the saliva-responsive maize protein profile has been identified from the proteomics analysis. The results of this study show that caterpillar saliva is an important elicitor for triggering herbivore defenses in maize. Another research project was to discover a new way to find plant proteins that defend against insect herbivores. Some important plant defense proteins have been found that can resist digestive proteases in the insect gut and are eliminated in the frass. We used mass spectrometry to identify several maize proteins in fall armyworm frass that may play a role in herbivore defense, including ribosome-inactivating protein 2 (RIP2). Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) act by depurinating residues on ribosomal RNA and thereby inhibit translation. Since RIP2 was found in frass, we proposed that it might be involved in defending maize from herbivore attack. Immunoblot analysis indicated that RIP2 is initially synthesized as an inactive proenzyme that can be cleaved to the active form by larval gut extracts. Also, results indicated that the expression of RIP2 was induced by FAW larval feeding, but not mechanical wounding. The proenzyme form of RIP2 was detected in 13 maize inbred lines and two teosinte subspecies. This data indicates that RIP2 expression in response to insect feeding is a wide spread phenomenon in maize. Quantitative-RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis indicated that RIP2 is rapidly induced (1 hour) following caterpillar attack and remains at the wound sites for four days after caterpillar removal. Phytohormone application assays determined that RIP2 expression was regulated by several different phytohormones, including ethylene, JA and ABA. It appears that there is no consistent pattern of hormonal regulation of RIP-like protein expression. The expression profile of RIP2 in maize vegetative stage was examined. The data showed that RIP2 is expressed locally and during maize vegetative development. Furthermore, when purified recombinant RIP2 was directly tested against fall armyworm larvae in bioassays, the data indicated that the amount of RIP2 typically found in the leaf after caterpillar attack could significantly retard caterpillar growth. We concluded that RIP2 plays an important role in protecting maize against insect herbivores. With these two studies, I was able to take a further step toward understanding the interaction of plant-insect relationship.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7089], "author_name_tesi": "Chuang, Wen-po ", "last_name_ssi": "Chuang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wen-po", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dawn S Luthe", "Surinder Chopra", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "John Edward Carlson", "Yinong Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dawn S Luthe, Dissertation Advisor", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Member", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Member", "John Edward Carlson, Committee Member", "Yinong Yang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plant-insect interaction", "maize(Zea mays)", "fall armyworm(Spodoptera frugiperda)", "saliva", "ribosome-inactivating protein 2(RIP2)"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Synthesis, Morphology And Dynamics \nof Polyureas And Their Lithium Ionomers\n", "id": "28068", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11459", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Electrolytes currently used in commercial lithium ion batteries have led to leakage and safety issues. Solvent-free solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) offering high energy density are promising materials for lithium battery applications. SPEs require high modulus to separate the electrodes and suppress lithium dendrite growth. Microphase separation of the hard segments in amorphous polyureas (PUs) yields materials with higher moduli than typical low glass transition temperature (Tg) polymers. In this dissertation, several families of solution polymerized polyether-based PU ionomers were synthesized and their thermal, morphology and dynamic properties characterized as a function of chemical composition. \n\t In the initial phase of this investigation, polyethylene oxide (PEO) diamines (with molecular weights = 200, 600, 1050, 2000, 3000 and 6000 g/mol) were polymerized with 4,4\u2019 methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). PUs with 200 and 600 g/mol PEO soft segments are amorphous and single phase. The amorphous PU having 1050 g/mol PEO segments exhibits a small degree of phase separation, as demonstrated by X-ray scattering. PUs with 2000, 3000 and 6000 g/mol PEO soft segments are semi-crystalline and their melting points and degrees of crystallinity are lower than those of the precursor PEO diamines due to their attachment to rigid hard segments.\n\tEven though polypropylene oxide (PPO) does not dissolve cations as efficiently as PEO, PPO is not crystallizable and was chosen to create a second family of amorphous PUs. PPO-containing diamines ((Jeff400 (MW = 400 g/mol) and Jeff2000 (MW = 2000 g/mol)) and MDI were chosen as the neutral soft segment and the hard segment, respectively. 2,5-diaminobenzene sulfonate was successfully synthesized and used for preparing ionomers. The amount of ionic species in these ionomers was varied and quantified using 1H-NMR. Single Tgs were observed and they increased with increasing ionic content. No X-ray scattering peaks corresponding to microphase separation of hard and soft segments were detected, nor were ordered hydrogen bonded carbonyl bands in FTIR spectra, demonstrating that the Jeff400 PUs are single phase. Using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS), segmental relaxation temperatures also increase with increasing ionic species content.. Increasing the number of ionic groups increases the hard segment content, which results in higher DSC Tgs and slower fmaxs for the segmental relaxation processes.\n\tFor the non-ionic and all of the ionic Jeff2000 PU samples that contain some non-ionic soft segments, low temperature Tgs were observed that arise from microphase separated soft phases. X-ray scattering peaks related to microphase separation and ordered hydrogen bonded carbonyl bands were observed, reinforcing the conclusion of hard/soft segment segregation. The DRS segmental relaxation is associated with soft phase relaxation, with some of the ion dipoles participating in this process for the ionic samples. The ionomers could not be dialyzed due to water insolubility, but were purified by multiple precipitation in deionize water. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that the observed conductivity primarily arises from ionic impurities.  \n\tA third family of PU ionomers was synthesized using an amorphous polypropylene oxide-b- polyethylene oxide-b-polypropylene oxide diamine (ED900, MW = 900 g/mol, 68% EO) and 2,5-diaminobenzene sulfonate. Hexamethylene diisocyanate was utilized as the hard segment as its high packing efficiency is known to facilitate microphase separation. The non-ionic ED900 PU and its ionomers with various ion contents were successfully synthesized. Low Tgs due to segregation of soft segments, X-ray scattering peaks related to microphase separation between segments, and ordered hydrogen bonded carbonyl bands were detected. Tapping mode atomic force microscopy was also used to explore the morphology of these microphase separated materials. DRS segmental relaxations are associated with soft phase. These materials were extensively dialyzed and their low conductivities suggest that the lithium ions are primarily trapped in hard domains.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10976], "author_name_tesi": "Chuayprakong, Sunanta ", "last_name_ssi": "Chuayprakong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sunanta", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt", "Ralph H Colby", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Enrique Daniel Gomez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt, Dissertation Advisor", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Enrique Daniel Gomez, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polyureas", "Ionomers", "Synthesis", "Morphology", "Dynamics", "Nanotechnology"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "INTERPRETING THE SPECTRAL SIGNATURES OF SURFACE-ENHANCED RAMAN SCATTERING", "id": "rn3011364", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12778", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Molecules may be uniquely identified through the inelastic light scattering process known as Raman scattering.\nThe Raman scattered intensities are often weak, but may be enhanced by several orders of magnitude--through the\nprocess known as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)--by placing the molecules near the surface of metallic nanoparticles. Through SERS, we can detect the scattering from a single molecule, which means that the technique is useful for the ultra-sensitive detection of chemical and biological agents. However, the SERS signals are often very different from the signals of normal Raman scattering, as they now reflect the various interactions of the molecule(s) with the nanoparticle. Understanding these spectral changes are, therefore, vital in both identifying the probed molecule, and in understanding and extracting information of the molecule's interaction with the surface. To understand these changes, we have developed the dressed-tensors formalism that takes into account the interaction of the molecule with the inhomogeneous local electric fields from the nanoparticle. With this method, we show that the field gradient contribution to the spectral changes often reflect the relative orientation of the molecule with respect to the surface. This result, coupled with the dynamics of the probed molecule, suggests that the translational and rotational motions of a single molecule may be tracked through its SERS spectral changes.\nWe have also extended this method to describe other types of surface-enhanced spectroscopies, namely Raman optical activity (ROA), which is sensitive to chiral structures and used to probe the behavior of biomolecules in solution, and circular dichroism (CD), which is often used to investigate the secondary structure of proteins. For surface-enhanced ROA (SEROA), we find that spectral changes are highly sensitive to the local electric field gradient, the orientation of the molecule, and the surface plasmon frequency width, giving insight into why mirror-image SEROA is yet to be observed for enantiomers. We also find that the spectral signatures of plasmonic CD are similarly complicated. However, this electromagnetic fields description of the enhancement is insufficient at describing the spectral changes for certain chemical systems. We find that, at low temperatures and for single or few molecules, the observed shift of particular normal modes may be reflective of the specific binding interactions of the molecule with the surface. In the case of resonant single molecule SERS of rhodamine-6G, we show that the relative intensity fluctuations are independent of the orientation of the molecule, but may rather describe picometer changes in its excited state geometry. These results indicate that we need a rigorous method to account for the quantum mechanical interactions between the molecule and the surface. To this end, we have developed an exact subsystem density functional theory (DFT) method that can exactly reproduce the supermolecular energies and densities of a wide range of systems, including covalently bonded subsystems. We have also extended this method to the time-dependent DFT regime, and show that we can accurately reproduce supermolecular excitation energies of strongly coupled subsystems. The spectral changes observed in SERS contain a lot of information of the molecule-nanoparticle interactions, and the methods developed here have allowed---and will continue to allow---us to interpret these changes.

College and university counseling centers are faced with the challenge of providing psychological treatment for students facing a variety of mental health concerns. In order to improve treatment for college students, it could be helpful to identify therapeutic approaches that may facilitate change and improve outcomes. Two psychological problems for which college students seek treatment are depression and eating concerns, and symptoms of these can lead to risky behaviors such as suicide attempts in clients with depression and physical health problems associated with eating disorders. Previous research has shown that maladaptive perfectionism is associated with depression and eating disorders, and can precede and/or exacerbate symptoms. The concept of self-compassion involves approaching failure with kindness, viewing failure as part of the human experience, and practicing mindfulness. Although research has demonstrated the links between maladaptive perfectionism, self-compassion, depression, and eating disorders, less is known about potential mediators within these relationships. The current study examined self-compassion as a mediator of the link between maladaptive perfectionism and both depressive symptoms and eating concerns in a sample of treatment-seeking college students. In line with a recent study that supported a two-factor model of self-compassion, which identified self-disparagement and self-care as distinct factors, the mediation models in the current study were tested for both factors. Results supported all of the mediation models and demonstrated that self-disparagement in particular explained a significant amount of the variance in depression. While self-disparagement explained a significant amount of the variance in eating concerns, self-disparagement explained more of the variance in depression than in eating concerns. Examining the relative influence of each variable, results demonstrated that maladaptive perfectionism explained the most variance in outcome (i.e., depression and eating concerns), followed by self-compassion (i.e., self-disparagement and self-care), and then the interaction of self-compassion and gender. Additionally, the mediation models were also significant for the generalized anxiety, social anxiety, academic, family, and hostility subscales, but not for substance use. Differences among the three types of perfectionists indicated that adaptive perfectionists reported the highest levels of self-compassion, maladaptive perfectionists reported the lowest levels of self-compassion, and self-compassion in non-perfectionists fell in between. \n\t", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16164], "author_name_tesi": "Chun-Kennedy, Caitlin Lorraine", "last_name_ssi": "Chun-Kennedy", "middle_name_ssi": "Lorraine", "first_name_ssi": "Caitlin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counseling Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Bieschke", "Kathleen Bieschke", "Jeffrey Hayes", "Benjamin D Locke", "Stephanie A Shields"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Bieschke, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathleen Bieschke, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Hayes, Committee Member", "Benjamin D Locke, Committee Member", "Stephanie A Shields, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["self-compassion", "self-disparagement", "self-care", "maladaptive perfectionism", "depression", "eating concerns", "college student mental health", "CCMH"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Development of Planning and Design Phases of an Integrative Building Lifecycle Process Model for Advanced Energy Retrofit Projects", "id": "22849", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10261", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Advanced Energy Retrofit (AER) projects provide an opportunity for significant energy savings for existing buildings. They can reduce the overall environmental impact of existing facilities, while also providing long-term economic savings to the facility owner. The planning and design phases of an AER project play a significant role in defining the success or failure of the project. The process for delivering AER projects can be complex, and it is important to effectively design the delivery process to enable the design solution to effectively reduce energy consumption. \nThis research focused on the development of an efficient and structured process for performing AER projects. It also identified the level of system integration and team collaboration that can occur in retrofit projects that are focused on reducing the energy consumption in existing buildings. A baseline Integrative Building Lifecycle Process Model (IBLPM) for the planning and design phases of retrofit buildings was developed by using literature on building systems and retrofit approaches. The baseline process model was then analyzed and validated using three detailed case studies. Two scales of retrofit projects were chosen for case study project.  They included comprehensive and medium scale retrofits that contain scope for team collaboration and building system integration.\nAfter performing all the case studies, it was identified that the processes followed by both scales of retrofit projects is similar, although there were clear differences in the level of detail in the activities that were performed on the different scales of projects. A protocol that includes the validation outcomes and the evaluation criteria was developed and used to create the final planning and design phases of the IBLPM. The planning phase process map of the IBLPM gives a high level overview of the activities that needs to be performed by the owner and the project team members. The design phase process map of the IBLPM is more detailed and contains the activities that occur throughout the different phases of the integrative design process. \nThe final outcome, the planning and design phases of the IBLPM, will aid project teams in the implementation of repeatable, consistent retrofit processes, along with the identification of important information exchanges that take place between the project participants. The IBLPM also identifies collaborative activities that need to be performed between a series of defined integrative workshops.

This study examines the terrestrial bulk organic carbon isotope record to evaluate factors influencing \u03b413C changes and their variability. The differences in CIE magnitudes provide an opportunity to investigate the carbon cycle in soils during the PETM.

Then, an affinely adjustable robust linear programming model is derived to study the multi-period problem. As an application area, we propose a methodology to generate a robust logistics plan that can mitigate demand uncertainty in humanitarian relief supply chains using a CTM based system optimum dynamic traffic assignment (SO DTA) model. Next, the proposed framework for SO DTA is extended to a dynamic network design problem. Finally, we consider robust congestion pricing problems under user equilibrium in static networks and extend it to consider robust dynamic user equilibrium optimal toll, which is formulated as a differential mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (DMPEC). Also, a cutting plane algorithm and a simulated annealing algorithm are proposed to solve the DMPEC problems.\nTheoretically, the tractability and conservativeness of robust counterparts are discussed. Also, numerical experiments show that the robust optimization approach leads to high quality solutions compared to the deterministic problem or the sampling based stochastic problem. The results of the numerical experiments justify the modeling advantage of the robust optimization approach and provide useful managerial insights, which may have wider applicability in supply chain and transportation networks.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [793], "author_name_tesi": "Chung, Byung Do ", "last_name_ssi": "Chung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Byung Do", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tao Yao", "Tao Yao", "Terry Lee Friesz", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Venkataraman Shankar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tao Yao, Dissertation Advisor", "Tao Yao, Committee Chair", "Terry Lee Friesz, Committee Chair", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Member", "Venkataraman Shankar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dynamic traffic assignment", "Supply chain and transportation networks", "Robust optimization", "Demand uncertainty"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Strategies to Overcome Drug Resistance in Melanoma", "id": "19099", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9191", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "  B-Raf is the most mutated gene in melanoma.  The most common V600E mutation constitutively activates the MAP kinase-signaling cascade.  The recently FDA approved selective V600EB-Raf inhibitor, Vemurafenib, gave great promise for patients with metastatic disease and exhibited manageable toxicity; however, most of the patients eventually developed more aggressive resistant tumors.  \n\n  The focus of this dissertation is to identify molecular mechanisms leading to resistance for B-Raf targeting agents, such as Vemurafenib and B-Raf siRNA, in order to develop therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance in melanoma.  We found that agents targeting V600EB-Raf decrease expression levels of the tetraspanin CD82 (a tumor metastasis suppressor) leading to more aggressive cell invasion for resistance development.  Here, B-Raf targeting agents are shown to increase expression of DNA methyltransferases leading to CD82 promoter methylation, decreasing CD82 expression, and promoting integrin expression for cell attachment on extracellular matrix (ECM) under flow conditions.  Decreased CD82 increases the invasive migratory potential of melanoma cells through vessel walls to enhance lung metastases development.  CD82 promoter methylation could be reversed using the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (Decitabine), suggesting that the combination of agents might overcome melanoma spread in patients.\n  Deregulated PI3 and MAP kinase pathways promote early melanocytic lesion development and confer drug resistance.  Few treatment options are available to target these deregulated pathways to prevent cutaneous non-invasive melanocytic cells or invasive melanomas from developing into more aggressive, widely-disseminated metastatic disease.  In this dissertation study, we examined the ability of a selenium containing compound called PBISe to moderate these two major signaling pathways to prevent cutaneous melanocytic lesion or metastatic melanoma development.  Topical PBISe treatment inhibited melanocytic lesion development in laboratory-generated skin by 70-80% and in animal skin by ~50% through targeting both the Akt3 and MAPK pathways.  Thus, PBISe treatment has the potential to treat non-invasive melanocytic lesions and invasive metastatic melanoma development in skin.\n  The Vemurafenib resistance mechanisms are complex.  We also found that the Vemurafenib-mediated ERK1/2 negative feedback loop inhibits tumor suppressor Sprouty4 and increases Akt3 activity, ultimately leading to the development of drug-resistant melanomas.  In this study, combining Vemurafenib with sigma receptor-targeted LPD (Liposomal-Polycation-DNA) nanoparticles containing Akt3 siRNA and suppressor Sprouty4 plasmid simultaneously inhibits the MAPK and Akt3 signaling cascades.  The combination-mediated inhibition prevents the development of resistant tumors in xenografted mice.  Further, the novel melanoma cell-targeting nanoparticle LPD can also carry potential siRNA to silence genes that lead to drug resistance.  Therefore, this nanoparticle based agent has important potential for development as an effective agent for combating recurrent resistant disease.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9012], "author_name_tesi": "Chung, Chin-ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Chung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chin-ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Toxicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gavin Peter Robertson", "Gavin Peter Robertson", "Gary Alan Clawson", "Rogerio I Neves", "Jiyue Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gavin Peter Robertson, Dissertation Advisor", "Gavin Peter Robertson, Committee Chair", "Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Member", "Rogerio I Neves, Special Member", "Jiyue Zhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Melanoma", "B-Raf(V600E)", "Vemurafenib", "Epigenetics", "Cell invasion", "Integrin"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "VORTICITY DYNAMICS IN THE LEADING EDGE VORTEX ON REVOLVING WINGS", "id": "13854hxc5287", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13854", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The presence of a stable leading edge vortex(LEV) is the most distinguishing feature of flapping wing flight.

This research is focused on the fundamental condition of the stable LEV in revolving wings, which represent the stable rotating phases of flapping wings. A revolving rectangular wing with constant angle of attack and rotational speed is simulated in queiscent fluid. By changing Reynolds number and aspect ratio of the wing, relative magnitudes of every term of di erent vorticity transport mechanisms are investigated by calculating the terms in the vorticity transport equation. As a result, tilting of the planetary vorticity due to a vertical gradient of spanwise flow(PVTr) is found to assist the stability of LEV by canceling out a portion of vorticity.

However, some researchers do not utilize plausible values as recommended by the survey institutions due to difficulties in handling plausible values. There are inconsistent research findings regarding the different short-cut treatments of plausible values, such as using the mean or only one of the plausible values. Specially, it is not completely clear under what conditions and what estimation results would be inaccurate. Therefore, more studies are needed to resolve the inconsistent findings regarding different treatments of plausible values. \nThis study intends to examine the effects of misusing plausible values, and explore whether the effects vary depending on the role of plausible values in the model. Differences between each of the shortcut methods (average or one of the plausible values) and the recommended method were examined with respect to parameter estimates, standard error estimates, confidence intervals, and statistical significance test results by replicating models in two published studies while considering the role of plausible values in the analysis models. Moreover, changes in rank ordering of the PISA 2012 country means due to estimation with these different treatments of plausible values were investigated.    \nResults showed that point estimates were quite robust to the misuses of plausible values when they were dependent variables but standard errors tended to be slightly underestimated even though statistical test results were not affected. When plausible values were used as independent variables, their misuse produced different statistical test result for a parameter. Rank orders for some of the 2012 PISA country means also changed depending on treatment of plausible values. The findings demonstrate that it is safer to use plausible values as recommended by the survey developers when one can. However using shortcut treatments of plausible values could be a viable option under certain conditions such as software limitations and difficulty in implementation given the minor differences in analysis results.

Oral secretions play a critical role in mediating induced plant defenses. Here, I investigated the effects of OS from Colorado potato beetles (CPB) on the manipulation of induced defenses in tomato. First, I investigate the specificity of induced defenses in response to OS from lepidopteran species, tobacco hornworm (THW), and coleopteran species, CPB. I found that OS from CPB decreased defense gene transcripts compared with wounded control plants but OS from THW increased defense responses. This suggests that the specific response of induced defenses is attributed to OS from the herbivores. Next, I explored the underlying mechanisms of defense suppression by OS from CPB. Because herbivores possess microbial symbionts and herbivore-associated microbes could change plant physiology, I investigated the effects of symbiotic microbes from CPB on plant defenses. I found that the symbiotic bacteria were secreted in OS during herbivory. By perceiving the beetle's attack as a microbial one, plants induced ineffective defense responses against CPB. The defense suppression was dependent on negative crosstalk between JA and SA signaling pathways. Finally, I investigated whether manipulation of induced defenses by the symbiotic bacteria from CPB occur in wild and cultivated Solanum plants. I found that antagonism between JA and SA was present in Solanum plants. In addition, the symbiotic bacteria suppressed defense responses in Solanum plants, suggesting that defense suppression by the symbiotic bacteria could help CPB adapt to host plants. This is the first study to demonstrate that herbivore-associated microbes manipulate plant defenses. This research will contribute to the understanding of how herbivore-associated microbes mediate the complex interactions between plant and insect.

The SEC and the financial press have raised concerns about pressure on analysts from institutional clients to express views in line with clients\u2019 positions in their recommendations.  Of analysts\u2019 institutional clients, hedge fund managers are the most important to analysts because of the large commissions hedge funds generate.  If these lucrative clients pressure analysts, I expect that it would be difficult for analysts to remain independent.  My results reveal that, after controlling for future earnings surprises, analysts\u2019 recommendations are likely either Buy or Strong Buy when hedge funds have large long positions.  I also find that those optimistic recommendations for stocks in which hedge funds have large long positions have negative future returns, indicating that those optimistic recommendations are overly optimistic.  \nI argue that the recommendations for stocks in which hedge funds have large long positions lead to negative returns because analysts do not downgrade their recommendations in a timely manner when their profitable clients sell these stocks.  Consistent with this argument, further analysis shows that hedge fund managers start selling their stocks when analysts\u2019 recommendations are optimistic and that analysts downgrade their recommendations after hedge fund managers sell stocks.  Cross-sectional analysis uncovers that compared to other analysts, analysts at top ten prime brokers such as Goldman Sachs, Bear Sterns, and Lehman Brothers are almost 40% more likely to downgrade their recommendations in the quarters following stock sales by the 100 largest hedge funds.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5924], "author_name_tesi": "Chung, Sung Gon ", "last_name_ssi": "Chung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sung Gon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Orie Edwin Barron", "Orie Edwin Barron", "Bin Ke", "Henock Louis", "Laura B Field"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Orie Edwin Barron, Dissertation Advisor", "Orie Edwin Barron, Committee Chair", "Bin Ke, Committee Member", "Henock Louis, Committee Member", "Laura B Field, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hedge funds", "sell-side research analysts"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Exploring Computational Sustainability via Differential Variational Inequalities", "id": "12387", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5934", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sustainability is a widely accepted paradigm for better future in governmental as well as non-governmental organizations.

Modularity has long been a technique used to incorporate life cycle considerations into product architecture design. Most modular design methods rely on predefined modularity measures to evaluate product architectures but lack the ability to assess life cycle consequences of these modules in a supply chain. This research proposes a new methodology\u2014the Architecture & Supply Chain Evaluation Method (ASCEM)\u2014to find an optimal modular architecture during the design stage which has both minimal life cycle costs (LCC) and the lowest environmental impact (EI). Unlike traditional methods, ASCEM expands the assessment scope from the product itself to its supply chain network.  The life cycle performance (LCC and EI) of a modular product in a closed-loop supply chain is adopted as the modularity measure to identify the best modular structure from a holistic life-cycle view. \nIn this work, a product is first mapped into a functional model represented by a component-and-interaction connectivity graph. Each component has unique attributes, and their interactions are functional existence, joining, and disjoining. The estimation of a product\u2019s LCC and EI is based on both the component attributes and the interactions between them. A model of existing processing facilities as a supply chain optimization model is created, and the model\u2019s parameters are adapted to various modular structures. This optimization model is used to evaluate the test product\u2019s minimal LCC and EI in the supply chain. To determine the optimal modular structure using this model, a heuristic is created to generate modular structures for evaluation. Using the ASCEM, a designer is then able to identify not only the most beneficial modular structure during the configuration design but also an optimal supply chain allocation for the identified modular structure. \nTwo existing products covered by the Waste of Electric and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive (refrigerator and coffee maker) are used to demonstrate ASCEM. For methodology validation, ASCEM is compared with a common modular design method (the Decomposition Approach) and subjected to an applicability test for product variety. \nThe results demonstrate that ASCEM can effectively and efficiently find a near-optimal modular structure with low LCC and EI for the tested products. Additionally, a preliminary sensitivity analysis of capacity levels in a closed-loop supply chain (investigating whether a product\u2019s reverse supply chain conditions significantly affect design decision making) reveals that reverse supply chain conditions ought to be considered in the modular design process. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7368], "author_name_tesi": "Chung, Wu-Hsun ", "last_name_ssi": "Chung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wu-Hsun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gul Kremer", "Richard Allen Wysk", "Gul Kremer", "Richard Allen Wysk", "Andris Freivalds", "Dr David Riley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gul Kremer, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Allen Wysk, Dissertation Advisor", "Gul Kremer, Committee Chair", "Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Chair", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "Dr David Riley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Design for Life Cycle", "Modular Design", "Closed-loop Supply Chain", "Sustainable Supply Chain"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "LIKELIHOOD-TUNED DENSITY ESTIMATOR AND ITS APPLICATION TO CLUSTERING", "id": "11149", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6827", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nonparametric density estimation is widely used for investigating underlying features of data. We introduce a likelihood enhanced nonparametric density estimator which arises from treating the kernel density estimator as an element of the model that consists of all mixtures of the kernel, continuous or discrete. One can obtain the kernel density estimator with \u201clikelihood-tuning\u201d by using the uniform density as the starting value in an EM algorithm. We prove algorithmic convergence of this EM algorithm to the nonparametric mixture maximum likelihood estimator. The second tuning step leads to a fitted density with higher likelihood than the kernel density estimator. This twice tuned density estimator reduces the bias of the kernel density estimator while the order of variance stays the same. Our simulation study shows that the second-tuned estimator performed robustly against the type of densities, but this feature tended to weaken relative to a competing estimator as the data dimension grew.\nAlong with the type of density estimators, the bandwidth selection problem is very crucial in the nonparametric density estimation, particularly in higher dimensions. We introduce a new bandwidth selection method using the spectral degrees of freedom in- troduced in Lindsay et al. (2008). Investigating the theoretical sDOF and simulation results, we found that the bandwidth need to increase proportionally to the square root of dimension if we are to achieve adequate smoothing in higher dimensions.\nWe also develop a penalized version of the likelihood-tuning procedure that allows the mixture model to adapt to local shape and scale features. This model gives the kernel density estimator with the t-kernel with the first tuning. The second penalized- tuning leads to a density estimator with local shape adaptation in the t-kernel function.

In the first study, a dry form of PG was supplemented either via top dressing it to the TMR or including it as a part of the total mixed ration (TMR) to 19 multiparous and 18 primiparous Holstein dairy cows immediately after parturition to 21 d after parturition. Propylene glycol fed either as a top dress or as a part of the TMR reduced plasma BHBA concentration and subsequent incidence rate of subclinical ketosis from 39 to 13%. The percent of cows that experienced multiple episodes of subclinical ketosis was also reduced from 53 to 14% during the first 3 wks of lactation. Propylene glycol fed as a top dress tended to increase the rate of milk production. In the second study, an additive effect of PG plus choline chloride was evaluated in 79 multiparous and 41 primiparous Holstein dairy heifers during the transition period (3 wks before to 3 wks after the parturition). Propylene glycol was fed as a dry form product via incorporating it into the TMR, and choline chloride was fed as rumen protected choline (RPC) via top dressing it onto the TMR. An additive effect of RPC plus dry PG was notable in reducing plasma BHBA concentration. Rumen protected choline tended to improve and/or maintain appetite during the transition period. Dairy cows that transition less optimally such as first-calf heifers may benefit from the beneficial additive effect of RPC plus dry PG. In the third study, a 12-h serial blood sampling was conducted to monitor serum insulin and blood metabolite responses to dry PG and RPC from 6 multiparous Holstein dairy cows in early lactation. Dry propylene glycol fed either by top dressing or mixing it into the TMR reduced plasma BHBA concentration which confirmed the lower plasma BHBA concentration observed in the first study when dry PG was top dressed and in the first and second studies when dry PG was incorporated into the TMR. Rumen protected choline stimulated and/or maintained DMI, and this increase in DMI by RPC likely reduced plasma NEFA concentration and subsequently increased milk yield. Concentration of insulin was similar between treatments at around 2 h after feeding. This similarity in the insulin concentration at 2 h after feeding can explain the similar insulin concentrations observed in the first study. The secretory pattern characteristic of insulin reinforces the importance of a serial blood sampling to accurately assess response of insulin to dietary treatment. In the fourth study, the effectiveness of dry PG via top dressing was compared to liquid PG via oral drenching and the effects of dry PG via incorporating it into the TMR in stimulating serum insulin and rumen and blood metabolite responses under a frequent feeding condition were studied in 8 rumen-cannulated multiparous Holstein dairy cows. Propylene glycol shifted rumen fermentation toward a more glucogenic environment without negatively affecting rumen fermentation and rumen N availability. Responses of rumen VFA profiles and blood insulin and glucose concentrations were highly dependent on the amount of PG that was available to the rumen at the time of sampling. Serum insulin and blood and rumen metabolites responded similarly to liquid or dry PG drench indicating that top dressing dry PG is as effective as oral drenching. In the last study, the gluconeogenicity of glycerol as a dry glycerin product was evaluated in 39 multiparous Holstein dairy cows during the first 3 wks of lactation. Glycerol fed as a top dress was glucogenic and tended to enhance gluconeogenesis. This glucogenic effect of glycerol however was too transient to elicit a significant lactational response during the first 3 wks of lactation likely due to the overall good health status of cows transitioning into lactation. Collectively, PG as a dry form product reduced plasma BHBA concentration and subsequent incidence rate of subclinical ketosis through its effect on shifting rumen VFA profiles toward a more glucogenic environment and therefore improving carbohydrate status of the cow. The efficacy of PG was highly dependent on the amount of PG that was available to the rumen. Dry propylene glycol fed as a top dress was as effective as oral liquid PG drenching and incorporating dry PG into the TMR could serve as an alternative to top dressing and drenching in stimulating serum insulin and blood and rumen metabolite responses. Glycerol can enhance gluconeogenesis in cows but its gluconeogenicity appears to be less than PG. Rumen protected choline had the potential to stimulate and/or maintain appetite for cows during the transition period. Rumen protected choline reduced plasma NEFA concentration and was additive to the effect of dry PG in reducing plasma BHBA concentration likely through its effect on feed intake.

Drawing upon discourse and ideologies about Confucian values and gender roles, this dissertation aims to investigate how those discourses and ideologies impact on my life living as a marginalized figure. The main research questions explored in this study were as follows: (1) What does it mean for a Korean graduate student mother to have a cross-cultural adaptation experience and how did I deal with some challenges and conflicts?, (2) How does my cross-cultural mothering experience contribute to the general understanding of feminism in the context of a diverse society?, and (3) How does my cross-cultural adaptation experience contribute to the general understanding on expatriates in the context of a diverse society?\nAs an international student coming from a Confucian-heritage culture, I found myself feeling uncomfortable with the non-power distance cultural aspects represented in American university; I made adaptive changes in attitudes during class, in addition to different student-faculty interactions, which seemed to require less obedience from the students and more active communication. My status as an international student was also a crucial factor influencing my decision about the timing of motherhood.

With the deep-rooted Confucian values both I and my family (including my in-laws) have internalized, however, I experienced a huge Confucian influence on my daily life in gender role expectations and parenthood style.\nWith every year, the population of the United States becomes increasingly ethnically diverse, and the number of female graduate students has been increasing as well. And yet, there has been little research on student mothers from different cultures or school policies to accommodate student-parents\u2019 needs. Thus, I hope my story offers policy makers, local community members, and other student mothers an insight into the particularities of a student mother of color\u2019s lived experiences and a push for changing the culture and climate toward diversity, while also suggest that women themselves need to keep trying to abolish the traditional Confucian patriarchal conceptions of society by transforming their own ways of thinking.

This process has been especially noticeable on the east coast of the United States where most areas have experienced significant anthropogenic disturbances to ecosystems. However, with the exception of historic logging, the Schoodic region of Hancock County, Maine, has escaped mostly unscathed; but there are indications that development of this area is imminent. Therefore, to minimize the loss of wildlife habitats this study aims to identify essential habitats and map species presence in established conservation areas. The result is a practical approach to developing and conserving essential wildlife corridors within this region. Sampling sites were determined by a stratified random method using land cover types and property boundaries. Field observations (e.g., photo trapping, timed searches) and rapid habitat assessments along with electrical circuit theory (Circuitscape) and least-cost corridor models were used to determine where corridors should be placed.    \nCorridor selection was based on habitat suitability grids for nine carnivores and five herptiles which were created using an improved land cover layer. Optimal corridors were chosen to provide a continuous path of lowest resistance and highest conductance possible for each species. These corridors were then overlaid using map algebra to create corridors that included the needs of multiple species. Establishing a separate corridor path for each taxonomic group proved to be the best plan of action since the outputs of both the Circuitscape and least-cost corridor models showed the paths to be dissimilar. However, all corridors were similar in that they required two road crossings and relied heavily on the habitats in and around a property that is destined for future development. Securing these habitat corridors will reduce the effects of human encroachment on wildlife populations as development encroaches. \nIn comparing the two models I noticed that Circuitscape seems to be more sensitive to movement barriers such as roads, whereas the least-cost corridor model does not identify these barriers as strongly. I recommend that until the utility of Circuitscape is better understood conservationists should use a mixed method approach to corridor design by using a combination of both Circuitscape and the least-cost corridor models. \n This study not only confirms the presence of multiple species and their habitat preferences, but it also provides an improved land cover layer, habitat suitability grids, and a comparison of two corridor models, which will all serve as a starting point for future work. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [394], "author_name_tesi": "Church, Alyssia ", "last_name_ssi": "Church", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alyssia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Brooks", "Robert P Brooks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Brooks, Thesis Advisor", "Robert P Brooks, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["habitat corridor", "wildlife conservation", "fragmentation", "landscape ecology", "connectivity", "habitat loss", "Schoodic Maine", "Circuitscape", "Least-cost"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SELF-GOVERNANCE, NORMALCY AND CONTROL:\nINMATE-PRODUCED MEDIA AT\nTHE LOUISIANA STATE PENITENTIARY AT ANGOLA\n\n", "id": "8754", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3498", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThis project explores the uses of inmate-produced media at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, an all-male maximum-security prison with an inmate population of 5,108 men, the majority of whom are serving life or life-equivalent sentences.

Chapters eight through ten are more historical and theoretically grounded and incorporate the research of past scholars with the new information obtained by this researcher.\nThe media, in addition to being a necessity for distributing information throughout the eighteen-thousand acre penitentiary, serve as cultural vessels for establishing community and normalcy and promoting and reinforcing Warden Burl Cain's philosophy of moral rehabilitation. They may also act as tools of resistance, advocating for inmate rights and judicial reform. Those men who engage in self-reflection and accept the tenets of moral rehabilitation may be afforded greater autonomy, and may achieve a sense of normalcy and become subjectified, ultimately being able to govern not only themselves, but also others.\nThis project also identifies the benefits, intrinsic and extrinsic, of working with the inmate-produced media. Those men involved with said media are afforded privileges and freedoms beyond those given to the average inmate, including the opportunity to leave the penitentiary for specific events. As producers of mass media, these select groups of men wield considerable influence in the control and maintenance of Angola, not unlike media producers in the 'free world.' Thus, the prison serves as a microcosm of the world in which we live, making the impact of the inmate-produced media and the implementation of governmentality all the more important to consider.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3483], "author_name_tesi": "Churcher, Kalen Mary Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Churcher", "middle_name_ssi": "Mary Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Kalen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeremy S Packer", "James Ford Risley", "Charles Elavsky", "Russell Frank", "Meredith Christine Doran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeremy S Packer, Committee Chair", "James Ford Risley, Committee Chair", "Charles Elavsky, Committee Member", "Russell Frank, Committee Member", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["inmate control", "self-governance", "governmentality", "Foucault", "inmate-produced media", "Angola", "Louisiana State Penitentiary"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Psychological Reprieve in the Symphonies of Ralph Vaughan Williams", "id": "28865", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12379", "abstract_tesi": "         The Vaughan Williams compositions that stand to yield the most to new analyses are those expressively adventurous works written during trying periods in the composer\u2019s life, especially the WWI years (Symphony No. 3) and those right before his death in 1958 (Symphony No. 9). Both pieces continually reference their morbid source material, WWI and Tess of the d\u2019Urbervilles, respectively. Although the music is frequently explained in terms of these sources, no examination begins with the composer and what internal processes may have influenced the composition of these works. \n         Seeking to fill this considerable gap in Vaughan Williams scholarship, my thesis explores how Vaughan Williams engages with the idea of psychological reprieve in the Pastoral Symphony (No. 3) and Symphony No. 9. In The Pastoral, I will show that Vaughan Williams removes himself from the war in which the work first germinated by including elements of a locus amoenus to provide distance and refuge from his traumatic memories of the trenches. In Symphony No. 9, I will identify various manifestations of the Freudian uncanny, the sensation that occurs when a once-suppressed idea re-emerges, in effect a failure to achieve full removal. This concept is particularly suitable for exploring R.V.W.\u2019s ninth effort, since this work, based on Hardy\u2019s Tess, brought the composer into contact with several elements that resurrected his primal fear of death. Though he, like all other humans, suppressed such eschatological fears, they appear to have come roaring back as he delved into Tess to compose his final symphony. \n         This work will feature an introduction, two central segments, and a conclusion. In the introduction, I will frame the compositions as outgrowths of their musical and socio-political environments. With the broader context established, I will investigate personal issues in the composer\u2019s life during the time of the Third and Ninth Symphonies. By examining these difficulties, I will be able to define how he would have imagined removal and why he needed it. \nFollowing the introduction, I will examine the Pastoral Symphony, first conceived in the trenches of WWI. Through a semiotic analysis of rotational circularity, harmonic stasis, and references to prelapsarian locales in the first three movements, I will show that Vaughan Williams created and populated a locus amoenus to remove himself from the war by providing an alternate place of pleasance. Proceeding to the fourth movement, I will show that, through an introduction-coda frame, Vaughan Williams redefines the purpose of the locus, using it instead to sequester semiotic references to his war. In effect, he creates an Ovidian locus terribilis and finds removal outside its boundaries.  \n         Section two examines Symphony No. 9 and the means by which Vaughan Williams articulates the Freudian Unheimliche (uncanny), the feeling of terror when a stimulus reawakens a primal, repressed fear, in this case, death. The musical uncanny will be explored by evaluating common elements in musical segments depicting Stonehenge, the \u201cghost drummer of Salisbury Plain,\u201d and the bells that signals Tess\u2019 execution, all experiences that would trigger uncanny sensations, some of which directly connect to the composer\u2019s life. R.V.W. wrote of an uncanny sensation when he first saw Stonehenge, and later lived near the monument on Salisbury Plain (he was billeted there during WWI). He also includes references to the South Tidworth poltergeist, or the \u201cghost drummer of Salisbury Plain,\u201d a legend with which he would have been familiar, and replicates Clare and Liza Lu\u2019s interaction with the chimes that signaled Tess\u2019s execution. By telling the Tess story, we soon discover that the aging composer composed a largely autobiographical work, one that struggles to provide the same reprieve he created in the Pastoral.\n\tThis research demonstrates that Vaughan Williams musically articulates his attempts at psychological refuge, whether they are successful or unfruitful. This study is one of the first works to examine the works of Ralph Vaughan Williams through semiotic and psychoanalytic lenses, and thereby hopes to begin a trend of critical theoretical approaches to R.V.W.\u2019s compositions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11750], "author_name_tesi": "Churchill, Jonathan David", "last_name_ssi": "Churchill", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Musicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Dowell Youmans", "Taylor Aitken Greer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Dowell Youmans, Thesis Advisor", "Taylor Aitken Greer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vaughan Williams", "Reprieve", "Symphony No. 3", "Symphony No. 9"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Prevalence of Insomnia in Perimenopausal Women Transitioning to Menopause", "id": "24958", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11071", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Background/Significance: Insomnia in adults contributes to poor health outcomes such as myocardial infarction and obesity.  Evidence consistently suggests a predisposition to insomnia in women; yet, there is a paucity of research that addresses insomnia in a high-risk group of women \u2013 perimenopausal women transitioning to menopause.  Perimenopause will affect 500 million women within the next decade. Studies of individual sleep symptoms in perimenopausal women are abundant; few studies, however, address such symptoms from the perspective of diagnosable insomnia in perimenopausal women.  \nStudy Purpose: The primary aim of the study was to describe the prevalence of insomnia in perimenopausal women progressing to menopause. Two secondary aims were also addressed; (1) to examine if there is a difference in self-reported insomnia/insomnia symptoms between perimenopausal stages, and (2) to identify independent predictors of influence on chronic insomnia among perimenopausal women.   \nTheoretical Framework: The Perimenopausal Insomnia Symptom Management Model (PISMM), an adaptation of the Spielman 3 P Model of Insomnia and the Symptom Management Theory (SMT) was used to guide this study.  The SMT and 3 P Model of Insomnia, when combined, address the essence of the subjective and objective experience of sleep symptoms and insomnia among perimenopausal women.\nMethods: A secondary analysis of publically-available data from the Study of Women\u2019s Health Across the Nation, a multisite, longitudinal study of the natural history of menopause (N=3302) was conducted. The purpose of the Study of Women\u2019s Health Across the Nation was to describe the chronology of the biological and psychological characteristics of the menopausal transition on health and risk factors for age-related chronic illnesses; survey and biophysical data were collected at baseline and 13 annual intervals. For the secondary analysis, survey data (baseline and 10 annual data points) were analyzed.  Self-reported sleep symptoms survey data were used to examine the prevalence of insomnia as defined by American Academy of Sleep Medicine insomnia criteria. The primary outcome variables were four insomnia symptoms: difficulty falling asleep, sleep latency,  awakenings from sleep, wake after sleep onset, and sleep quality. Descriptive analysis of all variables for each study interval was completed. Repeated measures logistic regression was used to identify if insomnia symptoms change over time by perimenopausal stage.  Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of influence on chronic insomnia defined in this study as the presence of insomnia symptoms for two consecutive data collection points.\nResults: The sample (n=3302) were middle aged (45.9 \u00b1 2.69) women with high school or more education at baseline survey.  Most of the sample was married (65%), mid-high income (78.1%), and of diverse race/ethnicity. Insomnia was present in at least one third or more of perimenopausal women at any point in the transition period (31%-42%). Awakenings were the most frequently reported insomnia symptom (31%); increased sleep latency was least frequently reported (14%); and wake after sleep onset (15%) was reported half as often as awakenings.  Self-reported sleep quality (restless or very restless sleep) did not significantly worsen over the ten year study period. Insomnia symptoms were worse and more prevalent in the late stage of perimenopause compared to early perimenopausal stage (p<0.0001).  The odds of having any one symptom of insomnia were 1.3 times greater for those in late stage versus early stage of perimenopause (95% CI [1.2, 1.5]; p<0.001).  The odds of developing chronic insomnia were 1.5 times greater for those in perimenopause than pre-perimenopausal status at baseline (95% CI (1.3, 1.8); p<0.001). Other important factors of influence for chronic insomnia among PM were: night sweats (p<0.001), depression (p<0.001), higher body mass index (p<0.001), weekly exercise (p=0.005), and younger age (p=0.001).\nConclusions & Implications: The study addressed the prevalence of insomnia in perimenopausal women transitioning to menopause specifically identifying insomnia as highly prevalent in perimenopausal women, significantly more severe insomnia in late stage perimenopausal women, and risk factors for chronic insomnia in perimenopausal women. Perimenopausal women are at risk for developing chronic insomnia when compared to pre-perimenopausal women. Insomnia in perimenopausal women is under-recognized and under-diagnosed; screening for insomnia symptoms by healthcare providers is a necessity to potentially reduce the burden of insomnia among perimenopausal women. The study findings highlight the importance of continued research addressing insomnia in this population and suggest new clinical implications for symptom management in perimenopausal women.  Insights for designing/testing interventions to improve the sleep and long-term health of perimenopausal women are suggested. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10644], "author_name_tesi": "Ciano, Colleen Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Ciano", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Colleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Amy M Sawyer", "Judith E Hupcey", "Tonya King", "Kristen H Kjerulff", "Robin Redmon Wright"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Amy M Sawyer, Dissertation Advisor", "Judith E Hupcey, Committee Chair", "Tonya King, Committee Member", "Kristen H Kjerulff, Committee Member", "Robin Redmon Wright, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Perimenopause", "Insomnia", "Sleep", "Mid-life", "Women", "Surgical menopause", "Sleep Latency", "Wake After Sleep Onset", "Sleep Quality"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Learning impairment in honey bees caused by agricultural spray adjuvants\n", "id": "12003", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6183", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Spray adjuvants are often applied to crops in conjunction with agricultural pesticides in order to boost the efficacy of the active ingredient(s).  The adjuvants themselves are largely assumed to be biologically inert and are therefore subject to minimal scrutiny and toxicological testing by regulatory agencies.  Honey bees are exposed to a wide array of pesticides as they conduct normal foraging operations, meaning that they are likely exposed to spray adjuvants as well.  It was previously unknown whether these agrochemicals have any deleterious effects on honey bee behavior.  The proboscis extension reflex (PER) assay was used to measure the olfactory learning ability of honey bees treated orally with sublethal doses of the most widely used spray adjuvants on almonds in the Central Valley of California.  Olfactory learning is important for foraging honey bees because it allows them to exploit the most productive floral resources in an area at any given time.  Any impairment of this learning ability may have serious implications for foraging efficiency at the colony level.  Several of the most widely used adjuvants from each of three different adjuvant classes (nonionic surfactants, crop oil concentrates, and organosilicone surfactants) were investigated in this study.\n\nLearning was impaired after ingestion of 20 \u00b5g organosilicone surfactant, indicating harmful effects on honey bees caused by agrochemicals previously believed to be innocuous.  Organosilicones were more active than the nonionic adjuvants, while the crop oil concentrates were inactive.  Ingestion was required for the tested adjuvant to have an effect on learning, as exposure via antennal contact only induced no level of impairment.  A decrease in percent conditioned response after ingestion of organosilicone surfactants, which has been demonstrated here for the first time, may be an indication of severe, colony-level impacts.  Organosilicone spray adjuvants may therefore play a vital role in the ongoing losses that characterize Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD).\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6176], "author_name_tesi": "Ciarlo, Timothy Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Ciarlo", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Albert Mullin", "Christopher Albert Mullin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Albert Mullin, Thesis Advisor", "Christopher Albert Mullin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["associative learning", "proboscis extension reflex", "organosilicone", "adjuvant", "colony collapse disorder"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Exploratory qualitative case study of lab-type activity interactions in an online graduate geoscience course", "id": "22434", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10240", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This exploratory qualitative case study investigated the use of lab-type activities in an online graduate geoscience course.

The biosynthesis of this cofactor involves the insertion of two sulfur atoms into two completely unactivated carbon atoms of protein bound octanoyl groups.  Lipoyl synthase, the protein thought to catalyze sulfur insertion, has been cloned and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography.  Indeed, both lipoyl synthase and biotin synthase belong to a superfamily of enzymes that use S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) and iron sulfur clusters to generate high-energy carbon-centered radicals that are intermediates in catalysis.  Proteins that are members of this superfamily have a conserved iron sulfur cluster-binding motif consisting of cysteine residues in a CX3CX2C pattern.

Cofilin/actin rods (rods) have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, but the precise molecular composition and regulation remain unclear.  Classically, rods are thought to be composed of F-actin filaments bound with cofilin.  Here, we show that enhancing actin polymerization during cofilin rod induction does not exacerbate rod but rather inhibits cofilin rod formation.  Cofilin rods even form and persist after substantial actin depolymerization.  Live fluorescence imaging of rods reveals highly concentrated cofilin but not G-actin.  Thus, we propose that cofilin rods are composed of cofilin filaments bound with G-actin, not the opposite. Consistent with our hypothetical model, cofilin rods can be dissolved by LIM kinase (LIMK), which phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin.  Dephosphorylation of cofilin by the phosphatase slingshot increases cofilin rod formation. The formation of cofilin rods in postsynaptic dendritic branches leads to local disassembly of pre- and postsynaptic components, and disrupts intracellular organelle trafficking.  Moreover, dissolution of rods by LIMK restores pre- and postsynaptic proteins at distal dendrites.  We conclude that cofilin, not actin, is the core component of rod structures, and the removal of cofilin rods by LIMK may facilitate potential clinical treatments of neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2841], "author_name_tesi": "Cichon, Joseph Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Cichon", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Gong Chen", "Gong Chen", "Bernhard Luscher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Gong Chen, Thesis Advisor", "Gong Chen, Thesis Advisor", "Bernhard Luscher, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cofilin", "actin", "LIM kinase", "cytoskeleton", "synapse"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Within and Between Family Associations in Attitudes, Behaviors, and Perceptions in the Parent-Adult Offspring Relationship", "id": "7587", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3384", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores the extent to which parents and offspring influence one another when both parties are in adulthood. Using data from The Adult Family Study, the following three papers examine in adulthood constructs previously studied in childhood and adolescence. Participants included 158 African American and European American men and women (aged 22 to 49 years), their mothers, and their fathers (N = 474). Parents and offspring participated in separate telephone interviews as well as in-person videotaped joint interviews. The first paper examines generational differences in gender attitudes between parents and offspring, including the extent to which generational differences vary by offspring gender or ethnicity. As expected, adult offspring were less traditional in their gender attitudes than parents, although there were greater generational differences in attitudes between mothers and daughters and in European American families. The second paper explores generational and gender differences in demand, withdraw, and dominant behaviors observed between adults and their parents during videotaped discussions. Offspring were videotaped separately with their mothers and fathers discussing what annoys them about each other and independent raters coded the videotapes for demand, withdraw, and dominant behaviors. As expected, offspring withdrew more than both their parents. Mothers were more demanding and dominating compared to fathers and daughters were more dominating than sons. Observed behaviors were also associated with self-reported relationship quality and well-being. Offspring and parents who demanded more also described their relationships as more negative. Offspring with more dominating fathers and mothers with more demanding offspring also reported greater psychological distress.  The third paper explores whether parents' and offspring's well-being is more strongly associated with their self-perceptions or with their parents'/offspring's perceptions of their achievements. Participants evaluated their own and the other party's vocational and relational success. In general, parents described their offspring as more successful than offspring described themselves. Offspring's and mothers' well-being was associated not only with their own self-perceptions, but with the other person's perceptions of their achievements. Together, these studies suggest parents and offspring continue to influence one another in adulthood, even after offspring have left the parental home and entered adult roles. Further, these papers highlight the importance of obtaining multiple perspectives from within the same family by identifying gender and generational differences in attitudes, behaviors, and perceptions. Finally, these studies indicate that experiences in the parent-adult offspring tie hold relational and psychological implications not only for aging parents, but also for their grown offspring.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3372], "author_name_tesi": "Cichy, Kelly Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Cichy", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Kelly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eva Sharon Lefkowitz", "Steven Howard Zarit", "David Manuel Almeida", "Eric Loken", "Jon F Nussbaum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eva Sharon Lefkowitz, Committee Chair", "Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Chair", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member", "Eric Loken, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adult family relationships", "gender"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "All-trans-retinoic acid regulates vitamin A homeostasis", "id": "7167", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1220", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) is the active metabolite of vitamin A (VA; retinol) that mediates the majority of VA-dependent functions, such as embryonic development, cellular proliferation and differentiation, testicular function, and immune function.  Because of the clinical impact of RA on different disease conditions, it is important to delineate the affects of acute and chronic RA administration on both whole-body and tissue specific VA and RA utilization and kinetics.  The present study was conducted to better understand the regulation of RA in vivo and expand the current model that describes VA regulation.  The results of this thesis show that chronic RA administration altered VA kinetics, acute RA rapidly increased CYP26 expression, and RA metabolism is maintained during physiological stress.  Moreover, this work shows that the distribution and metabolism of RA are adjusted in response to changes in dietary VA intake and retinol supplementation.  Together, the results presented here suggest that VA homeostasis is maintained through an autoregulatory process, with RA acting as the principle messenger that enables the liver to sense VA status.  Based the observation that increased RA levels, whether administered through diet or intravenous injection, directly affect retinol and RA homeostasis, it is proposed that tissue and plasma RA levels are homeostatically maintained within a narrow range thus allowing the liver to respond to minor changes in VA status.

In sum, the results demonstrate that RA is the signal that enables the body to \u201csense\u201d VA status and that molecular mechanisms regulating RA levels adjust rapidly in response to different physiological, nutritional, and metabolic states to preserve RA homeostasis.

Significant benefits in terms of\ntransmission rate, reliability and coverage has been demonstrated via cooperative communication techniques. To that end, we focus on the impact of stochastic arrivals in the general setting where pairs of nodes exchange information via multiple intermediate relays. Throughout this thesis, we consider and address issues as\n scheduling, rate allocation, stability regions and quality of information for wireless\n networks. The premise of this thesis is that resource allocation and scheduling among users has to be performed in a cross-layer manner\nfor multiuser networks subject to randomness and\nQuality-of-Information(QoI)-based performance assessment. Consequently, we both address transmission policies, and characterize theoretical bounds for multiuser networks with various physical layer capabilities, input traffic and utility metrics. We start by considering a pair of nodes with stochastic traffic flows who wish to communicate in a bi-directional communication scenario using intermediate relays in two-hop fashion.  We\nfirst develop the throughput optimal control policy by tailoring the backpressure algorithm to the problem at hand. Two main alternatives for network operation are either to have queues at the relays, i.e., hop-by-hop scheduling, or no queuing at the relays, i.e., immediate forwarding. For the case of static channels, we show the stability regions of these two approaches are identical. On the other hand, for time-varying channels, we show that hop-by-hop scheduling outperforms immediate forwarding. Next, we turn our emphasis in considering some other very critical issues in wireless networks such as minimizing consumption of resources and distributed operation.  Each use of the relay incurs a unit cost, for example, representing the required transmission energy. We consider both centralized and decentralized algorithms. The results illustrate new cost-delay trade-offs depending on different levels of cooperation and queue information availability in the network. We then consider the case where users within the network are capable of compression of received data within the network. We demon-\nstrate how compression decisions on distortion-sensitive traffic are effected and carried\nout along with rate allocation for networks with attributes such as stochastic tra\u00b1c\nand capability of performing network coding. We proceed with Quality-of-Information\n(QoI)-aware networking, where a new set of attributes are used to characterize value of\ninformation. We propose rate allocation and attribute optimization for multiuser chan-\nnels to maximize network utility based on QoI metrics. We next propose rate allocation\nand link scheduling for QoI-based utility maximization for a multihop relay network with\ntime-varying channels. Lastly, we study the exploration-exploitation tradeoff for multi-\nple sensor devices which aim to maximize QoI utility-minus-operational costs, when the\nattribute of freshness of received information is taken into account.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1814], "author_name_tesi": "Ciftcioglu, Ertugrul Necdet", "last_name_ssi": "Ciftcioglu", "middle_name_ssi": "Necdet", "first_name_ssi": "Ertugrul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aylin Yener", "Aylin Yener", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "Thomas F Laporta", "Guohong Cao", "Randall A Berry", "Randall A Berry"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aylin Yener, Dissertation Advisor", "Aylin Yener, Committee Chair", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Member", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "Randall A Berry, Committee Member", "Randall A Berry, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Relay networks", "Cross-layer design", "Stochastic Network Optimization", "Two-Way Relaying", "Quality-of-Information"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Regulation Of Mitochondrial Translation And Oxidative Phosphorylation Through Reversible Acetylation", "id": "15559", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7785", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In a eukaryotic cell, mitochondria provide energy in the form of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Human mitochondria have their own genome and transcription/translation system to synthesize mitochondrially encoded thirteen proteins of respiratory chain complexes. We identified mitochondrial ribosomal protein L10 (MRPL10) as the major acetylated ribosomal protein in mammalian mitochondria with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by tandem mass spectrometry and immunoblotting analyses. In addition, we discovered that SIRT3, which is the main NAD+-dependent deacetylase localized into mitochondria, interacts with the ribosome and is responsible for the deacetylation of MRPL10. We employed SIRT3 knock-out mice in order to study the mechanism of reversible acetylation of MRPL10. The acetylation of MRPL10 resulted in increased MRPL12 binding to the L7/L12 stalk accompanied by enhanced protein synthesis in in vitro translation assays. Moreover, HIB1B, a brown adipocyte tissue cell line stably overexpressing SIRT3, demonstrated reduction in the acetylation status of MRPL10 and decreased MRPL12 binding to the L7/L12 stalk. By using [35S]-methionine pulse-labeling assays, we revealed that the mitochondrial protein synthesis was suppressed in these cells overexpressing SIRT3.  Diminished synthesis of mitochondrial-encoded protein subunits of respiratory chain complexes resulted in reduced the activities of Complex I and IV and total ATP production. Overall, these findings define a possible mechanism by which SIRT3-dependent reversible acetylation of MRPL10 and MRPL12 binding to the ribosome regulates the mitochondrial protein synthesis and, therefore, modulates the OXPHOS and ATP production. Next, we identified and assessed the acetylation of the flavoprotein (SdhA) subunit of Complex II, succinate dehydrogenase, which resulted in reduced activity of Complex II in SIRT3 knock-out mice. Moreover, we identified three additional members of the mitochondrial ribosome; CHCHD1, AURKAIP1, and CRIF1 in our mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses. We found that siRNA mediated knockdown of the newly identified ribosomal proteins to impair mitochondrial protein synthesis as determined by [35S]-methionine pulse-labeling assays.

As temperature increases during heating, some of the hydride particles within the cladding dissolve while the internal gas pressure in fuel rods increases generating multi-axial hoop and axial stresses in the closed-end thin-walled cladding tubes. As cool-down starts, the hydrogen in solid solution precipitates as hydride platelets, and if the multi-axial stresses are sufficiently large, the precipitating hydrides reorient from their initial circumferential orientation to radial orientation.  Radial hydrides can severely embrittle the spent nuclear fuel cladding at low temperature in response to hoop stress loading.\nBecause the cladding can experience a range of stress states during the thermo-mechanical treatment induced during vacuum drying, this study has investigated the effect of stress state on the process of hydride reorientation during controlled thermo-mechanical treatments utilizing the combination of in situ X-ray diffraction and novel mechanical testing analyzed by the combination of metallography and finite element analysis. The study used cold worked and stress relieved Zircaloy-4 sheet containing approx. 180 wt. ppm hydrogen as its material basis.  The failure behavior of this material containing radial hydrides was also studied over a range of temperatures. Finally, samples from reactor-irradiated cladding tubes were examined by X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation.\nTo reveal the stress state effect on hydride reorientation, the critical threshold stress to reorient hydrides was determined by designing novel mechanical test samples which produce a range of stress states from uniaxial to \u201cnear-equibiaxial\u201d tension when a load is applied. The threshold stress was determined after thermo-mechanical treatments by correlating the finite element stress-state results with the spatial distribution of hydride microstructures observed within the optical micrographs for each sample. Experiments showed that the hydride reorientation was enhanced as the stress biaxiality increased.  The threshold stress decreased from 150 MPa to 80 MPa when stress biaxiality ratio increased from uniaxial tension to near-equibiaxial tension. This behavior was also predicted by classical nucleation theory based on the Gibbs free energy of transformation being assisted by the far-field stress. \nAn analysis of in situ X-ray diffraction data obtained during a thermo-mechanical cycle typical of vacuum drying showed a complex lattice-spacing behavior of the hydride phase during the dissolution and precipitation. The in-plane hydrides showed bilinear lattice expansion during heating with the intrinsic thermal expansion rate of the hydrides being observed only at elevated temperatures as they dissolve.  For radial hydrides that precipitate during cooling under stress, the spacing of the close-packed {111} planes oriented normal to the maximum applied stress was permanently higher than the corresponding {111} plane spacing in the other directions.   This behavior is believed to be a result of a complex stress state within the precipitating plate-like hydrides that induces a strain component within the hydrides normal to its \u201cplate\u201d face (i.e., the applied stress direction) that exceeds the lattice spacing strains in the other directions.   During heat-up, the lattice spacing of these same \u201cplate\u201d planes actually contract due to the reversion of the stress state within the plate-like hydrides as they dissolve.  \nThe presence of radial hydrides and their connectivity with in-plane hydrides was shown to increase the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature during tensile testing.  This behavior can be understood in terms of the role of radial hydrides in promoting the initiation of a long crack that subsequently propagates under fracture mechanics conditions.  Finally, the d-spacing of irradiated Zircaloy-4 and M5 cladding tubes was measured at room temperature and compared to that of un-irradiated samples.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11453], "author_name_tesi": "Cinbiz, Mahmut Nedim", "last_name_ssi": "Cinbiz", "middle_name_ssi": "Nedim", "first_name_ssi": "Mahmut", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Arthur Thompson Motta", "Donald Albert Koss", "Kenan Unlu", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Michael Billone"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Dissertation Advisor", "Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Chair", "Donald Albert Koss, Committee Member", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Michael Billone, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Zirconium", "hydride", "reorientation", "dry cask storage", "radial hydrides", "stress", "stress state", "in situ", "X-ray diffraction", "biaxiality"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Optimizing an Integrated Supply Chain\n", "id": "11332", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "212", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many optimization models have been developed to make specific decisions in supply chains. However, when these decisions are integrated together, supply chains may operate more efficiently. This research presents a basic model for designing a supply chain network and two integrated models that were developed from this basic model: a strategic-tactical (S-T) model and a tactical-operational (T-O) model. The basic model is a single-period model that makes the tactical decisions of determining the optimal configuration of the manufacturing plants, independent distributors, and customers in the distribution network assuming that there is only one distribution center (DC) with infinite capacity. The S-T model is similar to the basic one but includes multiple periods and makes the decisions for the locations and sizes of several DC\u2019s. The DC sizes and locations are considered as strategic decisions since these are made for long periods of time, and the distribution decisions for each customer are considered as tactical since these are made for each period in the model and are used for planning purposes. The T-O model is a multi-period model that makes the distribution decisions of supplying the customer demands and making the replenishment orders for the DC\u2019s. It uses as part of the input the results from the S-T model for DC locations and sizes and the final list of customers as well as the actual customer orders. This research also presents a step-by-step procedure to deal with the sensitivity and uncertainty in demand that is incurred in the S-T model due to the use of demand forecasts. All the models developed in this research contain multiple criteria to consider customer service objectives in addition to maximizing the profit. Finally, a flowchart was presented to show the integration of the S-T and T-O models.

As a result of obesity, an adult\u2019s daily life may be affected physically, socially, and even psychologically. Coupled with its impact on health, the effects of obesity are often reflected in the workplace in the form of, for example, loss of productivity and increased incidence of lower-back injuries and other musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). This research investigated the impact of obesity on lifting capacity (LC). Two experiments were conducted in a laboratory setting. The first experiment evaluated the effect of obesity by means of three common measures of obesity, Body Mass Index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and estimated percent body fat (%BF), as well as other physical and biomechanics-related factors, on LC. LC was represented by an average lifting strength (ALS) and the Maximum Acceptable Weight of Load (MAWL), which was measured through a psychophysical test. A general lineal model (GLM) found that the weight and %BF of participants had a significant effect on MAWL at a 95% confidence level. Height, BMI and the interaction between gender and %BF had a significant effect on ALS. When biomechanics-related factors were introduced in the analysis of ALS, it was found that WC, the L5S1 disc compression and the interaction between gender and %BF. Evidence was found to confirm that when obesity was measured by BMI and %BF, the LC of obese individuals decreased and that gender difference was an underlying factor affecting the response.\nThe second experiment was designed to analyze factors that may cause obesity to have an effect on LC: (1) increased girth and (2) increased weight in the anterior part of the body. Results of GLM analysis showed that age, gender, an experimental BMI, the compression in the L5S1 disc and the randomized lifting order had a significant effect on ALS. However, the lifting conditions (increased girth and increased weight) in which participants performed lifting tasks, did not have a significant effect on LC and were not statistically different from each other either. Because the experimental BMI was significant, it was concluded that the effect of the additional weight was confounded with this factor and that it negatively affected the LC.\nResults of these two research experiments suggested, in general, that the increased %BF and BMI were two obesity measures that negatively affected the LC of individuals, as well as gender. These findings led to an experimental addition to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Recommended Weight of Lift (RWL) equation, which currently fails to account for the health of workers. This research proposed that a physical health multiplier (PM), based on the %BF and gender, could be added to this equation to account for the health status of workers. This multiplier would depend on the average %BF of the group of subjects that will perform lifting tasks in the workplace. Adding this multiplier would decrease the RWL for overweight and obese individuals, therefore reflecting the results of the experiments conducted as part of this research. This recommendation does not intend to discriminate against any individual and is not approved by NIOSH. In addition, the multiplier was derived using the data collected in this study, which was conducted in a laboratory setting and it may not fully represent the real population of obese workers in the US. Instead, the most important benefit of such addition to the RWL equation is to increase the safety of workers by giving management an additional and alternative tool to help analyze and design lifting tasks if health is a concern of the organization. The purpose of the multiplier was to take into consideration the obesity wave affecting the US and would not only be applicable to manual material handling jobs, but may also impact patient handling tasks in the health care industry.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8101], "author_name_tesi": "Cintron, Lorna Raquel", "last_name_ssi": "Cintron", "middle_name_ssi": "Raquel", "first_name_ssi": "Lorna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds", "Dr Paul Griffin", "M Jeya Chandra", "Dr Samuel Oyewole", "Diane Marie Spokus"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andris Freivalds, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Paul Griffin, Committee Member", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Dr Samuel Oyewole, Committee Member", "Diane Marie Spokus, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ergonomics", "Obesity", "BMI", "NIOSH", "RWL", "Lifting Capacity", "MAWL", "L5S1"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Developing and testing a positive theory of instrument choice: Renewable Energy Policy in the fifty American states\n\n\n", "id": "7340", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "969", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The environmental economics literature consistently suggests that properly designed and implemented economic incentives are superior to command-and-control regulation in reducing pollution. Economic incentives, such as green taxes, cap-and-trade programs, tax incentives, are able to reduce pollution in a cost-effective manner, provide flexibility to industry and stimulate innovation in cleaner technologies. In the past few decades, both federal and state governments have shown increased use of economic incentives in environmental policy. Some states have embraced them in an active manner, while others have failed to do so. \nThis research uses a three-step analysis. First, it asks why some states employ more economic incentives than others to stimulate consumption of renewable energy by the residential, commercial and industrial sectors. Second, it asks why some states employ stronger incentives than others. And third, it asks why certain states employ certain instruments, such as electricity surcharges, cap-and-trade programs, tax incentives or grants, while others do not. The first two analyses were conducted using factor analysis and multiple regression analysis, while the third analysis employed logistic regression models to analyze the data. Data for all three analyses were obtained from a combination of primary and secondary sources. \nTo address these questions, a theory of instrument choice at the state level, which includes both internal and external determinants of policy-making, was developed and tested. The state level of analysis was chosen. States have proven to be pioneers in designing policies to address greenhouse gases (see, for instance, the recent cap-and-trade legislation passed in California). \nThe theory was operationalized with the help of four models: needs/responsiveness, interest group influence, professionalism/capacity and innovation-and-diffusion. The needs/responsiveness model suggests that states tend to choose more and stronger economic incentives when they are more dependent on conventional sources of energy, such as coal, oil and gas or when they have the potential to produce renewable energy. The interest group influence model suggests that instrument choice is ultimately a political decision, most likely to benefit some groups more than others. \nThe professionalism/capacity model posits that states with more professional legislatures, with legislators who make more use of policy analysis, with more capacity to generate nonpartisan policy research and with larger agencies tend to employ more and stronger instruments to stimulate renewable energy consumption and production. And last, the innovation-and-diffusion model suggests that states with a proven innovation record in climate change tend to employ more and stronger economic incentives than states without such record. Also, this model explains states\u2019 instrument choice decisions as a function of the choices made by their neighbors.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [961], "author_name_tesi": "Ciocirlan, Cristina Elena", "last_name_ssi": "Ciocirlan", "middle_name_ssi": "Elena", "first_name_ssi": "Cristina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Beverly Ann Cigler", "Jeremy Plant", "Nihal Bayraktar", "Steven Ames Peterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Beverly Ann Cigler, Committee Chair", "Jeremy Plant, Committee Member", "Nihal Bayraktar, Committee Member", "Steven Ames Peterson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["instrument choice", "innovation and diffusion", "renewable energy policy", "legislative professionalism", "comparative state", "policy formulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EMOTION REGULATION IN CHILDREN EXPOSED TO MALTREATMENT:  THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN MALTREATMENT STATUS, PARENTING QUALITY, AND TEMPERAMENT\n", "id": "11000", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1700", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study sought to address three main goals in order to elucidate the mechanisms that contribute to emotion regulation in children exposed to maltreatment.

The proposed methodology, ultimately, predicts fracture width and fracture permeability that would be developed in a system with a tarmat layer having a certain thickness and a reservoir being produced at a certain production rate and total depletion time. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [323], "author_name_tesi": "Cirdi, Ayse Pamir", "last_name_ssi": "Cirdi", "middle_name_ssi": "Pamir", "first_name_ssi": "Ayse", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Luis Ayala"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor", "Luis Ayala, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["aquifer", "reservoir", "tarmat"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Design, Fabrication and Testing of Contact-aided Compliant Cellular Mechanisms with Curved Walls\n", "id": "12337", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5468", "abstract_tesi": "Contact-Aided Compliant Cellular Mechanisms (C3M) are compliant cellular structures with integrated contact mechanisms.  The focus of the thesis is on the design, fabrication, and testing of C3M structures with curved walls for high strain applications.  Global strain capability is increased in these compliant mechanisms by replacing straight walls with curved walls in the traditional honeycomb cellular structure.  The addition of contact mechanisms also increases cell performance via stress relief.  Furthermore, curved walls are beneficial for fabrication at the meso-scale.  \n\nThe curved honeycomb unit cell, defined by a set of variables, is analyzed using finite element analysis.  Each unit cell is subjected to an input displacement that is incremented up until the maximum local strain is equal to the allowable strain.  The effective maximum global strain of the cell is then calculated from the input displacement.  For each cell the non-contact global strain (maximum global strain in a cell without a contact mechanism) and the contact-aided global strain (maximum global strain in a cell with a contact mechanism) are calculated.  For the contact-aided cells the ideal contact gap must also be calculated.  It was found that curved C3M structures are always capable of larger global strains than straight-walled structures. Analysis of various cell geometries, reveals that the best cells have curved walls, are tall and slender, and do not benefit from a contact mechanism.  Two optimization problems were formulated using MATLAB and finite element analysis to find the best non-contact and contact-aided cells.  The first problem optimizes global strain in contact-aided cells, where the value of the objective function is found by taking the product of the contact-aided global strain and the increase in global strain that can be obtained due to stress relief.  The second problem optimizes global strain in the non-contact cells, where this objective function is equal to the non-contact global strain.  The optimized solutions for the curved cells can achieve global strains of up to 32.4% in non-contact cells and 19.7% in contact-aided cells.\n\nThe lost mold rapid infiltration forming (LM-RIF) microfabrication process was used to fabricate C3M structures from both metallic (mesoscale 316L Stainless Steel) and ceramic (3mol% yttria stabilized zirconia) materials.  The LM-RIF process is utilized to directly fabricate structures from CAD models in multiple arrays of C3M parts.  After the parts are fabricated, they are tested experimentally using a custom test rig.  During testing, a micrometer drives the displacement of the C3M mechanism, and the corresponding force is recorded via a built in force gauge.  The displacement and force are both recorded through a computer interfaced to the system.  This data gathered from the test rig is verified by calculating the displacements using digital images.  Three different types of C3M specimen are tested and the force versus displacement data corresponds to predicted data with Moduli of Elasticity values ranging from 120 to 280 GPa.  Additionally, each of the specimens was capable of a global strain equal to about half of the predicted global strain.  There are several factors which could explain these errors in the experimental results.  Slight variations in the fabrication process can lead to geometric variations, such as bending, warping and inconsistent wall thicknesses, as well as variations in the material properties, including elastic modulus and material strength, for each batch of parts.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5460], "author_name_tesi": "Cirone, Samantha Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Cirone", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Samantha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker", "Mary I Frecker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker, Thesis Advisor", "Mary I Frecker, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["stress relief", "contact-aided compliant mechanism", "cellular structure", "micro fabrication", "ceramic"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Surface chemical control over the valence electronic structure of gold nanoparticles", "id": "bn999672v", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12729", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Control over the electronic properties of metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles is critical for the development of new technologies in photocatalysis, solar energy conversion, quantum computing, and nanosensing. Size, shape, crystal structure, and dielectric environment are common parameters that are used to tune the electronic structure of nanomaterials. However, a less explored but equally promising parameter is modification of surface chemistry. The chemisorption of small molecules onto the surface of nanoparticles introduces a wide array of chemical functionality that allows for discrete modification of electronic structure at the metal/molecule interface. Specifically in monolayer-protected gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), previous work suggests that a stark change in surface chemistry (i.e., alkylthiol vs. alkylamine) is required to observe a modification of the electrical, optical, thermal, and magnetic properties of the metal core -- each of which is dependent upon the interfacial electronic structure. \n\nConduction electron spin resonance (CESR) spectroscopy is a valuable technique which has gone unexplored for observing how surface chemistry influences electronic structure. The utility of CESR lies in its selectivity and sensitivity to electronic structure at the Fermi level of the metal. Herein, I show how para-substituted aromatic thiolate and alkanethiolate ligands are capable of modifying the electronic structure through analysis of the measured g-factor -- a parametrization of spin-orbit coupling that comes from the electron spin resonance energy. In conjunction with quantum chemical calculations, we demonstrate that the sigma-bonding strength of the ligand is capable of controlling the degree of interfacial mixing between the metal and adsorbent, and correlate this with changes in the AuNPs' surface potential.

Mothers and children under the age of five, especially those from middle- and low-income settings, are the most affected by the deficiency. The consequences of the deficiency are known to impact both pregnant and non-pregnant women at the physical and psychosocial level. In children, ID is known to be a risk factor for inadequate development. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of six months of iron supplementation in infants between six to 18 months old on mother-infant interactions in a rural Bangladeshi sample.  \nThe data used for the current analysis are from a substudy of a larger longitudinal randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled factorial community trial exploring the effects of iron and zinc on diarrhea and anemia outcomes. Infants were supplemented for six months with iron/folic acid (n=70), iron/folic acid and zinc given either in combination (n=70) or separately (alternating days; n=73), and placebo (n=69). In this substudy, mother-infant interaction was measured at baseline (n=91), midpoint (three months; n=263), and endpoint (six months; n=272). Iron status was assessed in both, mothers and infants at baseline and endpoint via serum ferritin, transferrin receptor, C-reactive protein, and hemoglobin (in the infants only). Mother-infant interactions were coded per the Emotional Availability Scales comprised of four maternal scales: sensitivity, structuring, non-intrusiveness, and non-hostility and two infant scales:  responsiveness and involvement. Other measurements collected and which were related to mother-infant interactions include: socioeconomic status, mean upper arm circumference, weight-for-age Z score, child\u2019s sex and age, maternal depressive symptoms and maternal reasoning ability.        \nAt baseline, there were no demographic differences between supplementation groups but maternal transferrin receptor and body iron levels differed by groups. Post six months of supplementation to infants, infants differed significantly among groups in iron status while mothers did not. Cross-sectional analyses indicated that there were no differences between groups on scores of the emotional availability subscales at any time point. Longitudinal analyses indicated that scores at endpoint on the subscales (all except child scales) decreased compared to baseline regardless of supplement type and the magnitude of change did not differ between groups. \n\tThese findings indicate that mother-infant interactions in this sample were not affected by supplement type, but other factors were important. Positive contributors to the outcome were higher maternal reasoning ability, higher maternal and infant iron status, increased days of breastfeeding, infant\u2019s older age, and higher socio-economic status. Future analyses on these data will investigate the relation between infant and maternal iron status and mother-infant interactions irrespective of the supplementation groups. Considering the importance of mother-infant interactions on child development in our societies, future studies and policy makers should consider taking into account the aforementioned contributors with the hope that the well-being of mothers and infants could be improved.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16018], "author_name_tesi": "Ciulei, Mihaela A.", "last_name_ssi": "Ciulei", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Mihaela", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Laura E.

Using qualitative methodology including interviews and diary entries, data were collected over several months and analyzed to derive an understanding of the student perspectives on teacher interpersonal behaviors, teacher functional behaviors in the classroom, student learning behaviors, and teacher reactive behaviors in response to students' behaviors.  \nThe students\u2019 insights in this investigation offered an unexpected perspective on the interpersonal and technical behaviors of their teachers not currently present in the literature.  Their achievement motivation and outcomes were the overriding influences in the development of the teacher-student relationship, and not a relationship of affiliation with the teacher as had been expected.  \nSecond, the teacher-student relationship established patterns of interaction and expectations quite early in its development. Evidence over a period of months indicated that little had changed in the students\u2019 perceptions of their relationships with their teachers, suggesting the possibility exists that the opportunity for teachers to connect positively with students is quite limited and occurs in a very short amount of time; the implications of which mean that recovery from a negative relationship might be difficult to overcome.   \nImportant to the students was the notion of being able to predict how teachers would behave in class and with students, how well they would perform their duties, how they would treat the students, and how they might administer the use of humor with them and their peers.  Also important was the need for students to determine teacher expectations in order to earn the acceptance of their teachers through compliance and performance.  The conditional nature of the teacher-student relationship elicited a number of questions for further investigation into the phenomenon of this relationship.\nInformation learned from this investigation has provided the impetus for a variety of future studies as well as a number of opportunities for teacher training and professional development.

Two different models of iron-deficient states were used for our investigation.  Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) was studied with a focus on iron misregulation.  RLS is characterized by an irresistible desire to move the extremities, with the legs generally affected to a greater degree than the arms.  We measured the levels of whole-molecule ferritin, H-ferritin, L-ferritin, and transferrin in the cerebrospinal fluid from patients with RLS, with the goal of attaining a profile of these proteins in the central nervous system.  We also determined that the iron-signaling hormone hepcidin is present in the CSF, and that its levels are altered in RLS.  To investigate the type of brain iron misregulation possibly occurring in RLS and its potential causes, we studied the short- and long-term consequences of early iron deficiency on rat brain.  We utilized microarray analysis of the whole brain homogenate of the developmental iron-deficient rat model.  The rats were born to iron-deficient mothers, and were analyzed at two different ages: at 21 days, while weaning and iron-deficient; and at six months, after a recovery period consisting of normal iron intake for five months.  Over 300 genes were significantly changed in the 21-day animals.  Several significant gene clusters of interest were identified, including: myelin-related, signal transduction, channel/pore class transporter and alpha-type channel activity, ion channel activity, DNA binding, transitional metal binding, and solute carrier family members.  The impact of the misregulation of the genes in these clusters can cause decreased myelination and conductivity, as well as impaired cell-to-cell and intracellular signaling, in addition to the expected changes in iron-related genes.  In the six month formerly iron-deficient animals, only twelve genes were identified as significantly changed, reflecting considerably fewer changes than the acute iron-deficient state, but changes that are long-term.  Of the twelve genes found, all were down-regulated, and seven were either estimated sequence tags or transcribed sequences, leaving five genes whose function can be discussed.  Of the five genes, two are cytoplasmic, two are nuclear, and one is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The down-regulation of genes from the six month animals represents weakened cytoskeletal stability and infrastructure of neurons, decreased nucleic acid translation, and decreased responsiveness to oxidative stress.  Genes of interest from each age group were verified utilizing qualitative Real-Time PCR.  Overall, the data suggest that iron deficiency irreversibly impacts a range of functions.  Furthermore, the presence of gene changes in the 6 month animals after a five month period of iron recovery reinforce the importance of identifying the windows of opportunity for optimal intervention.  \n\tOur findings have had a significant impact on the current understanding of the relationship between the central nervous system and iron deficiency.  We established a distinct CSF profile for RLS, provided novel information regarding the presence of hepcidin in the CNS, and found significant alterations in hepcidin levels in RLS.  Additionally, we have identified numerous genes changed during and after iron deficiency in the developmental iron-deficient rat brain, providing the necessary first step in elucidating the biological basis of the behavioral alterations resulting from iron deficiency.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5656], "author_name_tesi": "Clardy, Stacey Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Clardy", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Stacey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "Ian Alexander Simpson", "John Elliot Beard", "David A Antonetti", "Gary Alan Clawson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Committee Chair", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Member", "John Elliot Beard, Committee Member", "David A Antonetti, Committee Member", "Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["H ferritin", "hepcidin", "iron deficiency", "brain iron", "developmental brain iron deficiency", "brain microarray", "myelin", "solute carrier family", "signal transduction", "transferrin", "L ferritin", "cerebrospinal fluid", "CSF", "immunoblot"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Experimental Identification of Noise Paths and Mitigation Methods for a Device in a Submerged Environment", "id": "22076", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9826", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A common concern in the design of electromechanical devices are the noise emissions.

The effort concentrates on first determining the transmission paths between the source and receiver. Once the primary path is determined, mitigation techniques are investigated.\n\nA small scale water test environment is developed to easily evaluate the radiated noise. The limits and capabilities of using the small scale reverberant environment are determined. A controlled acoustic source is used to evaluate the variation in mean radiated spectrum level measurements at multiple locations within the environment. From this study an optimal location for a receiver hydrophone is determined having a precision interval of \u00b1 1.1 dB when measuring the controlled acoustic source.\n\nThe problematic tonal noise is determined to be related to the pulse-width modulation switching frequency of the electric actuators. The characterized reverberant environment is used to determine the dominant noise path within the electromechanical device in a submerged water state. A source-path-receiver model is developed with five possible noise paths. Path breaks are methodically applied to rank their order of relative importance. The dominant noise path is determined to be between the electric actuators through the actuator mounts to the unit housing.

First, the behavior of solid hydrogen under rotation was investigated in order to determine if the possible supersolid phase is unique to 4He. Although there are clear indications of quantum mechanical motion of residual ortho-hydrogen impurities within the solid, NCRI is not observed in any solid H2 samples.\nSecond, modifications to the traditional experimental apparatus were employed in order to make it possible to grow solid 4He at a fixed point on the solid-liquid coexistence curve within a torsional oscillator for the first time. A vast improvement in the overall reproducibility of the data is consistent with the formation of single crystals within the sample cell. The onset of NCRI is consistently found to be 79mK in helium crystals containing only ~1ppb of isotopic impurities. These results demonstrate that the supersolid-like behavior of solid 4He is not associated with superfluid liquid flowing along grain boundaries.\nFurther results suggest that vortices exist in the solid, and that the onset of NCRI corresponds to the temperature at which their motion is suppressed.

In order to raise compliance with diabetic testing and aid in early detection of ischemia and sepsis an implantable electrochemical sensor array has been developed to monitor glucose, lactate and pyruvate.\nThe glucose sensors were first fabricated on gold electrode arrays on flexible polyimide sheets by photo-polymerization of the biocompatible polymer poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA) to develop hydrogels and encapsulate the sensing elements. Using conventional silicon fabrication methods, arrays of five gold microdisk electrodes were fabricated using lift-off photolithography and sputtering techniques.

The developed glucose sensors were also tested in vivo to determine their ability to function in the harsh in vivo environment.

Elemental sulfur concentrations in biofilms are 20 to 25% S(0) by mass, while underlying anoxic sediments contain less than 5% S(0). I analyzed paired biofilm-sediment samples using Illumina high-throughput sequencing with universal (bacterial and archaeal) 16S rRNA primers and found that the most common biofilm type is dominated by Gamma-, Beta-, Epsilon-, and Deltaproteobacteria. Underlying sediment microbial communities are nearly identical except for the lower abundance of Gammaproteobacteria related to freshwater Beggiatoa strains. My community composition data are consistent with Beggiatoa-dominated microbial mats in which cells orient along the oxic-anoxic interface at the sediment surface, as measured in microsensor profiles.

In-cylinder combustion analyses were performed and untreated exhaust emissions were measured at 15 and 30 mph with road loads of 10, 20 and 30 horsepower. Hydrogen increased the flame speed reducing time for flame kernel development and combustion duration. However, the hotter burn lost more heat to the surroundings and thermal efficiency of HCNG was lower than natural gas. Increasing engine speeds magnified reduction in combustion duration created by hydrogen. As load on the engine increased, hydrogen-influenced reduction on burn time was reduced. Heat and throttling losses reduced the thermal efficiency of the combustion. More complete combustion with hydrogen reduced carbon-based emissions and bulk cylinder temperature increase drove increased NO formation.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2839], "author_name_tesi": "Clark, Jamie Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Clark", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Jamie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["engine testing", "combustion", "HCNG", "chassis dynamomter"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of FOSS Video Games in Comparison to their Commercial Counterparts\n", "id": "8813", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2494", "abstract_tesi": "The topic of copyrights and copyright law is a crucial component in understanding today's media landscape.

Although this transformation has had a crucial technoscientific dimension, and although agricultural technoscience has long been an important topic in rural sociology, rural sociologists have had little to say about the relationship between environmental regulations and agri-environmental technoscience. In this thesis I address this relatively neglected topic by examining a particular regulatory system: the nutrient management regulations that attempt to reduce nutrient runoff from industrial livestock and poultry operations. The thesis examines the regulatory science that laid the scientific foundation for the regulations as well as three techno-fixes that were developed to reduce the risk of runoff. I explain how these two types of agri-environmental technoscience have helped keep regulatory compliance costs in check, maintaining the profitability of the regulated industry and of regions as locations for it. My thesis is that agri-environmental technoscience plays a crucial role in overcoming (socio)ecological obstacles to the accumulation of capital. I also use this case study to grapple with the larger intellectual problem of how to understand the relationship among capitalism, technoscience, and nature in an era of increasing environmental concern.

Overall pressure ratios for gas turbines continue to rise to achieve higher efficiencies, resulting in increasingly extreme thermal conditions in the hot section of the engine. Secondary air, bled from the compressor, is used to cool turbine components and seal the inter-stage cavities from the hot main gas path to maintain component durability. Unsealed cavities lead to hot gas ingestion, which can degrade critical components or, in extreme cases, can be catastrophic to engines. Providing adequate sealing flow is required to maintain component life, but efficient use of the secondary air is required to maintain the thermodynamic efficiency of the engine. To fully optimize these competing requirements, experiments at engine-relevant conditions are required to validate new designs and computational tools. This dissertation presents sealing effectiveness measurements for an engine-realistic turbine rim seal operated at engine-relevant conditions.\nA new facility providing continuous flow for a 1.5 stage turbine was designed, constructed, and commissioned to study hot gas ingestion for at engine-relevant conditions. Sealing effectiveness was determined through concentration measurements, whereby CO2 was used as a tracer gas in the secondary air supply, and sampled throughout the turbine rim seal and rim cavity. The turbine design was representative of a modern turbine with engine-realistic purge flow delivery and leakage flows, resulting in complex flow fields in the cavities. The measurements indicated that sealing effectiveness depended on the number of purge holes at and inboard of the purge injection location, with more purge holes exhibiting higher effectiveness than fewer purge holes. Outboard of the purge location, the sealing effectiveness was not affected by the number of purge holes. The boundary layer on the rotating disk entrained the purge flow, and the rotor and stator pumping distributed the purge flow throughout the cavity reducing the amount of ingestion. The results indicated that the well-accepted orifice models used to predict sealing effectiveness throughout the industry are successful for some cases; however, the results in this dissertation showed that those models are unsuccessful in predicting sealing effectiveness for the complex engine-realistic geometries and purge flow delivery methods. These findings highlight the need to obtain sealing effectiveness data at engine-relevant conditions, using engine-realistic hardware to develop ingestion models applicable to gas turbine engines.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13661], "author_name_tesi": "Clark, Kenneth Phillip", "last_name_ssi": "Clark", "middle_name_ssi": "Phillip", "first_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole", "Karen Ann Thole", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Stephen P Lynch", "Robert Francis Kunz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karen Ann Thole, Dissertation Advisor", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Chair", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Stephen P Lynch, Committee Member", "Robert Francis Kunz, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["turbomachinery", "turbine", "rim seals", "hot gas ingestion", "experimental", "engine relevant"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "TEACHERS AND TECHNOLOGY: UNPACKING ILLUSIONS OF A ONE-TO-ONE COMPUTER INITIATIVE\n", "id": "7123", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5734", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In January 2005, the US Department of Education announced the National Education Technology Plan, the latest vision for computer technology in education in public schools.

Using research and theory from studies of general violence and IPV, this dissertation researched the following five questions: (1) Are early violent offending and violent victimization (non-partner-related) risk factors for IPV victimization? (2) Does the relationship between IPV and other deviant behaviors persist after controlling for early behaviors?; (3) Do peer network characteristics influence these relationships?; (4) Do these relationships vary for male and female adolescents?; and (5) Does the relationship between IPV victimization, general violence, and other deviant behaviors vary depending on whether one or both individuals in the relationship were victimized?\n\nPrior research on adolescent IPV suffers from three conceptual and methodological limitations: the lack of longitudinal research, samples limited to female victims, and the absence of peer network influence in models. To address these problems, this research used data from three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a large nationally representative sample of adolescents. Additionally, this study included peer network data, which allowed this research to incorporate peer network characteristics measured directly from the respondent\u2019s peers.\n\nPart of this research used data from Add Health\u2019s secure romantic partnership network data. In these data, respondents who nominated one another as romantic partners were linked, which allowed this study to identify couples in which (a) neither of the individuals reported IPV victimization, (b) one of the individuals reported IPV victimization, and (c) both of the individuals reported IPV victimization. The purpose of making these distinctions was to approximate Johnson\u2019s (2008) typology of IPV. This is the first study on the correlates and consequences of adolescent IPV to distinguish between IPV victimization that was experienced by only one or both individuals within a couple.\n \nA larger goal of this research was to integrate research on general violent victimization and IPV victimization. These two types of victimizations are usually examined separately. Some scholars have argued that IPV victimization is distinct from general violent victimization in terms of origins, correlates, and theoretical explanations. Other scholars have argued that all violence is essentially the same, and IPV research should not be separate from that of research on general violence. This research hypothesized that IPV victimization is both similar to and distinct from general violence; it depends on the type of IPV victimization (i.e., whether the partner violence was mutual or one-sided). This distinction may determine how similar and different IPV is to general violence.\n\nThe results of this research reveal five major findings. First, both prior violent offending and violent victimization increased the odds of IPV victimization; both engaging in past violence and being a victim of past violence (non-partner-related) increase the risk of IPV victimization. Second, even after controlling for prior instances of deviant behavior, IPV victimization was associated with an increase in short-term deviant behaviors, including violent offending, violent victimization, delinquency, and drug use. However, the size of this relationship is smaller than previously thought, and IPV victimization does not increase all of these behaviors at the same rate for all victims. Adolescents who previously engaged in violent offending, who previously were victims of general violence, and who previously engaged in delinquency actually report fewer of these same subsequent behaviors on average compared to individuals who have not engaged in these behaviors previously.\n\nThe third major finding was that peer network characteristics did not appear to play a role in IPV victimization, either in predicting victimization or predicting behaviors associated with victimization. However, the measures of peer delinquency used in this study were limited, and further studies of this relationship are necessary. \n\nThe fourth major finding was that there were some gender differences in causes and correlates of IPV victimization, but not as many differences as some scholars might expect. For example, prior violent offending was a stronger predictor of IPV victimization for males than for females. Prior violent victimization was a stronger predictor of subsequent violent offending and violent victimization for females than for males. Overall, males and females did not differ significantly in many predictors or correlates of IPV victimization. One possible reason for the high proportion of similarities between males and females is the measure of IPV victimization used in this study. This study\u2019s measure of IPV victimization likely captured many less-serious instances of IPV victimization, for which males and females likely have similar rates. \n\nThe final major finding of this study was that there appear to be multiple types of IPV victimization among adolescents, and these multiple types of IPV have different predictors and correlates. Thus, researchers of adolescent and adult IPV should not assume that all instances of IPV are similar.\n\nThis study has major implications for theory and research on IPV, as well as policy regarding adolescent IPV. One major implication from this research is that some types of IPV victimization appear to be similar to more general forms of violent victimization. Also, theories that are generally used to explain violent victimization may also be applicable to some types of IPV. Finally, when dealing with adolescent IPV victimization, intervention efforts should vary based on whether the violence is perpetrated by both individuals within the relationship or only one of the individuals. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6385], "author_name_tesi": "Clark, Valerie A.", "last_name_ssi": "Clark", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Valerie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback", "Richard Barry Ruback", "Michael Paul Johnson", "Jeremy Staff", "Derek Allen Kreager", "Stephanie A Shields"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Barry Ruback, Committee Chair", "Michael Paul Johnson, Committee Member", "Jeremy Staff, Committee Member", "Derek Allen Kreager, Committee Member", "Stephanie A Shields, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["General Violence", "Intimate Partner Violence", "Adolescence", "Gender"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Obstacles and Opportunities for Water Conservation in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria", "id": "6567", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6485", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Water has been called the oil of the 21st century.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was lower in O compared to Y (71\u00b13 vs. 94\u00b16 ml\u2219min-1\u22191.73 m-2, P<0.01). Older adults had prolonged urine excretion rates compared to young (P = 0.04). Water excretion rate was positively correlated with eGFR in older (R2 = 0.47, P = 0.01) but not young adults (R2 = 0.11, P = 0.32). In young subjects, BHI increased with beverage Na+ concentration and Enterade-AD had the highest BHI (Enterade-AD = 1.24 \u00b1 0.10 vs. water = 1.00, P = 0.01). Older subjects had higher BHI compared to Y for all beverages and Enterade had the highest BHI (Enterade; 1.20 \u00b1 0.13 vs. water; 1.00 \u00b1 0, P < 0.01). Due to prolonged urine excretion rates, examining 4 h BHI may be more appropriate for older adults compared to 2 h BHI. After a bolus fluid load, healthy older adults exhibit a prolonged time course for urine excretion due to decreased eGFR. Increasing the beverage Na+ content progressively increases BHI in young adults independent of glucose or AA content. For older adults, the Enterade beverage with 5 AAs and moderate electrolyte content had the highest BHI and maintained hydration most effectively.

Energy density is a function of a materials permittivity and electrical breakdown strength.  High values of each of these parameters are desirable for a high energy density and were explored in various fluoropolymer systems.  Copolymers containing vinylidene fluoride (VDF), chlorofluoroethylene (CTFE), and trifluoroethylene (TrFE) were synthesized by a two-step approach beginning with the copolymerization of VDF and CTFE and the subsequent hydrogenation of the CTFE units to TrFE to create the terpolymer P(VDF-CTFE-TrFE).  By changing the chemical composition of the fluoropolymers, the permittivity was varied from 12 to 50 due to changes in the crystal phase that converted the polymers from paraelectric to ferroelectric materials.\n\nThe electrical breakdown mechanisms of a single copolymer composition of P(VDF-CTFE) was studied as a function of molecular weight and temperature.  Energy density and breakdown strength increased as molecular weight increased and temperature decreased.  An electromechanical breakdown mechanism was responsible for failure at 25C while a thermal breakdown mechanism operated at -35C which was below the glass transition of the material.  In between at -15C, a combination of the two mechanisms was found to operate.\n\nElectromechanical breakdown was also found to operate in a copolymer system with a fixed amount of VDF and varying amounts of TrFE and CTFE.  The molecular weights were identical for all the polymers.  Maxwell stress is the primary contributor to the electromechanical stress in polymers with a high amount the CTFE.  Electrostrictive stress due to a crystal phase change at high electric fields is a major contributor to the electromechanical stress in polymers containing a high amount of TrFE.  Energy density and electrical breakdown strength increased with increasing amounts of TrFE.\n\nNanometer sized silica particles were incorporated into a P(VDF-CTFE) matrix using an in-situ sol-gel process.  Electrical breakdown strengths and energy densities were maximized in hybrids containing an optimized amount of silica due to the creation of new charge trap sites.  These sites reduced space charge and electric loss delaying thermal breakdown in the hybrids.  For optimized composites, high energy densities over 20 J/cm3 were achieved. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3119], "author_name_tesi": "Claude, Jason W.", "last_name_ssi": "Claude", "middle_name_ssi": "W.", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qing Wang", "Ralph H Colby", "Michael T Lanagan", "Qiming Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qing Wang, Committee Chair", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vinylidene fluoride", "fluoropolymer", "energy storage", "electrical breakdown", "capacitor", "dielectric"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DYNAMIC VITALS MONITORING FOR PATIENT PRIORITIZATION IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT: A TECHNOLOGY ENABLED UTILITY APPROACH \n", "id": "11354", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1637", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the lack of standard protocols on how to assign priorities in the Emergency Departments (ED), there are plenty of opportunities for biases in the health system.  Many hospitals in the US have implemented the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) as the method to sort their patients at the triage. However, there is a lot of subjectivity from the nurses and even though the ESI has been widely accepted, it is not the standard.  Moreover, many hospitals have no written protocol on patient reassessment during their waiting time after they have been triaged. Therefore, there is considerable uncertainty with regards to the changes of vital signs and patient status during their waiting period. Nurses typically use a First Come First Serve (FCFS) rule for patient selection when several patients have the same priority (e.g. same ESI) and are waiting in the ED after triage, disregarding the fact that a patient status might improve or degrade while waiting. \n\tThis research focuses on the development of dynamic decision making models for patient prioritization in the emergency department. It involves the use of wireless technology to collect patients\u2019 vital signs in real time, and the integration of such information in decision making models for patient selection in the ED. Integration of wireless technologies and advanced sensing capabilities provides a potential to establish a data-rich emergency room scheduling system, which can be exploited to improve productivity and patient care via dynamic decision making. The monitoring devices serve the purpose of collecting data, which are used to test a decision model that utilize multi-attribute utility theory (MAUT) in order to aid the nurse in making the decision on patient prioritization. \n\tThe rationale behind the research is that even though patients are assigned a priority when seen at the triage, their condition might improve or degrade while waiting at the ED.  For this reason, it is argued that the patient priority should be dynamic, which means it should be changing as a function of the preferences of the nurse doing the triage coupled with the patient\u2019s vital signs, the patient\u2019s descriptive information (age, gender, etc.), and the time of the patient in the ED waiting room.\n\tMulti-attribute utility theory (MAUT) is employed to model patient prioritization due to the inherent uncertainty in ED settings. MAUT is based on the notion of the lottery, referred to as a von Neumann-Morgenstern lottery. In fact, one of the challenges is on how to present the nurses with the lottery questions without using excessive numerical values or abstract representations. \t \n\tAs part of the research, the nurses\u2019 individual preferences were extracted with a series of questions that were developed to estimate their indifference points between lottery and certainty. The von Neumann-Morgenstern lotteries were transformed into simple questions, verbal discussions, and case-based scenarios. Exponential functions were created for each attribute and the overall utility was calculated using the multiplicative form. The traditional MAUT equations were modified in order to incorporate multiple decision makers and the changes of the vital signs over time. The utility functions were tested with real clinical data in an ED, and prioritization lists were developed for each nurse according to their utilities at various instances of time. \n\tThe nurses\u2019 individual preferences were aggregated to minimize the differences between them, deriving one global decision rule for patient prioritization for each hospital.  The model based in MAUT was compared against one of the most common methods currently used for patient selection:  First-Come- First-Serve (FCFS).  An expert was presented with a list of real patients waiting in the ED and she was asked to rank the patients taking into account the patient\u2019s vital signs at the moment of patient selection. A statistical analysis proved that the priority lists derived with the dynamic MAUT model are different from the ones derived using FCFS.  The dynamic MAUT lists proved to be a closer approximation to an expert opinion.  Furthermore, because of its dynamic nature, there was a statistical difference in the dynamic MAUT priority lists over time.  \n\tThe contribution of the research to the state-of-the-art is multi-faceted involving (1) the application of utility theory in healthcare systems, (2) the adaptation of utility theory for dynamic decision making with multiple decision makers, (3) the integration of wireless technology in healthcare systems, and (4) the utility aggregation of multiple decision makers.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1624], "author_name_tesi": "Claudio, David ", "last_name_ssi": "Claudio", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gul Kremer", "Paul Griffin", "Gul Kremer", "Andris Freivalds", "Chao Hsien Chu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gul Kremer, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Griffin, Committee Member", "Gul Kremer, Committee Chair", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Chair", "Chao Hsien Chu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vital signs monitoring", "dynamic MAUT", "Multi-attribute utility theory", "Emergency Department", "patient prioritization", "technology"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Essays in Macroeconomic Theory and Political Economy", "id": "10927", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5808", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis consists of three chapters. The first chapter investigates how the functional operator used in Kocherlakota (1996) is linked to the game underlying the model. Using the machinery developed by Abreu et al. (1990) (APS) I solve for the set of equilibrium value profiles directly. Consider a function f whose hypograph is self-generating and apply the APS set operator B to the hypograph. The main result states that the functional operator used in Kocherlakota (1996) maps the function f to the upper boundary of the resulting set.\n\nThe second chapter tackles various issues in the empirical literature investigating the claim that economic development leads to political development, i.e., higher income causes democracy. All democracy data are ordinal, i.e., ordered and discrete. In contrast to Barro (1999) and Acemoglu et al. (2008), who treat the democracy data as continuous, I develop and estimate a dynamic model where the ordinal democracy variable has the Markov property. As pointed out by Robinson (2006), most work in the literature fails to take into account that democracy might have an effect on income. Consequently, I test whether income has an effect on democracy and whether democracy has an effect on income. The effects between income and democracy are dynamic as they unfold over time. This leads me to employ the standard econometric causality concept in time series analysis, Granger causality. Mosconi et al. (2006) have extended the concept of Granger causality to binary processes. Using a similar Markov approach allows me to apply their definition of Granger causality in my econometric model. I also show that GDP per capita is a unit root process for almost all countries and that failing to take this into account leads to model misspecification and misleading results. My empirical analysis suggests the following. First, higher income Granger causes democracy for full democracies, which means that a high income helps to stabilize democracies. Second, higher income Granger causes democracy for medium democracies implying that income can have a positive effect on regime type where there is already a somewhat favorable environment. Third, I find that Granger causality runs from democracy to income meaning that income and democracy form a bidirectional feedback system.\n\nThe third chapter investigates empirically the effect of extending the franchise to women. The underlying question is why women had to fight for their right to vote. The hypothesis is that richer and more educated women had a higher turnout at the polls than poorer and less educated women. Using data on demographic composition, election results and voter registration for Pittsburgh I estimate female voter turnout and female voter participation across different social groups and the effect of women suffrage on election results. I find that female voter turnout and female voter participation was higher in the richer and more educated parts of town. However, I cannot find an effect of the enactment women suffrage on the election results.

Following its formation, a globular cluster's black hole population is transformed by the dynamical processes that occur within dense stellar systems. After decades of theoretical and observational study, the outcomes of this evolution remain uncertain. Outstanding questions include the fraction of clusters that retain black holes, the size of the retained population, and the mass distribution of these black holes.  In this thesis, we model encounters between black holes and other cluster members to identify observable indicators of the presence and masses of black holes in globular clusters.\n\nIn one line of research, we model the formation of black hole-neutron star binaries via dynamical interactions in globular clusters.  We find that in dense, massive clusters, many of the black hole-neutron star binaries formed by these encounters will undergo gravitational radiation driven mergers. Black holes retained by the cluster after merging with a neutron star can acquire subsequent neutron star companions and undergo several mergers. However, the post-merger recoil is only suppressed below the globular cluster escape velocity for black holes with masses exceeding 30 M\u2299. Thus, the merger rate is sensitive to the black hole mass distribution.  Models with 35 M\u2299 black holes predict Advanced LIGO detection rates in the range 0.04 - 0.7 per year.  Systems that do not merge may be observable as black hole-millisecond pulsar binaries. We discuss the distribution of orbital parameters in such binaries and the cluster properties that promote their formation.  We find that the upper limit for the number of dynamically formed black hole-millisecond pulsar binaries in the Milky Way globular cluster system is ~10.     \n\nIn a complementary study, we model the emission lines produced in the photoionized debris of tidally disrupted white dwarfs and horizontal branch stars.  These emission lines can be used to investigate the intermediate mass black holes that may be present in some globular clusters.  We find that bright, broad, asymmetric C IV \u03bb1549 and [O III]  \u03bb5007 emission lines can be used to identify white dwarf tidal disruption events.  When a horizontal branch star is disrupted, the brightest optical emission lines are [N II] \u03bb6583 and [O III] \u03bb5007.  We compare our models with two candidate white dwarf tidal disruption events that have been observed in globular clusters.  We find several drawbacks to interpreting either of these sources as a white dwarf tidal disruption event.  However, models of a red clump horizontal branch star undergoing mild disruption by a 50 - 100 M\u2299 black hole yield an emission line spectrum that is in good agreement with one of these sources.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8688], "author_name_tesi": "Clausen, Drew Reid", "last_name_ssi": "Clausen", "middle_name_ssi": "Reid", "first_name_ssi": "Drew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Eracleous", "Steinn Sigurdsson", "Richard Alan Wade", "Lee S Finn", "Yuexing Cindy Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Eracleous, Dissertation Advisor", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Alan Wade, Committee Member", "Lee S Finn, Committee Member", "Yuexing Cindy Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["black holes", "globular clusters", "neutron stars", "tidal disruption events"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Education for All Priorities in the Education Policies of Bolivia and Mexico", "id": "16152", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7989", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study contains an analysis of the contents of legal and policy texts of Bolivia and Mexico (2000-2012).

The study looks at two nations in different stages of development with administrations that have diverse influences to understand how national interpretations of the universal basic education norms may have been constructed. National political commitment to the Education for All (EFA) agenda is demonstrated by the incorporation of these norms into national policy frameworks, specifically the national education sector plan. In Bolivia and Mexico, reforms of the education system are given similar rationales, for example, education is considered to be the backbone of socio-economic development, low levels of education are said to have caused inequities, higher levels of educational attainment are seen as a potential engine for social progress. These rationales are similar regardless of national political agendas or differences in endogenous factors.

The education plans of Bolivia and Mexico elaborate national reform agendas, yet it is not apparent that education plans construct policies independent of other policy texts.

With a case study based on fieldwork in four villages in southwest Rwanda, I investigate agricultural commercialization as a social-ecological process, including the ramifications of related development programs and policies on the vulnerability, resilience, and adaptive capacity of smallholder agriculturalists to climatic uncertainty and acute weather events. This dissertation is the result of long-term fieldwork that relied on quantitative, qualitative, ethnographic, and spatial methods of data collection and analysis. It documents spatial-temporal patterns of climate risk, the uneven distribution of costs and benefits of climatic shocks, and the impact of development interventions on vulnerability. More precisely, this dissertation details how households come to differ (e.g. by class and gender) in their abilities to adaptively manage multiple environmental and social uncertainties. By illustrating how institutions and social-environmental variability interact to shape vulnerability and adaptive capacity, this work contributes to scholarly and policy debates at the interface of food systems, development, and climate change. One key contribution of this dissertation is the evidence that adaptive capacity can be productively considered as a social-ecological process rather than as a static, asset-based, quantifiable variable. I show that adaptive capacity to climatic change is produced through the intersection of household agency (including land use and livelihood decisions) and structural constraints (including agricultural policy as it intersects with subjectivities such as class and gender). I provide a framework for visualizing how adaptive capacity is dynamic and relational. In doing so, this research also presents valuable empirical understanding as to the viability of agricultural intensification policies that are now common throughout sub-Saharan Africa, where development planning now widely seeks to emulate the successes of the Green Revolution in Asia. It demonstrates that large-scale, state-led agricultural intensification may be limited in its success as a pro-poor development strategy\u2014as it is in Rwanda\u2014by high degrees of social and ecological variation. I therefore make the case that development policies must be carefully attuned to risk management processes and must be flexible enough to adapt to changing social-ecological conditions of risk.

Progress toward the asymmetric synthesis of streptorubin B and its stereoisomers is herein described. \n\tAlkynyliodonium salts are versatile substrates which have been used to form a variety of heterocycles and other ring systems.

First, breast cancers display inter-tumor heterogeneity evidenced by the diversity of clinically and molecularly defined tumor subtypes that differ with respect to disease progression and drug sensitivity. Second, individual breast cancers display remarkable intra-tumor heterogeneity evidenced by the diversity of component tumor cell subtypes co-residing within each cancer that differ with respect to cell morphology, proliferation rate, metastatic potential, drug sensitivity, and capacity for tumor reconstitution. The cellular mechanisms that generate and maintain breast cancer heterogeneity, both at the level of tumor subtype and tumor cell subtype, remain poorly understood. Using mouse models of human breast cancer, this dissertation examines whether and how breast cancer heterogeneity derives from the diverse and highly interactive cell subtypes that comprise the normal mammary gland, breast cancer\u2019s tissue-of-origin.\nIn one set of experiments directed at uncovering the origin of tumor subtypes, we examined why transgenic mouse models of breast cancer nearly always yield a hormone receptor (HR)-negative mammary cancer subtype. In the mammary gland, mature ducts consist of basal and luminal mammary epithelial cell (MEC) subtypes. The luminal epithelial compartment can be further subdivided into hormone receptor (HR)-positive and HR-negative subsets. While human breast cancers frequently express HRs and depend on ovarian hormones for growth, transgenic mouse models of breast cancers show an unexplained bias toward HR-negative disease. Since the majority of mouse breast cancer models use the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat (MMTV-LTR) as a mammary-specific promoter element, we examined whether MMTV targets transgene expression to a specific MEC compartment. Using the MMTV-LTR to drive expression of a nuclear H2BGFP reporter transgene, we observed nuclear labeling restricted to HR-negative cells within the luminal compartment. Combining this labeling strategy with MMTV-directed expression of the Neu oncogene, we found Neu transgene expression was similarly enriched within HR-negative luminal MECs. Further, Neu-initiated neoplasias were comprised entirely of HR-negative cells from the carcinoma-in-situ stage onward. Thus, MMTV-driven Neu expression targets HR-negative luminal cells, culminating in HR-negative tumors. We propose that the HR-negative phenotype of many mouse breast cancer models can be explained by MMTV-driven transgene expression in HR-negative MECs.  \nIn another set of experiments, we sought to study interactions between tumor cell subtypes. To do this, we developed a novel experimental platform for culturing chimeric mammary organoids which permits analysis of both the cell-autonomous and non-autonomous effects of oncogene expression. By combining primary MECs from two different transgenic donors, chimeric mammary organoids were assembled consisting of intermingled populations of genetically distinct donor MECs that could each be tracked over time. We tested our system using transgenic mouse models engineered to inducibly express either an activated HRas allele or oncogenic Wnt1 in specific MECs. As expected, HRas-expressing cells expanded in number, which is consistent with a predominantly cell autonomous role for oncogenic HRas. By contrast, Wnt1-expressing cells did not expand in number. Instead, luminal expression of Wnt1 produced a dramatic and selective expansion of the basal epithelial cell compartment, as captured by live cell imaging. Thus, secreted Wnt1 primarily drove MEC overgrowth by acting in a paracrine rather than autocrine manner. Overall, chimeric organoid analysis can be used as a sensitive and effective tool for studying complex cell-cell interactions in the context of both normal and transformed mammary epithelium.  \nIn a final set of experiments directed at explaining how diverse tumor cell subtypes are maintained within mammary cancers, we examined the functional relationship between distinct tumor cell clones. Recent studies highlight the phenotypic and genetic diversity present locally within individual breast tumors, but whether this heterogeneity is a cause or a consequence of tumor progression remains unclear. Here, we used mouse models of breast cancer to demonstrate for the first time that interclonal cooperation can be essential for tumor maintenance. Aberrant expression of the secreted signaling molecule Wnt1 generates mixed-lineage mammary tumors composed of basal and luminal tumor cell subtypes, which purportedly derive from a bipotent malignant progenitor cell residing atop a tumor cell hierarchy. Using somatic HRas mutations as clonal markers, we showed that some Wnt tumors indeed conformed to a hierarchical configuration, but others unexpectedly harbored genetically distinct basal HRas mutant (HRasmut) and luminal HRas wild-type (HRaswt) subclones. Both subclones were required for efficient tumor propagation, which strictly depended on luminally-produced Wnt1. When biclonal tumors were challenged with Wnt withdrawal to simulate targeted therapy, analysis of tumor regression and relapse revealed that basal subclones recruited heterologous Wnt-producing cells to restore tumor growth. Alternatively, in the absence of a substitute Wnt source, the original subclones often evolved to rescue Wnt pathway activation and drive relapse, either by restoring cooperation or by switching to a defector strategy. Uncovering similar modes of interclonal cooperation in human cancers may inform efforts aimed at eradicating tumor cell communities. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9808], "author_name_tesi": "Cleary, Allison Shea", "last_name_ssi": "Cleary", "middle_name_ssi": "Shea", "first_name_ssi": "Allison", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Joseph Gunther", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "David Feith", "Leslie Joan Parent", "Todd Schell", "Raghu Sinha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Joseph Gunther, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Chair", "David Feith, Committee Member", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "Raghu Sinha, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tumor heterogeneity", "interclonal cooperation", "breast cancer", "mammary gland", "transgenic mice", "3D organoid culture", "FACS"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF A FLEXIBLE TOPOLOGY MICRO-HYBRID\nPASSENGER VEHICLE POWERTRAIN FOR HARDWARE-IN-THE LOOP SIMULATION AND EDUCATION", "id": "10706", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6154", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations allow for rapid testing and validation of prototype components and their mathematical models.

After the English Reformation, the Book of Common Prayer standardized the marriage ritual for the first time, and marriage\u2019s explicit purpose became the building of strong Protestant households and communities. To encourage compliance with the new rituals, the ecclesiastical courts considered any marriage ceremony or pact that took place without church solemnization to be \u201cclandestine.\u201d The fact that the courts could only punish, not invalidate, irregular unions, however, resulted in anxiety and confusion over what constituted a legitimate match. This study argues that early modern authors portray clandestine marriages to experiment with the Reformation\u2019s impact on the intersection between the self and the marriage ritual. Augmenting recent literary and historical studies of marriage, it provides the first examination of the controversial social practice in a variety of genres\u2014from the epic and epyllion to drama and complaint. In particular the dissertation investigates the impact of clandestine marriage on the selfhood and identity of characters in the works of three major authors: Edmund Spenser, Christopher Marlowe, and William Shakespeare. In doing so, it reveals that fictions of clandestine marriage provide crucial insight into the shift and value of the marital bond in the wake of the English Reformation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3407], "author_name_tesi": "Cleland, Katharine ", "last_name_ssi": "Cleland", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Katharine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick G Cheney", "Patrick G Cheney", "Robert R Edwards", "Garrett Sullivan Jr.", "Laura Lunger Knoppers", "Joan Landes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick G Cheney, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick G Cheney, Committee Chair", "Robert R Edwards, Committee Member", "Garrett Sullivan Jr., Committee Member", "Laura Lunger Knoppers, Committee Member", "Joan Landes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Christopher Marlowe", "Edmund Spenser", "English Reformation", "clandestine marriage", "William Shakespeare", "early modern courtship"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Performance Evaluation of the Microwave Electrothermal Thruster Using Nitrogen, Simulated Hydrazine, and Ammonia", "id": "8309", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1369", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Microwave Electrothermal Thruster (MET) is an electric propulsion (EP) device that uses an electromagnetic resonant cavity within which a free-floating plasma is ignited and sustained in a propellant gas. Microwave energy is coupled to the propellant gas through collisions between free electrons and heavy particles in the plasma. The heated propellant is accelerated though a gasdynamic nozzle and exhausted to generate thrust. This heating mechanism is similar to that of an arcjet, which utilizes an arc discharge formed between two electrodes to heat a propellant gas. The main difference is that the MET plasma is free-floating and thus the system does not suffer from the lifetime-limiting electrode erosion problems that are characteristic of the arcjet. The MET potentially offers thrust and specific impulse comparable to arcjets with higher efficiency at low power levels and longer lifetimes. \nResearch was initiated to examine the feasibility of operating the MET using the products of hydrazine decomposition as the propellant gas. The goal of this research was to improve the performance of a hydrazine chemical system by combining it with an EP system that can outperform the arcjet and does not suffer from erosion problems. Operation with hydrazine propellant allows for integration with a conventional chemical propulsion system onboard a spacecraft. In addition, such a system could possibly be used for multimode operation, thereby enhancing the operational capabilities of the spacecraft. For example, it could be operated in a high specific impulse mode, suitable for stationkeeping, with microwave energy sustaining a high temperature plasma at moderately low pressures, or operated in a high thrust mode, suitable for rapid spacecraft repositioning, at high pressures without microwave energy input. Operation of the MET using pure ammonia, another lightweight liquid-storable propellant, was also examined to determine how well the MET performs compared to the arcjet using ammonia. The feasibility of operating the MET at various frequencies and power levels using simulated hydrazine and ammonia has been demonstrated.\nIn the MET plasma, microwave energy is coupled to the propellant gas through free electrons in the plasma. The electric field accelerates free electrons, which then transfer their kinetic energy to heavy particles through collision. Thus, electric field strength and chamber pressure play important roles in the power deposition and energy exchange mechanisms. These roles were examined theoretically through numerical modeling of the cavity electric field and experimentally through the variation of several MET components and parameters. In this program, testing was conducted on the 7.5-GHz MET at a power level of 70\u2013100 W using pure nitrogen and various mixtures of N2, H2, and NH3 to simulate decomposed hydrazine. Parametric studies of the effects of nozzle throat diameter, microwave frequency, and microwave power were performed. Testing was also conducted on the 2.45-GHz MET at a power level of 1\u20132 kW using pure nitrogen, simulated hydrazine, and pure ammonia. Parametric studies of the effects of nozzle throat diameter, antenna probe depth, propellant injector diameter, and the inclusion of an impedance matching unit were performed. Thrust and specific impulse measurements for the 2.45- and 7.5-GHz METs were obtained using thrust stands. At the present time, the 2.45- and 7.5-GHz METs are not optimized for operation with simulated hydrazine or ammonia, but key areas of study that have potential for significant performance enhancement have been identified. For the 2.45-GHz thruster, calculated specific impulses with ammonia and simulated hydrazine approach 400 s and 425 s, respectively, whereas, for the 7.5-GHz thruster, calculated specific impulse with simulated hydrazine approaches 220 s. However, experimental performance measurements were up to 40% lower than theoretical calculations. Numerical electromagnetic modeling of the existing 7.5- and 2.45-GHz thrusters was performed using the commercially available finite element analysis software COMSOL Multiphysics. This modeling yielded insight on the effects of variation of antenna depth, microwave frequency, and microwave power. The results agreed well with experimental measurements. Numerical electromagnetic modeling was also performed to design a new 8-GHz MET. This thruster was built and a preliminary performance evaluation was conducted. Calculated specific impulse with simulated hydrazine reached approximately 300 s with 95% coupling efficiency at a forward power of 250 W.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1358], "author_name_tesi": "Clemens, Daniel E", "last_name_ssi": "Clemens", "middle_name_ssi": "E", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Matthew Micci", "Sven G Bilen", "Robert Graham Melton", "David Spencer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Matthew Micci, Committee Chair", "Sven G Bilen, Committee Member", "Robert Graham Melton, Committee Member", "David Spencer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plasma", "thrust measurements", "electric field", "numerical modeling", "analytical modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Experiences of Adult Students in Multi-generational Classrooms\n", "id": "10693", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3305", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\tThis qualitative study is a basic interpretative inquiry studying the experiences of fourteen adult students 45 years of age or older in a multi-generational community college classroom.

The reforming of liquid fuels to produce hydrogen is a possible intermediate step in moving towards a hydrogen economy, but ultra low sulfur fuels are required since catalysts for fuel reforming and for fuel cell electrode (anode) are sensitive to sulfur poisoning. Traditional methods of removing sulfur, such as hydro-treating, are very costly to create ultra clean fuels, can change the composition of the fuel, and consume large quantities of hydrogen, which are the desired product. Adsorptive desulfurization has great potential to remove sulfur from the readily available liquid fuels, while not affecting the fuel composition. Nickel adsorbents are specifically effective because they are very selective to sulfur.\nThis research will compare three different types of nickel adsorbents. The comparison of these adsorbents should give some insight into how to design the most effective nickel adsorbent for removing sulfur from liquid fuels.\nThe first adsorbent studied in this research is a nickel metal loaded on SiO2Al2O3. The second adsorbent is Raney Nickel which is a highly dispersed nickel supported on an aluminum framework. The final type of adsorbent was prepared in the laboratory by co-precipitation, and has varying nickel metal contents. This adsorbent is supported on aluminum and in some cases contains varying amount of zinc.\niv\nAfter the three adsorbents have been tested, a comparison on these adsorbents can be shown. The adsorbent performance on jet fuel is highly dependent on the basis. For example, the co-precipitated sample 2/5/1 NiZnAl appears to perform the best with jet fuel on a g-fuel/g-Ads basis. On the basis of fuel processed, the Raney Nickel performs the best. This occurs because the co-precipitated samples are not as dense, and only about 1.7 grams was packed in the same volume as 3 grams of Ni-SiO2Al2O3 and 4.5 grams of Raney nickel. For tests on diesel fuel, there was no difference on the basis. It appears that of all the different physical properties of the adsorbents including surface area, micropore area and average pore size, the most important factor is surface nickel content. Raney nickel has the highest surface nickel content and performs the best followed by Ni- SiO2Al2O3 and then finally the co-precipitated samples.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2768], "author_name_tesi": "Clemons, Jennifer Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Clemons", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Chunshan Song"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Thesis Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fuel processing", "nickel adsorbents", "sulfur removal"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A Comparison Study Of The Policies And Procedures between A Juvenile Justice Facility And A Public High School \n", "id": "28813", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12507", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This case study examined the use of informal and formal protocols by two different institutions, a public high school and a juvenile justice facility.

It is in this area that many uncertainties are found. The current generation of full-core prismatic HTGR safety analysis codes employ coarse mesh solution methods for modeling the fluid flow and heat transfer in this reactor. There is, however, no generally accepted procedure for deriving accurate coarse mesh parameters, and the assumptions and approximations made in deriving models for the subscale behavior vary significantly. In contrast, current full-core neutronics analysis methods employ detailed unit cell calculations, combined with formal mathematical homogenization techniques, to obtain consistent and accurate coarse mesh parameters. The resulting coarse mesh solutions are of high quality and accuracy, and the ability to reconstruct the fine scale solution is an inherent part of the approach. In this work a new approach to modeling HTGR thermal-fluids is proposed that combines concepts from modern CFD techniques, formal mathematical homogenization, and full-core neutronics analysis methods.\nIn an attempt to bridge the gap between the current generation of coarse mesh methods and high resolution CFD approaches, a hybrid coarse/fine mesh compressible CFD solution scheme, intended for the safety analysis of prismatic HTGRs, has been developed. The reactor is considered on any scale to consist of a two-phase mixture of fluid and stationary solid components. This solution scheme is accompanied by a new model for the turbulent mixing and thermal dispersion in porous media based in the k-\u03b5 turbulence model.\nA new hierarchical solution scheme for modeling solid heat conduction is proposed which combines concepts from the equivalence theory in neutron transport and the field of reduced order modeling. Detailed unit cell calculations are used to obtain homogenized coarse mesh parameters and reduced order models are employed in modeling the time-dependent fine scale behavior. Inherent in this new approach is the ability to reconstruct the solution at any spatial scale.\nCoupled solutions based on the MHTGR-350MW benchmark are provided, demonstrating the features of the proposed methods. In particular the level of detail that is achieved by reconstructing the fine scale solution is far beyond that of traditional coarse mesh methods. The proposed methods are equally valid for other engineering applications, specifically those characterized by multiple spatial scales with complex flows through domains containing multiple arbitrary porous regions with localized heat sources and sinks.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8234], "author_name_tesi": "Clifford, Ivor David", "last_name_ssi": "Clifford", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Ivor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Fan Bill B Cheung", "Robert Francis Kunz", "Hrvoje Jasak", "Richard Martineau", "Onno Ubbink"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Dissertation Advisor", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Chair", "Maria Nikolova Avramova, Committee Chair", "Fan Bill B Cheung, Committee Member", "Robert Francis Kunz, Committee Member", "Hrvoje Jasak, Special Member", "Richard Martineau, Special Member", "Onno Ubbink, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["prismatic HTGR", "thermal-fluids", "heat transfer", "homogenization", "multiscale", "coarse mesh CFD", "reduced order model"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Thermodynamic formalism and multifractal analysis for general topological dynamical systems", "id": "10879", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6386", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We investigate to what degree results in dimension theory and multifractal formalism can be derived as a direct consequence of thermodynamic properties of a dynamical system.  We show that under quite general conditions, various multifractal spectra (the entropy spectrum for Birkhoff averages and the dimension spectrum for pointwise dimensions, among others) may be obtained as Legendre transforms of functions T : &#8477; &rarr; &#8477; arising in the thermodynamic formalism.  We impose minimal requirements on the maps we consider, and obtain partial results for any continuous map f on a compact metric space.  In order to obtain complete results, the primary hypothesis we require is that the functions T be continuously differentiable.  This makes rigorous the general paradigm of reducing questions regarding the multifractal formalism to questions regarding the thermodynamic formalism.  These results hold for a broad class of measurable potentials, which includes (but is not limited to) continuous functions.  We give applications that include most previously known results, as well as some new ones.\n\nAlong the way, we show that Bowen's equation, which characterises the Hausdorff dimension of certain sets in terms of the topological pressure of an expanding conformal map, applies in greater generality than has been heretofore established.  In particular, we consider an arbitrary subset Z of a compact metric space and require only that the lower Lyapunov exponents be positive on Z, together with a tempered contraction condition.  Among other things, this allows us to compute the dimension spectrum for Lyapunov exponents in terms of the entropy spectrum for Lyapunov exponents, and is also a crucial tool in the aforementioned results on the dimension spectrum for local dimensions.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6386], "author_name_tesi": "Climenhaga, Vaughn ", "last_name_ssi": "Climenhaga", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vaughn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yakov B Pesin", "Yakov B Pesin", "Omri Sarig", "Mark Levi", "Mark Strikman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yakov B Pesin, Dissertation Advisor", "Yakov B Pesin, Committee Chair", "Omri Sarig, Committee Member", "Mark Levi, Committee Member", "Mark Strikman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dynamical systems", "ergodic theory", "thermodynamic formalism", "multifractal analysis", "dimension theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Lignin As A Biorefinery Co-Product Market Opportunity", "id": "28767", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12266", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As the world considers moving from fossil fuel dependence toward a bio-economy, the development of biofuels is playing a major role. Unpredictable oil prices and governmental policy in favor of renewable energy has turned a non-existent industry into one that produces billions of gallons of corn ethanol each year. First generation biofuels, are facing barriers such as the blend wall and the food vs. fuel debate. The development of second-generation biofuels addresses many of the concerns caused by first generation biofuels by utilizing non-food based, lignocellulosic feedstock to generate, among other products, liquid biofuels and isolated lignin waste. Lignin, produced in large quantities is typically burned as an inexpensive fuel source.  Unlocking lignin\u2019s potential as a value-added product in the second-generation biorefinery would proliferate plant economics and advance commercialization. A thorough literature review was followed by expert elucidation interviews, providing the rationale for an examination of activated carbon as a potential value-added opportunity for biorefinery lignin. The overall goal of this research was to better understand the market potential of lignin-based activated carbon for the application of mercury sequestration from U.S. coal-fired power plant flue gas. This research focused on surveying coal-fired power plants that operated or planned to operate activated carbon injection systems for the sequestration of mercury. This study provided insight into how likely a power plant would be to purchase a lignin-based activated carbon, their likeliness of switching vendors, and the attributes that determine their purchases of an activated carbon product. For industry, the results of this research have potential to change how second-generation biorefineries utilize their lignin waste streams to increase revenue and plant economics. For activated carbon suppliers, this research identifies which attributes are most important to the activated carbon client for the aforementioned application and opens doors to a new abundant feedstock.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11652], "author_name_tesi": "Cline, Stephen Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Cline", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biorenewable Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Michael Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Michael Smith, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lignin", "lignin valorization", "new product development", "activated carbon", "Mercury and Air Toxic Standards (MATS)", "biorefinery"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Behaviorally active substances affecting reproductive success of the fungus gnat, Lycoriella ingenua, a pest of white button mushrooms, Agaricus bisporus ", "id": "13735krc204", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13735", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Little is known about the host seeking and courtship behaviors of the fungus gnat, Lycoriella ingenua (Diptera: Sciaridae), one of the most sever insect pests of cultivated white button mushrooms, Agaricus bisporus.

The work presented in this dissertation examines the host seeking behavior of female flies and the copulatory behavior of male flies.

Corals have symbiotic algae and other associated microbial organisms, which collectively contribute to and comprise the coral holobiont. As an integral part of the coral holobiont, bacteria are used as indicators of coral health. Yet, little is known regarding the bacterial diversity associated with coral reef environments, and even less has been published about the bacteria that are associated with isolated marine protected areas, such as the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument (French Frigate Shoals, Northwestern Hawaiian Islands). To obtain a baseline, both sediment and water-associated bacteria were examined from select locations in the French Frigate Shoals. Other reef locations have also received legal protection, however many corals within protected areas still exhibit strong signs of disease (e.g. such as Puerto Morelos National Marine Park and the Virgin Islands National Park). Minimal research has been published on the bacterial diversity associated with diseased corals. \nTo that end, we examined the bacterial communities associated with Orbicella faveolata exhibiting signs of Yellow Band Disease (YBD) within the Puerto Morelos National Marine Park, Mexico. Additionally, while studies have examined how changes in sea surface temperatures affect the coral-host at the gene-level, gaps remain regarding how corals respond to disease. We explored these gaps by examining the host transcriptomic response to YBD in Mexico and subsequently sampled an additional disease affecting O. faveolata, White Plague, as well as two diseases affecting Acropora palmata in the US Virgin Islands, White Band and White Pox. Of the four diseases examined, core responses across as well as within both species were detected. Differences in host response were also noted between each disease. Profiling the bacterial associations and host response allows us to gain a better understanding of the bacterial diversity associated with different health states of coral reef environments and how the host transcriptome responds to changes in health. These findings may be useful as baselines to diagnose the health state of other declining reef environments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10325], "author_name_tesi": "Closek, Collin John-erik", "last_name_ssi": "Closek", "middle_name_ssi": "John-erik", "first_name_ssi": "Collin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Monica Medina", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Jennifer Macalady", "Moriah Louise Szpara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Monica Medina, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Chair", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member", "Moriah Louise Szpara, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["coral reef health", "transcriptomics", "bacteria", "disease dynamics", "Caribbean", "Central Pacific"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Calfhood Pneumonia on Heifer and Cow Survival and Performance", "id": "12638gxc5043", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12638", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex (BRD) is a prevalent and economically important disease in growing cattle. The complexity of the disease is due to its multifactorial nature; it involves intricate interactions between bacterial agents, viral agents, the environment, and other stressors. The term BRD is most commonly used to describe a host of complex respiratory issues that are present in cattle, including upper respiratory infections and various forms of pneumonia. BRD cases for this study were defined as calves that were treated for \u201cpneumonia\u201d in the first six months of life, so the words pneumonia and BRD are used interchangeably henceforth. In addition to the obvious costs of treatment, BRD affects calf survivability, age at first calving, and cow performance (body weight and milk yield).\nHealth events, cull records, and calving dates were obtained from Holstein calves (n=1629) born between January 2000 and April 2015 on the Penn State University (PSU) dairy herd to analyze survivability. The GLIMMIX and LIFETEST procedures of SAS were used to determine what factors significantly affected pneumonia incidence, survival, and age at first calving (AFC). Year of birth (P<0.0001) and season of birth (P=0.0003) were significant predictors for pneumonia incidence. Calves born in months September through November were most likely to have a pneumonia treatment recorded (19.02%). Cattle treated for calf-hood pneumonia did not survive (mean sold age: 1507.91\u00b154.33 days) as long as the calves that were not treated for pneumonia (mean sold age:\niii\n1612.49\u00b122.70 days). Pneumonia incidence (P=0.0189) had significant effects on survival to 24-months of age. Cattle not treated for pneumonia had 1.649 greater odds of surviving to 24 months than those who were treated for pneumonia. Cattle treated for pneumonia had a slightly older mean for AFC (770.94\u00b17.30 days) than healthy cattle (761.97\u00b12.79 days), but this was not significant.\nAfter analyzing the effects the disease has on herd survivability, it was important to determine if animals once treated for BRD performed as well as their healthy herdmates. The health events of the cattle were obtained along with 708,162 daily milk yield observations and 560,059 daily body weight observations. The performance data was analyzed using a mixed model in ASREML where daily milk yield or daily body weight was determined by the fixed effects (lactation, week of lactation within lactation group, pneumonia status, pneumonia status within lactation group, pneumonia status within week of lactation and lactation group, and age group) and random effects (year- week within lactation group, cow, cow within lactation, and residual error). For milk yield, the effect of pneumonia (P=0.941) was not significant across lactations and stage of lactation. The significant differences in milk yield between diseased and healthy cattle tended to occur in late lactation. Pneumonia (P=0.332) and pneumonia within lactation group (P=0.360) were not significant indicators for body weight. Therefore, pneumonia significantly affected herd survivability and age at first calving; however, this study failed to demonstrate significance differences in milk yield and body weight for those calves that did survive.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13589], "author_name_tesi": "Closs, Gary Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Closs", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Gary", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chad Daniel Dechow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chad Daniel Dechow, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bovine Respiratory Disease", "BRD", "calfhood pneumonia", "heifer survival", "cow performance", "BRDC", "cow survival"]}]
