Since geographic information systems technology became broadly used in natural resource fields in the 1980s, scientists have used digital elevation models to study aspects of forested ecosystems including the delineation of drainage networks, geomorphic modeling, and ecological classification for forest management and ecosystem management. With recently available lidar elevation data, we have improved our ability to \u201csee\u201d features on the landscape by orders of magnitude. Existing methodologies for assessing geomorphometry and hydrologic network delineation across the landscape may not suffice for all tasks. By taking a multi-scale, multidisciplinary approach, we can improve our understanding of headwater ecosystems and how to assess and predict the relationship between terrain and vegetation.  This research was performed in the Leading Ridge experimental watersheds, the site of a long-term study analyzing the impact of forest management practices on stream water quality. The Leading Ridge experimental watersheds are also located within the Susquehanna/Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory. \nIn order to assess the ability of lidar-derived DEM to improve stream network modeling, the stream network for Leading Ridge watershed number one was recorded using a GPS unit during base flow conditions. The stream network was then modeled using lidar-derived 1 m, 3 m, and 10 m resolution DEMs as well as photogrammetrically-derived NED (National Elevation Dataset) DEM. All of the lidar-derived DEMs resulted in a relatively accurate stream network model, with the 3 m DEM providing the most accurate model. There was no significant difference between any of the lidar-derived modeled stream networks, but they were all significantly different from the NED DEM-derived stream network, which was much less accurate. Topographic index (TI) was modeled using multiple DEM products and presented very different statistical distributions and spatial patterns. The distribution of TI could have an impact on hydrologic models, while the improvements in network delineation could substantially improve our knowledge of headwater streams on the landscape. This could in part impact forest management, site planning, and ecosystem modeling. \nSurface roughness was calculated for Leading Ridge using several algorithms on two different lidar-derived DEMs to evaluate patterns of roughness on the watershed. Roughness metrics included standard deviation of slope, value of pittedness in cells, standard deviation of curvature, and the difference between the original DEM and a splined surface. Micro-plots and transects were surveyed to ground truth roughness metrics. Although the scale of the 1 m DEM was too coarse to assess micro-topography at the same scale as the ground survey, unique patterns were identified on different landforms and soil types. There was also substantial interaction between the roughness algorithm and the DEM creation algorithm. The results suggest that although there are many complicating factors when assessing surface roughness using a lidar-derived DEM, there is information about soils and topography that can be obtained. Also, DEMs studied here had slightly higher elevation values (about 0.3 m) on average than the field-surveyed elevations. \nIn order to relate topography to vegetation, curvature was chosen to model landforms based on its importance to water transport on an ecosystem. There was evidence of curvature being reflective of underlying geology and predictive for soil properties that may affect vegetation. Leading Ridge watershed was delineated into nine curvature classes using a 10 m DEM, and patterns of curvature were used to construct four recurring formations: hidden hollows, rock ridgelets, scalloped slopes, and rounded ridges. Based on a vegetation analysis of these formations, there was a difference in both vegetation community and structure based on formation. Similar formations were calculated for a broader region of the Ridge and Valley Province and vegetation communities on formations were identified. There was association between the identified vegetation community and the delineated formation. \nOverall, methodologies were developed to explore properties of forested ecosystems in the Ridge and Valley Province. Using lidar elevation data, delineation of the stream network and characterization of terrain and micro-topography were all improved, and curvature was utilized to help classify the landforms in watershed. Further research should attempt to validate these results across a broader area, as well as work to develop techniques to use together to create a multi-scale, hierarchical classification system incorporating hydrologic data, surface roughness, and landscape level terrain data. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3477], "author_name_tesi": "Brubaker, Kristen Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Brubaker", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Kristen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wayne Lawrence Myers", "Wayne Lawrence Myers", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer", "Douglas Miller", "Patrick Joseph Drohan", "Eric Zenner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wayne Lawrence Myers, Dissertation Advisor", "Wayne Lawrence Myers, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer, Committee Chair", "Douglas Miller, Committee Member", "Patrick Joseph Drohan, Committee Member", "Eric Zenner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lidar", "terrain analysis", "forest classification", "microtopography", "stream network delineation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Do you see what I see?

This research examines hostile media perceptions of blogs and news websites.  Hostile media perceptions are aroused in partisans who believe neutral or balanced media messages on an issue-relevant topic portray a biased or slanted view contrary to their opinion.   Partisans (N = 760) who strongly supported and opposed the issue of legalizing same-sex marriage participated in this study, which was made available online to readers of political and issue-oriented blogs.  There were four primary purposes guiding this research: 1) to extend theorizing on hostile media perceptions and explore whether or not these perceptions  exist within the blogosphere; 2) to examine the relationship between explicit source biases, commonly identified within blogs and more traditional media sources, and how these biases influence hostile perceptions more or less favorably; 3) to examine third person perceptions as an explanatory mechanism of hostile media perceptions and how differences in the issue attitudes of others influences this bias; and 4) to link general media perceptions (media credibility and media skepticism) and media reliance to hostile perceptions. \n\nThis research shows blogs (media blogs and issue blogs) generate hostile perceptions.  In addition, individual political characteristics play a distinct role in partisans\u2019 judgments of media messages.  Source bias also triggers more favorable and less hostile attitudes of media messages when the bias aligns with partisans\u2019 views.  Less favorable and more hostile perceptions are aroused from balanced messages when the source does not align with their views.  In general, this research shows source bias plays a greater role in generating hostile media perceptions for partisans with liberal and conservative orientations than reliance on online media or skepticism of mainstream media.  Additionally, third person perceptions, particularly the influence on others with contrasting attitudes, proved a significant predictor of hostile perceptions, validating claims that the media\u2019s perceived influence on others does indeed contribute to hostile perceptions of media coverage. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7135], "author_name_tesi": "Brubaker, Pamela Jo", "last_name_ssi": "Brubaker", "middle_name_ssi": "Jo", "first_name_ssi": "Pamela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Karl Davis", "Michel M Haigh", "Mary Beth Oliver", "Francis Erin Dardis", "Karen Gasper"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Karl Davis, Committee Chair", "Michel M Haigh, Committee Chair", "Mary Beth Oliver, Committee Member", "Francis Erin Dardis, Committee Member", "Karen Gasper, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hostile media perceptions", "hostile media effect", "third person perceptions", "blogs", "online news", "media blogs"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "An atmospheric-pressure microgap plasma source for ozone generation", "id": "23711", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10758", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ozone is a powerful oxidant commonly used to remove pollutants in water.

Supplementing mice with vitamin D has been shown to suppress while vitamin D deficiency or lack of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) increases intestinal inflammation in several experimental models of IBD. The intestinal microenvironment needs to be able to respond to invading pathogens with an appropriate immune response and then through the actions of gut specific tolerance-inducing immune cells turn off the response. We hypothesize that vitamin D regulates the development and function of intestinal T cells and that in the absence of vitamin D or the VDR intestinal T cell populations are skewed toward the inflammatory T cell types. The first objective of this research was to evaluate the development of intestinal T cell populations in vitamin D or VDR deficient mice. The second was to determine if potential differences in intestinal T cells are due to a T cell intrinsic need for vitamin D during development or if vitamin D is an environmental factor that affects T cell development or function.\nThe work presented here reveals a role of vitamin D in maintaining intestinal health by regulating the development and function of intestinal specific T cell populations.

The profession of physical therapy is quickly moving to the doctoral entry-level degree.  The Doctorate in Physical Therapy (DPT) degree focuses on preparing professionals for clinical practice, clinical scholarship, and a professional career in a specific field and aims at producing autonomous entry-level graduates.\n\tThe purposes of this study were to determine: 1) what curricular components academic and clinical physical therapists think should be added, 2) whether curricular perspectives influence these opinions, 3) what essential skills academic and clinical therapist think an entry-level graduate should possess in order to be an autonomous practitioner, 4) where in the curriculum these changes should be made as programs make the transitions from the entry-level Master\u2019s  degree to the entry-level doctoral degree, and 5) actual changes being proposed or made to the curriculum as programs make this transition and compare these changes to what both academic and clinical therapists think should be added to the curriculum. The research methodology included t-Tests to compare the mean differences between the opinions of clinical and academic therapists on curricular perspectives, curricular content and essential skills.  Multiple regression analysis examined the influence of demographic characteristics such as years of experience and curricular perspectives on curricular content and essential skills.  Logistic regression analysis examined the influence of the same demographic characteristics and curricular perspectives on where in the curriculum content additions should be made.\nThe results of the study suggest that academic and clinical therapists are influenced by different curricular perspectives: academic therapists are more likely to be influenced by reflective practice and the behavioral perspectives, while clinical therapists are more likely to be influenced by the traditional perspective.  Therapists influenced by reflective practice and the behavioral perspectives are more likely to think all 12 curricular content areas should be added to the curriculum as programs make the transition to the DPT, while therapists influenced by the traditional perspective are more likely to think only 2 curricular content areas should be added to the curriculum as the transition is made.  In addition, therapists who are influenced by reflective practice and the behavioral perspectives are more likely to think that entry-level graduates should possess a broader range of skills.  Curricular perspectives did not appear to be a significant factor for where in the curriculum content should be added.\n The results of this study have implications for physical therapy practice and theory and research.

Fixed optic designs have recently been proposed that have a transparent middle sheet with small, widely spaced, and highly efficient solar cells sandwiched between a fixed lenslet array on top and fixed reflector array on the bottom. Precision actuators position the middle sheet at the focal points of the lenslet/reflector array to microtrack the sun throughout the day. This paper discusses the kinematic design and control of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators used for the first time in this application. SMA actuators have the potential to be less expensive, easier to integrate, and lower power than electric motors. The kinematic design maintains upper and lower bounds on wire tension to prevent failure and ensure reversible actuation, respectively. The SMA actuators under quasi-linearized PID control can position the middle sheet with +/- 7 mm of range in the vertical and horizontal directions while ensuring less than 1.9 \u03bcm of steady state error in SMA actuator stroke. The middle sheet position and orientation errors, however, exceed 1 mm and 0.5o, respectively. These relatively large errors are due to flexibility in the suspension system, friction at wire supports, and large kinematic gains at extreme positions and indicate the need for middle sheet error measurement and feedback control.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16315], "author_name_tesi": "Brulo, Gregory Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Brulo", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Christopher Rahn", "Dr. H.J.

To do this we will need to expand the capacity of our workforce development and educational system to meet the training needs of business and industry. In order to assess the real world value of training in the private sector, one must first determine whether or not training is an expense or an investment. Of course this is not as easy as it sounds, for in general, the \u201cvalue\u201d of training is an expense in bad economic times and an investment in good economic times. In broad categorical terms, we want to know about the specific outcomes of workforce education and training programs. We want to be able to quantify the economic value of those programs for both employers and employees. This study examined the impact of pre-employment training delivered through the Marcellus Shale Education and Training Center to determine if the training program had an impact on new hires with the gas industry relative to reducing the number of safety incidents among new hires, reducing overall attrition rates among new hires, and help new hires acquire the kind of work ethic necessary for success in the gas industry.\nThe design of this study used a blend of quantitative and qualitative methods that is essentially descriptive in nature and focused on those individuals newly hired by companies in the oil and gas industry in the Marcellus Shale play in Central and Northern Pennsylvania. While not as rigorous as a true experiment, the researcher believed that this quasi-experimental design model would provide insight into the impact of the pre-employment training program on new hires in the gas industry. Given the challenges of determining the impact of training under the best of circumstances, and with those challenges compounded by the constantly changing landscape of training within the gas industry, particularly in the Marcellus Shale Region of Pennsylvania, it seemed to this researcher that applying this kind of mixed-method approach offered the best chance of assessing the practical value of the pre-employment training program that is the primary subject of this study. Based solely on the quantitative numbers, the experimental group for this study did demonstrate fewer safety incidents, a lower attrition rate, fewer tardies and fewer absences (i.e. a better work ethic) than members of the control group. However, from a statistical perspective, there was no statistically significant difference between the performance of the experimental group relative to the three dependent variables (safety incident score, attrition rate score, and work ethic score) in the work place (i.e. the gas industry) compared to the performance of those from the control group relative to those three variables in the work place. The degree of legacy knowledge possessed by those in the control group was a non-factor. Still, the numbers do not tell the whole story. And some of the numbers tell (or at least suggest) a quite different story that will require further research. But this study was seeking to go beyond the quantitative numbers and address some of the more qualitative factors that influence why one individual might be successful in the gas industry and another not so successful. It was in this context, for example, that the notion of work ethic was examined. In addition, since work ethic, or the lack thereof, has become in Pennsylvania a contributing factor to whether or not companies working the Marcellus Shale gas play are able to find and retain the right kind of people, particularly roughnecks, roustabouts and general laborers, it seemed that trying to come to a better understanding of work ethic in both quantitative and qualitative terms would lead to the development of better training programs geared towards preparing entry level workers for gas industry companies, and impact the retention rates for those companies (and so reduce their training costs in relation to high turnover).\nIn the final analysis, the value of this study is that it delineates a variety of areas that need further exploration. What is the relationship between the number of safety incidents and the amount of formal safety training versus informal on-the-job safety training? What is the value of work ethic as it is defined by the gas industry, and what is the degree to which a positive work ethic reduces overall turnover rates and increases productivity? And what are the reasons for the high degree of workforce mobility in the gas industry; does this mobility increase competition between companies; and what impact does this mobility then have on the training needs of companies throughout the industry. This study provides a context for understanding the scope of these questions.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6314], "author_name_tesi": "Brundage, Tracy Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Brundage", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Tracy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Lynn Passmore", "David Lynn Passmore", "Wesley Edward Donahue", "William J Rothwell", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Lynn Passmore, Dissertation Advisor", "David Lynn Passmore, Committee Chair", "Wesley Edward Donahue, Committee Member", "William J Rothwell, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["workforce capacity", "value of training to industry", "gas and oil industry", "pre-employment training", "workforce development", "employability skills"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Effects Of Porosity And Mineral Composition On Cement Alteration During Geological Carbon Sequestration", "id": "18136", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7910", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases such as CO2, it is likely that major climate change will occur by the end of the century if abatement measures are not implemented.

Assessment of this risk is one of the major challenges for CSS and is critical to ensuring the success of sequestration and the safety of the human population and environment. \nAfter injection, CO2 can dissolve into in situ brine to increasing its acidity. Acidified brine can react with wellbore cement, potentially changing its composition and transport properties. In this work, we develop a reactive transport model based on experimental observations to understand and predict the property evolution of cement in direct contact with CO2-saturated brine under diffusion-controlled conditions. This works also quantified the role of initial cement properties such as initial portlandite content and porosity in the alteration process.\nResults show alteration as initially fast before slowing down at later time. It appears that the initial portlandite content to porosity (defined here as \u03c6) ratio is a key parameter in determining the evolution of cement properties. Portlandite rich cement, for which \u03c6 values are large, results in a localized reactive diffusive front characterized by calcite precipitation. This leads to a significant porosity reduction, which eventually clogs the pore preventing further acid penetration. However at the cement brine interface severe degradation will occurs. This will insure a preferential path through the degraded zone.\n\t\nThe developed reactive transport model provides a valuable tool to link cement-CO2 reactions with wellbore cement behavior, and can facilitate risk assessment associated with geological CO2 sequestration.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7832], "author_name_tesi": "Brunet, Jean-patrick Leopold", "last_name_ssi": "Brunet", "middle_name_ssi": "Leopold", "first_name_ssi": "Jean-patrick", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Li Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Li Li, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Carbon capture and storage", "carbon sequestration", "wellbore cement", "carbon dioxide reaction"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The mechanisms and functional implications of altered microvascular vasoreactivity in healthy and essential hypertensive men and women", "id": "19723", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9379", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cutaneous vasodilation enables nutrient delivery to the skin and effectively transfers heat away from the body core to the environment for thermoregulation.

In the first study we investigated the specific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms responsible for mediating NO-dependent vasodilation during local skin heating and acetylcholine (Ach) perfusion in healthy young and middle-aged men and women.  We found that endothelial NOS (eNOS) mediates NO-dependent vasodilation during both local skin heating and Ach perfusion in young and middle-aged individuals.

Surface immobilized DNA is used in biosensing applications to capture an analyte of interest, which is then detected (in this case using fluorescence), as the detection of DNA sequences can be used to diagnose disease. Several encoding strategies are used to correlate the signal generated with the identity of the analyte, including spatial encoding incorporated into planar substrates, where a particular area on the surface corresponds to a particular analyte probe; and anisotropic encoding incorporated into particular substrates, where the particle itself codes for the analyte through its composition, etc. Both planar and particulate surfaces were analyzed in this work; the synthesis, functionalization, nucleic acid attachment and subsequent use as a probe in an assay, and signal transduction of bound analyte were all investigated. Barcoded nanowires serve as the encoded particle in this system, where the immobilized DNA sequence corresponds to the metallic pattern of the wire itself.\n\nChapters 2 and 3 detail the use of polymerases and ligases, respectively, to perform enzymatic amplification reactions (polymerase chain reaction and ligase chain reaction) when the\nnucleic acid primer or probe is bound to a barcoded nanowire. Investigations into the reaction mechanism, such as attachment chemistry thermostability measurements and control experiments to determine fluorescence signal origin, were performed and a hypothesis to explain the behavior observed is proposed; these studies are applicable to surface phase amplification between differing systems. Chapter 4 uses microcontact printing, where a polydimethyl siloxane stamp is used to pattern planar substrates with DNA probe sequences. Surface functionalization was studied in order to optimize DNA pattern transfer. These studies pave the way for microcontact insertion printing, which can be used to pattern isolated DNA molecules for use in single molecule studies. Taken together, these investigations answer fundamental questions about the reactions that occur when DNA is immobilized onto a surface for use in a biological assay.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5550], "author_name_tesi": "Brunker, Sarah Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Brunker", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Philip C.

Expert professional development without its acceptance and transfer into instructional practice is not sufficient.  The question of why some schools flourish and others do not when presented with the same professional development begs to be asked and answered.  This study sought to clear the cloud of uncertainty around what factors are present when professional development is efficacious and what factors interfere.  \n\tThe purpose of this research was to examine the perceptions of the participants directly involved in these professional development efforts, including teachers, principals, instructional facilitators, external consultants, and district personnel who were involved on-site of the efficacy of the professional development used to bring about changes in (1) beliefs and attitudes, and (2) actions and behavior in support of a Balanced Literacy initiative in an urban district.  Two schools in the district were studied in this case study for the years 2003-2005.  Data collected included contemporary key informant interviews of the principals, the instructional facilitators, and two teachers from each building.  Documents included \nBalanced Literacy Implementation Team minutes, reports from consultants who worked in the district, PSSA results, staff surveys, and participant-observer recollections and field notes.  \n\tBefore undertaking a large-scale professional development initiative in Balanced Literacy, it is important for districts to realize that professional development is context specific, internal capacity is necessary to sustain the initiative, and the professional culture of the school is an important consideration in an initiative\u2019s success.

Coloboma mice exhibit profound hyperactivity and are a model of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  To determine whether coloboma mice exhibit other signs of ADHD, we assessed latent inhibition as a test of attention, and we assessed impulsivity in coloboma mice.  We used a conditioned taste aversion paradigm to measure latent inhibition.  Control mice showed latent inhibition, but latent inhibition was disrupted in coloboma mice.  We used a delayed reinforcer paradigm to evaluate impulsivity.  When given a choice between an immediately-available lesser reinforcer and a delayed greater reinforcer, coloboma mice did not wait as long as control mice to obtain the greater reinforcer, suggesting that coloboma mice are impulsive.  Therefore, coloboma mice exhibit all 3 core signs of ADHD:  hyperactivity, inattention as determined by latent inhibition, and impulsivity. \n\nBecause noradrenergic dysregulation mediates hyperactivity in coloboma mice, we examined the role of norepinephrine in disrupted latent inhibition and impulsivity.  Reduction of norepinephrine with DSP-4 (N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride) restored latent inhibition but did not ameliorate impulsivity, suggesting that these behaviors are governed by independent mechanisms.\n\nTo identify the receptor subtypes that regulate hyperactivity of coloboma mice, coloboma mice were systematically challenged with adrenergic drugs.  The beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol and the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist prazosin each had little effect on the hyperactivity.  Conversely, the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine reduced the activity of coloboma mice but not control mice.  Subtype-selective blockade of alpha 2C-, but not alpha 2A- or alpha 2B-adrenergic receptors, ameliorated hyperactivity of coloboma mice without affecting activity of control mice, suggesting that alpha 2C-adrenergic receptors mediate the hyperactivity.  Localized in the basal ganglia, alpha 2C-adrenergic receptors are in a prime position to impact locomotor activity and are, therefore, potential targets of pharmacotherapy for ADHD. \n\nIn summary, this thesis represents a behavioral and pharmacological characterization of coloboma mice as a model of ADHD.  Here we show that coloboma mice exhibit all 3 core signs of ADHD:  hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity; that norepinephrine mediates both hyperactivity and inattention in coloboma mice; and that alpha 2C-adrenergic receptors are a potential source of noradrenergic dysregulation in coloboma mice.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3418], "author_name_tesi": "Bruno, Kristy J.", "last_name_ssi": "Bruno", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Kristy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ellen J Hess", "Robert J Milner", "Hyder A Jinnah", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy", "Robert Harold Bonneau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ellen J Hess, Committee Chair", "Robert J Milner, Committee Chair", "Hyder A Jinnah, Committee Member", "Patricia Sue Grigson Kennedy, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["attention deficit hyperactivity disorder", "alpha 2C-adrenergic receptor", "animal model", "coloboma mouse", "norepinephrine", "SNAP-25"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DRAMATIC INQUIRIES: ENCOUNTERING DISCOURSES ON \nWOMEN ARTISTS\u2019 CREATIVE CONFLICTS\n\n", "id": "12163", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "798", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since its inception at the end of the eighteenth century, the genre of the artist-drama has concerned itself with conflicts particular to the artist and the creative process. My dissertation project deals with women writers\u2019 artist-dramas that stage female artist-protagonists in their struggles for artistic expression. I argue that a gendered conceptualization of creativity that focuses on the traditional conflicts and crises of male artists (e.g. poverty, or distance from mundane experience due to the extraordinary talent) overlooks female artists and their experiences related to the creative process. The selected dramas critique conventional narratives on artists\u2019 crises by presenting the vastly different conflicts creative women encounter in their work. Furthermore, they highlight the interdependency of constructions of masculinity and femininity as pivotal to the experience of female artists.  \nThe four dramas include Elsa Porges-Bernstein\u2019s Johannes Herkner (1906), Marie Itzerott\u2019s Hilde Brandt (1905), Mathilde Paar\u2019s Helene (1882) and Anna Croissant-Rust\u2019s Der Standhafte Zinnsoldat (1896). Driven by feminist literary criticism and notions of New Historicism, my analysis expands current understandings of the genre by exposing the distinctive conflicts experienced by women artists. Read through this lens, the dramas reveal new insights by linking discourses on public performance with prostitution, by demonstrating the debilitating effects of masculinity in its performance of honor codes and claims to ownership, and by expounding the pervasive effects of discourses that produce and perpetuate gender roles. \nMy aim in this project is twofold; I strive to contribute not only to the re-discovery of women writers and to the re-reading of their texts, but I also argue that their (disruptive) contributions provoke a re-evaluation of the genre\u2019s traditional narratives.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [791], "author_name_tesi": "Brunow, Beate  Ursula Hanna", "last_name_ssi": "Brunow", "middle_name_ssi": "Ursula Hanna", "first_name_ssi": "Beate ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Ursula Bettina Brandt", "Barry Richard Page Jr.", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh", "Jennifer Ann Wagner Lawlor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Chair", "Ursula Bettina Brandt, Committee Member", "Barry Richard Page Jr., Committee Member", "Jacqueline J A Reid Walsh, Committee Member", "Jennifer Ann Wagner Lawlor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["women artists", "gender", "women writers", "turn-of-the-century", "drama"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Pragmatism and the Past:  Charles Peirce on the Conduction of Memory and History\n\n\n", "id": "11396", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1410", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation is entitled Pragmatism and the Past:  CS Peirce on the Conduct of Memory and History.  I start from the longstanding criticism that pragmatism unduly neglects the past in favor of the future.  As a response, I interpret Peirce\u2019s pragmatism and its associated doctrines in light of his accounts of memory, history, and testimony.  In particular, I follow Peirce\u2019s own example of a deep engagement with the history of philosophy and related fields.  For example, Peirce\u2019s account of memory is linked to the development of a notion of the unconscious, which brings in both his work as an experimental psychologist and his interaction with figures such as Helmholtz, Wundt and James.  Although my dissertation is primarily a recovery of Peirce\u2019s philosophy, it is influenced by a variety of contemporary approaches to issues of memory and testimony, including thinkers such as Coady, Danto, Ricouer, and their commentators.\n\tOverall, I show that Peirce\u2019s pragmatism calls for a robust notion of the past, rather than denying or reducing it to the future.  Moreover, Peirce\u2019s pragmatism offers a promising heuristic for any field of inquiry that concerns the past, and, as Peirce readily considers history a science, stands as a contribution to philosophy of science in general.  Finally, Peirce\u2019s account of the role of testimony in inquiry offers the promise of a fruitful contribution to another subject of great interest in contemporary philosophy.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1399], "author_name_tesi": "Brunson, Daniel J.", "last_name_ssi": "Brunson", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent M Colapietro", "Vincent M Colapietro", "Brady Lee Bowman", "Christopher P Long", "Jennifer Mensch", "William Pencak"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent M Colapietro, Dissertation Advisor", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Chair", "Brady Lee Bowman, Committee Member", "Christopher P Long, Committee Member", "Jennifer Mensch, Committee Member", "William Pencak, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hume", "Reid", "Berkeley", "testimony", "historiography", "perception", "memory", "epistemology", "pragmatism", "Peirce", "Descartes"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "A Longitudinal Examination Of The Behavioral Characteristics Associated With The Emergence Of Early Adolescent Conduct Problems In Girls And Boys.", "id": "6115", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1000", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to explore gender similarities and differences in the longitudinal relations between kindergarten behavioral characteristics, 4th grade adaptation ratings, and 7th grade self-reported antisocial activity, substance use, and sexual activity.  In the present study, girls and boys followed the same model in the emergence of antisocial activity.  Kindergarten aggressive and dysregulated behaviors (hyperactivity, inattention, opposition) uniquely predicted antisocial activity.  Fourth grade adaptation (peer and academic) ratings contributed with aggressive and dysregulated behavioral characteristics to predict substance use and sexual activity.  Although boys were more likely than girls to exhibit overt aggression at school entry, girls who were aggressive had outcomes that were similar to aggressive boys.  Dysregulated behavior problems that were part of the disruptive behavior spectrum (e.g., hyperactivity, oppositionality, and inattention) contributed to antisocial and related risky outcomes in similar ways for girls and boys.  Gender differences in the extent to which antisocial adolescents had grade-school histories of aggressive behavior appeared to reflect base rate differences in the prevalence of overt aggression at school entry, rather than gender differences in the predictive course of aggression or other dysregulated behaviors during middle childhood.  Results highlight the importance of assessing similar models of behavioral characteristics and adaptation markers in the prediction of preadolescent conduct problems for both girls and boys.  Future research is needed to delineate the specific processes by which early aggression, associated dysregulated behaviors, and grade-school peer and academic problems are linked to later conduct problems.

Approaching the nation state as a discursive construct, whose dominant national narrative is defined by the elites in power, my research focuses on the alternative national narratives of both nation-states, which are being explored in the two countries\u2019 literature. My project asserts the argument that fiction is a realm that can incite a discussion, or create a shift in consciousness, from which national change can arise. At the same time, fiction, as a product of the imagination may already envision changes that seem quite impossible under the existing circumstances. Moreover, the Bakhtinian heteroglossia in fiction, the overlapping, and coexistence of narratives, mirrors the image of a nation-state that consists of, or is shaped by, multiple communities rather than the common assumption of being a homogenous entity. In my dissertation, I discuss the following contemporary German and South African works in detail: (1) Narratives of Transition: G\u00fcnter Grass Ein Weites Feld (1995), Kerstin Jentzsch\u2019s Seit die G\u00f6tter Ratlos Sind (1994), Thomas Brussig\u2019s Wie Es Leuchtet (2004), Zakes Mda\u2019s Ways of Dying (1995), Sindiwe Magona\u2019s Mother to Mother (1998), and Antjie Krog\u2019s The Country of My Skull (1998) (2) Narratives of Repression: G\u00fcnter Grass\u2019 Im Krebsgang (2002), Monika Maron\u2019s Stille Zeile Sechs (1991), Zafer Senocak\u2019s Gef\u00e4hrliche Verwandtschaft (1998), Mike Nicol\u2019s The Ibis Tapestry (1998), Achmat Dangor\u2019s Bitter Fruit (2001), and Zo\u00eb Wicomb\u2019s David\u2019s Story (2001).\nMy literary research explores in particular the utopian possibilities, the missed chances that both, Germany and South Africa, experienced in the transition to a new society, and how those missed chances affect the present. I approach the process of unified democratization in both countries with Frantz Fanon\u2019s idea of \u2018national consciousness\u2019 and Hannah Arendt\u2019s idea of \u2018empathy\u2019 in order to determine how the development of self-awareness and reciprocal understanding can lead to national change. For both, South Africa and Germany, countries, which have been shaped by the traumas of pathological nationalism and the search for alternative visions of nation, it is of compelling interest to map out how modern nation states develop from imagination to \u201cconcretion\u201d so that national pathological pitfalls can be avoided and the transnational dimensions of nation-building strengthened. The German and South African experiences have illustrated the importance of conceiving the nation as part of both international and transnational communities. A discursive construct of a nation-state that allows for a plurality of national narratives is much better suited for a broader local collective, such as the European or African Union, as well as for a global community, because it allows for differences and similarities and is therefore more dynamic, flexible, and inclusive.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2463], "author_name_tesi": "Brust, Imke ", "last_name_ssi": "Brust", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Imke", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Dr Cary Fenton Fraser", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "John Philip Christman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Chair", "Dr Cary Fenton Fraser, Committee Member", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Africa", "Europe", "South African literature", "German literature", "nationalism", "trans-nationalism"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Evaluating Customer Satisfaction in Supply Chain", "id": "19220", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8625", "abstract_tesi": "In the literature many aspects of supply chain are analyzed and studied for improvement.

Yet, little is known about the complex development that occurs through schooling; the dominant paradigm in a child\u2019s life for learning about themselves. The study of the self in cognitive developmental and positive psychology has taken on heightened importance due to the increasing awareness of the central, functional role that the self plays in development across the life-span.  This study investigated teacher beliefs and practices for imparting self system and positive psychology attributes because of the critical link between the construction of the self and happier, healthier, more successful children.  This study considered the interactions among the beliefs that teachers hold about the importance of their role in the development of the selves of their students, the classroom practices used to impart self system and positive psychology attributes. Research design is a combination of qualitative interviewing (n=25) using grounded theory methods; and a case study at the middle school level.  Open-ended, in-depth interview protocol utilize: subjective happiness, meaning in life, satisfaction with life, and psychological well-being scales from the Positive Psychology Center. I argue that teachers can do much more to impact the human development of students.  Most studies that are conducted within a school context consider academic achievement as the dependent variable or outcome of a child\u2019s schooling.  Teachers are important in the life of a child not merely for imparting academic content knowledge, but additionally and more directly than is known, in aiding their cognitive and human development in terms of an integrated, whole view of children, or a self system.  Understanding the differing teacher beliefs and intervention and instructional strategies used to impart happy, healthy and whole children is the focus of this study.

Since conventional history matching involves manual input, most guidelines suggest a simplified model be used, and only the parameters that influence the outcome and those with the highest uncertainty be changed (Carlson, 2003). However, even with this simplification, the process of history matching still consumes a considerable amount of time. Moreover, as the complexity of the reservoir increases, the time required to perform a successful history match increases as well. After achieving a satisfactory history match, one is set to perform forecasting studies. Forecasting is the ultimate objective of a simulation study. In later times, if the prediction is not in agreement with the observed data, history matching parameters need to be re-tuned. After this tune-up process, predictions should be close enough to the observed data. When observed data deviates from predictions, reservoir engineers then have the daunting task of identifying the causes of such deviation in a rather short period of time to ensure that necessary preventive measures can be implemented promptly.\nExpert systems can be used to assist reservoir engineers with refining and re-evaluating their history matching parameters. In this proposed study, an artificial expert system is developed, which in turn provides the reservoir engineer with a good set of starting points to pick the history matching parameters for a newly created reservoir simulation model. The same expert system can also help in fine-tuning the parameters if the model is already history matched. For complex models, the expert system can use new production data to improve the history matching parameters. \nOnce the prediction process is under way, the expert system can be expanded into a suit of diagnostic tools to detect changes in reservoir responses that might occur over time. These problematic changes in responses can be caused by the alteration of the area around the well or from other geomechanical changes that take place within the reservoir. These developed tools are triggered when the well production profile behaves unexpectedly. The first tool looks into the possibility of a developed skin around the well may have caused the decline in production. Another tool evaluates whether a set of perforations have been plugged. If the reservoir has hydraulically fractured wells, an expert tool is used to analyze the fracture effective permeability and length to see if they match the specifications of the fracture job. Two more tools are used to assess two geomechanical features of the reservoir. The first one can help figure out if the production changes are caused by the reservoir compaction and the second looks into the possibility of tarmat breakage at the base of the hydrocarbon column. The last tool looks to identify areas of the reservoir where there is a possibility of having natural fractures. Coupled with the engineer\u2019s expertise, the expert system can be extended to more complex scenarios. It is worth noting that each expert system is explicitly developed for a specific reservoir and is not interchangeable with other reservoirs.\nThe last part of this research involves developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that provide user-friendly interfaces for the engineers to input and edit the data and generate numerical and graphical results. It will also enable the engineers to validate the results with the numerical reservoir simulator.\nIn this research, the assisted history matching expert system has shown its ability to bring the reservoir properties used by the reservoir simulation model closer to their original values. In addition, it has helped in reducing the uncertainty ranges for the different parameters used in the history matching process. The diagnostic expert systems have also shown the strength of the artificial intelligence protocol applied in these systems. For the forward solution part, all diagnostic expert systems show excellent results and thus can be safely utilized as proxies to the reservoir simulator. The backward solution part is more difficult to achieve. However, except the tarmat breakdown expert system, all diagnostic expert systems have shown satisfactory accuracy as identified by the user. The tarmat breakdown expert system, performed very well when only one area of the tarmat layer is broken whereas it struggled when another area of the tarmat broke at a later time.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9834], "author_name_tesi": "Bu Khamseen, Nader ", "last_name_ssi": "Bu Khamseen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nader", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Turgay Ertekin", "Paul Griffin", "Michael Adebola Adewumi", "Sarma V Pisupati"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Committee Chair", "Paul Griffin, Committee Member", "Michael Adebola Adewumi, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Artificial neural network", "reservoir simulation", "artificial expert systems", "history matching", "prediction", "unexpected behavior."]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Contagious Texts Embodied: Melancholy Hermeneutics in Late Medieval and Early Modern Literature", "id": "14869ckb5081", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14869", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation seeks to uncover the ways in which late medieval and early modern authors aspired to influence the physiological makeup of readers and audience members in the wake of increasingly sophisticated and encompassing notions of contagion. As I will argue, vernacular medical treatises, advice literature, and how-to books are all central to this aspiration. These texts encourage readers to inhabit literary environments in such a way that accounts for conceptions of the body as porous\u2014i.e. equally capable of absorbing and emitting infectious disease. Into this body and from this body would pour melancholy, an ailment to which these instructional works devote much space. Considered one of the main causes of plague, melancholy evolved during the medieval period from merely a personal affair, to a matter of national concern. Medical treatises and their more popular imitations sought to address this concern by disseminating the information necessary for self-diagnosis and care. The ideas and independently curative project of these works spread widely and reached canonical authors such as Chaucer, Gower, Sidney, and Shakespeare, who also sought to participate in similar methods of self-care through genre and affective design. Like the porous body, the hermeneutics common to the major works of these authors reveal meaning to be co-constitutive, emerging through the reciprocal exchange between the fiction of the text and the imagination of the reader. What these texts transmit, however, is not meaning alone, for to represent or to discuss melancholy also entails the transmission of melancholy. Literature, thus, played a practical role in helping readers cope in a culture of contagion by providing a means of self-preservation and fortification against an ever-threatening environment. Yet despite their healing agendas, performances and texts nevertheless ran the risk of spreading the epidemics they meant to stifle.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16089], "author_name_tesi": "Bubash, Connie Kathleen", "last_name_ssi": "Bubash", "middle_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "first_name_ssi": "Connie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Garrett A.

The population structure of Bordetella is clonal, as the majority of strains fall into a small number of genotypic complexes. While strains of B. bronchiseptica are very closely related genetically, this species exhibits a high level of phenotypic diversity. For example, B. bronchiseptica has been isolated from the respiratory tract of more than 20 species of mammals, causes a wide-variety of severities of respiratory disease, strains can differ up to 100,000-fold in their lethal doses and can differ in their expression of virulence factors. Despite this phenotypic diversity exhibited by B. bronchiseptica strains, very few studies have mapped these traits to a phylogenetic tree to examine the evolution of these traits. Beyond that, even fewer studies have determined the underlying genetics factors associated with the phenotypic trait that was mapped which makes it impossible to determine if the phenotypic diversity is associated with the same genetic factor and to examine the molecular evolution of this trait. Therefore, using a wide range of approaches including a murine model of infection, comparative genomics and transcriptomics, and phylogenetics, the molecular evolution of the genetics factors that appear to contribute to phenotypic diversity, measured either in terms of virulence or antigenic variation, were examined. The first section shows that the gene encoding adenylate cylcase toxin (CyaA) was replaced with a novel operon via lateral gene transfer (LGT) in a hypovirulent lineage of B. bronchiseptica. The next section shows that the type three secretion system (TTSS) contributes to the increased virulence of a B. bronchiseptica lineage. Finally, we found that two distinct O-Antigen loci, which appear to encode antigenically distinct O-Antigen serotypes, which homologously recombine between B. bronchiseptica lineages. Combined, data contained herein suggest that lateral gene transfer, differential gene expression and homologous recombination all contribute to the phenotypic diversity of B. bronchiseptica strains. We discuss the implication of these findings on both within and outside the Bordetella field, consider the ecological forces that may cause and maintain this diversity and future avenues of research that result from these works.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [253], "author_name_tesi": "Buboltz, Anne M", "last_name_ssi": "Buboltz", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Anne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill", "Avery August", "Peter John Hudson", "Kenneth Charles Keiler", "Kathleen Postle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member", "Kenneth Charles Keiler, Committee Member", "Kathleen Postle, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["comparative genomics", "Bordetella", "bronchiseptica", "phylogenetics", "mlst"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE IMPACT OF SPATIAL SEGREGATION AND ISOLATION ON VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION", "id": "14751rpb5358", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14751", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tExtant research and theory have highlighted the deleterious consequences of segregation and isolation, such as increased poverty rates, joblessness and victimization. These consequences are often thought to occur in disadvantaged and minority neighborhoods; however, recent research has suggested that segregation may lead to increased crime rates in even the more advantaged communities. While there has been a host of studies that have examined the relationship between segregation and crime, they have had several limitations. The following study addresses these limitations by using measures of spatial segregation, as opposed to more commonly used a-spatial measures, as well as examining National Crime Victimization Survey data, which allows for the study of crimes beyond simply homicide, and does not suffer from many of the limitations of police-based crime data. This study also examines many layers of victimization, by first focusing on overall assault victimizations, followed by race-specific victimizations, and lastly, differences in intra and interracial assaults. Results first conclude that the effects of segregation on assault victimization risk in general are non-significant or weakly related, suggesting that the effects of segregation differ by crime type. Additionally, the examination of racially disaggregated assault victimization suggests that isolation has a significant and negative effect on minority assault victimization, a finding contrary to prior segregation and homicide research, as well as theoretical expectations. Lastly, this study finds that spatial segregation increases the likelihood of interracial assaults, however, spatial isolation has the opposite effect on intraracial assaults.

Three studies that assess management impacts on indicators of soil quality, the potential remediation of low soil quality, and the use of indicators to monitor soil quality are described in the six chapters of the thesis. The first study evaluated the effects of soil management from a long-term soil fertility and crop rotation experiment (HRE) and Pennsylvania on-farm practices on microbial community levels physiological profiles (CLPP) with gram-negative BIOLOG plates. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analyses of microbial CLPP distinguished HRE treatments with manure and crop rotations more diverse than continuous corn from the other treatments and farms with routine organic amendments from no manure addition and/or wastewater irrigated farms. Although not without limitation, the CLPP can be used as an exploratory assessment of soil management. The second study evaluated soil remediation effects of compost addition on soil quality indicators and corn silage yields in three different landscape positions at a site irrigated with treated effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment plant and previously identified as having low soil quality. Soil quality indicators including soil enzyme activities, aggregate stability, and microbial biomass C increased with >90 Mg ha-1 compost treatment in all landscape positions. CLPP with <45 Mg ha-1 compost was different in the summit and backslope from the depression, and from >90 Mg ha-1 treatments in all landscape positions. Corn silage yields increased with increasing compost rates in the summit position. Soil quality remediation and site-specific management can be possible using organic amendments where soil quality is impaired. The third study evaluated a multivariate integration of soil quality indicators using principal components analysis (PCA) as a soil quality indexing process of a long-term experiment (HRE) and Pennsylvania farms with different management histories. Soil quality indicators included enzyme activities, soil microbial biomass C, total soil C, total soil N, and aggregate stability. All measured aspects of soil quality were influenced by soil management that included compost or manure additions, and forages and/or small grains in crop rotation. Through the indexing processes, unknown farms and the soil quality remediation results were assessed and successfully classified. The process of soil management classification and soil quality indexing could be a useful tool for farmers to evaluate farm management, and their farm management decisions.

Efforts to construct functional materials from such building blocks represent a promising alternative approach to the conventional miniaturization techniques developed for modern microelectronics.  Hence, the individual inorganic building blocks can be considered as tailorable fundamental units, from which new materials with designer properties can be constructed.  Colloidal nanochemistry is advantageous in this endeavor, because it has the potential to enable exquisite morphological control over individual nanocrystallites, and to permit inexpensive, high-throughput, liquid-phase processing into hierarchical nanostructures.\n\nTo address the demand for complex, next-generation nanomaterials with rigorously controlled architectures and interfaces using colloidal nanochemistry, synthetic innovations must be developed.  In this dissertation, the total synthesis framework used by organic chemists to prepare complex molecules has been used as a source of inspiration for approaching the colloidal synthesis of such multi-component inorganic nanostructures.

These were some of the earliest anatomical images made predominantly for a lay public. Their creator was a man originally trained as a physician but who made a career as a printer. He combined his skills in medicine and the arts to create singular anatomical prints with multiple flaps\u2014or \u201cflap anatomies.\u201d Their emergence in the Reformation era is not a coincidence\u2014they were the product of an ideological revolution committed to making knowledge once held in academic hands available more broadly to a lay public. \nChapter two tells the story of ivory manikins. The earliest of these were produced by an ivory turner who translated his expertise in minute carved ivories with fitted parts into anatomical models. He created a niche market that fulfilled the needs of new kinds of doctors. Educated male physicians were making inroads in women\u2019s medicine and subsequently played a controversial role in a highly gendered field. They found they could increase their authority by demonstrating with objects crafted ad hoc. These small models could be used to illustrate lectures, but could not convey the intricacies of anatomy\u2014accentuating the importance of the lectors\u2019 words.  \nChapter three relates the afterlives of each of these models through changes in how they were seen in both the public and academic realms. Each flowed and ebbed in popularity, changing from anatomical tools to curiosities, antiques, and spectacles. This chapter follows each and also details the emergence of newer dissectable models\u2014with an emphasis on Enlightenment era wax models\u2014from the eighteenth and twentieth centuries.\n\tExploring the making of models and comparing their historical contexts reveals that anatomical accuracy could be delivered selectively to adapt to specific social climates.

The icosahedral capsid encloses the viral DNA genome.  Virions are bounded by a host-derived lipid envelope embedded with viral glycoproteins and other transmembrane proteins.  The tegument is the proteinaceous region that lies between the capsid and envelope.  More than 25 virus-encoded proteins, as well as host proteins, are packaged into the tegument region.  Incorporation of tegument proteins may occur at multiple sites within the cell and is governed by a complex series of protein interactions.  Tegument proteins may associate with capsids within the nucleus, as the capsid exits the nucleus through budding and fusion with the nuclear membrane, during microtubule-mediated transport in the cytoplasm and during final envelopment at vesicles derived from the trans-Golgi network (TGN).  The studies described in this dissertation were initiated to identify tegument proteins associated with capsids isolated from the nucleus of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-infected cells.\n\tSeveral lines of evidence led us to investigate if the conserved, essential tegument protein, UL36, is associated with capsids in the nucleus.  UL36 is tightly associated with capsids, coimmunoprecipitates with the major capsid protein, VP5, and is present in the nucleus of HSV-1-infected cells.  Furthermore, viruses lacking UL36 exhibit a severe defect in tegumentation and do not undergo final envelopment, suggesting that incorporation of UL36 may be required for subsequent acquisition of other tegument proteins.  To address this issue, capsids were isolated and purified from the nuclear fraction of HSV-1-infected cells and analyzed for the presence of UL36 by Western blotting.  As hypothesized, detectable amounts of UL36 associate with capsids from the nuclear fraction.  Interestingly, UL36 associates only with DNA-filled C capsids and is not detected in association with A capsids or B capsids, which do not mature into infectious virions.  Further analysis of nuclear capsids revealed that the UL36 binding partner, UL37, also associates with capsids isolated from the nuclear fraction.  These results suggest that UL36 and UL37 are among the initial tegument proteins incorporated into virions and therefore may function to facilitate the incorporation of other tegument proteins into the virus particle.\t\n\tThe interaction of UL36 and UL37 homologues is conserved across the herpesvirus family.  The region and individual residues of UL36 critical for interaction with UL37 have been identified.  In contrast, the region of UL37 necessary for binding UL36 was unknown.  To fill this gap of knowledge, coimmunoprecipitation assays were used to identify the region of UL37 necessary for binding UL36.  Deletion of amino acids 568-809 of UL37 reduced coimmunoprecipitation of UL36 to near background levels.  The carboxy-terminal half of UL37, residues 568-1123, was sufficient for interaction with UL36.  Further deletion of this region of UL37 caused deleterious effects on UL36 binding.  These studies revealed that amino acids 568-809 are necessary and the carboxy-terminal half of UL37 is sufficient for interaction with UL36.  \n\tTo expand the identification of interaction domains of UL37, studies were also performed to identify the regions of UL37 involved in self-association.  Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that two regions of UL37, amino acids 1-300 and 568-1123, are independently capable of self-association.  Because the carboxy-terminal half of UL37 serves dual roles of self-association and UL36 binding, studies were performed to determine if this region is capable of interacting with both proteins simultaneously, thus forming a UL37-UL37-UL36 complex.  Full length UL37 appears to self-associate only under conditions when UL36 is not present, or is present in low amounts.  This result suggests that UL36 competes with UL37 for interaction with another molecule of UL37.  Therefore UL36 appears to regulate the self-association of UL37.  \n\tExpression of UL37 is necessary for tegumentation and envelopment of infectious HSV-1 virions.  The functional role(s) of UL37 that is critical during infection is unknown.  To identify regions of UL37 necessary for production of infectious virions, a trans-complementation assay was utilized.  The carboxy-terminal region of UL37, amino acids 568-1123, partially rescues the UL37 deletion virus, K&#8710;UL37.  These results suggest that the carboxy-terminus of UL37 may contribute to its essential functional role within the virus-infected cell.  In conclusion, the carboxy-terminal half of UL37, amino acids 568-1123, is involved in UL37 self-association, interaction with UL36 and plays a critical role during virus assembly.  \n\tCollectively, the studies described in this dissertation provide novel insights regarding the interaction of tegument proteins UL36 and UL37 with capsids and the regions of UL37 involved in the conserved interaction with UL36.  These studies may provide the foundation for future investigations to elucidate the functional role(s) of UL36 and UL37 critical for assembly of infectious virions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4490], "author_name_tesi": "Bucks, Michelle Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Bucks", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard James Courtney", "Richard James Courtney", "David Joseph Spector", "John Warren Wills", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Neil David Christensen", "Mary Judith Tevethia"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard James Courtney, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard James Courtney, Committee Chair", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Mary Judith Tevethia, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["HSV", "herpes", "capsid", "tegument", "UL36", "UL37"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Role of Linker DNA Conformation and Linker Histone in Regulating Higher-Order Chromatin Folding", "id": "14045jmc71", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14045", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\tThe genetic information of a eukaryotic cell is organized and packaged inside the cell nucleus in a way that allows for access to specific regions and genes by important cellular factors in order to direct cellular processes such as replication, transcription, gene expression, cellular differentiation, and DNA repair. The compact folding of chromatin in the nucleus is achieved through DNA and protein interactions to form chromatin fibers. The primary level of chromatin organization is the nucleosome, the basic repeating unit of chromatin. The nucleosome core consists of 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around an octamer of core histones. The nucleosome cores are connected by relatively straight linker DNA to form beads-on-a-string nucleosome arrays. Folding of nucleosome arrays into chromatin higher-order structures is achieved by the influence of linker histone that modulates global chromatin structures by influencing chromatin condensation, as well as multiple other factors such as core histone tail modifications, linker histone proteins, cations, protein modifying enzymes, DNA sequence, and architectural proteins. The goal of this dissertation was to develop an experimental system to determine the role of linker DNA conformation as well as linker histone H1 in the folding and regulation of chromatin higher-order structures. The central hypothesis of this work is that linker DNA conformation can direct chromatin folding into more or less compact states sufficient to alter fiber folding, nucleosome interactions, and chromatin accessibility. In this experimental system, utilization of high affinity nucleosome binding DNA sequences were used to construct reconstituted nucleosome arrays that position nucleosomes with single nucleotide precision separated by linker DNA with specific nucleotide sequences. The reconstituted arrays were analyzed for chromatin folding, nucleosome interactions, and overall higher-order chromatin structures using biochemical assays including sedimentation velocity analysis, quantification of nucleosome interactions, and linker DNA accessibility assays. \n\tThe DNA templates used for reconstitution with core histone proteins contained specific nucleotide sequences in the linker DNA region referred to as adenine-tracts. These DNA sequences are known for inducing bending in the DNA double helix. Using the reconstituted nucleosome arrays containing adenine-tracts in our biochemical and electron microscopy based experiments, we demonstrated the ability of DNA sequence to alter linker DNA geometry and conformation that directly influences chromatin compaction in the presence of cations. We also demonstrated that linker histone H1 enhanced the bending of linker DNA containing adenine-tracts resulting in more compact nucleosome arrays. Furthermore, we demonstrated that linker histone H1 levels direct longer range nucleosome interactions so that sub-stoichiometric levels of linker histone H1 induce chromatin looping. \nRegarding chromatin as a complex and dynamic system with a multitude of influential factors, we also discuss that our nucleosome array system is instrumental not only for the characterization of a single factor but the combinatorial effect of many factors on nucleosome interactions and chromatin higher-order structures as demonstrated by the work in this dissertation. The utilization of this biochemically defined system of compact nucleosome arrays can be used to investigate the influence of pioneer factors that are known to interact with compact chromatin as well as chromatin architectural proteins and DNA-editing enzymes that bind to particular DNA sequence motifs and alter the underlying chromatin structures. The delineation of these processes in the context of alterations of chromatin structures due to these factors would provide fundamental and unique information in regards to reorganization of chromatin fibers during cellular reprogramming and differentiation as well as DNA editing for gene therapy. The use of this in vitro system would allow for the experimentation of specific questions in regards to chromatin structure reorganization during these cellular processes and specific factors that otherwise would go unanswered.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14279], "author_name_tesi": "Buckwalter, Jenna Mae", "last_name_ssi": "Buckwalter", "middle_name_ssi": "Mae", "first_name_ssi": "Jenna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sergei Grigoryev", "Sergei Grigoryev", "Gregory Yochum", "Kristin Eckert", "Sarah Bronson", "Ira Ropson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sergei Grigoryev, Dissertation Advisor", "Sergei Grigoryev, Committee Chair", "Gregory Yochum, Committee Member", "Kristin Eckert, Committee Member", "Sarah Bronson, Outside Member", "Ira Ropson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Linker DNA", "Nucleosome", "Chromatin", "Adenine-tracts", "Linker histone H1", "Chromatin structure"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "TRACING STREAM NITRATE IN A CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA MIXED LAND-USE BASIN USING STABLE ISOTOPES, BACTERIA, AND INORGANIC CHEMICALS\n\n", "id": "7863", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "347", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Excess nitrate in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems has resulted in numerous water quality problems throughout the U.S., which emphasizes the need to develop effective management plans to deal with nitrate pollution, especially in mixed land-use watersheds.  Stable nitrate isotopes have been promoted as a useful tool for studying nitrate sources and cycling, but the application of these tracers in mixed land-use watersheds remains limited.  To address this need, five studies were undertaken to improve the ability to trace nitrate sources and movements in Spring Creek, a small (201 km2) mixed land-use karst watershed located in the Ridge and Valley Province of central Pennsylvania.  The first study (Chapter 2) was intended to improve our understanding of nitrate stable isotope variations in precipitation, which is essential for tracing sources of nitrate in streams during storm runoff periods.  Results of the study showed that information about oxidant levels in the atmosphere and knowledge of storm tracks can be very useful for explaining seasonal and within-storm variations of nitrate stable isotopes in precipitation.  The second study (Chapter 3) assessed nitrate isotope transformations, especially denitrification, in losing and gaining stream reaches along the main-stem of Spring Creek within the karst valley to test the assumption that nitrate isotopes in stream water conserve their original source signatures.  Results of this study showed that nitrate stable isotopes were relatively unaffected by in-stream processes in losing reaches, and only changed in the gaining reaches when new and isotopically distinct nitrate sources were introduced into the stream.  The third study (Chapter 4) was undertaken to better understand nitrate sources and flow pathways during storm events in a mixed land-use watershed.  The study illustrated for the first time how stable isotopes in nitrate and water could be combined to show major differences in nitrate delivery mechanisms between forested uplands and karst valleys, and confirmed the dominance of overland flow pathways in urbanizing basins.  The fourth study (Chapter 5) tested whether microbial source tracking techniques with E. coli bacteria could be used to develop indicators of human and animal pollution in stream water to address difficulties in distinguishing sewage (human) and manure (animal) sources of nitrate using stable isotopes.  Applications of a phenotypic (serotyping) and a molecular (ERIC-PCR) source tracking technique indicated that animal sources of E. coli were predominant throughout the Spring Creek watershed and that human E. coli sources were much less important.  The results suggested that differentiation of human and animal pollution sources may be difficult in watersheds that are primarily serviced by sewage treatment (e.g. Spring Creek), and that future studies of this sort should consider identifying watersheds where human and animal pollution sources are more widely distributed.  The final study (Chapter 6) was designed to determine how well land-use and nitrate pollutant sources could be discriminated using nitrate stable isotopes, inorganic chemistry, and bacterial indicator variables in a mixed land-use setting.  The results of this study showed that nitrate isotopes were sufficient for capturing basic differences in principal nitrate sources from precipitation, forested land-uses, and sewage; however, inorganic chemical tracers enabled discrimination among land-uses and geology that could not necessarily be captured using nitrate isotopes alone.  Future studies applying combined tracer approaches in mixed land-use watersheds should therefore consider the value of using nitrate isotopes alone to discriminate basic nitrate sources as well as the added benefit of using inorganic chemistry to discriminate on other watershed characteristics such as land-use and geology.  Overall, the five studies in this dissertation demonstrated valuable new techniques and highlighted new directions of research that will help to further our understanding of nitrate sources, transformations, and flow pathways in mixed land-use watersheds.       \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [341, 342], "author_name_tesi": "Buda, Anthony Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Buda", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Anthony", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Russell Dewalle", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Hunter J Carrick", "William Edward Sharpe", "Chitrita Debroy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Russell Dewalle, Committee Chair", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member", "Hunter J Carrick, Committee Member", "William Edward Sharpe, Committee Member", "Chitrita Debroy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bacteria source tracking", "storm events", "mixing", "tracers", "nitrogen", "discriminant analysis", "ridge and valley", "karst"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A joint Kaplan-Meier known-fate and Brownie tag-recovery \nmodel to estimate harvest and survival rates\n", "id": "15712", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7620", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Incorporating multiple data sources into mark-recapture estimation models may eliminate the need for some model assumptions and can improve precision of parameter estimates. For some estimators, incorporating multiple data types into the modeling procedure can help correct for violations of model assumptions. The Brownie tag-recovery model assumes that all individuals tagged in each cohort survive to the start of the first hunting season after tagging. However, it may not be efficient or possible to tag individuals just prior to the hunting season. For example, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Pennsylvania are trapped and tagged in spring and not harvested until the following fall. If individuals die between tagging and the hunting season, fewer individuals are actually available to be harvested than the model assumes and harvest rates will be underestimated. \nI developed a joint model that uses auxiliary known-fate data, provided by radio-transmitters, to inform a Brownie tag-recovery model to estimate harvest rates for game species; using auxiliary information accounts for tagging-to-harvest mortality. I performed simulations using 3 model species with varying tagging-to-harvest survival rates, annual survival rates, and harvest rates. I compared accuracy and precision of model species\u2019 harvest estimates between the joint model and a standard Brownie tag-recovery estimator. The level of precision that the joint model obtained depended upon the biology of the study species. With some species, the acceptable level of precision (CV = 10-15%) for harvest estimates was reached given certain thresholds for allocations of reward tags and radio-transmitters, but in other species, this level of precision was nearly impossible to obtain. In all cases, releasing 20 radio-transmitters and 100-150 reward-tags allowed the joint model to outperform, based on a metric combining accuracy and precision, the standard Brownie tag-recovery estimator.\nI then applied the joint model to Pennsylvania white-tailed deer and estimated harvest and annual survival rates for deer in 4 Wildlife Management Units (WMUs). I used a multi-step approach, in which I first selected the most parsimonious model structure for tagging-to-harvest survival rates. I then incorporated this model structure into the Brownie tag-recovery estimator. This model allowed me to test whether radio-transmittered deer are differentially selected by hunters for harvest compared to non-radio-transmittered deer. Radio-transmittered individuals often are used to infer the population level harvest rate, however, if fates of these individuals differ from unmarked individual, harvest rates may be not reflect the population level harvest rate. I failed to detect a transmitter effect in either male or female white-tailed deer. Harvest rate precision was comparable to what I estimated based on my computer simulations. Also I developed a model that allowed me to estimate harvest rates for the discrete periods of hunting that occur during white-tailed deer season in Pennsylvania. Although there were insufficient data to do this for each of the WMUs, I was able to obtain an estimate for each season by pooling across WMUs. \nFinally, I used an Integrated Population Model (IPM) to investigate the repercussions of shortening the antlerless firearm season to the last 7-days of a 12-day season. Although I had hoped to test this empirically, the Board of Commissioners for Pennsylvania Game Commission did not enact regulations to allow me to implement the study design. Consequently I used IPMs to utilize multiple sources of data and a biologically reasonable population model to calculate pre- and post-hunt abundance. It also allowed us to determine the harvest rate that would have been required to stabilize the population at 2007 levels, while implementing a 7-day antlerless season over 4 hunting seasons. I used hunter efficiency to back calculate from the necessary antlerless harvest to the number of licenses that the PGC would have needed to sell each year. In all cases, there needed to be a substantial, but not unreasonable, increase in the number of harvested antlerless deer and licenses sold.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7555], "author_name_tesi": "Buderman, Frances Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Buderman", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Frances", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Duane R Diefenbach, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["white-tailed deer", "deer harvest", "deer survival", "deer abundance", "tag-recovery", "known-fate", "Kaplan-Meier", "wildlife", "estimation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Developing second language narrative literacy using concept-based instruction and a division-of-labor pedagogy", "id": "26306", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11494", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A well-documented curricular gap exists in L2 pedagogy between the introductory courses, focusing mainly on language, and advanced courses, focusing mainly on literary content.

In order to contribute to closing the gap, this research aimed to promote the development of intermediate learners\u2019 L2 narrative literacy abilities while studying their development in the formation process. A concept-based instructional (CBI) approach was developed and implemented through a Division-of-Labor Pedagogy (DOLP) during a twelve-week pedagogical intervention.

Furthermore, once an object is located, having the ability to identify the object under consideration is still an on ongoing research problem. This dissertation has two main focuses. The first analyzes and investigates the spectral signatures of indoor clutter elements through their radar cross section (RCS). The characterization of the wideband spectral properties for indoor clutter elements is accomplished using finite difference time domain (FDTD) techniques. Using FDTD, the spectral characteristics of clutter elements were obtained over a wide range of frequencies and aspect angles at different transmit-receive polarization combinations. The spectral properties are then compared and contrasted between the different objects as well as human biological models for analysis and use in TTWR. The RCS results obtained from the simulations are then compared to experimental data collected using a wideband network analyzer. The second main topic is the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to construct models from the previously acquired spectral signatures to aid in target classification.

Implicit in much of this literature is an emphasis on social stratification processes that are produced and reproduced through interactions between individuals and social structures such as families and neighborhoods. Families play a potentially large role in both the development and reproduction of health disparities across generations. However, sociological exploration into the impact of families on one particular health disparity\u00e2\u20ac\u201dinfant health outcomes (such as low birth weight and preterm birth)\u00e2\u20ac\u201dhas been relatively minimal. Using multiple data sources, this dissertation provides an in-depth exploration of when and why family structure affects infant health outcomes. \nThis monograph begins by exploring a benefits-of-marriage hypothesis which contrasts two explanations of the marriage advantage: a life course or selection model (positing that the observed advantages are grounded in women\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s experiences in prior life stages such as childhood and adolescence) and a mediation model (positing that marriage leads to positive prenatal health characteristics, which in turn lead to better infant health outcomes). Findings indicate that the marriage advantage is diminished but not eradicated with the inclusion of a rich set of childhood environment characteristics. Subsequent exploration using fixed-effects models demonstrates the salience of the marriage advantage between married and single women within a recent, nationally-representative sample of households, but finds no difference between married and cohabiting women. The married-single disparity is partially explained by increased rates of prenatal smoking among single women. Results for two other measures of infant health\u00e2\u20ac\u201dlow birth weight and preterm birth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dindicate no evidence of a marriage advantage within a fixed-effects framework. In sum, the results demonstrate greater support for a life course or selection approach although it is clear that these processes do not account for the entire advantage.\nSecond, this monograph explores a different dimension of the marriage advantage: Are risky neighborhood environments more weakly related to infant health outcomes among married women compared with cohabiting or single women? Drawing upon fundamental cause theory and the buffering hypothesis, multilevel regression results indicate that mother-father relationship status is one type of interpersonal resource that differentially buffers women from the effects of living within stressful social environments. In neighborhoods characterized by high levels of violent and serious property crimes, cohabitation (and perhaps singlehood) are more risky (compared with marriage) than in neighborhoods with relatively low levels of crime\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand this disadvantage exists above and beyond measures of a host of human capital, sociodemographic, family background, and pregnancy characteristics.\nThird, this monograph addresses why single mothers have historically exhibited poorer infant health outcomes by examining intergenerational (mother-daughter) transmissions of infant health risk. Structural equation models indicate that previously-documented mother-daughter similarities in birth weight may be at least partly spurious in that intergenerational transmissions of educational attainment and sociobehavioral modeling accounted for half of the mother-daughter similarity in the risk of low birth weight when subgroups of non-poor and poor women were compared, and partially accounted for the mother-daughter similarity in birth weight (adjusted for preterm birth status). Furthermore, the effect of education on birth weight and the risk of low birth weight operated indirectly through nonmarital birth status. Findings demonstrate the importance of including this broader intergenerational context in future investigations of infant health outcomes\u00e2\u20ac\u201despecially with respect to research that intends to inform policies related to preventing infant health risk and reducing infant health disparities. \nIn sum, this dissertation contributes to both health disparities and family sociology literatures by producing theoretical, methodological, and policy-oriented insights related to the formation of infant health disparities that affect long-term human development and social investment.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12792], "author_name_tesi": "Buher-Kane, Jennifer ", "last_name_ssi": "Buher-Kane", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Amato", "Alan Booth", "Nancy Landale", "Marianne Hillemeier", "John David Iceland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Amato, Committee Chair", "Alan Booth, Committee Chair", "Nancy Landale, Committee Member", "Marianne Hillemeier, Committee Member", "John David Iceland, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multilevel modeling", "health disparities", "fertility", "demography", "family", "infant health outcomes", "neighborhood crime", "intergenerational linkages"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "LABELING ACTORS AND UNCOVERING CAUSAL ACCOUNTS OF THEIR STATES IN SOCIAL NETWORKS AND SOCIAL MEDIA", "id": "13389npb123", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13389", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The emergence of social networks and social media has resulted in exponential\nincrease in the amount of data that link diverse types of richly structured digital\nobjects e.g., individuals, articles, images, videos, music, etc. Such data are naturally\nrepresented as heterogeneous networks with multiple types of objects e.g., actors,\nvideo, postings, images, etc. and multiple types of links e.g., links that connect actors\nto items e.g., photos, videos, articles that denote relationships between individuals\nand items, and links between actors that denote social ties e.g., friendship, etc. Such\ndata present a number of research challenges in machine learning, network analysis,\nand causal discovery.

Nonetheless, thorough reservoir simulation is a time consuming process that requires powerful computational capabilities and highly skilled individuals in reservoir engineering, mathematics, and programing. The accuracy of the simulation process is affected by the availability and quality of reservoir characteristics. These characteristics are obtained using different data acquisition methods such as open-hole logging, well testing, and core analysis which is costly and time consuming. Another factor that affects production performance is horizontal and multilateral well configurations. These well completions are used to increases production rate and enhance sweep efficiency. However, the design of horizontal and multilateral wells is a complex task that involves engineering and economic constraints.\nThis thesis demonstrates the development of artificial expert systems that are not only capable of forecasting, but also robust in multilateral well design and reservoir evaluation. The study covers a wide range of well completions and shale gas reservoirs properties. Using artificial neural networks (ANN), the developed approach delivers forward-looking and inverse-looking solutions to relate between reservoir characteristics, well configurations, and production performance. Production Performance Expert System forecasts the gas rate and cumulative gas production of a given well completed in a shale gas reservoir, and thus it is categorized as a forward-looking solution. The average error of the results generated by the first system is 6.5%. The second expert systems provides an inverse-looking solution to propose multilateral well design given a target production of a specific reservoir. Well design parameters are produced within an average error of 5%. The third and final system is capable of predicting shale reservoir properties by analyzing the production performance of a horizontal or multilateral fishbone well completion. The developed system is capable of predicting reservoir characteristics with an average error of 4.5% from the target data. \nThe developed set of expert systems is expected to reduce the long hours required for excessive computations, which are typical in reservoir simulators. In addition, it can reduce costs of reservoir evaluation by working as an auxiliary tool to expensive well tests, logging operations, and core analysis. However, it is worth mentioning that these expert systems do not replace conventional reservoir simulators, rather they help in enhancing the decision making process by making educated estimations of reservoir properties and basic designs of multilateral wells to be used in history matching and field development or infill drilling strategies.\nA graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed to offer user accessibility to the aforementioned artificial expert systems. It provides easy execution of codes and neural networks without requiring knowledge of the background mechanism. This interface allows the user to provide their own input data to simulate any desired scenario within the dataset limits. The results of each case are shown graphically or numerically.\n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10042], "author_name_tesi": "Bukhamseen, Ibrahim ", "last_name_ssi": "Bukhamseen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ibrahim", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rate Transient", "Artificial Neural Networks", "Fishbone", "Horizontal", "Shale Gas Reservoir", "Multilateral"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Optimizing Corporate Decisions for Dominant Hydrocarbon Producers under Uncertainty", "id": "23413", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10643", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The production strategy of a dominant hydrocarbon producer can significantly affect the shape of the future of the hydrocarbon market (Nakov, A., and Nuno, G. 2011). This study focused on the role of a dominant producer in the hydrocarbon market; however, these findings could be applied to any industry extracting finite resources. The thesis was divided into four major chapters: 1) Capacity management, 2) Predicting decline parameters and development strategy for a capacity management model\u2014an artificial expert system, 3) Optimal spare capacity, and 4) Integrated capacity management and spare capacity. Collectively, information offered in these four chapters can optimize the corporate decisions made by a dominant hydrocarbon producer that operates oil and/or gas fields. Each of these studies was discussed in each chapter.\nThe first study had to do with Capacity Management (CM) that is a complex dynamic optimization problem whose goal is to manage production capacity across a portfolio of producing assets to maximize the total portfolio plateau length and/or NPV. Field-level constraints included facility limitations, costs, and technical properties (i.e., reservoir characteristics, and crude or gas types). Moreover, there also were company-level constraints (e.g., supply and spare capacity commitments). Although the problem could have been solved deterministically, the presence of uncertainty, in reservoir performance and the hydrocarbon market, made the probabilistic approach more realistic. This problem was tackled in three sections: (1) an integrated stochastic optimization model was built to solve for the optimal production rate allocation for a portfolio of oil or gas fields under the uncertainties of the markets and reservoir performances, (2) A sensitivity analysis was conducted for different market and reservoir models and parameters, and (3) A value of information (VOI) analysis was implemented to estimate the value of a more accurate expected demand. The various production allocation decisions, resulting from different economic and reservoir models, were compared with the goal of understanding the effect of these model parameters on decision-making. A Genetic Algorithm was implemented as the optimization algorithm. Results showed that the CM integrated model effectively maximized plateau length and mean NPV for the whole portfolio of fields. In addition, the optimal decisions in the CM problem were the function of the reservoir (i.e., reservoir quality, size, and maturity) and price (i.e., long-run equilibrium price) parameters. To maximize the total plateau length and/ or the NPV, production from youg fields with large decline exponent should be prioritized; then, mature fields with large decline expoenets. In other words, decline expoenet is the most impacting factor on the optimization problem. Capacity Management can add reserves with respect to time, delay development projects, increase profit, and reduce the uncertainty of the NPV. The relationship between the optimal production allocation decision and reservoir properties can be investigated for future studies; this may be achieved via regression analysis or machine learning techniques. This relationship can save significant amount of optimization time.  \nThe second section looks at developing an artificial expert system for the Capacity Management Model. The real-world applicability of a research study can be a key element in its success and enhance its value to oil and gas companies. Boosting a research study with this applicability can increase the reliability of the results since actual field data are being used rather than making an educated guess. The Capacity Management Model derived the proper production allocation for a portfolio of fields that maximized production plateau length while meeting the total target rate of output. This study was divided into two parts. In the first part, we predicted input parameters (decline curve parameters) for the CM model for given reservoir and development parameters. In the second part, we predicted a field development plan (drainage area) for a given set of reservoir properties, production rate and plateau length; production rate and plateau length were output from the CM model. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Genetic Programming (GP) methods were implemented to build the two prediction models. Predicting decline curve parameters and an optimal field development plan for any given set of reservoir properties constitutes a complex nonlinear optimization problem. Large variation in the magnitudes of various parameters (from 10e-04 for decline parameters to 10e07 for gas flow rates) further added to the computational complexity. These expert systems predicted decline parameters and a development plan for a specified system in a timely manner. In addition, no software can predict these parameters explicitly. In other words, the proposed expert system can predict endogenous parameters within seconds. Several existing studies addressed parameter estimation for the oil and gas industry (e.g., well testing results and multi-lateral well design) using artificial neural network methods. The prediction systems were tested against results from reservoir simulation; both systems showed excellent agreement with the simulation results. Moreover, the two implemented mechanisms (Artificial Neural Network and Genetic Programming) resulted in similarly accurate predictions that increased confidence in the constructed systems. The proposed models eliminated the need for a reservoir simulator in describing an appropriate production profile for a specified set of reservoir properties and development plans, and describing a development plan that achieved a required rate and plateau length for a given reservoir. Results showed that ANN and GP expert systems predicted decline parameters and dvelopoment plans with sufficient accuracy. For future studies,  the expert systemts built in this study can be enhanced for more complicated reservoirs like unconventional and hetrogenous reservoirs. \nThe third was spare capacity that can be a powerful tool for a major producer seeking to optimize its profit and increase its market power. Managing spare capacity under demand and price uncertainty is a complex optimization problem that requires sophisticated stochastic modeling and high computational capacity. This problem is best specified probabilistically, since it involves major investment in building and maintaining spare capacity volume, and may require a few years to develop the production facility. In other words, expected demand (at planning time) can be significantly different from actual realized demand. The problem was approached in three stages: 1) a stochastic optimization model was built to identify the optimal spare capacity under demand and crude price uncertainty, 2) sensitivity analysis was conducted for different demand and price forecasting models, and 3) a value of information analysis was conducted to quantify the impact of the accuracy of demand and price models. Acquiring spare capacity can increase profit and market power for a major crude oil producer. Spare capacity set the major producer as a price shock absorber (buffer mode), preventing prices from increasing (triggering alternative energy development) or from falling (reducing profit). Moreover, increasing crude prices can reduce the market share of a major producer by motivating the development of non-conventional and alternative energy sources. This study focused specifically on optimizing economic profits. We analyzed this issue by specifying an integrated stochastic optimization model that simulated demand for oil, and mapped demand forecasts on production decisions. The optimum spare capacity, estimated from different price and demand model assumptions, was evaluated with the purpose of understanding the impact of these assumptions on spare capacity decisions. Results showed a reasonably narrow range of spare capacity levels that maximized the total profits of a major oil producer. We recommend, for future studies, analyzing the relationship between the optimal spare capacity to acquire and market parameters include crude prices, world reserves and global demand. This will speed up the process and enhance the understanding of the problem. Moreover, our method implemented can be used to analyze the problem of optimal gas storage capacity given the seasonality in demand for natural gas.\nThe last part of the study integrated the first two studies (capacity management and spare capacity). This was done by assuming that a major producer was producing a portfolio of existing oil fields at maximum production potential. The integrated spare capacity model recommended a level of spare capacity to build. After that, the capacity management model suggested the optimal production rate allocation. Results showed that the optimal production allocation was a function of reservoir properties and maturity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10277], "author_name_tesi": "Bukhari, Abdulwahab ", "last_name_ssi": "Bukhari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Abdulwahab", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Anastasia Shcherbakova", "Luis Ayala", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Paul Griffin", "Yilin Wang", "Anastasia Shcherbakova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Dissertation Advisor", "Anastasia Shcherbakova, Dissertation Advisor", "Luis Ayala, Committee Member", "Sarma V Pisupati, Committee Member", "Paul Griffin, Committee Member", "Yilin Wang, Committee Member", "Anastasia Shcherbakova, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Optimization", "Risk Analysis", "Decision Analysis", "VOI", "petroleum economics", "optimization", "monte carlo simulation", "stochastic"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "An Investigation of the Adoption of Environmental Certification In Two Segments of the North American Wood Products Industry\n", "id": "8955", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5901", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation contains research that examined the determinants of wood industry executives\u2019 decisions and intentions to adopt environmental certification.

The cytoplasmic membrane proteins that comprise this complex system include TonB, ExbB, and ExbD.  Import of the scarce ferric iron from the environment is an integral activity for these organisms and is a determinant of virulence in many bacteria.  A complete understanding of the mechanistic details of this complex is the ultimate goal of our studies.\n\tTonB appears to be energized by a heteromultimeric complex at the cytoplasmic membrane composed of ExbB and ExbD.  Currently it is not known how the complex couples the energy of the proton motive force to TonB, although it is proposed to form a proton-conducting channel in the cytoplasmic membrane.  Consistent with that idea, TonB responds conformationally to the proton motive force only in the presence of ExbB/ExbD.  TonB and ExbD are topologically similar; each has a single N-terminal transmembrane domain with the majority of the protein exposed to the periplasm.  ExbB on the other hand contains three transmembrane domains with the majority of the protein exposed to the cytoplasm. Since ExbD and TonB have short cytoplasmic domains, the major region through which they can interact with ExbB is through their transmembrane domains.  Mutagenic studies of ExbB have identified a few key residues in two of its three transmembrane domains.  However, the majority of ExbB consists of two soluble cytoplasmic domains including a ~90 amino acid cytoplasmic loop between the first and second transmembrane domains and a ~50 amino acid C-terminal tail.  Nothing is known about the cytoplasmic domains of ExbB.  In this study, a deletion scanning analysis was applied to the cytoplasmic loop of ExbB to determine its role in ExbB activity if any.  \nThe studies in this dissertation show that the ExbB cytoplasmic loop is essential for its role in energizing siderophore-mediated iron transport across the outer membrane.  The majority of the loop deletions appear to collapse the proton motive force, which is the energy source for iron transport.  Because the cytoplasmic loop domain of ExbB is also required for trimerization of ExbD in the periplasm and dissociation of the TonB C terminus from its outer membrane association, we hypothesize that under wild type circumstances signal transduction occurs from the cytoplasm to the periplasm and outer membrane through the transmembrane domains of ExbB.  Each of the inactive ExbB loop deletions also form a previously undetected crosslinked complex.  In summary, in this dissertation, the role of ExbB as a proton translocator is established and more specifically, evidence is presented that the cytoplasmic loop plays a role in regulating translocation of protons through ExbB.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1054], "author_name_tesi": "Bulathsinghala, Charles M", "last_name_ssi": "Bulathsinghala", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Charles", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Postle", "Sarah Ellen Ades", "Kenneth Charles Keiler", "B Tracy Nixon", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Postle, Committee Chair", "Sarah Ellen Ades, Committee Member", "Kenneth Charles Keiler, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Erin Elizabeth Sheets, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ExbB", "cytoplasmic loop", "energy transduction", "Escherichia coli", "membrane protein", "TonB"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Regulation of Drug Resistance by Ikaros", "id": "25617", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10126", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Acute leukemia is the most common form of cancer in the pediatric population, accounting for nearly one third of all pediatric malignancies. Survival rates for pediatric leukemia have improved dramatically over the last 40 years and the combined 5-year survival rate has risen from less than 20% in the late 1960s to an estimated overall survival rate of greater than 85% today. However, despite the remarkable advancements in treatment therapies, the prognosis for high-risk patients\u2014those who relapse, or fail to achieve post induction remission\u2014remains poor. Treatment failure is the number one cause of relapse, making drug resistance a hallmark of high-risk leukemia. Sadly, the survival rate for the 25% of children who relapse is less than 30%, underscoring the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms mediating drug resistance and treatment failure, such that more efficacious treatment regimens can be developed. \n\tRecently, large scale genome-wide analyses of genetic alterations in leukemia have established IKZF1 (also known as ZNFN1A1), the gene encoding IKAROS, as one of the most clinically relevant prognostic markers in high-risk precursor-B cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). IKAROS is a sequence-specific DNA binding protein essential for normal hematopoiesis and participates in a complex network of interactions to recruit chromatin-modifying machines to gene regulatory regions promoting their transcriptional activation or repression via chromatin remodeling. Studies in mice have established IKAROS as a master regulator of lymphoid specification and a potent tumor suppressor in leukemia. Ongoing research has demonstrated that IKAROS binds and regulates thousands of genes involved in many different cellular processes. Mutations or deletions in IKZF1 have been consistently associated with high-risk leukemia, and interestingly, IKZF1 was the only gene for which mutations and deletions were found to be useful in predicting a poor response to therapy. What is not well understood, however, is the precise mechanism through which the loss of Ikaros function contributes to drug resistance and treatment failure. \n\tThe absence and/or inactivation of IKAROS is highly associated with leukemia that is resistant to current chemotherapy agents and has a poor prognosis. Evidence suggests that even modest changes in IKAROS function, resulting from defects in a single IKAROS allele (haploinsufficiency), aids in the progression of leukemic transformation and results in increased risk of relapse. Our main goal was to understand the role of IKAROS in high-risk, drug-resistant leukemia. To accomplish this objective, we studied IKAROS-mediated regulation of genes involved in the folate pathway as well as genes essential to the inhibitory effects and metabolism of standard chemotherapeutics used in the treatment of ALL. We hypothesized that IKAROS regulates the sensitivity of leukemia cells to chemotherapy and that restoration of IKAROS function would inhibit leukemic growth and increase sensitivity to chemotherapy.\n\tTo identify IKAROS target genes in leukemia, we used anti-Ikaros chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by deep sequencing in the human pre-B cell ALL cell line, Nalm6. Four IKAROS target genes involved in drug resistance were identified, and IKAROS binding was confirmed using independent anti-Ikaros ChIP assays in multiple cell lines and primary patient leukemia samples. Furthermore, we used both gain of function and loss of function assays to determine how IKAROS affected the transcription of genes involved in drug resistance. Our results suggest that IKAROS binds to the Ikaros regulatory elements (IRE) and decrease the expression of several genes important in drug resistance in human leukemia.  \nThe targets identified are intricately involved in folate metabolism, and thus, dysregulation of genes within this pathway could potentially affect the efficacy of treatment with methotrexate and the metabolism or inactivation of 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine into their inactive metabolites. To expand these studies, we sought to understand the signal transduction pathway(s) that control IKAROS-mediated regulation of drug resistance in leukemia by using both molecular inactivation and pharmacological inactivation of the pro-oncogenic protein casein kinase 2 (CK2). CK2 is overexpressed in human leukemia, and phosphorylation of Ikaros by CK2 results in decreased Ikaros DNA-binding affinity and loss of pericentromeric localization, resulting in a more diffuse nuclear pattern. We found that inhibition of CK2 resulted in increased binding of IKAROS at the upstream regulatory elements of target genes and a reduction in target gene transcription. \nImportantly, a regimen consisting of daily 6-mercaptopurine and weekly methotrexate, in addition to periodic intrathecal therapy, is considered the gold standard for maintenance therapy in ALL. Our findings suggested inhibition of CK2 increases Ikaros DNA-binding affinity at IKAROS regulatory elements (IREs); therefore, we hypothesized that CK2 inhibition would restore IKAROS-mediated repression of genes involved in drug resistance. Using cell cytotoxicity assays, we demonstrate that combination therapy with 6-TG or MTX and CK2 inhibitors results in increased cell death and thus heightened leukemia cell sensitivity to chemotherapy. Our results further suggest that inhibition of CK2 restores IKAROS function, enabling it to repress genes important in overcoming the inhibitory effects of chemotherapy agents used in high-risk leukemia ALL maintenance therapy, and provides support for combination therapy with CK2 inhibitors as a promising, novel treatment for ALL.\nIn summary, we have identified the mechanism by which a loss or deletion in IKAROS contributes to the development of drug resistance in leukemia. We identified IKAROS as a critical regulator of several genes important in drug resistance. Loss of IKAROS function due to mutations, deletions, and CK2 over-activity is characteristic of high-risk leukemia. A decrease in IKAROS function results in deregulated transcription of genes that metabolize 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine or modify the effective treatment dose of methotrexate. After identifying the signal transduction pathway that controls IKAROS-mediated repression of drug resistance genes, we devised a rational targeted chemotherapy involving combination treatment with CK2 inhibitors and standard chemotherapy agents for high-risk leukemia. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9818], "author_name_tesi": "Bulathsinghala, Marie S", "last_name_ssi": "Bulathsinghala", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Marie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sinisa Dovat", "Sinisa Dovat", "John Warren Wills", "Barbara Miller", "Gregory Yochum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sinisa Dovat, Dissertation Advisor", "Sinisa Dovat, Committee Chair", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member", "Barbara Miller, Committee Member", "Gregory Yochum, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Leukemia", "drug-resistance", "Ikaros"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Tracking multiple inputs: An investigation of the primacy effect in monolinguals and bilinguals", "id": "26389", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11518", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A fundamental challenge of statistical learning is to determine whether variance observed in the input signals a change in the underlying structure. When asked to segment two consecutive artificial languages, learners show a reliable tendency to only learn the first of two presented languages unless the change is correlated with a contextual cue or exposure to the second structure is lengthened (Gebhart, Aslin, & Newport, 2009). In this thesis, I explored whether the primacy effect can be attenuated by manipulating the amount of exposure to the first language. I presented participants with five one-minute blocks of two artificial languages, each followed by a test.  In one condition, learners received fixed input, whereas in the other they advanced to the second language immediately after learning the first. When participants advanced to the second language as soon as learning occurred, the primacy effect was attenuated.  Notably, contextual cues did not boost performance using this latter paradigm, suggesting that without becoming entrenched in the first language there is no additive effect for such cues. In a second set of experiments, I compared monolinguals to advanced second language learners, to determine whether experience learning and managing two linguistic systems impacts learner\u2019s ability to learn two artificial languages presented in succession. Results thus far reveal a greater percentage of second language learners acquiring the second presented language relative to the monolingual group.

It was recently shown to modulate several important chromatin-binding factors, however its role in regulation of chromatin function remains unclear.\nOne of the potential catL nuclear targets is a developmentally-regulated chromatin-condensing factor MENT (myeloid and erythroid nuclear terminal stage-specific factor).  MENT belongs to a serpin (serine protease inhibitors) protein family.  In addition to condensing chromatin, MENT acts as a very potent, specific catL inhibitor in vitro.  Here I examine the role of this inhibition in living cells, specifically in modulation of epigenetic histone modifications.\nUsing radioactive in vivo protease labeling and ectopic expression of tagged catL, I demonstrate that catL partially localizes in the nucleus and interacts with MENT in living cells.  CatL expression alters MENT binding to chromatin, depending on the serpin-protease ratio.  Using mutagenesis of MENT and catL active centers, I show that this interaction involves classical serpin-protease binding, which promotes MENT relocation to euchromatin.\nI also show that inhibition of catL by MENT or complete catL removal by the gene knockout causes destabilization of chromatin epigenetic factors, specifically the localization and level of trimethyl-H3K9 and H2A.Z histone isoforms, as well as spatial distribution of Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1).  H3me3K9 together with HP1 and histone methyltransferases are particularly important for maintenance of constitutive heterochromatin.  My work for the first time reveals the control of this key epigenetic circuit by a protease.  CatL knockout leads to dramatic loss of H3me3K9 on pericentromeric heterochromatin and Y-chromosome.  CatL knockout specifically affects nuclear targeting of Suv39h1, the major enzyme responsible for heterochromatic H3me3K9.  Neither DNA methylation nor several other epigenetic markers previously linked to heterochromatin and H3K9 methylation are affected by catL knockout.  Thus, I identify the H3me3K9 and Suv39h1 as specific epigenetic targets of catepsin L in the cell nucleus.\nBased on these results, I conclude that catL is a specific modulator of major epigenetic histone modifications, particularly H3me3K9.  Inactivation of catL by expressing a nuclear inhibitor or by gene targeting thus provides potential means for a targeted regulation of chromatin epigenetics without damaging other vital biochemical pathways.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2407], "author_name_tesi": "Bulynko, Yaroslava ", "last_name_ssi": "Bulynko", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yaroslava", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sergei A Grigoryev", "Laura Carrel", "Momcilo Miljkovic", "Vincent Chau", "Judith S Bond"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sergei A Grigoryev, Committee Chair", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member", "Momcilo Miljkovic, Committee Member", "Vincent Chau, Committee Member", "Judith S Bond, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["histone modifications", "protease", "chromatin"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Flame transfer function measurements and mechanisms in a single-nozzle combustor", "id": "18989", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8909", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The response of a fully-premixed flame to velocity fluctuations was experimentally measured in a single-nozzle, swirl-stabilized, model gas turbine combustor.  Flame response was quantified in terms of the flame flame transfer function relating the input velocity fluctuations to the output heat release rate fluctuations.  The velocity fluctuation was measured using the two-microphone method and the heat release rate fluctuation was measured using $CH^*$ chemiluminescence emission over the forcing frequency range of $100-500\\text{ Hz}$ with a fixed velocity fluctuation amplitude, $\\sfrac{u^{\\prime}_{rms}}{\\overline{u}}$, of 5\\%.  Measurements were conducted over a broad range of operating conditions encompassing varied combustor pressure, $0.1-0.4\\text{ MPa}$, inlet temperature, $373-573\\text{ K}$, average velocity, $15-35\\text{ }\\sfrac{m}{s}$, and equivalence ratio, $0.45-0.75$.  A total of 47 flame transfer function measurements were acquired over this range of operating conditions.  Time-averaged $CH^*$ chemiluminescence flame images were acquired at all operating conditions.  At select operating conditions, the flame structure during forcing was characterized through high-speed $CH^*$ chemiluminescence flame imaging.\n\nFlame transfer function gain at all operating conditions exhibited similar characteristics indicating that the same velocity fluctuation mechanisms may be present at all operating conditions.  At low frequencies, flame transfer function gain decreased with increasing forcing frequency.  After reaching a minimum, flame transfer function gain then increased with increasing forcing frequency.  Once a maximum was reached the behavior repeated.  Flame transfer function phase increased quasi-linearly with increasing forcing frequency.  Deviation from the linear trend occurred in the form of inflection points at forcing frequencies corresponding to flame transfer function gain minima.  The effect of each operating condition parameter on the flame transfer function was investigated independently.\n\nVelocity fluctuation mechanisms were investigated from a global perspective by comparing the collapse of flame transfer function gain with different frequency scaling parameters. Four frequency scaling parameters were compared: Strouhal number based on flame length $\\left(St_{L_{fl}}\\right)$, Strouhal number based on nozzle diameter $\\left(St_{D_{nozzle}}\\right)$, phase between axial and azimuthal velocity fluctuations at the flame anchoring location $\\left(\\theta_{v-u}\\right)$, and phase between swirl number and axial velocity fluctuations at the flame anchoring location $\\left(\\theta_{S-u}\\right)$.  It was found that $\\left(\\theta_{v-u}\\right)$ collapsed the flame transfer function gain best.  Since this parameter is directly related to the swirl number fluctuation magnitude it indicates that swirl number fluctuations are an important velocity fluctuation mechanism.  It was also found that the maximum flame transfer function gain decreased with increasing $\\sfrac{S_L}{\\overline{u}}$ which is related to the response time of the flame.\n\nVelocity fluctuation mechanisms were then investigated on a local scale through analysis of phase-synchronized flame images.  Root mean square fluctuation images showed that heat release fluctuations are equally distributed about the mean flame position at flame transfer function gain minima.  Conversely, at flame transfer function gain maxima the largest heat release fluctuation occurred in the downstream region of the flame.  A windowing analysis was applied to the phase-synchronized flame images to investigate the interference of axial velocity and swirl number fluctuations.  It was found that interference between these two mechanisms was only present at flame transfer function gain minima, and then only for certain window divisions showing that interference between between the two mechanisms is not the cause of the flame transfer function gain extrema.\n\nSwirl number fluctuations were then examined through their direct effect on the flame, movement of the flame base position.  Flame base movement followed an inverse trend to flame transfer function gain, i.e. when flame transfer function gain increased flame base movement decreased and vice versa.  This trend was shown for all but the shortest flames tested.  This indicates that flame base movement acts to decrease global flame response and that the degree of flame wall interaction modifies flame response.  Through examination of the vorticity equation it was shown how the flame could decrease the vorticity of the flow by gas expansion, baroclinic production of vorticity of opposite side, and increased viscous diffusion.  Therefore it is proposed that when the swirl number fluctuation is largest the flame base movement is largest and the position of the flame relative to the shear layer changes causing decreased vorticity and in turn decreased flame transfer function gain.  When the swirl number fluctuation is smallest the flame base does not move and the vorticity of the shear layer is not damped before interacting with the flame leading to high flame transfer function gain.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8751], "author_name_tesi": "Bunce, Nicholas Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Bunce", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Michael Matthew Micci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Domenic Adam Santavicca, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Michael Matthew Micci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["combustion", "gas turbine", "flame response", "swirling"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Total Sexual Selection on Men's Voices", "id": "19944", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "9499", "abstract_tesi": "The human voice is particularly well suited for the study of sexual selection in humans.

Teachers across the country are more and more likely to have students that represent various languages and cultures in their classrooms than ever before.  Responsibility for the treatment of students is mediated by federal, state, and district laws and policies.  In 2002, an English-only ballot initiative was passed in Massachusetts, reversing the pro-bilingual orientation of earlier federal efforts designed to welcome linguistic diversity in schools.  The challenges from the new policy required teachers to reorient their approaches to language diversity and these students immediately after forty years of pro-bilingual policies.  This study explores how teachers, through their role as policymakers characterize the responsibilities of schools to these children during an English-only era.\n\tA review of the literature on policy implementation and analysis, sensemaking theory, and individual and social notions of discourse provided a theoretical framework for this research.  A case study approach guided this study, using a series of three, in-depth interviews with each of the five participants.  Data analysis included coding and categorizing the data, while identifying the major themes that emerged.  Participant responses over time were closely examined and developed into five major themes and several sub-themes.\n\tThe major themes that emerged from the study were: time and curriculum, influence of biography, networks and divisions, contextual factors, and leadership.  Through these themes, there is evidence of multiple discourses within and among the participants as they made sense of the English-only policy.  Despite this diversity among themselves, the participants also used discourses to create categories and binary distinctions.  Similar to the initial ballot initiative, the participants see the policy as either black or white with little to no middle ground.  In reality, it is impossible to place the participants within the binary distinction that they have created because they existed somewhere between the two extremes depending on the context of our discussions.  Their sensemaking process blurred the boundaries between the two sides of the English-only debate and has implications for policy research, teacher education, and professional development.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [603], "author_name_tesi": "Bunten, Bridget Anne Conlon", "last_name_ssi": "Bunten", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne Conlon", "first_name_ssi": "Bridget", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick Willard Shannon", "Patrick Willard Shannon", "Gail Louise Boldt", "Dr Youb Kim", "Dana Lynn Mitra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick Willard Shannon, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Chair", "Gail Louise Boldt, Committee Member", "Dr Youb Kim, Committee Member", "Dana Lynn Mitra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["educational policy", "English-only policy", "teacher sensemaking", "bilingual education"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Iterative Hillclimbing Optimization Techniques for Transform Image Encoding/Decoding and for Image Segmentation", "id": "5953", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4993", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An iterative hillclimbing optimization technique was introduced in this thesis. \nIt was used to tackle many index assignment problems, i.e.\ntransform image encoding, noisy image decoding, and image segmentation.\nWe first studied basic transform image coding techniques, then introduced an\niterative algorithm which has a hillclimbing property on the cost function.\nWe then extended the algorithm to hyperspectral image coding.\nWe realized that the algorithm can be generalized to other applications as well.\nWe applied the iterative hillclimbing idea to noisy channel image decoding.\nWe also investigated\na Turbo-like joint source-channel decoding technique, which is another kind\nof iterative decoding.\nLastly, we re-investigated the image segmentation application, using the iterat$\nThe hillclimbing method inspired development of another iterative algorithm whi$\nwith applications both to image decoding and image segmentation.\nThe hillclimbing algorithm at the heart of this thesis thus\nyielded several promising offshoot directions for continuing research.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4970], "author_name_tesi": "Bunyaratavej, Piya ", "last_name_ssi": "Bunyaratavej", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Piya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jia Li", "John F Doherty", "David Jonathan Miller", "George Kesidis", "John Metzner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jia Li, Committee Member", "John F Doherty, Committee Member", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Chair", "George Kesidis, Committee Member", "John Metzner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["image segmentation", "image decoding", "optimization", "image encoding", "iterative", "hillclimbing"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Investment in Process Control Justification for Multi-stage Systems Using Analytical Model   ", "id": "14124", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7335", "abstract_tesi": "Process control and quality assurance are the composing elements of a quality management system that are used to ensure the quality of a product or a service.

Among these released offenders, two out of three parolees are returned to prison within three years of release.  This study examines community-level risk factors for parolees in order to learn how different communities affect parolee recidivism.  Specifically, the parolee population in Georgia was used to investigate how parolee recidivism is affected by three community characteristics \u2013 poverty, rurality, and the presence of criminal justice resources.  \n\tUsing Geographical Information Systems, a multilevel dataset was created that included individual-level parolee data, socio-structural measures and crime data of communities, and the location of parole offices in Georgia.  Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling, parolees were followed over a two-year period in order to learn which community characteristics contributed to their return to prison.  Each community characteristic was examined independently in order to avoid issues of multicollinearity between the socio-structural variables measuring poverty, rurality, and criminal justice resources.  From these analyses, six important findings emerged.\n\tFirst, parolees who lived in urban communities with high levels of concentrated disadvantage, high population density, and high crime rates had significantly lower odds of being returned to prison.  Because parolees increasingly reside in these impoverished urban communities, these areas are precisely the type of communities where parolees are safest from being returned to prison.  This finding might be explained in part by the presence of informal social control and criminal justice resources, which could affect the level of parolee recidivism across communities.  Although this study attempted to evaluate whether this finding could be explained by local criminal justice resources, these effects were not statistically significant.  Additional analyses should be conducted using finer measures of criminal justice resources.  \n\tThe second and third findings showed that community effects were not uniform across parolee subopulations. Specifically, parolee race and risk scores each significantly interacted with community poverty. While all parolees had similar odds of recidivism in communities marked by extreme poverty, this recidivism gap widened in wealthier communities with white parolees recidivating significantly more than minority parolees.  Further, a significant interaction was found between risk scores and racial inequality, with minority parolees more likely to  be returned to prison in high racial inequality communities that favored African Americans.  These findings suggest that some populations can benefit from residing in certain types of communities, while other populations reintegrate successfully regardless of where they live.  \n\tThis study also sought to better understand how five different theoretical and empirical poverty measures affected recidivism.  The fourth finding established that only concentrated disadvantage significantly affected individual parolees\u2019 odds of being returned to prison.  The fifth finding showed that only extreme poverty significantly affected community rates of recidivism.  Poverty measures of relative deprivation, racial inequality, and spatial proximity to poverty did not significantly impact parolees\u2019 odds of being retuned to prison.  These latter two findings suggest that poverty measures examining the magnitude of poverty are more important predictors of recidivism than relativistic measures of poverty (i.e., relative deprivation, racial inequality) or spatial measures of poverty (i.e., neighboring poverty levels).  It is important to note that the geographic level at which this data was analyzed may affect the significance level of certain poverty measures, meaning that smaller community measures may result in different poverty outcomes.\n\tFinally, individual characteristics of parolees were found to be signficant across every model in this study.  The magnitude of the effects of these parolee characteristics, both static (e.g., race, gender) and dynamic (e.g., drug and alcohol use, risk scores), suggest that while understanding community effects is important, one should still consider the impact of individual parolee characteristics on recidivism.\n\tSeveral limitations to this study are noted.  First, this study provided a thorough examination of socio-structural variables, yet was unable to measure important mediating variables (e.g., neighborhood attachment).  Second, the lack of randomness of parolees\u2019 reintegration into residential communities is an inherent limitation in all community-level research, including the present study.  Although there are a few examples of random assignment of communities, these examples are usually extremely expensive as well as politically unpopular.  Finally, given that the poverty findings from this study are inconsistent with previous parolee research, the results from this study showing that the community effects affect parolees differently across geographical areas may not be generalizable to the entire parolee population of the United States.  \n\tThe community effects findings from this study indicate that communities can be important to the reintegration efforts of parolees.  This study, in conjunction with other studies, found that various geographic areas can affect parolees differently.  Additionally, community effects are not constant across different racial and ethnic groups.  Given the differential effects communities have upon parolees across states and among different racial and ethnic groups, implications from this study suggest that a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to parole policy will be ineffective.  Indeed, these results indicate that parole policy should be crafted locally with an understanding as to how communities operate in different jurisdictions in order to be successful.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1935], "author_name_tesi": "Burden, Frances Frick", "last_name_ssi": "Burden", "middle_name_ssi": "Frick", "first_name_ssi": "Frances", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback", "Barry Ruback", "D Wayne Osgood", "Barrett Alan Lee", "Alexander Klippel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Barry Ruback, Dissertation Advisor", "Barry Ruback, Committee Chair", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member", "Barrett Alan Lee, Committee Member", "Alexander Klippel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["recidivism", "neighborhood effects", "prisoner reentry", "parolees", "concentrated disadvantage", "social disorganization"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "OPTIMIZATION-BASED FRAMEWORKS FOR THE \nANALYSIS AND REDESIGN OF METABOLIC NETWORKS", "id": "6410", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "326", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-09-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The central theme of this thesis is the development of computational tools for the analysis and redesign of metabolic networks.  The key questions that are addressed in this work are: how can one (i) select the optimal set(s) of functions to recombine into microbial strains to enhance their maximum theoretical production capabilities, (2) identify the smallest set of reactions capable of supporting minimal metabolism under various conditions, (3) test whether hypothesized intracellular objectives are consistent with experimental measurements, (4) shape the connectivity of a metabolic network in such a way that a targeted biochemical becomes an obligatory byproduct of cell growth, and (5) elucidate the topological and structural features of metabolic reconstructions at the genome-scale.  \n\tIn the first part of this thesis, a computational protocol is introduced and applied to select the optimal foreign reactions from a genomic database encompassing multiple species for increasing the maximum theoretical yields of the twenty amino acids in Escherichia coli. Here it was found that the production capabilities of seven amino acids could be enhanced by the addition of only one or two foreign functionalities. Next, the minimal reaction network framework revealed that 224 or 229 metabolic reactions are required to support E. coli growth on glucose or acetate, respectively, while a cell cultured on a rich optimally engineered medium could theoretically support growth with as few as 122 metabolic reactions. Thus the minimal reaction sets were revealed to be highly dependent on the imposed uptake environment and the growth requirements. In the following section, the ObjFind procedure is applied to two sets of experimental E. coli flux data (i.e., anaerobic and aerobic growth) revealing that a common metabolic objective, biomass production, is the most explanatory. The OptKnock framework is then introduced for pinpointing reactions in a metabolic network for removal to force growth-coupled biochemical production.  Computational results for the overproduction of lactic acid, succinic acid, and 1,3-propanediol are consistent with both intuitive and non-intuitive knockout strategies published in the literature. Lastly, the flux coupling finder procedure is applied to three genome-scale metabolic models enabling the exhaustive identification of various types of reaction coupling.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [320], "author_name_tesi": "Burgard, Anthony P.", "last_name_ssi": "Burgard", "middle_name_ssi": "P.", "first_name_ssi": "Anthony", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas", "Andrew Zydney", "Darrell Velegol", "Reka Z Albert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Costas D Maranas, Committee Chair", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metabolic network", "stoichiometric modeling", "microbial strain design"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Identification of college students' recreational networks and the temporal association with drinking and hooking-up", "id": "22411", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10178", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "        For young adults, alcohol use and sexual behavior are imbedded in a particular form of social network: the people whom they engage in a variety of activities with over a weekend, referred to as a recreational network. Little attention has been paid to examining these recreational networks in previous research.  The current study attempts to fill this gap.  \n\tThe first aim of the present study was to examine the heterogeneity in network characteristics associated with drinking and hooking-up sexual behavior among undergraduate college students.  The second aim was to explore the temporal changes that occur over a weekend within these recreational networks and their association with drinking and hooking-up.  From a behavior change perspective, the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) suggests that people\u2019s social relationships can shape their behavior through norms.  Therefore, this theory along with a social network perspective were combined to explain why students may be drinking and hooking-up in distinct recreational networks over the weekend.  \n\tIn the spring, summer, and fall semesters of 2012, 435 college students completed the HUDSoN (Hooking Up and Drinking Social Network) Questionnaire on consecutive days during a weekend.  The HUDSoN includes: 1) questions on hooking-up and drinking behavior and 2) a social network inventory that examines with whom students are hanging out, characteristics of those individuals, and the multi-dimensional relationships among network members.  To achieve the first aim, latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify recreational network profiles using data from Friday night.  Six network indicators were used in the LCA model: 1) size, 2) gender diversity, 3) drinking buddies in the network, 4) activities engaged in by each network member, 5) level of trust within the network, and 6) age of network members.  Hooking-up and drinking behavior were then added to the LCA model as covariates.  To achieve the second aim, latent transition analysis (LTA) was used to explore the temporal changes that occur within college students\u2019 recreational networks from Thursday to Friday night using the same six network indicators.  Hooking-up and drinking behavior were then added to the LTA model as covariates to examine whether these behaviors are associated with movement between the network classes.  \n\tAs a result of the LCA three distinct network classes were identified: 1) Risky Partiers (26.7%), 2) Restrictive Partiers (34.0%), and 3) Restrictive Non-Partiers (39.3%).  Alcohol consumption and hooking-up were associated with membership into network class.  Students who consumed alcohol were most likely to be Risky Partiers and less likely to be Restrictive Partiers in comparison to Restrictive Non-Partiers.  Students who hooked-up were most likely to be Risky Partiers or Restrictive Partiers compared to Restrictive Non-Partiers.  As a result of the LTA model four distinct network profiles were identified: 1) Risky Partiers (22.9%, 25.8%), 2) Restrictive Partiers (28.3%, 44.8%), 3) Inclusive Non-Partiers (28.8%, 3.0%), and 4) Restrictive Non-Partiers (19.9%, 26.3%).  Alcohol consumption and hooking-up were associated with movement between the recreational network classes from Thursday to Friday night  Drinking was associated with an increased likelihood of students transitioning to Risky Partiers from Thursday to Friday night, whereas hooking-up behavior was only associated with Inclusive Non-Partiers transitioning to Risky Partiers.\n\tFindings from this study suggest that students drink and engage in sexual behavior in different ways depending on their recreational networks. These findings have potential implications for interventions to decrease risky alcohol and sexual behaviors targeting the type of recreational networks in which undergraduate students choose to embed themselves.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9866], "author_name_tesi": "Burger, Brea Desiree", "last_name_ssi": "Burger", "middle_name_ssi": "Desiree", "first_name_ssi": "Brea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Barthalow Koch", "Patricia Barthalow Koch", "Robert James Turrisi", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa", "Rachel Annette Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Barthalow Koch, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Barthalow Koch, Committee Chair", "Robert James Turrisi, Committee Member", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa, Committee Member", "Rachel Annette Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["alcohol use", "college students", "social networks", "recreational networks", "hooking-up"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "EL PASO POLYCHROME IN THE CASAS GRANDES REGION, CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO: CERAMIC EXCHANGE BETWEEN PAQUIM\u00c9 AND THE JORNADA MOGOLLON", "id": "6967", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2922", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "El Paso Polychrome was the second most common non-local ceramic type at Paquim\u00e9, a 13th-15th century pueblo in northwestern Chihuahua, Mexico.  Paquim\u00e9 was one of the largest sites in the prehistoric Southwest.  Most models of this center\u2019s development and regional role focus on trade, and El Paso Polychrome is one of the most common non-local ceramic types at Paquim\u00e9.  Researchers have generally assumed that El Paso Polychrome originates in the Jornada Mogollon culture area, centered in west Texas and southern New Mexico.  This ceramic type\u2019s status as a trade ware in northern Mexico has never before been tested, though the exchange of ceramic vessels is not the only possible explanation for El Paso Polychrome\u2019s presence.  The focus of this dissertation is testing this assumption that El Paso Polychrome is a trade ware at Paquim\u00e9 and other sites in northwest Chihuahua.  For this purpose a large sample of late El Paso Polychrome from Paquim\u00e9 was systematically compared to samples from Villa Ahumada, Chihuahua, at the very southern extent of the Jornada Mogollon culture area, and to samples from several sites at Fort Bliss Army Air Artillery Range in the Jornada Mogollon heartland.  Technological and design attributes were recorded for over 1600 El Paso Polychrome sherds from these three locations, and 300 of these samples were also thin-sectioned for petrographic analysis.  This petrographic analysis provided information on mineral components, ceramic body recipe and grain-size distribution.  When compared statistically, El Paso Polychrome from the Chihuahuan sites is not significantly different from samples from west Texas and south-central New Mexico.  In addition, all El Paso Polychrome samples subjected to petrographic analysis were tempered with crushed granite, and there are no sources of granite within 30 kilometers of Paquim\u00e9 or Villa Ahumada.  This is well beyond the distance potters are willing to travel for raw materials in ethnographic studies.  The frequency of El Paso Polychrome at Paquim\u00e9 and its associated communities can be entirely accounted for by the movement of ceramic vessels rather than other causes, such as migration of potters or stylistic emulation.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2916], "author_name_tesi": "Burgett, Jessica Prue", "last_name_ssi": "Burgett", "middle_name_ssi": "Prue", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth", "Dean R.

Pythium species are among the most damaging pathogens of horticultural crops causing damping-off of seedlings as well as root and stem rots in ornamental plants. Despite frequent attempts to recover Pythium from recycled water, success in isolation is sporadic. This raises the question of possible microbial suppression of Pythium present in recycled irrigation water.\n\tThe present study focused on the deleterious effect of microbial communities in recycled irrigation water on the development of Pythium aphanidermatum, P. irregulare, and P. cryptoirregulare. Microscopic observations of the interaction between microorganisms in recycled irrigation water and Pythium species indicated a deleterious effect on Pythium development. The amount of sporangia produced in the presence of the microbial community was negatively affected when compared to water samples with no microorganisms. In addition, research was conducted to evaluate heterotrophic bacteria isolated from recycled irrigation water that reduced the growth in vitro of the three highly pathogenic Pythium species. We isolated a variety of bacteria some of which inhibited the three Pythium spp. growth, others bound to their hyphae, and still others seemed to enhance the growth of the Pythium species. Known biocontrol agents against Pythium (Pseudomonas and Bacillus) and some potentially new biocontrol agents (Acidovorax, Microbacterium, and Chryseobacterium) were identified as isolates inhibiting the growth of P. aphanidermatum, P. irregulare, and P. cryptoirregulare in vitro. The use of biological control agents to control Pythium spp. is not new. However, in most cases, commercially available beneficial organisms are from other environments. Utilization of naturally occurring suppressive bacterial communities in recycled irrigation water may provide an environmentally friendly ecologically sound biological control strategy. We observed that Pythium grew slower when bacterial isolates bound to their hyphae. This phenomenon was previously observed but is not fully understood. These isolates were identified as Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Pantoea, and Pseudomonas species. Surprisingly, we also isolated bacteria that enhanced the growth of Pythium in vitro. More research is needed to understand this phenomenon. \n\tFurther studies were conducted to determine if changes in bacterial community composition were associated with the presence of Pythium species in the water. We used automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) to examine the impact the presence of P. aphanidermatum, P. irregulare, or P. cryptoirregulare had on bacteria diversity in recycled irrigated water. ARISA profiles indicated that all three Pythium species had an impact on the bacterial community. To confirm ARISA results, we used quantitative PCR (q-PCR) to quantify the change in \u03b3-Proteobacteria populations when P. aphanidermatum, P. irregulare, or P. cryptoirregulare were added to recycled irrigation water samples. All samples showed a significant increased in \u03b3-Proteobacteria population when one of the three Pythium was present in the water sample. The results suggest that Pythium presence plays a role in structuring bacterial community composition. \n\tIn an effort to gain knowledge of the aquatic ecology of Pythium spp., we isolated and identified Pythium species from greenhouse water reservoirs to elucidate temporal patterns of Pythium in that aquatic environment. This is an important aspect to increase farmer awareness of this genus and the species that are more prevalent in this ecosystem. The results suggest that some Pythium species survived for long periods (e.g. Pythium group F isolates) while other species are transient (e.g. P. catenulatum) in this environment. P. aphanidermatum, P. irregulare, and P. cryptoirregulare were rarely isolated (one time only) from greenhouse water reservoirs suggesting that microbial populations in recycled irrigation water suppress these three pathogenic Pythium species.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8258], "author_name_tesi": "Burgos, Maria Luisa", "last_name_ssi": "Burgos", "middle_name_ssi": "Luisa", "first_name_ssi": "Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary William Moorman", "Frederick Eugene Gildow Jr.", "Edward G Dudley", "Beth Krueger Gugino", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco", "Timothy W Mcnellis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary William Moorman, Dissertation Advisor", "Frederick Eugene Gildow Jr., Committee Chair", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Member", "Beth Krueger Gugino, Committee Member", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pythium and bacterial community is recycled irrigation water"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Experiential Professional Development: Promoting Communicative Language Teaching with Expeditionary Learning Outward Bound Design", "id": "6562", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "729", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Experiential professional development (EPD) that has been integrated into the school day in World Language (WL) classrooms creates opportunities for teachers to learn to use a communicative approach to language teaching (CLT) through experience.

This model of EPD is a ten-week learning expedition, influenced by Expeditionary Learning Outward Bound (ELOB) design (Campbell et al., 1998, Cousins 1998).  The course was offered by a major U.S. university to a local public school district in spring 2004.  At school, four Spanish teachers collaborated with colleagues, students and the EPD consultant to design, teach and reflect on communicative activities implemented in classroom lessons.  \n\nDuring the EPD course, the teachers\u2019 classes were observed everyday.

In recent years, nanowires have gained interest due to the ability to take advantage of their geometry for increased light absorption and the synthesis of radial heterostructures.  Several growth techniques have been explored for the growth of GaN and GaSb nanowires.  Metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is of particular interest due to its use in the commercial growth and fabrication of GaN-based and GaSb-based devices.\n  \nThe first part of this thesis focused on addressing several key issues related to the growth of GaN nanowires by MOCVD.  Preliminary studies investigated the effect of growth conditions on GaN nanowire formation in a hot wall MOCVD reactor.  A computational fluid dynamics-based model was developed to predict the gas phase velocity, temperature and concentration profiles in the reactor.  The results demonstrate a strong dependence of GaN nanowire growth on substrate position within the reactor which is due to the rapid reaction and depletion of precursors near the gas inlet of the reactor.   Ni-catalyzed GaN nanowire growth was observed to occur over the temperature range of 800-900oC, which is significantly lower than typical GaN thin film temperatures.  The nanowires, however, exhibited a tapered diameter due to thin film deposition which occurred simultaneously with nanowire growth.  Based on the low growth temperatures, TEM characterization was carried out to investigate the nature of the catalyst.  Through these studies, the catalyst was found to consist of Ni3Ga, indicating the presence of a vapor-solid-solid growth mechanism. \n \nIn an attempt to improve the nanowire growth selectivity, GeCl4 was added during growth resulting in a drastic increase in nanowire density and a reduction in the tapering of the nanowires.  Upon further inspection with TEM, the nanowires were found to consist of two morphologies: smooth nanowires and serrated nanowires.  The smooth nanowires were found to consist of the wurtzite crystal structure, while the serrated nanowires were determined to have a wurtzite core with zinc blende faceted islands protruding from the wurtzite core. \nThe second half of this thesis focused on the growth and characterization of GaSb nanowires.  An extensive amount of work has been carried out on GaSb thin films, however only a few reports exist on GaSb nanowire growth.  As a result, it was necessarily to complete a systematic study to determine a growth window for GaSb nanowires.  A narrow range of growth conditions were found for Au-catalyzed GaSb nanowire growth.  Vertically oriented nanowires were observed over a pressure range of 150-300 Torr depending on the substrate.  \n\nBased on these findings, additional characterization was carried out to investigate the structural properties of the nanowires along with chemical analysis of the catalyst to determine the nature of the catalyst as a function of the growth conditions.  The catalyst was found to consist of Ga, Sb, and Au consistent with that expected for vapor-liquid-solid growth, however the concentrations varied depending on the growth conditions and nanowire sample.  For one set of nanowires, the seed particle contained a Au-Sb solid solution (1-15 at.% Sb).  For the other set of nanowires, the particle consisted of an AuSb2 grain and an AuGa or Au2Ga grain that resulted in the formation of a bicrystalline nanowire.

The classification was determined by the tendency of the amorphous carbon to convert to crystalline graphite when annealed at temperatures above 1000 \u00b0C.  A unique property of non-graphitizing carbon is native nanoporosity, pores with widths less than 2 nm.  The pores act as molecular sieves and are able to separate molecules based on size and shape.  Nanoporous carbons (NPC) are utilized in gas separation membranes, catalysis, and electrical double layer capacitors.  The disordered structure of the carbon is attributed to the presence of extensive cross-linking in its precursor. \n \nPolyfurfuryl alcohol (PFA) is an example of a non-graphitizing carbon precursor.  Numerous researchers have studied this polymer-carbon system and acquired extensive knowledge in the areas of polymerization, pyrolysis, activation, and high temperature treatment.  Investigating the genesis and evolution of porosity in all aspects of carbon synthesis is critical to engineering the carbon to meet required design criteria, which include pore widths and volumes, surface area, and microstructure.  \nFour topics are examined herein: 1) Tuning of PFA polymerization and cross-linking in order to direct changes in carbon structure and porosity; 2) the autogenesis of porosity during pyrolysis; 3) the evolution of porosity and microstructure during annealing of non-activated and activated carbon; 4) the effectiveness of activated NPC as an electrode in an electrical double layer capacitor.\n\nEfforts to modify the molecular weight and degree of cross-linking in PFA were successful; however the variations were not propagated to the carbon.  The polymers were assimilated during pyrolysis due to the continued polymerization which occured up to the point of decomposition.  Thus bulk production of NPC could proceed from PFA synthesized by any method with the assurance that the properties of the product are consistent.  The exception was carbon derived from mixtures of PFA and Triton X-100, a surfactant.  With sufficient amount of the surfactant present, mesopores were generated in the nanoporous carbon.  Pyrolysis, rather than polymerization, was the key step in the synthesis of purely nanoporous carbon.\n\nThe pyrolysis of polyfurfuryl alcohol was studied up to 600 \u00b0C.  Nanopores appeared in the carbon as early as 300 \u00b0C along with significant amount of mesopores.  As the pyrolysis temperature was increased, nanoporosity was retained, but the mesoporosity disappeared.  At 600 \u00b0C the average pore width was 0.4-0.5 nm.  Between 300 and 400 \u00b0C, both polyaromatic domains decorated with hydrogen and oxygen (hetero) atoms and partially decomposed polymer chains coexisted.  The unreacted polymer and heteroatoms induced mesoporosity by buffering the nanopores created by polyaromatic domains.  Raising the pyrolysis above 400 \u00b0C released the buffering material, thereby collapsing the mesopores.\n\nA new pathway to synthesize a carbon with both nanoporosity and pre-graphitic structures was discovered by annealing a nanoporous activated carbon at 2000 \u00b0C.  The activation process permitted the carbon to overcome its intrinsic barrier to graphitization.  Prior to activation the nanopore walls were comprised of disordered graphene layers.  Activation eliminated the barrier to graphitization by reducing the number of layers and removing carbon material highly susceptible to oxidation.  High temperature annealing at 2000 \u00b0C of a carbon activated to 84% burnoff induced the formation of pre-graphitic domains amongst the nanoporous carbon.  The structures were termed pre-graphitic as order extended in two dimensions.  (002) bands were identified and assigned to amorphous, turbostratic, and graphitic carbon.  A nanopore volume of 0.50 cm3 gm-1 was preserved after annealing.  The product was heterogeneous, exhibiting both nanoporosity, a property of non-graphitizing carbon, and pre-graphite, a property of crystalline graphite.\n\nTwo electrode capacitors were fabricated utilizing activated nanoporous carbons.  The performance of carbons derived from polymers synthesized in the presence of either the solvent tetrahydrofuran or surfactant Triton X-100 was compared.  Triton X-100 acted as a mesopore former during pyrolysis.  The initial mesoporosity influenced activation by allowing generation of additional mesoporosity at all burnoffs.  Whereas, the carbon derived from polymer with tetrahydrofuran did not exhibit significant mesoporosity until a burnoff of 80%.  Nanopore volumes as high as 0.98 cm3 gm-1 at an average diameter of 0.82 nm were achieved.  Constant current capacitances of 106 F gm-1 and 109 F cm-3 were measured for carbon activated to just 15% burnoff with a nanopore volume of 0.28 cm3 gm-1.  The highest capacitance measured was 164 F gm-1.  The volumetric capacitance was 88 F cm-3 due to extensive activation and a lower bulk density.  Polyfurfuryl alcohol derived nanoporous carbon had tunable porosity and was an excellent material for capacitor electrodes.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1022], "author_name_tesi": "Burket, Christopher L", "last_name_ssi": "Burket", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry C Foley", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Andrew Zydney", "Angela Lueking"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry C Foley, Committee Chair", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member", "Angela Lueking, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["molecular sieves", "graphitization", "nanoporous carbon", "activated carbon", "non-graphitizing carbon", "carbon", "polymerization", "pyrolysis", "activation", "capacitors"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "C-4 EXPLOSION CHARACTERIZATION AND COMMON TRANSDUCER  ANALYSIS THROUGH APPLICATION OF DIGITAL CORRECTIONS FOR \nCONDENSER MICROPHONES\n\n", "id": "8582", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4949", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Composition C-4, a common explosive, produces a broad range of frequencies when detonated.

This approach can be most successful when there is contextual understanding of how such transitions can be successfully made and what constraints exist.  American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is a slow growing herbaceous perennial forest plant collected from Pennsylvania forestlands for more than 250 years.  Little is known about the wild ginseng industry in the state and concerns exist regarding the sustainability of continued wild extraction.  \u201cConservation through cultivation\u201d holds promise as a conservation pathway for this species, especially as a component of agroforestry land-use systems, yet there are many basic questions to answer to help facilitate this transition.  Accordingly, this study simultaneously investigated economic, socio-political, and ecological questions relating to forest-based production of ginseng in Pennsylvania.  An interdisciplinary approach involving a survey instrument, key informant interviews, facilitated discussions, field habitat studies and financial modeling was used between 2002 and 2009 to gather and develop information pertinent to managing, sustaining and/or expanding this industry through agroforestry cultivation.  Collectively, results from these data collection efforts indicate excellent potential for a \u201cconservation through cultivation\u201d approach to help conserve ginseng in Pennsylvania, while providing economic opportunities.  However, key challenges exist with regard to socio-political aspects of this transition.  Specifically, results suggest that a variety of husbandry activities are already used to produce \u201cwild\u201d ginseng, ranging from intensive \u201cforest farming\u201d to casual \u201cseed stocking\u201d in select forested areas.  This scenario presents a dilemma regarding interpretation of \u201cwild\u201d harvest data because current industry reporting mechanisms are insufficient to accommodate the complex range of husbandry practices used, and which often result in \u201cwild\u201d appearing roots.  In addition, this investigation found that many stakeholders, including those already growing ginseng on their forestlands, were concerned about \u201cgovernment management efforts\u201d to date.  Specifically, there is demand for more emphasis on proactive government conservation efforts including greater support for planting on forestlands and less emphasis on reactive tactics such as additional regulations and paperwork.  These and other related findings suggest government agencies such as the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR) should work to develop mechanisms and processes for improved (i.e., more accurate, less cumbersome) industry tracking and enforcement but that these efforts should be informed by stakeholders on a continuous basis through annual point-of-sale and industry contact to evaluate efficacy and elucidate any sources of discord that undermine public and industry compliance with management goals and programs.  The development of producer certification mechanisms could benefit all stakeholders if it successfully addresses the many existing \u201ctransparency\u201d issues surrounding the wild ginseng trade.  Finally, results from field studies of ginseng habitat in Pennsylvania indicate that a specific assemblage of floristic \u201cindicators\u201d can be used to help guide adoption on forestlands in the state, and that certain assemblages can provide additional forest products (e.g., maple syrup, timber) that can encourage ginseng husbandry on forestlands as part of an integrated forest stewardship opportunity emphasizing both economic and ecological diversity.

While the actions and goals of lobbyists appear to be straightforward, the lobbying tactics selected by lobbyists vary for different situations and in different contexts (Browne, 1985; Cook, 1998; Gladieux & Wolanin, 1974; Milbrath, 1960; Rosenthal, 1993).  One specific aspect of the state higher education context which has become more important for states in the management and performance of state higher education is its governance structure\u2014a formal organizational structure that provides oversight over public postsecondary education sectors and institutions (Hearn & Griswold, 1997; Richardson, Reeves Bracco, Callan, & Finney, 1998, 1999).  Additionally, there is some historical evidence that higher education governance structures may have an influence on lobbying (Hearn and Griswold, 1997).\n\nThis study explores the role that state higher education governance structures have on contemporary state-level higher education lobbying.  Using a multiple case study research design, interviews with state legislators, public higher education institution lobbyists, and education association lobbyists provide insight into which lobbying tactics are used under what conditions, including differences in state higher education governance structures (e.g., governing board, coordinating board, or planning board).  The research methodology also included a comparative lobbying pathway analysis\nwhereby lobbying tactics were pattern coded, mapped, and counted to compare the frequency of lobbying tactics selected under different conditions and to understand why tactics were selected and how state governance structures may have influenced the selection of tactics.  The issue of teacher preparation was initially selected as a higher education issue about which lobbying examples were provided by interviewees; however, most lobbying activity concerned appropriations and other institutional operational issues.\n\nThe findings indicate that there are more similarities in state higher education lobbying than there are differences among the three states included in the dissertation.  For all three states, most lobbying tactics decisions appear to be characterized by the following model: lobbyists (who implements) present policy arguments/institution\u2019s position (what lobbying action) via a face-to-face meeting (how implemented) with state legislators (whom to lobby).  Members of the state higher education governance boards, whether it is a governing board, coordinating board or planning board, are rarely lobbied.  The higher education issue of most concern is the level of state appropriations.  This is followed in importance by policies that impact the operation of public higher education institutions, like any other public entity.  Lobbying for K\u201312 teacher preparation is not done regularly.\n\nThe findings support both Milbrath\u2019s (1960, 1963) communication model of lobbying and Browne\u2019s (1985) roles model.  Aligned with Milbrath\u2019s (1960, 1963) communication model, the most prevalent higher education lobbying activities involved communicating with lobbyees.  Maintaining positive relationships with lobbyees is a critically important goal of lobbying for state higher education lobbyists, often taking precedence over successfully advancing the higher education institution\u2019s policy position.  The finding that contextual factors played a role in lobbying tactic selection decisions supports Browne\u2019s (1985) roles model.  The most important contextual factors included whether the state legislature or an entity within the state higher education governance structure had authority to determine the level of state appropriations, and the official position of the lobbyee.  Suggestions for future research include expanding the study by employing a research design and data collection and analysis techniques to include all 50 states, including lobbying conducted by private higher education institutions, and examining differences in how state executive personnel are lobbied when compared to state legislators.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3518], "author_name_tesi": "Burkum, Kurt Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Burkum", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Kurt", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson", "Robert M Hendrickson", "Patrick T Terenzini", "Dr Donald E Heller", "Jeremy Cohen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert M Hendrickson, Committee Chair", "Patrick T Terenzini, Committee Member", "Dr Donald E Heller, Committee Member", "Jeremy Cohen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["higher education governance structure", "lobbying"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Infiltration Mapping for Urban Environments\n", "id": "10129", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "685", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The comfort and safety of building occupants is the main consideration of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) design.  Infiltration, the unintentional transfer of air between the inside and outside environment, plays a large role in both the design of appropriate HVAC systems, and in the analysis of building safety during air contaminant events.  Traditional single zone models can predict infiltration for small buildings, but require testing of the building to determine a leakage characteristic.  The more advanced multi-zone models can predict infiltration and contaminant transport within buildings.  Although multi-zone models can be built based on typical elements, they usually do not perform well until they have been calibrated through trial and error to match test data.  The proposed resistance model builds from the multi-zone framework to develop a detailed model, suitable for buildings of all sizes, with the simplicity of a single zone model, for use as a design tool.  This is achieved by first developing theoretical relationships between building fenestration and area weighted building airflow resistance.  The area weighted building airflow resistance is then associated with the distribution of pressures on the building envelope to develop a single whole building resistance for the given boundary conditions.  Correction factors for the internal partitions of the building, including both floors and walls, are presented.  Additionally, an exploration of wind pressures specific for urban environments is explored.  New shelter factors for reducing building pressures based on urban environments are developed and presented.  In addition, recommendations for wind tunnel studies and numerical simulations to determine building wind pressures are given.  Finally, verification of the model is demonstrated through both comparison to data in the literature as well as experimentation on a medium sized office and classroom building.

This feeding strategy has the additional benefit of potentially reducing ammonia (NH3) emissions by lowering hen nitrogen (N) excretion. This dietary strategy was investigated under commercial conditions, based on the promising results of previous university scale studies. The objective was to establish if reduced CP, AA supplemented laying hen diets could maintain hen production performance, reduce feed costs, increase farm revenue, lower hen N excretion, and/or decrease NH3 emissions, compared to hens fed typical levels of CP, on a commercial scale.\nA total of 50,760 Lohmann LSL Lite laying hens were divided into three groups that were each fed diets containing different levels of CP and supplemented with limiting AAs to their required levels. Hens were housed in a high-rise facility with a deep-pit manure storage system. Each diet was fed to two out of the six total cage rows. Diets were corn-soybean meal based and least-cost formulated weekly based on current ingredient prices and nutrient concentrations. Hens were fed these diets ad libitum from 18 to 51 weeks of age (January 20, 2008-September 7, 2008). Diet C was a control diet formulated with the highest level of CP and was meant to represent a typical commercial laying hen diet. Diets B and A were formulated to contain intermediate and low levels of CP, respectively. \nWeekly diet formulations were examined to establish if diets were formulated to be isocaloric and AA balanced while also achieving the designed CP differences between diets. Monthly replicated data was collected at the front (F), middle (M), and end (E) of the feed trough for each cage row. Monthly samples and data included feed for CP, AA, and particle size analysis, hen body weight, egg weight, albumen height, Haugh units, yolk color, shell strength, shell thickness, and manure percent dry matter (DM), total N, ammonium (NH4+) N, organic N, phosphate (P2O5), potash (K2O), and NH3 flux. Weekly non-replicated production data and egg grade out results by dietary treatment were collected and reported by the producer. Weekly egg income, feed consumption, and feed prices were used to calculate weekly feed cost and egg income minus feed cost, e.g. farmer revenue. A 3 x 3 factorial analysis was performed using the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS\u00a9 software version 9.1 to detect differences between parameters by diet (A, B, and C), location on the feed trough (F, M, and E), and their interaction. Mean comparisons were made using Tukey\u2019s procedure.\nExamination of weekly diet formulations revealed that, overall, diets were isocaloric and AA balanced and that diets B and A were formulated at 0.85 and 1.40% less CP than diet C, respectively. Analyzed feed samples collected from within cage rows proved the diets to be AA balanced; however, overall, diets B and A were actually shown to contain 1.53% and 1.98% less CP than diet C, respectively; quite different than formulated CP differences between diets. \nFeed particle size analysis showed that the high CP diet consistently contained a numerically smaller proportion of large particles (2380-3360 \u00b5m) and larger proportion of small particles (840-1190 \u00b5m and 420-590 \u00b5m) than the lower CP diets throughout the eight month trial, however, these results were not statistically significant. Additionally, feed collected at the M location along the feed trough was made up of a greater proportion of large particles (>2380 \u00b5m) than feed collected from the F and/or E locations (P<0.05). \nHen body weight and egg weight were numerically lower for the low CP diet versus the two higher CP diets throughout the study, though these differences were not statistically significant. Hen day egg production averaged 87.9, 87.4 and 87.1% for diets A, B, and C, respectively, and albumen height, Haugh units, yolk color, shell strength, and shell thickness did not differ by dietary treatment. Diets A, B, and C consistently had the highest to lowest percentage of large, grade A eggs and lowest to highest percentages of extra-large and jumbo, grade A eggs, respectively, throughout the study. Hen body weights and egg weights were consistently lower at the M location on the feed trough compared to the F and/or E, while shell strength was numerically higher at the M than at the F and/or E throughout the trial, though these findings were not statistically significant. Additionally, overall, albumen height and Haugh units were shown to be significantly higher at the M than at the F and/or E (P<0.05). Yolk color and shell thickness did not differ by location on the feed trough.\nMean weekly egg income per hen housed for diet A was $0.0022 and $0.0024 less than for diets B and C, respectively. However, mean weekly feed costs per hen housed for diets A and B were $0.0083 and $0.0070 less than for diet C, respectively. The resulting weekly egg income minus feed costs per hen housed for diets A and B were $0.0059 and $0.0068 higher than for diet C, respectively.\nManure percent DM, total N, (NH4+) N, organic N, and P2O5 did not differ by dietary treatment; however, manure K2O was numerically lowest for the low CP diet and highest for the high CP diet consistently for seven out of the eight months of the trial. Additionally, manure percent DM, (NH4+) N, organic N, P2O5, and K2O did not differ by location on the feed trough; however, manure total N tended to be highest at the M and lowest at the F location along the feed trough. Manure ammonia flux increased each sampling period until it peaked at 97.41 mg/cm2/min in May and then decreased until rising again in September; however, ammonia flux did not differ by diet or location on along the feed trough. There were no significant interactions overall between diet and location along the feed trough for any manure components or NH3 flux.\nThis study found that when reduced CP, AA balanced diets were fed to a large scale commercial laying hen flock, it was possible to maintain hen production performance while reducing dietary costs and increasing farm revenue. However, it was also shown that this dietary strategy did not significantly influence ammonia flux or manure composition. These results indicate that although this dietary strategy may not be effective for reducing hen N excretion or NH3 emissions on a large scale basis, it would, however, be economically beneficial for producers to implement in commercial laying operations.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2191], "author_name_tesi": "Burley, Heather Kristin", "last_name_ssi": "Burley", "middle_name_ssi": "Kristin", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul H Patterson", "Paul H Patterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul H Patterson, Thesis Advisor", "Paul H Patterson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["commercial", "laying hens", "crude protein", "amino acids", "performance", "economics", "ammonia"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Enrichment of methionine from naturally concentrated feedstuffs for use in organic poultry diets", "id": "16111", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8036", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Methionine (Met) is an essential amino acid (AA) critical for poultry growth and production.

The research was conducted in the context of a large manufacturing facility, specifically a submarine shipyard, and is motivated by a real world application. The primary research objectives are to accurately model the system, develop effective specialized scheduling algorithms, and to develop an interactive multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology that accurately represents and reflects a decision maker's preferences.\n\nThe problem differs from the standard resource constrained scheduling problem in that we consider multiple projects, finite buffer space, recurring tasks, and multiple objectives. Multiple projects implies that projects may have different due dates and different relative importance. Finite buffer space can lead to blocking or forced idle time on spatial resources. Recurring tasks, such as preventative maintenance on resources, necessarily require different treatment than standard activities. Finally, multiple objectives requires a domain-appropriate methodology capable of capturing and reflecting the decision maker's preference structure.\n\nThe general goal of the methodology is to guide the user towards an acceptable non-dominated solution. Schedules are generated by applying a schedule generation scheme to a prioritized list of activities. Metaheuristic search are used to generate priority lists and schedule generation scheme parameter values. We implement a detection algorithm to avoid deadlock. We develop an interactive scheduling methodology that allows the user to articulate preferences and have those preferences reflected by the scheduling algorithm. In addition to numerical data we use value path plots and Gantt charts to convey information to the decision maker. \n\nThis research contributes to the literature in three ways. Firstly, we consider an innovative real world problem that has not been adequately addressed in the literature. It is an important problem and yields transferable results. We develop a model of the system that effectively captures the salient system characteristics. Secondly, we develop effective scheduling algorithms. Lastly, we develop an interactive solution methodology that allows the user to articulate preferences, view results, and adjust the preference structure and to have those preferences reflected in the scheduling procedure.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1998], "author_name_tesi": "Burnett, Gabriel August", "last_name_ssi": "Burnett", "middle_name_ssi": "August", "first_name_ssi": "Gabriel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah Jean Medeiros", "Deborah Jean Medeiros", "Mark Thomas Traband", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "John Messner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah Jean Medeiros, Dissertation Advisor", "Deborah Jean Medeiros, Committee Chair", "Mark Thomas Traband, Committee Chair", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Member", "John Messner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["project scheduling", "RCPSP", "multiple objective", "spatial resource", "MCRCMPSP-GPR/S"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "APPLYING SOCIOEMOTIONAL SELECTIVITY THEORY TO NURSING HOME RECREATION: SERVICES WHICH PROMOTE RESIDENTS\u2019 AND FAMILY/FRIENDS\u2019 AFFECTIVE WELL-BEING \n\n\n", "id": "9725", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5886", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The psychosocial well-being of older adults living in nursing homes and the people they are close to is of increasing concern.  Nursing home residents demonstrate high rates of loneliness and depression while close family members report feelings of role ambiguity and stress.  These issues will become increasingly important as the number of residents rises dramatically.  To partially address residents\u2019 psychosocial needs, nursing homes that receive federal funds are required by law to provide meaningful and appropriate recreation services.  A primary strategy that recreation providers use to meet residents\u2019 psychosocial needs is to promote new relationships among them through group programs.  While this approach may facilitate some supportive relationships, it also promotes meaningless and detrimental ones as well.  Moreover, it omits relationships that are most important to residents-- those with close family members and old friends.  The liberal use of resident-centered groups is consistent with activity theory, the predominant theoretical framework for recreation services in nursing homes.  This theory suggests that high rates of interaction promote affective well-being.  Activity theory, however, has been strongly criticized as empirically weak and simplistic.  A newer and more empirically robust theory of social interaction, socioemotional selectivity, appears to provide a stronger framework for promoting psychosocial well-being in residents.  It suggests that, as time left to cultivate relationships ebbs, affective well-being is associated with contact with important people, not simply frequent interactions.  This study examined the relevance of socioemotional selectivity theory to recreation services in nursing homes and explored ways in which it could be used to address the psychosocial needs of residents and their close family/friends.  There were four major findings.  First, in accordance with socioemotional selectivity theory, residents tended to be very close to family and old friends.  While Fung and Carstensen (2004) suggested that very close relationships serve two functions, they provide emotional social support and are emotionally meaningful, in this study they were closely associated with emotional social support.  Second, at recreation groups, residents generally did not interact with people from whom they received emotional social support.   Therefore, justifying the provision of programs to groups of residents as a way to reduce feelings of loneliness and depression may be erroneous.  Furthermore, in accordance with socioemotional selectivity theory, residents and family friends indicated that desirable forms of interaction excluded other residents.  Third, one variable associated with socioemotional selectivity theory, satisfaction with social contacts in groups, appeared to be very influential in predicting group attendance and a factor comprised of activities that were social in nature or involved outings.  Fourth, family/friends reported greater freedom to interact with nursing home residents than previously reported by Friedemann and colleagues (1997).  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5882], "author_name_tesi": "Burnett-Wolle, Sarah ", "last_name_ssi": "Burnett-Wolle", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Geoffrey Clay Godbey", "Ann Marie Kolanowski", "Alan R Graefe", "Ralph Welby Smith", "Melissa Hardy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Geoffrey Clay Godbey, Committee Chair", "Ann Marie Kolanowski, Committee Member", "Alan R Graefe, Committee Member", "Ralph Welby Smith, Committee Member", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Family", "Affective Well-Being", "Recreation", "Leisure", "Nursing Home", "Socioemotional Selectivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Seed Life Expectancy: The Spermosphere, Defense Chemistry, and Weed Recruitment\n", "id": "12303", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4005", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Plant seeds may remain dormant in the soil for extended periods of time, creating soil seed banks that contribute to the perpetuation of plant species. Weed seed banks can create weed management challenges for farmers, and reduction of these seed banks could become an important piece of an effective weed management strategy. A better understanding of the seed-soil-microbe interactions in the soil could help develop effective seed bank management tools. This study focuses on phenolic acid, short aliphatic organic acid, and long-chain fatty acid changes within dormant wild oat (Avena fatua L.) seeds and the surrounding soil (spermosphere) as the seed imbibes, and on seed defense mechanisms used to protect against harmful soil microorganisms. It is hypothesized that during imbibition, the seed will experience a loss of compounds from soluble chemical fractions, and this loss will be quantifiable in the seed and surrounding soil. In addition, it is hypothesized that during fungal attack, the seed will elevate the levels of defense compounds, especially those bound to the cell wall. During imbibition, wild oat hull chemical composition and short aliphatic concentration were most affected, with soluble short aliphatic concentration decreasing 69% in the hulls and 62% in the caryopses. Free phenolic concentration decreased 77% in concentration in the hulls. The spermosphere is likely composed of phenolics and short aliphatics, which may have varying effects on the surrounding soil ecology. When exposed for 3d to Fusarium avenaceum and F. culmorum, the greatest defense response observed in wild oat seeds was a substantial accumulation (40%-650%) of soluble-fraction phenolics in the caryopses. Soluble-fraction short aliphatics also increased substantially (up to 1800%) in caryopses. Some increase in phenolic concentration occurred in the seed hulls. Insoluble cell wall-bound fractions exhibited no change, and treatments at little effect on long-chain fatty acid concentration.

PPAR alpha is phosphorylated by multiple kinases which differentially regulate its activity. Computational analysis of PPAR alpha revealed 5 potential glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) phosphorylation sites. GSK3 is a key enzyme involved in glycogen metabolism, and is important for signaling by insulin, growth factors, and nutrients. It was hypothesized that PPAR alpha is a substrate for GSK3 phosphorylation and this association is involved in fasting mediated homeostasis. PPAR alpha is phosphorylated by GSK3 beta, primarily at serine-73 in the A/B domain of rat PPAR alpha. This residue is conserved across PPAR alpha species including humans. The regulation of PPAR alpha target gene expression was affected by manipulating GSK3 activity via chemical inhibitors and specific RNA inhibitors (RNAis). We also demonstrated an increased turnover and ubiquitination of PPAR alpha with the over-expression of GSK3 beta, presumably the result of increased PPAR alpha phosphorylation. In addition to GSK3 affecting PPAR alpha activity, it has been noted that ligands for this nuclear receptor, the peroxisome proliferators, influence GSK3 alpha and GSK3 beta expression and activity. The adaptive response in the liver to fasting involves both PPAR alpha and GSK3. Thus, mice subjected to fasting represents an ideal, physiologically-relevant model system to explore PPAR alpha and GSK3 activity and their confluence. Fatty acid metabolism genes, such as Acyl CoA Oxidase (ACO), the bifunctional enzyme (BIEN), and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (thiolase) were increased during fasting in wild-type (PPAR alpha +/+) but not in PPAR alpha knockout (PPAR alpha -/-) mice. GSK3 alpha was increased at the mRNA and protein level, while GSK3 beta was decreased at the phosphospecific level by fasting in wild-type mice. Two potential mechanistic links between PPAR alpha activation upon fasting and GSK3 expression and activity were examined, Tribbles 3 (TRB3) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). TRB3 is a fasting inducible inhibitor of the serine-threonine kinase AKT/PKB and PGC-1 alpha is a ligand inducible coactivator for PPAR alpha involved in the control of cellular energy metabolic pathways. In contrast to previously published results, TRB3 was not differentially regulated by fasting in wild-type or PPAR alpha -/- mice at the mRNA or protein level. However, PGC-1 alpha mRNA levels were increased upon fasting, and unexpectedly, the levels were increased in a PPAR alpha-dependent manner. This establishes a novel regulation of PGC-1 alpha that is dependent on the expression of PPAR alpha during fasting. This thesis has demonstrated that PPAR alpha is a substrate for GSK3 beta phosphorylation that causes increased ubiquitination and turnover of PPAR alpha, and that PPAR alpha, GSK3 alpha/beta, and PGC-1 alpha are coordinately regulated during a 24 hr fast in the murine model. These studies reveal how these pathways converge and are not only important for understanding what occurs during fasting, but may also be used to further study other metabolic states, namely insulin resistance. Clearer understanding of the interconnectedness of PPAR alpha, GSK3 alpha/beta, and PGC-1 alpha can ultimately aid in how metabolic syndrome and other related diseases are approached and treated.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3287], "author_name_tesi": "Burns, Katherine Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Burns", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Donna Hope Korzick", "Gary H Perdew", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Donna Hope Korzick, Committee Member", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fasting", "phosphorylation", "GSK3", "PPARalpha"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Conceptualizing Supervision in the Professional Development School Context: A Case Analysis", "id": "14536", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7153", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study is a qualitative case study of the first year experience of a novice supervisor in a Professional Development School (PDS) context.

Recently, there has been a national effort to improve the quality of services to virtually all customers of the federal government.  This customer satisfaction effort includes the provision of recreation by federal agencies, such as the US Army Corps of Engineers, the National Park Service, and the USDA Forest Service.  \nThe purpose of this study was to further explore the nature of customer satisfaction at US Army Corps of Engineers outdoor recreation settings.  A set of customer service-related research questions was developed to understand the complex issue of customer satisfaction.  These questions focused on three distinct levels of customer satisfaction: satisfaction items, satisfaction domains, and overall satisfaction.  The first research question examined recreationists\u2019 importance and performance levels across a battery of 19 satisfaction attributes.  Both gap scores (difference between importance and performance level) and performance-only items were analyzed to determine their relationship within their respective satisfaction domain and their relationship with overall satisfaction.  The next research question involved the relationship of the four domains (facilities, services, information, and recreation experience) under which the 19 importance/performance items fell.  The purpose of this question was to examine the relationship between the items and the four domains and the role of each of the satisfaction domains in predicting overall satisfaction.  The final level of analysis focused on a single-item, 10 point measure of overall satisfaction.  The 19 importance/performance items and the four domains were compared against this measure as an indication of overall trip satisfaction.  Furthermore, respondents were segmented into distinct user group categories (ramp use, camping, and day use), as well as socio-demographic sub-groups to determine if there were differences in satisfaction models for these different groups of recreationists.  \nThis study was delimited to water-based recreationists who were 18 years or older at ten US Army Corps of Engineers managed lakes across the United States.  Just under 3000 face-to-face interviews were conducted during the 1997 summer recreation season (Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend).  \nOverall, participants demonstrated a high degree of satisfaction with the Corps facilities, services, information, and with their recreation experience.  The performance-only measures were found to be significantly better indicators of overall satisfaction than  the gap sores, and the items were strongly correlated to the four satisfaction domains.  The four domains were significant predictors of overall satisfaction and proved to be strong mediators of the satisfaction items in predicting overall trip satisfaction.  \nThere was a relationship between a respondent\u2019s self-selected primary activity (ramp use, camping, or day use) and overall satisfaction, with slightly significant differences noted between those groups.  However, there was no relationship between the socio-demographic and trip characteristic variables and overall satisfaction.\nThe model of customer satisfaction tested in this study proved to be a valid method of measuring recreational customer satisfaction in water-based outdoor recreation models.  Deeply rooted in both the recreation and marketing literature, the model appears to be transferable to other recreation settings (indoor facilities, commercial recreation settings, etc.).  This holds promise that there may be an easily understood model of customer satisfaction that may be used by managers to attempt to positively impact the overall satisfaction of recreationists.  Further research is needed to verify the appropriate items and domains for different settings and market segments, to ensure that the 10-point satisfaction scale is an adequate measure of overall satisfaction for recreationists across the spectrum of recreational opportunities available, and to better understand the mediation role of the four satisfaction domains related to overall trip satisfaction.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5098], "author_name_tesi": "Burns, Robert Clyde", "last_name_ssi": "Burns", "middle_name_ssi": "Clyde", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Leisure Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan R Graefe", "Robert D Lee", "Dr C Gregory Knight", "Dr Harry C Zinn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan R Graefe, Committee Chair", "Robert D Lee, Committee Member", "Dr C Gregory Knight, Committee Member", "Dr Harry C Zinn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["segmentation", "methodology", "customer satisfaction", "recreation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Grain size controls on planform morphology and stratigraphy of river-dominated deltas", "id": "16353", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8246", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The proportions of sand and mud that make up a river-dominated delta strongly determine its topset morphology, which in turn controls its internal facies and clinoforms.

We used Delft3D to simulate nine self-formed deltas having different sediment loads and critical shear stresses required for re-entrainment of mud.  The deltas prograded into a shallow basin absent of waves, tides, Coriolis forcing, and buoyancy.  Model results indicate that sand-dominated deltas are more fan-shaped and mud-dominated deltas are more bird\u2019s foot in planform because the sand-dominated deltas have more active distributaries and a smaller variance of topset elevations, and thereby experience more equitable distribution of sediment to their perimeters.  This results in a larger proportion of channel facies and autogenic parasequences in sand-dominated deltas, and more uniformly-distributed clinoform dip directions, steeper dips, and greater clinoform concavity.  These conclusions are consistent with data collected from the Goose River Delta, a coarse-grained fan delta prograding into Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada.

Traditionally, root traits have represented an underutilized area in plant breeding, due to the complex effects of the environment on growth, and the fact that in situ observation of root systems is challenging.  Phenotypic screening is used to identify complex combinations of traits that collectively hold agronomic value, and to characterize the range of variation in those traits.  The ability to make accurate and rapid measurements of root traits could lead to their use as a focus in plant breeding.  My research has been based on high-throughput phenotypic screening of root anatomical and architectural traits that influence the cost of root growth and maintenance, and identification of the loci controlling these traits within the genome.  \nThe three-dimensional shape of the root system is known as root architecture, and is determined by traits such as root length, diameter, branching and growth angle.  Root architecture influences the placement of roots within the soil, thereby affecting the ability of the plant to intercept resources. Genetically controlled variation exists in root architecture, and is directly related to differences in plant performance between genotypes.   A primary difference among architectures is the way in which carbon is allocated across root classes, because each root class has a different metabolic cost and role.  Efficient use of carbon allows for new growth and deployment of roots into previously unexplored soil domains, and has been shown by others to assist in edaphic stress tolerance.  \nAnatomical traits are defined by the internal structure of the plant, and the arrangement of cells and tissues.  Anatomical root traits such as the size of the cortex, and the number and arrangement of cells and cell files, determine the pathway and rate of nutrient movement from the soil to the vascular cylinder.  The number and area of xylem vessels influence the rate of water movement from the roots to the shoots.  Root cost is affected by anatomical factors such as cell wall area, cell density, and the relative amount of respiring and non-respiring tissue, and therefore the carbon resources available to allow deployment of new roots into the soil.   \nMy research has focused on the anatomical root trait of aerenchyma in maize (Zea mays).  Lysigenous aerenchyma forms in the maize root cortex following programmed death of dispensable parenchyma cells, resulting in replacement of these cells with air-filled channels.  While it is typically associated with flood-induced hypoxia, enhanced aerenchyma formation has been shown to occur in response to other edaphic stresses, including nutrient and water deficiency.  Loss of cortical cells during aerenchyma formation has been previously correlated with reductions in root respiration, resulting in metabolic savings on tissue maintenance over the course of a growing season.  The rate, extent and location of aerenchyma formation are likely to affect the cost of growth and maintenance, as well as metabolic savings resulting from cell death.  Root systems that economize on the metabolic cost of tissue maintenance have greater resources for enhanced growth into new soil domains. \nMy results show that aerenchyma formation varies significantly among genotypes, root classes and sampling positions in maize.  Patterns in root architecture and anatomy were identified between maize landraces and accessions of the maize ancestor, teosinte, as well as among three recombinant inbred populations of maize.  Finally, quantitative trait loci were identified for a variety of architectural and anatomical root traits in the three recombinant inbred populations.  Knowledge of phenotypic trait variation, and the genetic basis of those traits, offers information to assist plant breeders in the development of carbon-economizing root systems for enhanced resource acquisition.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [207], "author_name_tesi": "Burton, Amy  L.", "last_name_ssi": "Burton", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Amy ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan M Brown", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Dawn S Luthe", "David Robert Huff"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan M Brown, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Chair", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Chair", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member", "David Robert Huff, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["root", "plant architecture", "aerenchyma", "maize"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "\u201cMORE THAN ENTERTAINMENT\u201d: THE ROLE OF SATIRICAL NEWS IN DISSENT, DELIBERATION, AND DEMOCRACY\n", "id": "11542", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5614", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research project argues that in an age of infotainment and a failing news media, satirical news has emerged as an important force in revealing truth and engaging an apathetic public in politics and debate. Therefore, this research project seeks to distinguish and examine the roles of satirical news in encouraging a deliberative democracy. Satirical news has historical roots in the First Amendment as a loud critic and purveyor of political dissent. More recently, satirical news shows on television\u2014the precursors to The Daily Show\u2014have faced many barriers, including political party maneuverings, ratings, and falling advertising revenue, ultimately finding that if staying power required potent satire, such roadblocks must be ignored.  Finally, political comedians intend to affect change or prove an ideological point through their satire, but often after criticism, hide behind the satirist shield and claim, \"I'm just a comedian.\" Such a stance has benefits in that it encourages comedians to more fearlessly challenge pseudo-structures created by the political-media elites, filling the role traditionally held by journalists. At the same time, the satirist shield allows politicians and media elites to throw satirical news critiques aside, regardless of their truth and importance. In the end, satirical news is certainly important to democracy. If those in power fail to recognize satire's significance, they must be either forgetting or ignoring the First Amendment's purpose of encouraging robust and free debate. Such debate and discourse, fueled by the rearrangement power structures and the invocation of indignation, are necessary outcomes of satirical speech. These distinct roles of satirical news serve a theoretical basis for legitimizing the impact of such shows on the creation of an informed citizenry.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5604], "author_name_tesi": "Burton, Sarah J", "last_name_ssi": "Burton", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Media Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Martin Halstuk", "Martin Halstuk", "Matthew Frank Jordan", "Robert Dwayne Richards"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Martin Halstuk, Thesis Advisor", "Martin Halstuk, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew Frank Jordan, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Dwayne Richards, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["discussion", "debate", "deliberative democracy", "mediaocracy", "infotainment", "role", "criticism", "dissent", "First Amendment", "history", "legal research", "ethnography", "The Colbert Report", "The Daily Show", "fake news", "satirical news", "deliberation", "entertainment", "politics", "media", "intentions", "comedy", "comedians", "satire"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Life history of Pterostichus melanarius (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and its importance for biological control in field crops", "id": "s4655g560", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12875", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Pterostichus melanarius (Coleoptera: Carabidae) is a Palearctic generalist predator native to Europe that was introduced to North America in the 1920\u2019s and has since become widespread in the United States. This beetle is non-native to the U.S., yet appears to have little to no negative effect on native carabids and is a critical natural enemy in agricultural systems, especially because it feeds on the invasive gray garden slug Deroceras reticulatum. My thesis begins with a review that compiles in one publication the details of P. melanarius distribution, life history, diet, and factors that influence its populations. I used ecological niche modeling to determine the current potential range of P. melanarius in the United States and found that annual mean temperature and precipitation of the driest month were the most important factors to determine probable habitat suitability.\nMy second chapter investigates the effects of crop rotation and integrated pest management on pests and natural enemies in no-till cropping systems in central Pennsylvania. Overall, I found that diversified rotations that implemented continuous crop cover with perennial forages and cover crops and incorporated IPM enhanced the abundance of natural enemies early in the growing season and can suppress pests to similar levels attained by simple rotations managed with Bt hybrids, pesticidal seed treatments, and prophylactic pesticide application. I also found that protecting and increasing carabid abundance, especially P. melanarius, is important for slug control and can be achieved by reducing tillage, increasing crop species diversity, and using integrated pest management. \nLastly, I examined the predator-prey relationship between ground beetles and slugs by investigating non-consumptive effects of P. melanarius on D. reticulatum behavior and physiology. I found that combined physical and chemical cues of P. melanarius induced fear behavior in D. reticulatum that resulted in increased hiding and decreased foraging by D. reticulatum. Due to the ineffectiveness of radioimmunoassays, I could not determine a physiological fear response.

In an effort to balance the municipal budget, numerous city services have been cut, one of which is park maintenance. Detroit has made the decision to decommission nearly 1,600 acres of park space and reposition nearly 550 acres of park space, leaving it to become overgrown and, at first glance, unusable for residents. This research accepts the reality of Detroit\u2019s currently unsustainable park management costs, looks at the methodology of this decommissioning, and determines if and to what degree social and ecological factors were taken into account. The extent to which Detroit considered social/demographic characteristics was evaluated through Geographic Information System (GIS) \u2013based analysis. I hypothesized that the city of Detroit chose to decommission parks based solely on maintenance costs in an unsystematic way and did not readily consider social/demographic characteristics. This research proposes a new strategy for decommissioning parks that takes into account social issues, in particular by taking into account the needs of populations identified as at risk. These user groups comprised people aged 15 and under or aged 65 and over, based on an assumption that these population cohorts have a greater need for public space and limited access them. Next, ecological characteristics were considered. Characteristics such as tree cover, soil condition, and proximity to water were prioritized as general characteristics to consider for ecosystem services potential because they are relatively easy to measure and could have important implications for the city of Detroit. Areas ranking high in regard to these characteristics could be decommissioned and would require little or no management yet still provide valuable ecosystem services. This analysis resulted in the identification of two distinct types of parks: parks primarily for people and parks primarily for ecology. This dichotomy was developed based on the city of Detroit\u2019s own two-park classification system: this research simply modified Detroit\u2019s existing system. This two-fold strategy was implemented to provide social benefits to the people who need them most and to determine which parks had the most potential to provide ecosystem services to the city. The overarching goal of this strategy is to produce a more cost-effective method for decommissioning parks, one whereby they will still provide benefits to the people of the city.\u2003", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8519], "author_name_tesi": "Bush, Erik Ryan", "last_name_ssi": "Bush", "middle_name_ssi": "Ryan", "first_name_ssi": "Erik", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Landscape Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean Burkholder", "Larry James Gorenflo", "Kenneth Tamminga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sean Burkholder, Thesis Advisor", "Larry James Gorenflo, Thesis Advisor", "Kenneth Tamminga, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Revitalization", "Urban Greening", "Parks", "Park Management", "Urban", "Detroit", "Ecosystem Services", "Social Benefit"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Role of the Uridine Diphosphate Glucuronosyltransferase 2a Family in Tobacco Carcinogen Metabolism", "id": "15808", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8006", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Tobacco use is considered the most preventable cause of death in the world today, with tobacco-related cancers causing millions of deaths annually. Environmental and genetic factors are known to impact cancer susceptibility, and using environmental exposure and/or genetic information to identify a subset of individuals at high-risk for developing tobacco-related cancers has the potential to save many lives. Inter-individual differences in enzymes that activate and metabolize carcinogens are thought to influence cancer risk. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are phase II detoxifying enzymes that play a critical role in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds, including multiple classes of tobacco carcinogens. The effects of coding and non-coding SNPs on UGT activity have been analyzed for many UGT isoforms, and multiple UGT variants have been determined to be significantly associated with cancer risk. \n     The entire UGT2A family has been neglected in prior research studies, with UGT2A tissue expression and enzyme activities relatively unknown. With recent reports suggesting UGT2A1 expression in the lung and trachea and UGT2A1 glucuronidation activity against simple polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) substrates, the overall hypothesis of this research project was that UGT2A1 detoxifies PAH carcinogens in target organs for tobacco carcinogenesis. Due to the sequence homology between all UGT2A enzymes, and with little information reported on UGT2A2 or UGT2A3, we also hypothesized that UGT2A2 and UGT2A3 enzymes are involved in extra-hepatic tobacco carcinogen metabolism. \n     An initial set of experiments was completed to characterize the role of UGT2A1 in tobacco carcinogen metabolism. Quantitative real-time PCR showed highest relative UGT2A1 expression in the lung, followed by trachea > tonsil > larynx > colon. Significant UGT2A1 glucuronidation activity was observed against a variety of PAHs, including the proximate carcinogens benzo(a)pyrene(B(a)P)-7,8-diol, dibenzo(a,l)pyrene-11,12-diol, and 5-methylchrysene-1,2-diol. No UGT2A1 glucuronidation activity was observed against additional classes of tobacco carcinogens, including tobacco specific nitrosamines or heterocyclic amines. In vitro experiments suggested that UGT2A1 over-expression in a HEK293 cell system prevents B(a)P-mediated cytotoxicity and covalent binding. These data suggested that UGT2A1 is an important detoxification enzyme in the metabolism of PAHs within aerodigestive and respiratory tract tissues.\n     The next set of experiments focused on characterizing two prevalent UGT2A1 non-synonymous coding SNPs, the UGT2A175Lys and UGT2A1308Arg variants. The UGT2A175Arg variant exhibited a significant (p<0.05) ~25% decrease in glucuronidation activity (Vmax/KM) against all PAH substrates examined compared to wild-type UGT2A175Lys activity, while no detectable glucuronidation activity was observed for the UGT2A1308Arg variant against all substrates examined. Results from a lung cancer case-control study showed the inactive UGT2A1308Arg variant to be significantly associated with lung non-small cell carcinoma (p=0.04) and lung squamous cell carcinoma risk (p=0.02). A significant decrease (p<0.001) in wild-type UGT2A1 activity against multiple PAH substrates was observed following UGT2A1308Arg co-expression with wild-type UGT2A1 at approximately a 1:1 ratio. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed dimerization between wild-type UGT2A1 and UGT2A1308Arg. The decrease in wild-type UGT2A1 activity following UGT2A1308Arg co-expression is a novel regulatory mechanism for UGT2A1 and may have implications on cancer risk. \n     In the initial cloning of UGT2A1 from human lung RNA a novel UGT2A1 exon 3 deletion splice variant was identified (termed UGT2A1\u0394exon3), and subsequent studies were completed to characterize the expression and function UGT2A1\u0394exon3 and the corresponding UGT2A1_i2 protein. Through qualitative PCR, UGT2A1\u0394exon3 was shown to be expressed in various tissues including lung, trachea, larynx, tonsil, and colon. The ratio of UGT2A1\u0394exon3:wild-type UGT2A1 expression was highest in colon (0.79 \u00b1 0.08) and lung (0.42 \u00b1 0.12). An antibody specific to UGT2A1 revealed the ratio of UGT2A1_i2:UGT2A1_i1 protein expression in lung and colon homogenates to be 0.5-0.9. UGT2A1_i2 exhibited no glucuronidation activity against a variety of substrates, including PAHs such as 1-hydroxy-pyrene and B(a)P-7,8-diol. An inducible in vitro system was created to determine the effect of UGT2A1_i2 co-expression on wild-type UGT2A1_i1 activity. Increasing UGT2A1_i2 levels resulted in a significant (p<0.01) decrease in UGT2A1_i1 activity (Vmax) against 1-hydroxy-pyrene, 3-OH-B(a)P and B(a)P-7,8-diol. Co-IP experiments suggested the formation of UGT2A1_i1 and UGT2A1_i2 hetero-oligomeric complexes and UGT2A1_i1 homo-oligomeric complexes. These data suggested that a novel exon 3 deletion UGT2A1 splice variant specifically regulates UGT2A1-mediated glucuronidation activity via protein-protein interactions, and that expression of this variant could impact the local detoxification of carcinogens. \n     The final set of experiments described in this dissertation focused on determining the functions of UGT2A2 and UGT2A3 in the local metabolism of tobacco carcinogens. UGT2A2 was determined to be expressed in the trachea and larynx, and a novel splice variant of UGT2A2 lacking exon 3 (UGT2A2\u0394exon3) was identified. UGT2A3 was determined to be expressed a variety of extra-hepatic tissues, with UGT2A3 well expressed in the colon, lung, tonsil, trachea, and larynx. Cell homogenates prepared from HEK293 cells over-expressing UGT2A2\u0394exon3 had no detectable glucuronidation activity against all substrates examined. Cell homogenates prepared from HEK293 cells over-expressing UGT2A2 and UGT2A3 showed activity against simple PAHs. Both UGT2A2 and UGT2A3 were determined to have no detectable activity against complex PAH proximate carcinogens, tobacco specific nitrosamines, or heterocyclic amines. Data presented here suggested UGT2A2 and UGT2A3 are both expressed in various aerodigestive and respiratory tract tissues; however, these enzymes lack enzyme activity against PAH proximate carcinogens. \n     This dissertation has laid the groundwork for understanding the physiological role of UGT2A enzymes in the local detoxification of PAH tobacco carcinogens. Results presented in this dissertation suggest that UGT2A1 is a major metabolizer of PAH carcinogens in the lung and other target tissues for tobacco carcinogenesis. UGT2A1 coding SNPs and a novel UGT2A1\u0394exon3 splice variant were characterized for the first time in this study. Results presented here suggest that the UGT2A1308Arg variant is associated with increased lung cancer risk, and we propose that inter-individual variability in UGT2A1\u0394exon3 expression may also impact cancer risk. Although additional work is needed to confirm these findings, results presented in this dissertation suggest that UGT2A1 variants negatively regulate wild-type UGT2A1 activity and may play a role in tobacco-related cancer susceptibility.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7954], "author_name_tesi": "Bushey, Ryan Taylor", "last_name_ssi": "Bushey", "middle_name_ssi": "Taylor", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip Lazarus", "Shantu G Amin", "John Ellis", "Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Thomas E Spratt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Philip Lazarus, Dissertation Advisor", "Shantu G Amin, Committee Member", "John Ellis, Committee Member", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["UDP-glucuronosyltransferase", "tobacco carcinogen metabolism", "single nucleotide polymorphism", "alternate splicing", "UGT regulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Biogeochemical Weathering of Iron-Silicate Minerals", "id": "7146", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2214", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the Rio Icacos watershed of Puerto Rico, which has one of the fastest documented chemical weathering rates of granitic rock in the world, the quartz diorite bedrock weathers spheroidally, producing a 0.2-2 m thick interface of partially weathered rock layers called rindlets. Plagioclase dissolution and biotite oxidation are the first observable weathering reactions in this system although it remains unknown which of these reactions occurs first. Dissolution of plagioclase produces porosity and may retard dissolution of other silicate minerals within the rindlet zone. Biotite weathering occurs in two stages: by oxidation within the rindlet zone and by alteration to kaolinite within the saprolite. Within a 0.07 m zone near the rindlet-saprolite interface, we document the fastest rate of hornblende dissolution in the field ever reported: 6.0 x 10-13 mol m-2 s-1. \nThe release of Fe(II) during hornblende dissolution supports the growth of iron-oxidizing bacteria at depth in the Rio Icacos saprolite. Fixation of CO2 by these bacteria supports growth of heterotrophic bacteria. A conceptual model is presented to quantify the effect of Fe(II) release during bedrock weathering on the microbial population at depth in the saprolite. By consuming Fe(II) and O2, iron-oxidizing bacteria may affect spheroidal fracturing, which is likely driven by diffusion of O2 into the bedrock and oxidation of Fe-silicate minerals.\nMicrobial populations also affect the mechanisms and rates of mineral weathering via the production of organic moieties that interact with mineral surfaces. Spectroscopic and microscopic techniques were utilized to investigate Fe-silicate glass surfaces after incubation with siderophores, extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), and/or under colonies of bacteria. Siderophores enhanced release of Fe, Al, and Si. Release of these elements was greatest in the presence of both EPS and siderophores, but negligible in the presence of EPS alone. Siderophore-exposed surfaces contained widespread, small etch pits and greater surface roughness than bacteria-exposed surfaces, which contained fewer, localized, larger etch pits. This is the first documented case in which mineral surface pitting by siderophores has been observed. Small acidic molecules released from the EPS may have shuttled Fe from the surfaces to the siderophores, enhancing general dissolution.

Recent research has found that parent conflict is also related to atypical physiological regulation in infants, suggesting that potential effects of parent conflict on immature regulatory systems during infancy may explain childhood outcomes. Because infants rely on their caregivers for external regulation during the first year of life, one way conflict could affect infant regulation is through effects on parent-infant dyadic regulation. In a sample of 6-month-old infants and their mothers (N = 52), this study investigated dyadic flexibility, a novel measure of dyadic regulation, as a mediator of the relation between parent conflict and infant vagal regulation during a mild social stressor (the Face-to-Face Still Face). Dyads with mothers reporting higher conflict were less flexible in the reunion episode of the FFSF, and infants of these dyads exhibited less vagal reactivity in the reunion episode, suggesting less effective recovery and greater need to engage in physiological self-regulation. A test of mediation found that conflict was related to infant vagal reactivity through an indirect effect on dyadic flexibility during the reunion episode.

This study will supplement the scarcity of research available on the effect of advisory programs at the high school level.  This is a qualitative study which utilized the intensive case study as the research methodology.  Data collection sources included interviews, observations, and document analysis.  Interviews were conducted with five teachers, six counselors, twenty-five students, the building principal, and the program coordinator.  The researcher conducted interviews during an intensive one-week visitation period; however ongoing data collection occurred over a three-month time frame.  Cite selection was accomplished through a pre-study principal survey combined with the reputation of the school\u2019s advisory program.  The primary research questions included in this study were, (1) what is the impact of an effective advisory program, and (2) what structural, cultural and content/theme components are present that contributed to the efficacy of the program.  Several important conclusions were drawn from this study.  First, teacher support and willingness coupled with building-wide enthusiasm and excitement around a compelling need for the program was imperative.  An advisory program will be ineffective and stagnant without such support.  Teachers and students must be committed to the program and its success.  If this element is present it propagates a favorable relationship between the student/advocate and the benefits to the school and its students are unlimited.  The student/advocate relationship was the cornerstone of the program and all efforts were focused on nurturing this relationship.  Second, whereas the impact for the students in the effective advocacy groups was clearly positive, the effects on the larger school environment were negligible.  The students and advocates reported that the impact on the individual student was measurably greater than the school as a whole.  In fact, there was conclusive evidence that some advocacy groups were functioning at a high level while others were stagnant and under-performed.  Third, the advisory program affected the professional preparation time required by the teachers.  The effective advocates had to devise activities beyond the scripted plans to include activities and curriculum more specifically suited for their advisory group.  The effective advocates reported that the program required extra planning to ensure the success of their advisory sessions.  The teachers believed the preparation element was overlooked during the implementation phase and that little to no effort had been exerted to address this issue.  Fourth, whereas the school thoughtfully planned scripted lessons for advisory, such activities were of less value to the advocates and students than the activities planned by the advocates that were more specifically designed for the needs of each advocacy group.  With the exception of the academic progress checks and some college preparatory activities the scripted lessons were deemed invaluable and lacked relevance.  The findings from this study augment the literature currently available on the effect of advisory/advocacy programs in large high schools by studying the structural and cultural attributes of effective advocacy groups.  Further study is recommended in the area of teacher preparation for the role of advocate versus teacher (as content specialist) and how schools might better equip teachers of varying experience for this unconventional role, particularly at the high school level.                            \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [935], "author_name_tesi": "Butler, Craig Brian", "last_name_ssi": "Butler", "middle_name_ssi": "Brian", "first_name_ssi": "Craig", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nona Ann Prestine", "Nona Ann Prestine", "William Hartman", "Shannon Patrick", "Bernard Joel Badiali"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nona Ann Prestine, Dissertation Advisor", "Nona Ann Prestine, Committee Chair", "William Hartman, Committee Member", "Shannon Patrick, Committee Member", "Bernard Joel Badiali, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["School Climate", "Mentor", "Advocate", "Advocacy Group", "Variability"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Human Resources and Reduced Hours\n", "id": "9756", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1835", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this research is to discover how often Human Resource professionals use reduced hour policies and how much HR professionals desire to use these policies.

We employ the NASA Parameterized Chemistry Tracer Model (PCTM) for atmospheric transport and a modified version of the inversion used by the Atmospheric Tracer Transport Model Intercomparison Project (TransCom) with sub-continental resolution and annual variability of transport. We sub-sample carbon dioxide time series at four North American flux tower sites for mid-day hours to ensure sampling of a deep, well-mixed atmospheric boundary layer. The addition of these flux tower sites to a global network reduces North America mean annual flux uncertainty for 2001-2003 by 15% to 0.4 Pg C yr-1 compared to a network without the tower sites. North American flux is estimated to be a net sink of 1.3 Pg C yr-1, within the uncertainty bounds of the result without the towers. Uncertainty reduction is found to be local to the regions within North America where the flux towers are located. Including the towers reduces covariances between regions within North America. We estimated potential future uncertainty reduction with simulated observations at North American sites that are now or planned to be instrumented for suitable carbon dioxide measurements.\nWe also tested a micrometeorological adjustment to surface carbon dioxide measurements to approximate mid-continental-boundary-layer measurements. This adjustment can be calculated during mid-day hours using atmospheric measurements commonly available at flux tower sites. The atmospheric transport models used in global atmospheric inversions often do not have sufficient spatial or temporal resolution to capture small-scale variability in the continental boundary layer. We find that using mid-day hours of observations at continental sites, either with or without the micrometeorological adjustment, allows inclusion of continental sites in global atmospheric inversions. Increased continental observation density is necessary for estimating carbon fluxes with finer resolution in space and time.

In order to accomplish these research objectives, oxygen free copper coupons were prepared to a variety of average surface roughnesses (Ra ranging from 0.05 \u03bcm to 2.5 \u03bcm) prior to coating application. Three coating systems were investigated: Au/Ni plating, Ni plating, and Ni sputtering. The majority of this research focuses on the Au/Ni plated samples, with Ni plated and Ni sputtered data included for comparison.\n\nNickel, gold, and copper are commonly used in electrical components, such as electrical contacts, in which component reliability is of great importance. As there are a wide variety of environments to which electrical components could be exposed to during service, the coated samples were aged for up to nine weeks in one of three aging environments: mixed flowing gas/atmospheric corrosion (MFG), elevated temperature and relative humidity (TRH), and thermal cycling (TC). The mixed flowing gas/atmospheric corrosion environment was created by using a Battelle Class 2 environment with the following conditions: 30 \u00b0C, 70 % relative humidity, 200 ppb NO2, 10 ppb H2S, and 10 ppb Cl2. The elevated temperature and relative humidity environment maintained samples at a constant temperature and relative humidity of 40 \u00b0C and 85%, respectively. Samples in the thermal cycling environment were cycled between temperatures of -40 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C with a 15 minute dwell time and an approximately 4.5 \u00b0C/minute ramp rate.\n\nCharacterization using optical profilometry, optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrical contact resistance (ECR) measurements allowed for the determination of changes in the coupons due to the coating system, surface preparation, and environmental exposure.\n\nFor the unexposed samples, the surface roughness effects on the residual stress varied depending on the coating material and deposition technique utilized. The residual stress in the gold coating of the Au/Ni plated coupons was tensile and decreased in magnitude with increasing substrate surface roughness. The Ni plated coupons exhibited a compressive stress for the smoothest set of samples, while the rougher samples were nearly stress free. The Ni sputtered samples retained an approximately constant residual stress regardless of the substrate surface roughness. On the other hand, the surface roughness had little to no effect on the electrical contact resistance for the as received samples. All measured electrical contact resistance values for these samples were observed to be within approximately 1 m\u03a9 of each other, with values on the order of 10-12 m\u03a9.\n\nCharacterization after environmental exposure revealed aging effects on the residual stress and electrical contact resistance to vary depending on the surface roughness and aging environment. Samples exposed to the atmospheric corrosion/mixed flowing gas (MFG) environment exhibited the largest change in electrical contact resistance. ECR values increased from the as received condition of 10-12 m\u03a9 to over 1000 m\u03a9. The extent of the sample surface with increased ECR values increased with increasing roughness and amount of corrosion product present. In comparison, little to no changes in the electrical contact resistance were observed in the thermal cycled and elevated temperature and relative humidity aged samples.\n\nThe tensile residual stresses observed in the Au/Ni plated samples remained approximately constant or decreased in magnitude with aging time (depending on the aging environment), with the largest change resulting from thermal cycle aging. The tensile stresses found in the Au/Ni plated coatings were observed to decrease in magnitude two to three times more for the thermal cycled samples (~60-120 MPa depending on the substrate surface roughness) as compared to the MFG aged samples (~10-50 MPa).

Collaboration implies that the school and members of the community work together toward a common goal.  This study examined how a rural school district and the communities in which the district belonged collaborated on a community development initiative.  Of course, this collaboration did not occur in a social or political vacuum, there were influences beyond the control of the local players that affected how the school district and the community collaborated.  Neoliberalism and globalization have affected the social, economic and educational structures of rural America.  The changes created by neoliberalism and globalization on these structures have threatened the sustainability of rural communities.  This dissertation examined the opportunities and constraints rural communities are facing and the role that a rural school system could play in increasing social and economic sustainability of rural communities.   The questions guiding this research were: 1) what are the challenges and opportunities of rural community-school collaboration in a community development initiative? 2) what are the implications of this case study for rural community and school collaboration in a globalized economy?  \n\tTo address these questions, a single site case study was conducted.  The research focused on a small, rural school district and the community as they collaborated on a community development initiative. The initiative centered on an entrepreneur center that the school district proposed for its students and the community. Interviews with eighteen people, and observations in three public meetings provided the data for this study. This study also included document analysis from reports presented to the committee formed by the school district to explore the entrepreneur center, as well as historical newspapers to gain a historical context for the study.   One important aspect to this study is the role of the researcher in this study.  The researcher was a participant observer in the events studied which afforded more insight into the events studied.  A review of the literature focusing on rural schools, and rural communities in the United States provided context for the events in this study.\n\tThe entrepreneur center never became a reality for the school district or the community.  The committee charged with exploring the feasibility of the entrepreneur center held meetings in good faith with the community, but attendance at the meetings decreased over the period of time in which this study was conducted.  Although the next paragraph will explore the more subtle explanations for these failures, the most obvious reason for the failure of this initiative was the shift from discussing the possibilities of the entrepreneur center to one of school consolidation.  The shift in focus occurred when the school\u2019s architectural firm conducted a feasibility study for the project and focused on the efficient use of the school district\u2019s physical plant, not on the ideals and hopes for the entrepreneur center.\n\tBased on the interviews, observations of the committee meetings, and document analysis, the following insights were revealed: 1) Rural community members are unsure how to articulate and make sense of their positive individual experiences within the community versus their negative perceptions of the community overall. 2) There must be meaningful participation by the public in the development and the process of a community collaborative effort in order for it to succeed.  This entails more than a token participation and \u201crubber stamping\u201d of initiatives brought forth by the school district.  People want to see the results of their participation as well as how their participation changed the course of the initiative. 3) The school system can act as a bridge to connect rural schools and communities thus alleviating some of the changes in social, economic, and educational changes resulting form neoliberalism and globalization. This involves rural schools adopting a place-based curriculum that encourages a critical pedagogy of place and becoming an incubator for community development initiatives 4) Smaller successes occurred in this study when individual principals implemented parts of the entrepreneur center in their own schools.  This indicated the reasonableness of the foundation of the entrepreneur center, as well as the strength of place-based education.\n\tThe findings in this study suggest how rural schools and communities might collaborate in a globalized society.  In particular, rural educators and the school system, must recognize their new role in the community. They serve an important function of bridging two worlds; one that is vanishing (stable social structures) and one that is threatening to overtake rural schools and communities (liquid, unstable social structures).  One way this can be accomplished is by rural school districts encouraging an appreciation of place by adopting curriculum (place-based) that will challenge rural students to take up issues that are important to people in their communities.  In fact, rural educators can serve as a \u201ccoupler\u201d between those members of society that have very little connection to a \u201cplace,\u201d and those community members that are more \u201cplace bound.\u201d  Further research is needed to explore other methods of collaboration that can serve the same purpose of bridging the gap between the world of stable social structures and the threats to that stability.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6099], "author_name_tesi": "Butler, Thomas A", "last_name_ssi": "Butler", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kai Arthur Schafft", "Dana Lynn Mitra", "William L Boyd", "Jacqueline Edmondson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kai Arthur Schafft, Committee Chair", "Dana Lynn Mitra, Committee Chair", "William L Boyd, Committee Member", "Jacqueline Edmondson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Globalization", "rural schools", "neoliberalism", "rural communities", "public spaces"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic influences on the production of optional plural morphology among bilingual speakers of Yucatec Maya and Spanish", "id": "28850", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12660", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This is a study of the psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic factors that influence the use of optional plural morphology and number agreement among bilingual speakers of Yucatec Maya and Spanish.

Up to now, three generations of coal-based jet fuels have been produced in pilot plants and their thermal stability properties have been tested under static and dynamic conditions in autoxidative and pyrolytic regimes. In the present work, chemical compositions and structures, physical properties, combustion characteristics, and decomposition in a static system in the pyrolytic regime were studied for the candidate fuels. \n\nChemical compositions and structures of coal-based jet fuel were determined by GC/MS, 13C NMR and 1H NMR analyses. Quantitative analysis by GC/MS was used to classify chemical composition into nine groups of compounds, while 1H NMR analysis was used to identify and quantify hydrogen structures in seven regions, based on their chemical shifts. The results from GC/MS and 1H NMR characterization have been compared and show a significant agreement in terms of major composition in jet fuels.\n\nThe static tests in batch reactors were conducted in the pyrolytic regime at very high temperatures in the absence of oxygen. The pyrolytic stability in static conditions was determined by heating 5 mL of sample in a 25 mL-microautoclave at 480oC under 100 psig of UHP N2 for different periods of time. Preliminary results have shown that the hydrotreated LCO/RCO 1:3 having boiling range 180-270\u00810\u00b88C had the highest stability.

In addition, it was found that the specific jet fuel distillation end point is one of the most important parameters controlling the jet fuel\u00a1\u00afs chemical composition.\n\nHowever, to produce a thermally stable jet fuel that can be utilized in the actual jet engines, the fuel quality has to meet ASTM specification requirements. The properties study has shown that all coal-based jet fuels meet ASTM specifications with high flash points and low cloud points. But, the problem associated with high aromatic contents in hydrotreated jet fuels is low smoke point, resulting in high sooting tendencies and emissions.  Net heat of combustion of high-aromatic jet fuels is also relatively low, even though the energy density of the fuels is found to be high.\n\nTo study the relationships among chemical composition, solid deposition rate and other physical properties, mathematical models were established using multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches. ANN is more effective than MLR, as it can establish non-linear relationships of complex systems and can also accurately predict unseen data sets. For visualization purposes, the ternary diagrams have been used to display relationships among three main components with properties. An optimum chemical composition was developed to meet requirements of slow solid deposition rate, net heat of combustion at 18,400 Btu/lb and smoke point at 19 mm.  Based on the existing data, the 1:1 blend of saturated LCO and saturated RCO, composing 0.76% aromatics, 68.47% cycloalkanes (46.98% decalin and 21.49% other cycloalkanes) and 30.77% alkanes and the others, is the only sample having chemical composition that can meet all requirements. However, coal-based jet fuels which are composed of large amounts of aromatics, tetralins or decalins can still be desirable JP-900 if the limitations on aromatics, net heat of combustion and smoke points are flexible.\n\nFinally, the correlations between hydrogen structures of coal-based jet fuels and solid deposition rate have been created using MLR and ANN. These correlations are statistically, physically and chemically satisfied. It was found that the structures of hydrogen donors in decalin, tetralin and indane are the main contribution to suppression of solid deposition. Based on this structure-thermal stability relationship, reaction mechanisms of pyrolytic degradation of coal-based jet fuels have been proposed.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5910], "author_name_tesi": "Butnark, Suchada ", "last_name_ssi": "Butnark", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suchada", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Fuel Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert", "Chunshan Song", "Semih Eser", "M Mercedes Maroto Valer", "M Albert Vannice"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Chair", "Chunshan Song, Committee Member", "Semih Eser, Committee Member", "M Mercedes Maroto Valer, Committee Member", "M Albert Vannice, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chemical Composition", "Artificial Neural Network", "Multiple Linear Regression", "JP-900", "Coal-Based Jet Fuel", "Jet Fuel Properties", "Thermal Stability", "Quantitative Structure-Property Relationship"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Modeling safety effects of geometric design consistency on two-lane rural roadways using mixed effects negative binomial regression", "id": "21071", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9772", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous research has examined the relationship between roadway safety and design consistency using measures such as the difference between design and operating speeds and the difference in operating speeds on successive elements. While such measures have proven effective in identifying inconsistencies in the roadway, they do not directly identify the conditions associated with safety performance. The purpose of this research was to directly quantify the effects of geometric design consistency on roadway safety using measures that can be linked to specific geometric elements. To do so, five years of crash data and roughly 5,000 miles of alignment data from the state of Washington were utilized to model crash experience on 2.5 mile segments.\n\nUsing mixed effects negative binomial modeling, three safety performance functions (SPFs) were developed. The first contained typical roadway parameters that were suggested for use by several contemporary safety management tools, while the second contained various geometric design consistency measures developed from the dataset. The final SPF contained both typical and design consistency parameters. After Empirical Bayes adjustments were applied using the conditional overdispersion parameters from the mixed effects negative binomial models, sites with potential (SWiPs) for safety improvements were ranked for each model using the scaled differences in frequencies between the predicted and adjusted number of crashes.\n\nA comparison was then made based on differences in SWiP rankings between the typical parameter model and the final model containing additional design consistency parameters. Ultimately, 40 unique segments were identified by each SPF out of the top 220 segments ranked; this constitutes a 19 percent change in the top 10 percent of segments identified as SWiPs. Additionally, there was marked variation in the order in which SWiPs were ranked. This disparity may lend credence to the incorporation of geometric design consistency parameters in the development of predictive safety models. Ultimately, by directly modeling the inconsistencies in geometric roadway design, practitioners may be able to better identify and categorize unsafe roadways both in the design stage and post-construction. However, it is important to note that the use of design consistency parameters does not ameliorate the modeling process solely based on a difference in SWiP identification; rather, it should encourage further avenues of research into the use of such measures in predictive safety modeling. Although this investigation is only preliminary, the results may help to burgeon the ever-expanding body of literature regarding the relationship between geometric design consistency and roadway safety.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9522], "author_name_tesi": "Butsick, Andrew Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Butsick", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Peter Jovanis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Peter Jovanis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["geometric design consistency", "SPFs", "mixed effects negative binomial regression", "Sites with Potential (SWiPs)"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Multi-target Tracking Using Higher-order Motion Models", "id": "19121", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8905", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Multi-target tracking is a significant and challenging problem. In its general form it is known to be NP-hard, and many approximate sub-optimal solution methods have been proposed to make the problem tractable. To select the best possible trajectories in a given video sequence, a cost function is used to assign costs to the potential candidates. Most recent approaches use only unary costs and pairwise costs between observations in two consecutive frames. Higher-order costs incorporating track smoothness constraints over three or more frames, such as constant velocity, can improve the performance of a tracker, but with added computational complexity. Our motivation is to leverage this information while keeping the computation time comparable to existing methods. For this purpose, we provide two different algorithms. \n\nThe first algorithm solves for partial trajectories (known as tracklets) over overlapping windows of three frames, and merges consistent overlapping tracklets to form longer tracks. In the case of inconsistency, a larger window of frames is used to resolve the conflict. A final step of merging disjoint tracklets using a min-cost network flow algorithm is carried out to handle long term occlusion in the sequence.\n\nThe second approach directly creates a network flow graph using potential correspondences in consecutive frames as the nodes. Our problem formulation readily lends itself to path estimation in a trellis graph, but  unlike previous methods, each node in our network represents a candidate pair of matching observations between consecutive frames.  Extra constraints on binary flow variables in the graph result in a problem that can no longer be solved by min-cost network flow.  Therefore, we propose an iterative solution method that relaxes these extra constraints using  Lagrangian relaxation, resulting in a series of problems that are solvable by min-cost flow, and that progressively improve toward a high-quality solution to our original optimization problem.\n\nWe present quantitative experimental results demonstrating the superiority of our proposed algorithms over current state-of-the-art.
