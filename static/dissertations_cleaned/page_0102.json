Since then, a large number of both types of substellar objects have been discovered; they have been studied, characterized, and classified.  Yet knowledge of their magnetic properties remains difficult to obtain.  Only radio emission provides a plausible means to study the magnetism of these cool objects.  At the initiation of this research project, not a single exoplanet had been detected in the radio, and only a handful of radio emitting brown dwarfs were known.\n\nThis project was launched to attempt to detect emission from brown dwarfs cooler than spectral type L3.5, the coolest brown dwarf detected prior to this project, and also to attempt to discover radio emission from nearby exoplanets.  These objects are known to emit radio waves via the gyrosynchrotron and electron cyclotron maser instability mechanisms.  By analyzing flaring radio emission from these objects, we would therefore gain insight into their magnetic field properties and the characteristics of the surrounding plasma environment.\n\nThis dissertation presents the results from surveys of 33 brown dwarfs, 18 exoplanetary systems, and one additional M dwarf for flaring radio emission, conducted with the 305-m Arecibo radio telescope at a center frequency of 4.75 GHz using the broadband, fast-sampled Mock spectrometer.  During the course of these surveys, we failed to detect flaring radio emission from any exoplanets, including the young exoplanetary system HR 8799, which theoretical work indicated may have strong magnetic fields capable of generating radio emission at gigahertz frequencies due to their relatively hot temperatures and high masses.  Such a detection would provide an exciting alternative to the previous unsuccessful low radio frequency searches for the emission from exoplanets orbiting middle-aged, solar type stars.\n\nAmong the brown dwarfs we examined, many were not observed to emit bursts of radio emission, with a successful detection rate of 6%.  However, we have detected flaring radio emission from four ultracool dwarfs, two of which are new: the L1 dwarf J1439284+192915 and the T6.5 dwarf J10475385+2124234.  Among the two known sources that we have detected, J07464256+2000321, an L dwarf binary system, and TVLM 513-46546, a periodically emitting M9 dwarf, we have conducted a lengthy observing campaign of the latter.  These observations allow for an unprecedented examination of the burst morphology of the source in time and frequency domains over several years.  Our investigation of this source has also resulted in the tantalizing possibility that the temporal properties of the radio bursts go through cycles over the course of months.  The discovery of J1047+21 dramatically extends the temperature range over which brown dwarfs appear to be at least sporadic radio-emitters, from ~1,900 K (L3.5) down to ~900 K (T6.5).  Follow up observations of this object indicate that while it has detectable quiescent emission, its flaring behavior appears to lack any periodic component.  The detection of radio emission from J1439+19, while tentative, is potentially significant due to its relatively slow rotation, which may have implications for dynamo generation theory.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8841], "author_name_tesi": "Route, Matthew Philip", "last_name_ssi": "Route", "middle_name_ssi": "Philip", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexander Wolszczan", "Alexander Wolszczan", "Lyle Norman Long", "Steinn Sigurdsson", "Kevin Luhman", "John David Mathews", "Richard Alan Wade"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexander Wolszczan, Dissertation Advisor", "Alexander Wolszczan, Committee Chair", "Lyle Norman Long, Committee Member", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Special Member", "Kevin Luhman, Committee Member", "John David Mathews, Committee Member", "Richard Alan Wade, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Brown Dwarfs", "Exoplanets", "Radio Emission", "Planetary Magnetic Fields", "Stellar Magnetic Fields", "Stellar Activity"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Resource Management Issues in Wireless Sensor Networks", "id": "9831", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2211", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sensor networks consist of a number of small sensing devices that are battery-operated and have very limited capabilities. When such sensors are deployed they form a wireless ad-hoc network to communicate with each other and with data processing centers. After deployment, the network is typically required to perform multiple tasks or missions. Because of the limited number of sensors and the possibly large number of missions competition will arise. In such cases, it might not be possible to satisfy the requirements of all missions using available sensors. So, algorithms that decide how the resources are assigned become important. The problem of assigning sensors to missions becomes especially challenging when directional sensors are used as each such sensor can be assigned to at most one mission. Algorithms to solve this problem need to consider the demand and importance for the different missions to decide which missions to fulfill. They also need to assign specific sensors to each mission. This assignment should depend on how suitable a sensor is to the mission and the utility, i.e. amount/quality of information it can provide. \n\nIn this dissertation, we study different sensor-mission assignment problems. We design algorithms that attempt to maximize the overall utility of the network and evaluate their performance using simulations on randomly generated problem instances. We propose algorithms that are centralized, in which all assignment decisions are made by a single node that has a global view of the network, and others that are distributed making them more suitable for actual implementations. We consider static environments, in which all mission requests arrive at once, and dynamic environments, in which missions arrive and depart over time. We address different constraints and design specific solutions for each. Namely, we consider energy, budget, computational power and bandwidth constraints. Although most of the problems we consider are NP-hard, our practical algorithms manage to improve the utility of the network and in many cases achieve near optimal performance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2192], "author_name_tesi": "Rowaihy, Hosam ", "last_name_ssi": "Rowaihy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hosam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas La Porta", "Thomas F Laporta", "Guohong Cao", "Tracy Mullen", "Sofya Raskhodnikova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas La Porta, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Chair", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "Tracy Mullen, Committee Member", "Sofya Raskhodnikova, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Resource Management", "Sensor Networks", "Sensor Assignment"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THE BAILEY TRANSFORM AND CONJUGATE BAILEY PAIRS", "id": "7669", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4194", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis introduces a new generalized conjuagate Bailey pair and infinite families of conjugate Bailey pairs.

However, patients with an implanted LVAD, such as the HeartMate II (HMII), have experienced bleeding episodes in the abdomen. These incidents are likely caused by the cleavage or proteolytic breakdown of von Willebrand Factor (vWF), a protein in the clotting cascade. To determine the LVAD\u2019s potential contribution to vWF mechanical destruction, in vitro studies were conducted to quantify the flow at the outlet of the HMII using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) under steady and pathophysiological conditions.\nIn the steady flow experiment, the HMII was connected in series with a compliance chamber and operated at 8800 \u00b1 100 RPM with an 80 mmHg rise across the pump, producing a flow rate of 3.2 \u00b1 0.1 L/min. The second experiment included a pulsatile pump with the LVAD and compliance chamber inducing pulsatility through the HMII for a total flow rate of 5.0 \u00b1 0.1 L/min. The pulsatile pump was operating at a rate of 105 beats per minute with a stroke volume of approximately 50 mL. Velocity profiles, Reynolds shear stresses (RSS), Reynolds normal stresses (RNS), and turbulence intensities (TI) were used to visualize the outlet flow in the cannula both quantitatively and qualitatively. \nUnder both steady and pulsatile conditions, shear stresses orders of magnitude higher than those needed to unfurl and cleave vWF were observed in the outlet cannula. This evidence, in conjunction with high turbulence intensity values and stark contrasts in velocity profiles in certain regions, points to the positive correlation between continuous flow VADs and the potential proteolytic cleavage or mechanical destruction of vWF.  Prolonged exposure of these flow conditions may lead to acquired von Willebrand Disease, which can lead to uncontrollable bleeding episodes in the abdominal region.

Development and differentiation of the mammary gland occurs postnatally under the control of a complex system of hormonal and environmental cues making the mammary gland an important model of study for both developmental biology and endocrinology.  Furthermore, breast cancer is the \u201cnumber one cause of cancer death in Hispanic women\u201d and the \u201csecond most common cause of cancer death in white, black, Asian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaska Native women\u201d according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  These statistics make it clear that ongoing research in both breast cancer and normal mammary gland development is imperative to women\u2019s health.   \nThe primary cause of breast cancer is transformation of mammary epithelial cells (MECs) that result in unregulated cell proliferation and subsequent mammary carcinomas.  Several components of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, the IGF ligands and the IGF-type I receptor (IGF-1R) in particular, regulate both normal and transformed MEC growth.  \nPrevious studies from our laboratory examined expression of the IGF ligands and the IGF-1R in normal mammary gland development and demonstrated that the IGF ligands and the IGF-1R are expressed in distinct patterns during normal development.  Subsequent analysis of receptor affinity for IGF ligands demonstrated that the insulin receptor isoform A (IR-A) is an IGF-II-sensitive signaling receptor and furthermore, that hybrid receptors consisting of equal parts IGF-1R and insulin receptor (IR), preferentially bind IGF ligands.  \nHerein, we have developed and tested a quantitative PCR assay to accurately measure IGF-1R, IR-A and IR isoform-B (IR-B) expression on the same scale.  We have used this assay to quantify mRNA expression of IGF sensitive receptors in primary MECs during mammary gland development.  These data demonstrate that IR isoforms are expressed at much higher levels than the IGF-1R at all times.  Subsequent protein analysis demonstrated that due to this disproportion, at least 49% of IGF-1R is present as part of a hybrid receptor during pregnancy stages.\nWe next provide preliminary data that demonstrate preferential activation of the IGF-1R rather than hybrid receptors by IGF-I in vivo.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that insulin stimulates IGF-1R activation in vivo, either by stimulating classic IGF-1R or IGF-1R present in a hybrid receptor.  The importance of IGF-1R signaling in MEC development is further supported by microarray analysis of a MEC-specific conditional deletion of the IGF-1R during post-pubertal development.  These data suggest a functional role for IGF-1R signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway in regulating expression of cell cycle regulatory molecules.  In the final section of this thesis, we present in vitro data that support the findings of the microarray analysis and demonstrate that activation of the PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin pathway stimulates cell cycle progression downstream of IGF-I in normal MECs.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [289], "author_name_tesi": "Rowzee, Anne Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Rowzee", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Anne", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Teresa Wood", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Maricarmen Planas Silva", "Michael Verderame", "Andrea Manni"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Teresa Wood, Committee Chair", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Chair", "Maricarmen Planas Silva, Committee Member", "Michael Verderame, Committee Member", "Andrea Manni, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Insulin-like growth factor receptor", "Insulin receptor", "Mammary epithelial cells", "Quantitative PCR", "Insulin-like growth factors", "Epidermal growth factor"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Associations between micronutrient intake and blood lead level in Uruguayan children \n\n", "id": "12597", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "538", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Background:\n\tLead exposure is one of the important pediatric environmental health problems in both developing and developed countries. The primary site for absorption of lead is the gastrointestinal tract. Lead is thought to compete with nutrient metals like iron, calcium and zinc for similar binding sites on intestinal transporter proteins for absorption. On the other hand, vitamin C may chelate and excrete lead in urine. It may also alter iron-lead interaction by increasing iron absorption. In addition, there is some evidence that folate metabolism may be related to lead toxicity. Overall, some evidence exists for an association between micronutrient status and lead exposure, but supplementation with micronutrients has not always been effective. It is important to identify a population at risk for both micronutrient deficiency and lead exposure to carry out successful dietary intervention. This cross-sectional study examined the relation between dietary intakes of micronutrients (calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin C and folate) and blood lead level (BLL) in 6-8 year old children (n=61) from Montevideo, Uruguay. \n\nMethod:\n\tSixty-one first graders from four primary schools in Montevideo (the capital of Uruguay) participated in the study. The study children came from low-income families, living in areas known for lead exposure. Fasting blood samples were collected during a clinic visit in school to analyze whole blood lead levels by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Two 24-hour dietary recalls were conducted with mothers or caregivers and daily nutrient intakes calculated from a database of nutrient composition of Uruguayan foods. Parents filled out a brief questionnaire on socio-economic status, parental education and employment and child\u2019s health. In addition, questions were asked to identify sources of lead exposure. Nutrient intakes were adjusted for total calorie intake by residual analysis. The relationship between micronutrient intakes and BLL were modeled in co-variate adjusted multiple linear and logistic models, with each nutrient tested in separate models and entered as tertiles. \n\nResults:  \n\tMean (SD) BLL of 61 study children was 5.0 (2.6) \u00b5g/dL, with 8.2% and 37.7% of the study children having BLL &#8805; 10 \u00b5g/dL and BLL > 5 \u00b5g/dL, respectively. Median (IQR) calorie-adjusted intake of calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin C and folate was 728 (315) mg/day, 10 (5) mg/day, 5 (3) mg/day, 44 (37) mg/day and 325 (240) \u00b5g/day, respectively. About 60% children had calcium intake below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) (800 mg/day). Intakes of rest of the micronutrients (iron, zinc, vitamin C and folate) were adequate. Nutrient intakes were positively correlated with total daily calorie intake and iron intake was correlated with intakes of vitamin C. Higher dietary calcium intake was associated with lower BLL after adjusting for child\u2019s BMI, environmental exposure, family possessions and school. Children in the highest tertile of calcium intake (871-1474 mg/day) had 1.2 \u00b5g/dL lower BLL (p< 0.1) and 83% lower likelihood (p< 0.05) of having BLL > 5 \u00b5g/dL than children in the lowest tertile (246 \u2013 728 mg/day). No significant associations were found between BLL and other four micronutrients. There were no significant interactions between iron and calcium or iron and vitamin C. \n\nConclusions:\n\tHigher calcium intake was associated with lower blood lead level in 58 Uruguayan school children. However, no association was found between intakes of iron, zinc, vitamin C and folate with children\u2019s BLL. Future studies should confirm the findings by repeating the results with biomarkers of micronutrients. In addition, the effects of calcium supplementation on BLL in young children are also warranted.\n \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [535], "author_name_tesi": "Roy, Aditi ", "last_name_ssi": "Roy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aditi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katarzyna Kordas", "Katarzyna Kordas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katarzyna Kordas, Thesis Advisor", "Katarzyna Kordas, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["blood lead level", "children", "micronutrients", "environmental toxicology", "international health"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Blood lead levels, dietary intake, and oxidative stress in lead-exposed Uruguayan children", "id": "21775", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9760", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lead exposure poses threats to health of millions of children worldwide. Weight of the evidence from experimental and epidemiological studies suggests that low-level lead exposure, a condition currently observed in general population, is associated with various adverse health outcomes in spite of the null findings in some studies. Although, we have a knowledge-base of the health consequences of exposure to lead in children, important questions particularly on the\nmechanisms of its toxicity, as well as prevention and treatment of lead exposure remain unanswered. Understanding the association between socio-demographic and dietary factors that could affect children\u2019s lead exposure and the relation between lead and oxidative stress, a proposed common mechanism for many lead-induced toxicities, could potentially help in finding effective preventive strategies for exposure and toxicities of low-level lead. This cross-sectional study in 211 children (5-8 years old) from Montevideo, Uruguay identified the potential sociodemographic and household risk factors that can predict children\u2019s blood lead levels (BLLs), a biomarker of lead exposure. The study also examined the relation between dietary intakes of nutrients and BLL, and investigated the association between BLL and two oxidative stress markers (measured as F2- 8\u03b1 isoprostane or isoprostane, a lipid oxidation marker and 8- hydroxy-2- deoxy Guanosine or 8-OH-dG, a DNA oxidation marker), and tested whether intakes of antioxidants act as effect modifiers. The mean BLL of the study children was 4.7 \u00b1 2.2 \u03bcg/dL and 30.2% children had elevated BLL [\u2265 5 \u03bcg/dL, the current reference level set by Centre for Disease Control for identification and monitoring of children who are exposed to more lead than most children; CDC, 2012]. The most salient socio-demographic and household risk factors for BLL in the study were: father\u2019s smoking, father\u2019s employment in jobs with potential for metal exposure (such as construction, factories, and print shops, and as mechanics or drivers), and the number of young child (< 5 years old) in a household. Among dietary factors, carbohydrate (both as absolute amount and as percentage of energy intake) and fat (as % energy)\u2014were positively associated with children\u2019s BLL. On the other hand, calcium intake was inversely associated with children\u2019s BLL. Majority of the study children did not meet the recommended intake for calcium(800 mg/day). Other nutrients were not associated with BLL and no interactions between pairs of nutrients (iron-zinc, iron-vitamin C or iron-calcium) on BLL were observed. Finally, a weak positive association was found between BLL and the urinary concentrations of isoprostane in the study children, but not between children\u2019s BLL and the concentration of urinary 8-OH-dG. The interactive effects of antioxidants (vitamin C or zinc) with BLL on oxidative stress markers were not statistically significant. This study provides evidence that Uruguayan children continue to be exposed to lead years after the withdrawal of lead from gasoline. Because there is perhaps no safe level for lead and because low-level lead exposure may cause neurodevelopmental deficits and other long-term health problems, lead testing should be made a routine in pediatric practice in Uruguay. School entry is an opportune time for lead screening, if not done previously, since it can be conducted along with other screenings important for school achievement such as hearing and vision. Moreover, the identified socio-demographic and household factors in this study could be used for initiatives to make behavioral and lifestyle changes in children and families and to increase awareness among parents, health-care providers and policy-makers. Educational campaigns regarding prevention of lead exposure may potentially help children and their siblings. Finally, this study provides evidence that could be used to design future long-term studies to answer questions regarding the biological mechanism and the role of nutrition in mitigating exposure and lead toxicities.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9511], "author_name_tesi": "Roy, Aditi ", "last_name_ssi": "Roy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aditi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutritional Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katarzyna Kordas", "Katarzyna Kordas", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher", "Laura E Murray Kolb", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katarzyna Kordas, Dissertation Advisor", "Katarzyna Kordas, Committee Chair", "Shannon Leanne Kelleher, Committee Member", "Laura E Murray Kolb, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lead exposure", "blood lead level", "children", "Uruguay", "dietary intake", "oxidative stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Failure-time statistics of a coupled-field damage evolution model via temporal averaging", "id": "16179", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8125", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We study the coupling between dynamics at different time-scales during fatigue damage growth with an objective of understanding the factors that lead to large variations observed in the statistics of life of specimens subject to periodic loading. For this we study a previously developed 1D coupled-field damage evolution model that couples the dynamics at the macroscopic and microscopic scales. We perform Monte-Carlo life-cycle simulations of large ensembles of initial random micro-states with the objective of determining the effect of initial microsturctural uncertainty on the variability of failure-time statistics. We find through our simulations that the spatial evolution of damage is governed by the spatial distribution of the unperturbed steady-state macroscopic strain and that the failure-time distribution of the bar damage failure-time distributions have oscillations that have a period that is half of the forcing period.\n\nHowever, direct numerical simulations of large ensembles for such multi-scale models are expensive, as the time-scales of the macroscopic and microscopic systems are usually very disparate. To overcome this challenge we use the method of averaging to average out the macroscopic dynamics. We first implement the method of averaging on a 1-DOF version of our continuum problem and use it to determine a universal slow time-scale in which the evolution of damage is independent of the forcing amplitude and the parameter that governs the damage evolution rate. This not only helps us to reduce computational time by orders of magnitude, but also helps us to understand the nature of $S$-$N$ curves for our model. We also implement the method of averaging on a 2-DOF damage evolution model and demonstrate the existence of a first integral for the system and that the damage phase space can be partitioned into regions corresponding to different damage failure modes.\n\nWe then develop a numerical scheme, based on the method of averaging, that can be used to extend our averaging scheme numerically to higher dimensions. This helps to reduce the computational time  required for life-cycle simulations of our continuum model by a large factor and we therefore then use this method to study failure-time statistics. We first use the averaged equations to develop lower dimensional models that capture the evolution of damage occurring in a bar with seeded faults. We then use the averaged equations to derive approximate expressions for the failure time for a brittle bar and use it to demonstrate the importance of the spatial correlation of initial damage on the convergence of failure-times. Next we perform life-cycle simulations for ensembles of initial damage conditions at different forcing frequency to demonstrate a direct correlation between the spatial localization of damage and the relative variability of failure times. Finally, we use semi-analytical techniques to demonstrate a periodic dependence of the median failure-time on the forcing frequency for fatigue of brittle materials.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8067], "author_name_tesi": "Roy, Arjun ", "last_name_ssi": "Roy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Arjun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Paul Cusumano", "Joseph Paul Cusumano", "Francesco Costanzo", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Eric M Mockensturm"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Paul Cusumano, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Chair", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fatigue", "continuum damage mechanics", "method of averaging", "extreme value statistics", "failure-time statistics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SIGNAL ANALYSIS USING RAISED COSINE EMPIRICAL MODE DECOMPOSITION\n", "id": "11665", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "434", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The inherent nonstationarity of signals in nature imparts their usefulness.

The rapidly growing list of applications points to its\ncapability.\n\nThis dissertation\u2019s approach towards the EMD technique revolves around enhancing its performance while simultaneously leveraging its unique capabilities in practical applications. The original contributions of this dissertation are two-fold: firstly, a new signal-analysis technique based on EMD is developed. This new technique, called raised cosine empirical mode decomposition (RCEMD), possesses several desirable qualities: enhanced frequency resolution, computational efficiency and lower sampling rate requirement. A theoretical framework is developed to compare the performances of the original and proposed techniques. A pre-emphasis and de-emphasis based technique to improve the frequency resolution of the EMD family of algorithms is also developed.\nThe second substantial contribution of this dissertation concerns novel applications of\nsignal analysis techniques including RCEMD. An overlay communication technique that utilizes the unique instantaneous frequency based signal decomposition property of RCEMD is developed. A modification of this technique that is suitable for interference rejection in broadband communications is also described. Finally, two applications of signal analysis techniques concerning atmospheric remote sensing are explored. First, an RCEMD-based technique to isolate both persistent and sporadic signal features in atmospheric pressure measurements is developed. Secondly, a genetic algorithm method\nto resolve and estimate the parameters of fragmenting meteoroids observed using radar\nmeasurements is presented.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [428], "author_name_tesi": "Roy, Arnab ", "last_name_ssi": "Roy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Arnab", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof John F Doherty", "John F Doherty", "John David Mathews", "Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Karl Martin Reichard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof John F Doherty, Dissertation Advisor", "John F Doherty, Committee Chair", "John David Mathews, Committee Member", "Ram Mohan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Karl Martin Reichard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hilbert spectrum", "time-frequency analysis", "signal overlay", "raised cosine interpolation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Connecting the Pale Blue Dots: Detection & Characterization of Exoplanets with Extreme Precision Spectroscopy", "id": "14204aur17", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14204", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two decades ago, technological advancement aligned with some of mankind\u2019s oldest and most compelling questions to give birth to exoplanet science.

Building on the success of instruments like HARPS, Doppler velocimetry is now firmly on the path towards extreme precisions (\u223c10 cm/s ), driven by the urge to find true Earth analogs. This effort, however, requires severe technical artistry and demands unprecedented performance from both hardware and software. In this dissertation, I present the comprehensive and multifaceted path to extreme precision spectroscopy. We begin with existing spectrographs and the battlefield lessons they offer, focusing particularly on PARAS, an operating workhorse instrument with which I have been deeply involved, achieving \u223c1 m/s radial velocity (RV) precision over several months. I then detail the design and development of two new instruments that will achieve unprecedented RV precisions: (a) the Habitable Zone Planet Finder, an upcoming near-infrared instrument for the 10 m Hobby Eberly Telescope, designed to achieve 1-3 m/s on cool stars, and (b) NEID, an extreme precision optical instrument aiming at < 30 cm/s that will be the centerpiece of the NASA-NSF Exoplanet Observational Research (NN-EXPLORE) partnership.

Immersed methods have  been gaining wide use in the analysis of biomechanical systems. In this dissertation, we are interested in analyzing a pathological state of the cerebral system known as hydrocephalus using an immersed method. During hydrocephalus, there is an abnormal accumulation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the lateral ventricles of the brain. As a result, the ventricles distend and compress the brain tissue and disrupt the the normal functioning of the brain. The current therapies for hydrocephalus are surgical in nature, like shunt implants and endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), and aim to divert the excess CSF from the ventricles into appropriate resorption sites. However, patients generally suffer from many post-surgical complications and hence there is an overriding need to gain a deeper understanding of the biomechanics of hydrocephalus in order to improve the treatment protocols.  \n\nAn effort in this direction is to develop computational models of hydrocephalic brains that will not only foster a better understanding of the biomechanical aspects of the disease among the clinicians but also enable them to use these models for prognosis. The biomechanical models of hydrocephalus that have been proposed so far have focused either only on the CSF dynamics or the deformation of the brain parenchyma described using different material models. However, modeling hydrocephalus as an FSI problem is relatively new.\n \nIn this dissertation, we study the mechanics of hydrocephalus as an FSI problem by modeling the brain parenchyma as a deformable, incompressible Neo-Hookean solid that is submerged in CSF which is modeled as a Newtonian fluid. For analyzing this FSI problem, we use the fully variational formulation of the IFEM developed by Heltai and Costanzo (2012). In this method, like in other immersed methods, the discretization of the solid and the fluid domains are independent of each other and the fluid is treated in an Eulerian framework and the deformation of the solid is analyzed in a Lagrangian framework. In the fully variational setting the exchange of information between the fluid and solid domains (i.e. the interpolation of the velocity of the solid from the background fluid field and the spreading of the forces, arising due to the elasticity of the solid, in the fluid domain) is achieved using the standard infrastructure of the finite element method. This method is capable of handling of FSI involving both incompressible and compressible solids and the density and the viscosity of the solid need not be the same as those of the fluid. Moreover, the method has the potential to be easily extended for a poroelastic solid.\n\nWe have developed a custom C++ based numerical code to implement the generalized IFEM. We present the numerical experiments that we have performed to the establish the correctness of our numerical implementation. We show that we obtain convergence rates that are in accordance with those found in the literature. We show that our numerical simulations give physically relevant results for viscometry tests. We also present some new tests for both incompressible and compressible solids that can be used for gauging the accuracy of the numerical implementation. \n\nWe finally present some simple two-dimensional simulations that we have performed to model the deformation of the brain parenchyma when the CSF viscosity is varied. We see that higher viscosity of the CSF has an impact on the recovery time of a pre-deformed brain parenchyma. Such a numerical study has not been hitherto undertaken and may provide a better insight into outcome of ETV.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8066], "author_name_tesi": "Roy, Saswati ", "last_name_ssi": "Roy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Saswati", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Corina Stefania Drapaca", "Francesco Costanzo", "Sulin Zhang", "Panagiotis Michaleris", "Luca Heltai", "Jonathan S Pitt", "Francesco Costanzo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Corina Stefania Drapaca, Dissertation Advisor", "Francesco Costanzo, Committee Chair", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Member", "Panagiotis Michaleris, Committee Member", "Luca Heltai, Special Member", "Jonathan S Pitt, Special Member", "Francesco Costanzo, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluid-structure interaction", "immersed finite element method", "hydrocephalus", "computational biomechanics"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Aerosol-dynamics-based soot modeling of flames", "id": "20625", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9392", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Modeling of soot formation and destruction in combustion systems involves modeling of fluid dynamics, chemistry, and radiative transfer.

Considering complexity of these inter-connected processes of real-world combustion systems and computational cost associated with their modeling, a systematic comparative study of soot models is needed to identify an affordable, yet comprehensive and accurate model of soot prediction in device-scale and real-world combustion systems. Such a systematic study of two detailed soot models is performed in the current work. The models used in this study are a discrete sectional method (DSM) and a method of moments with interpolative closure (MOMIC). A semi-empirical soot model is also included in the study for comparison. Several gas-phase chemical mechanism were also tested with the soot models to identify the relative importance of gas-phase chemical mechanisms in the outcome of the soot simulations. \n\nResults showed the importance of the surface growth and nucleation schemes in predicting the soot volume fraction.  Even though the surface growth contributed most to the soot mass growth, nucleation plays a critical role in final soot volume fraction by way of influencing the soot number density. Therefore, accurate prediction of nucleating species is key to the success of detailed soot model. The comparison of DSM and MOMIC showed very similar prediction trend in global quantities. The semi-empirical model, with proper tuning, was found to perform well in all the flames studied. DSM was found computationally most costly, while the semi-empirical model was computationally least expensive. \n\nThe study in laminar flames was complemented by a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a two-dimensional turbulent flame using MOMIC. A robust numerical scheme was developed and tested for MOMIC in DNS. The effects of turbulence on gas-phase chemistry and soot dynamics were explored from the data generated.

In particular, the near-simultaneous firing of neurons within a cortical area or across cortical areas has received much attention as a potential sensory code.  These experiments investigated the potential role of synchronous firing in the somatosensory system. Three main questions were addressed: whether or not synchronization was present among local populations of neurons in primary somatosensory cortex during sensory stimulation; if synchronization could serve as a signal to bind the simultaneous stimulus responses in primary and secondary somatosensory cortex; and can cortical neurons distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous presynaptic inputs from the thalamus.  The results presented here show that within SI, local populations of neurons become synchronized during sensory stimulation to varying degrees depending on the nature of the stimulus.  In addition, neurons in SI and SII with overlapping receptive fields become tightly synchronized when responding to a single stimulus.

These changes are studied using phylogenetic tools that identify sites in the genome, which are important for adaptation in the new host (positively selected sites). Studying how these changes in the genome sequence affects change in the structure of viral proteins is still very challenging, as a one-to-one relationship does not exist between changes in sequence and changes in structure. The primary structure of the protein is its amino acid sequence that determines the final tertiary structure of the protein. The rules that govern the folding of proteins starting from the linear amino acid sequence are still poorly understood. Over the last five decades progress has been made in predicting the secondary structure of proteins using robust computational tools. The secondary structure, which is an intermediate step (alpha helix, beta sheet, and coils) between primary and tertiary structure, is a property determined by a combination of amino acids. We have used six predicted secondary structural properties to construct a multivariate statistical pipeline that identifies differences in structure at amino acid positions between groups of related viral proteins (Human and Avian Metapneumovirus, HIV and SIV).

Proper placement of optical radiation allows for reduced energy consumption, increased brightness perception, and improved color rendition. It can also result in lamps that have a greater impact on nonvisual human functions such as circadian rhythms, sleep, mood, and cognition. For an architectural lighting system, careful consideration must be given to all of these areas; recent advancements in understanding nonvisual photoreception must be balanced with the traditional emphasis on visual quality and energy efficiency.\n\nThe three research projects described herein investigated spectral tuning by examining the effects of optical radiation or seeking ideal spectral power distributions. In all three cases, emphasis was placed on developing an architectural lighting system based on red, green, and blue (RGB) light emitting diodes (LEDs) that is capable of providing maximum stimulation to nonvisual systems while maintaining visual quality standards. In particular, the elderly were considered as a target population because they have an increased risk of developing disorders linked to illumination deficits. The three endeavors can be summarized as follows:\n\n\nLIGHT THERAPY FOR SENIORS IN LONG-TERM CARE\n\nAim:  To examine the effect of optical radiation on circadian rhythms, sleep, mood, and cognition for frail elderly in a long-term care environment.\n\nMethodology:  A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of light therapy was conducted using circadian-effective short-wavelength (blue) optical radiation to treat a sample of residents recruited for participation without bias for existing medical diagnoses.\n\nKey Findings:  Light therapy treatment improved cognitive functioning compared to placebo but no changes were detected in nighttime sleep statistics, reports of daytime sleepiness, circadian rhythms, or depression inventory parameters.\n\n\nPERCEIVED BRIGHTNESS OF TRICHROMATIC LIGHT SOURCES\n\nAim:  To examine the effect of tuning optical radiation on brightness perception for younger (18-25 years of age) and older (50 years of age or older) observers.\n\nMethodology:  Participants made forced-choice evaluations of the brightness of a full factorial of stimulus pairs selected from two groups of four metameric stimuli. The large-field stimuli were created by systematically varying either the red or the blue primary of an RGB LED mixture.\n\nKey Findings:  Light stimuli of equal illuminance and chromaticity do not appear equally bright to either younger or older subjects. The rank-order of brightness is not predicted by any current model of human vision or theory of brightness perception including Scotopic to Photopic or Cirtopic to Photopic ratio theory, prime color theory, correlated color temperature, photometry, color quality metrics, linear brightness models, or color appearance models. Age may affect brightness perception when short-wavelength primaries are used, especially those with a peak wavelength shorter than 450 nm. \n\n\nOPTIMIZING RGB LED MIXTURES\n\nAim:  To investigate potential tradeoffs between luminous efficacy, nonvisual efficacy, and color quality of RGB LED mixtures when the peak wavelength and full with half maximum of the primaries are varied. To identify mixtures suitable for architectural lighting which provide increased circadian stimulation.\n\nMethodology:  Software to calculate the properties of RGB LED mixtures matching the chromaticity of blackbody radiation was developed using Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic. Excel Solver was used to perform a series of optimization routines, identifying high-performing mixtures that were then compared to traditional lamps.\n\nKey Findings:  Trichromatic mixtures suitable for architectural interiors can outperform traditional lamps when luminous efficacy, nonvisual efficacy, and color quality are considered simultaneously. However, misplacement of radiant energy can result in poor performing trichromatic systems. When radiant energy is manipulated, tradeoffs may occur between luminous efficacy, nonvisual efficacy, and color quality.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4295], "author_name_tesi": "Royer, Michael Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Royer", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kevin William Houser", "Kevin William Houser", "Richard George Mistrick", "Richard A Behr", "David Manuel Almeida", "Noel Hudson Ballentine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kevin William Houser, Dissertation Advisor", "Kevin William Houser, Committee Chair", "Richard George Mistrick, Committee Member", "Richard A Behr, Committee Member", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member", "Noel Hudson Ballentine, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Architectural lighting", "light therapy", "brightness perception", "light emitting diodes (LEDs)", "spectral tuning"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Real and the Imaginary in the literary works of E.T.A.

Hoffmann, J. Eichendorff, and V. Odoevsky.  In the early 19th century, the literary interest in reasoning as the leitmotiv of the cultural movement in the age of Enlightenment shifted to the cryptic area of the human soul and its influence on individual behavior. In the absence of modern knowledge of psychology, writers of the time speculated that the human behavior was subject of influence of mystic power of nature. This provided perfect conditions for the development of certain literary themes. Among these themes, the authors of Romanticism explored the reciprocal interaction between the day-to-day reality and the idealized, overwhelming, and threatening world of supernatural. \nWhen reality is not perfect, where does our imagination lead us?  Is it an extraordinary fantasy or even sublime that one can barely comprehend? Do we abandon all the conventional ideas about the perfect day-to-day life and its aesthetic demands? Or is our fantasy only another perfect version of the everyday idyll? Should one give up reason as a supreme force of our intellect in favor of intuition and imagination? \nIn their major works, authors such as Hoffmann, Eichendorff, and Odoevsky answer these questions in their unique literary manner. Two short stories The Mines at Falun (1819) and Sylph (1837) as well as the novel Of the Life of a Good-For-Nothing (1823) provide a rich context for measuring literary values of the romantic supernatural world and determining their connection to reality. \nBeyond traditionally opposed spacial characteristics in the literary period, this research advances the fantasy-reality-relationship as an optimal model for categorizing a work of Romanticism from the point of author\u2019s literary goals and intentions. This dissertation proposes the following: when an author highlights imaginary objects it reveals an author\u2019s emphasis on the protagonist\u2019s inner world and psychology. The regulation of common sense, behavioral code, self-consciousness, creative urge, identity, and madness become central objects of these works. On the other hand, when an author underlines the dominance of the realistic space indicates an author\u2019s focus on depiction of the protagonists\u2019s external surrounding reality. Socio-cultural, political, and philosophical ideas are the central objects of literary examination in these works. The comparative analysis of three texts of Hoffmann, Eichendorff, and Odoevsky aims to expand previos work on the interaction between imaginary and realistic spaces in the literature of Romanticism. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6418], "author_name_tesi": "Rozanov, Vladislav Nikolayevich", "last_name_ssi": "Rozanov", "middle_name_ssi": "Nikolayevich", "first_name_ssi": "Vladislav", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Purdy/ Martina Kolb", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Dr Martina Kolb", "Adrian Johannes Wanner", "Ursula Bettina Brandt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Purdy/ Martina Kolb, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Chair", "Dr Martina Kolb, Committee Chair", "Adrian Johannes Wanner, Committee Member", "Ursula Bettina Brandt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["German and Russian literature of Romanticism", "literary space"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Sourcing from Emerging Nations: Issues and Opportunities for Supply Chain Management\n", "id": "6511", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3425", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The importance of overseas sourcing in the achievement of better results in the purchasing function and in overall business performance has been widely investigated since the late 1980s.

These supply chain benefits must, however, be weighted against the possible negative supply chain impacts of, for example, more fragmented transportation and logistics infrastructure, and more limited information technology capabilities of LDC firms. However, few extant studies have addressed the logistics and supply chain implications of sourcing from LDCs.\n\nThe purpose of the current study is to provide an understanding of key sourcing issues when a firm sources from LDCs, and to explore the relationship of the issues with the firm\u2019s supply chain performance. A self-administered mail questionnaire was used to collect data from purchasing managers of U.S. manufacturing firms that directly source from both developed and less developed countries.

In this study, we attempt to investigate the RE mechanism by identifying and characterizing proteins that bind to it. \nThe minichromosome affinity purification (MAP) is a useful approach to isolate protein-DNA complex in its native chromatin context.  Minichromosome is an artificial yeast vector that can be assembled into nucleosomes naturally in living cells. To identify factors that regulate the RE function, a 1.5kb RE segment was cloned into the minichromosome and introduced to yeast cells. Protein components of the affinity purified RE minichromosome isolated from either a or \u0192\u00d1 cells were separated and analyzed by mass-spectrometry. A DNA repair protein yKu80p was identified by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionisation Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) to specifically associate with minichromosome in a cells. Chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) assay confirms the occupancy of both yKu80p and yKu70p at RE in vivo. Deletion of YKU80 results in altered chromatin structure in the RE region and more importantly, causes a dramatic decrease of HML usage in MATa cells. We also detect directional movement of yKu80p from the RE towards HML during switching. These results indicate a novel function of yKu80p in regulating mating type switching. \nTo understand the molecular mechanism of yKu80p in switching, we took two biochemical approaches to search for factors that regulate RE function. The proteins identified in both methods would be our prime candidates for further study. First, we exploit the tandem affinity purification (TAP) approach coupled with multi-dimensional protein identification technique (Mud-PIT) to identify proteins that associate with yKu80p during the course of switching. Comparison of the mass-spectrometry results of the switching and non-switching samples revealed that Rvb1p and Rvb2p, subunits of nucleosome remodeling complex INO80, bind to the yKu80p at the early stage of DSB repair. In vitro calmodulin pull down assay confirmed this strong but transient interaction. Moreover, ChIP assay was performed to demonstrate that Rvb1p binds to the active RE in a yKu80p dependent manner. In addition, Rvb1p exhibits a similar directional movement pattern along the left arm of Chromosome III during switching like that of the yKu80p. Second, optimized MAP approach combined with Mud-PIT analysis was used to identify the complete protein repertoire of the RE minichromosome. Various proteins have been found to associate with the RE minichromosome. They include not only proteins known to participate in minichromosome maintenance but also several novel candidates that are potentially linked to RE function. Two subunits of INO80, Arp5p and Rvb1p, were identified in this study. Since Rvb1p and Rvb2p were also detected in previous screen, we speculate that the INO80 complex might be involved in switching. To directly address this possibility, we deleted ARP5p which is required for INO80 function both in vivo and in vitro. The ARP5 deletion strain indeed exhibits significant defect in donor preference: the HML usage dropped from 85% to 40%. These data collectively argue that chromatin remodeling complex INO80 play an important role in mating type switching.\nBesides binding to the DSB as shown by previous study, our data suggested that both INO80 and yKu80p also bind to RE. One reasonable interpretation is that the two DNA loci could be brought together by those proteins during switching. This is consistent with the \u00a1\u00a7entry point\u00a1\u00a8 hypothesis which proposed that, at the beginning of switching, the double strand break (DSB) is brought to the RE vicinity, possibly by proteins that bind to both loci, and subsequently starts homolog searching and recombination. Here we provide another line of evidence that \u0192\u00d7-H2A, a landmark of double strand break, is also enriched in the RE region upon HO cleavage. This enrichment requires wild type yKu80p but not functional INO80. Based on the biochemical properties of these complexes, we envision that yKu80p may mediate DSB entering RE either through self-dimerization or by interacting with DSB bound proteins. Subsequently, the nucleosome mobilization activity of INO80 may contribute to homolog searching of DSB for its donor loci. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1258], "author_name_tesi": "Ruan, Chun ", "last_name_ssi": "Ruan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Song Tan", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Hong Ma", "Jerry L Workman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Song Tan, Committee Chair", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Jerry L Workman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["yKu80", "mating type switching", "chromatin structure", "recombination enhancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SensorEar: A Sensor Network Base Voice Eavesdropping System\n\n\n\n", "id": "9002", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2111", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, the research and application on sensor network became a very hot topic.

One of the challenges in producing pegylated proteins is the low product yield and difficult purification of the desired (typically mono-pegylated) product. The overall objective of this thesis was to examine the use of ultrafiltration for the production and purification of a desired mono-pegylated protein product. The specific aims included: (1) evaluate the effects of electrostatic and solute-solute intermolecular interactions on transmission of pegylated proteins through both neutral and charged ultrafiltration membranes, (2) develop an ultrafiltration process to purify pegylated proteins with different degree of pegylation, and (3) develop a combined reaction and membrane-based separation process to enhance the yield of a desired pegylated product. Experiments were performed using a model pegylated system produced by covalent attachment of activated PEG to \u03b1-lactalbumin. Ultrafiltration experiments were performed with UltracelTM cellulosic membranes, with a negatively charged version generated by covalent attachment of sulfonic acid groups to the base cellulose. \nThe ultrafiltration data showed strong electrostatic exclusion of the pegylated proteins from a charged membrane. A theoretical model was developed to describe the sieving behavior of the pegylated proteins accounting for the increase in the effective protein size, the elimination of the protonatable \u2013NH2 group due to the pegylation reaction, and the alteration of the electrostatic potential field around the protein due to the PEG layer. The transmission of the pegylated proteins also increases with increasing PEG concentration due to the increase in free energy of the pegylated protein in the bulk solution associated with the strong intermolecular interactions. These intermolecular interactions also affect the bulk mass transfer, which could be described theoretically using a modified concentration polarization model. These models provide an appropriate framework to describe / optimize the performance of ultrafiltration and diafiltration processes for the purification and formulation of pegylated proteins.  \n\tThe sieving data were used to develop a diafiltration process to purify the mono-pegylated protein. Unreacted (native) protein and PEG were removed via a single diafiltration step using a highly charged membrane with relatively large pore size (300 kDa); the high retention of the mono-pegylated protein was due to a combination of steric and electrostatic exclusion. The process provided greater than 90% yield with purification factors of more than 20. A similar diafiltration process was developed for purification of a mono-pegylated protein from the di- and tri-pegylated forms, with greater than 95% yield and more than 20-fold purification. \n\tA combined reaction-membrane based separation system was developed to produce a mono-pegylated protein at high yield by continuously separating the product from the reactor. The final product yield from this reaction-separation scheme was 69%, significantly higher than the 50% yield obtained using a batch process. A simple mathematical model was developed for this reaction-separation system, providing additional insights into the underlying phenomena and a framework for the design and optimization of this type of reaction-separation process. Overall, this thesis provided a clear demonstration of the potential of using membrane-based systems for the purification and enhanced production of desired protein-polymer conjugates.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9041], "author_name_tesi": "Ruanjaikaen, Krisada ", "last_name_ssi": "Ruanjaikaen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Krisada", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney", "Andrew Zydney", "Darrell Velegol", "Michael John Janik", "Arnold Anthony Fontaine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Arnold Anthony Fontaine, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ultrafiltration", "membrane processes", "pegylated proteins", "biotechnology"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "The Influence of Natural and Human-Induced Environmental Change on the Community Composition of Temporary Ponds", "id": "6315", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4192", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The influence of environmental change on biodiversity has received a significant amount of attention in recent years.  Typically, environmental change is modeled in terms of changes in the physical environment that drive shifts in the species composition of ecosystems.  Such shifts in the physical environment can result from both natural and human-induced processes.  Anthropogenic modifications of the environment are of particular concern, as human-induced environmental change is believed to be accelerating rates of species loss.  For example, the degradation of habitat via urban development is perhaps the most overt example of human-induced environmental change.  \n\nOf the systems impacted by urbanization, wetlands appear particularly sensitive.  As amphibians commonly use wetlands for breeding habitat, and given the concern over their ongoing global declines, there is a need to quantify the effects of urbanization on the breeding distribution of amphibians.  Thus, I conducted a survey of the larval amphibian community in central Pennsylvania (U.S.A.) wetlands along an urbanization gradient.  Wetlands in urban areas had less surrounding forest and wetlands and greater road density than rural wetlands.  Urbanization was also associated with increases in hydroperiod (i.e., wetland permanency) and the presence of fish predators.  Moreover, urban wetlands had lower larval amphibian species richness than rural wetlands.  This decrease in richness was due to a decrease in occurrence of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and ambystomatid salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum and A. jeffersonianum) in urban sites.  Wood frogs and ambystomatid salamanders were positively associated with the amount of forest surrounding sites and negatively associated with hydroperiod.  As a result, I hypothesize that these species are sensitive to the effects of urban development. The remaining species in this study appear fairly resilient to the effects of urbanization.  These data demonstrate the importance of quantifying both local and landscape attributes when describing the factors that limit the breeding distribution of amphibians.  We recommend that to preserve amphibian biodiversity in urbanized landscapes, it is best to focus on regional diversity, protecting a variety of sites that encompass various hydroperiods, have adequate buffer habitat, and are connected by dispersal routes. \n \nHuman-induced environmental change need not always be as obvious as urbanization.  For example, the temperate deciduous forest of the northeastern US is believed to be undergoing a shift from mixed-oak (Quercus sp.) to red maple (Acer rubrum) dominated; a shift termed \u201cThe Red Maple Paradox\u201d.  This subtle shift in the composition of the forest is believed to be the result of human activities such as fire suppression.  Such a change in the structure of the forest has the potential to affect ecosystems within the forest that utilize leaf-litter as an energy source.  To assess the impact of \u201cThe Red Maple Paradox\u201d on detrital food webs, we conducted a mesocosm experiment investigating the influence of red maple litter on the food web of temporary woodland ponds.  Amphibian biomass and survival were significantly lower in experimental ponds that contained only maple litter.  The negative effects of maple litter were most pronounced in larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica).  I hypothesize that this effect resulted from a temporary shift from a grazing-based food web in oak mesocosms to a microbial-based food web in maple mesocosms, as oak mesocosms initially had higher levels of phytoplankton biomass and lower levels of bacterial production than maple mesocosms.  This bottom-up effect of maple litter on wood frogs then appeared to affect other amphibians and zooplankton through a complex series of interactions.  These data suggest that litter composition impacted the performance of most trophic groups by altering the processing of energy in this system, thereby destabilizing species interactions throughout the food web.  Therefore, \u201csubtle\u201d compositional shifts in the forest have the potential to influence communities that rely upon leaf-litter inputs as a primary source of energy.\n\nIn addition to human-induced changes in litterfall patterns, leaf-litter input to ecosystems has also been shown to vary naturally.  Because temporary ponds appear to rely upon allochthonous subsidies of leaf-litter to support secondary production, alterations in the flow of these inputs have the potential to influence community dynamics.  To assess the influence of variations in energetic subsidies on community composition in this ecosystem, we manipulated leaf-litter inputs in mesocosms.  Increasing leaf-litter inputs increased the dissolved organic carbon content and decreased the pH and dissolved oxygen of the mesocosms.  Increasing litter also increased the percent survival and developmental rate of wood frogs (Rana sylvatica).  Litter input appeared to have little to no influence on the zooplankton and salamander larvae of this system.  I hypothesize that the effects of litter input on wood frogs were the result of an increase in microbial production, and hence, food resources for tadpoles.  Increased production by microbes is consistent with the changes observed in the physio-chemical environment of the mesocosms.  Zooplankton and salamander larvae may have been unaffected because they may not effectively utilize microbial production.  These data indicate that detrital subsidies are important to some members of the food web of temporary ponds and that variations in these inputs have the potential to affect the performance of vulnerable species.    \n\nPerhaps the most common type of natural environmental change is succession.  Small, temporary wetlands commonly exhibit a variety of successional states, from open water, to dominated by submergent/emergent vegetation, to completely forested.  In accordance with increases in the amount of submergent/emergent vegetation in wetlands, there is also an increase in the number of invertebrate predators of amphibians.  This increase in the numbers of predators is associated with the avoidance of these sites by some amphibians for breeding.   Using field surveys, laboratory, mesocosm, and field experiments, I conducted a study of the breeding effort of amphibians in ponds of varying predation pressure and the susceptibility of the embryos and larvae of these amphibians to predators.   These data were then used to parameterize a stage-structured model examining the impacts of predation on population growth.  It was found that Jefferson\u2019s salamanders (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) avoided oviposition in ponds of higher predation pressure while spotted salamanders (A. maculatum) did not.  Moreover, A. jeffersonianum were more vulnerable to both embryonic and larval predators than A. maculatum.  The results of the model suggest that only predation acting upon multiple life-history stages can cause population growth for A. jeffersonianum to become negative.  These data provide support for the hypothesis that multi-stage predation can shape breeding distributions in amphibians by imposing strong selective costs in specific environments.  Furthermore, these data highlight the importance of conducting multi-stage studies and utilizing multiple ecological methodologies when addressing the factors that limit the distribution and abundance of organisms.   \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4165], "author_name_tesi": "Rubbo, Michael ", "last_name_ssi": "Rubbo", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katriona Shea", "Hunter Carrick", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr.", "Peter John Hudson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katriona Shea, Committee Chair", "Hunter Carrick, Committee Member", "Charles Raymond Fisher Jr., Committee Member", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["amphibians", "urbanization", "environmental change", "leaf-litter"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Exploring an underdog cause: What hinders or motivates participatory behavior in animal advocacy", "id": "15392", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7756", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The animal advocacy movement struggles to implement extensive improvements to animal conditions.

The benchmark consists of seven exercises divided into two phases, a void distribution benchmark and a DNB benchmark. A specification was created to distribute experimental information to participants. In addition, two studies were performed to determine the reliability of the experimental data. \nResults from the benchmark participants were then compiled and analyzed. Based on the final results for the first phase and preliminary results for the second phase, a number of conclusions were drawn. The codes involved tended to overpredict the void fraction at the lower elevations of the test sections and underpredict it at the higher elevations. This was attributed to the x-ray densitometer measurement method used, which was sensitive to the dependence of subchannel void distribution on flow regime. It was noted that the participants\u2019 results showed a time shift in the temperature increase transients, indicating unexpected heat transfer between the test section and downcomer. Many of the codes also experienced difficulty in accurately modeling the brief flow reduction transient, generally underpredicting the void fraction early in the transient. \nTRACE is a thermal-hydraulics code developed by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for system analysis. TRACE calculations were performed for the transient bundle void distribution test cases and the results were presented with analysis. It was concluded that TRACE was able to stay within the 5% error bound for the power increase test case, but was not able to stay within this bound for the other cases. A time shift was seen in the temperature increase test case, which was likely due to heat transfer between the downcomer and test section. This indicates that the experimental section may not have actually been adiabatic.\nThe PSU in-house code CTF, an improved version of the advanced thermal-hydraulic subchannel code COBRA-TF, was also used for preliminary scoping calculations of selected benchmark exercises. CTF was generally able to predict the void fraction in the subchannel test cases within 10% void, but was not able to stay within the 3% error bound for these cases. The CTF results stayed within the error bound for the power increase transient, but the code was not able to maintain this accuracy for the other three test cases.

To protect people and infrastructure against catastrophic events, many cities implement strategies to adapt to sea-level rise. These strategies are often designed for low annual flooding probabilities (i.e., one in 50 to one in 10,000). As a result, the design of these strategies hinges on the upper tails of sea-level rise projections.\n\nOver the past decades, studies have used various calibration methods including frequentist bootstrap and Bayesian inversion to provide probabilistic projections. However, these studies often do not estimate explicitly the upper tail and neglect the effect of known properties of observations. Sea-level observations often have autocorrelated (interdependent) residuals (model minus data) and typically have time-dependent (heteroskedastic) observation errors. In this thesis, we analyze the impact of neglecting such known observed properties on sea-level projections. Specifically, we compare the output of a semi-empirical sea-level model calibrated with different statistical estimation methods: (i) a frequentist bootstrap, (ii) a Bayesian inversion neglecting heteroskedastic residuals, and (iii) a Bayesian inversion considering heteroskedastic residuals. We show how implementing a more appropriate calibration method (in terms of accounting for known observed properties of the residuals) leads to a sizeable increase in the upper tail of sea-level rise projections. The results indicate that the choice of the calibration method can have considerable implications for the design of sea-level rise adaptation strategies.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11515], "author_name_tesi": "Ruckert, Kelsey Leigh", "last_name_ssi": "Ruckert", "middle_name_ssi": "Leigh", "first_name_ssi": "Kelsey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Klaus Keller", "Chris Eliot Forest", "James Kasting"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Klaus Keller, Thesis Advisor", "Chris Eliot Forest, Thesis Advisor", "James Kasting, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sea-level rise", "Autocorrelated projections", "Calibration methods", "Overconfidence"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Investigation of the Heat Transfer of Two Parallel Jets Impinging Normal to a Flat Surface", "id": "5q47rn72z", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12567", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The recent development of fifth generation fighter aircraft has been designed to takeoff in short distances, accelerate to supersonic flight, and land vertically. For short takeoff and vertical landing operations, STOVL, aircraft use thrust vectoring to direct high-speed, high temperature jet exhaust from the primary nozzle towards the ground. This redirection of flow provides approximately half of the thrust required for lift. The remaining thrust is generated by a lift fan which produces a sonic jet plume. The complex nature of the flow-field generated by these aircraft severely impacts the surrounding operational environment. The need to understand the high temperature, high velocity flow-field associated with these aircraft in close proximity to the ground is extremely important. These flow conditions give rise to hazardous conditions for personnel and equipment in the nearby proximity of the landing aircraft.\nTo understand the effects of high temperature impinging flows and the subsequent heat transfer into the impingement plane, the existing High Speed Aeroacoustics Laboratory was redesigned to achieve high temperatures flows while in impinging configurations. High temperature flows are achieved through the use of two electric heaters in a parallel configuration. The parallel heater configuration allows the jet exhaust on an impinging jet model to reach a total temperature ratio of 2.0 with a jet Mach number of 1.34. More importantly, the use of electric heaters and PID controllers produces stable flow conditions within \u00b1 4 K of the desired jet temperature.\nOnce facility development was completed, a series of experiments were conducted to determine the flow-field characteristics of a heated, supersonic rear jet impinging on a ground plane. A dual impinging jet model (using a cold, sonic front jet) was also studied. This model is representative of a generic military-style STOVL aircraft in a hover configuration. The operational conditions were limited to jet stand-off distances between 4 and 15 nozzle diameters, and jet Mach numbers between 1.16 and 1.56. The total temperature of the jet was also varied between 1.2 and 2.0.\nSchlieren flow visualization was used to qualify the average flow-field behavior exhibited in both single and dual jet configurations. Single jet configurations showed a strong relationship between jet stand-off distances and thickness of the thermal outwash. For dual jet configurations, the interaction between the two jets, and the subsequent mixing, can be seen. The location of this mixing region is strongly dependent on the Mach number of the rear jet.\nSteady-state and transient surface temperature measurements were also a focus in this study. Steady-state measurements were compared to adiabatic wall temperatures calculated from CFD. For the limited CFD cases, experimental results compared well with the calculations, with less than 10% difference at all locations. For single impinging jets, the normalized temperature distribution in the impingement region is heavily dependent upon the jet separation distance. For large separation distances, increases in the total temperature ratio can reduce the peak normalized temperature at the stagnation point by as much as 10%. For dual impinging jet operations, the region between the two jets experience an increase in normalized temperature when compared to the single jet operations. A slight increase in the stagnation temperature is also seen.\nTransient thermal distributions obtained for a rear jet Mach number of 1.16 at a total temperature of 1.5 and a jet separation distance of 6 nozzle diameters are compared to a transient conduction computation model. The experimental model compared poorly to the experimental model for all time increments. However the differences can be attributed to boundary condition assumptions, and accuracy can be improved with model refinement.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12595], "author_name_tesi": "Rudenko, Nicholas Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Rudenko", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nicholas Andrew Rudenko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nicholas Andrew Rudenko, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Impinging", "Jets", "Dual Jets", "Heat Transfer", "Normal Impingement"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Birth Weight, Sex Hormones and Sexual Maturation in Girls\n", "id": "8493", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1831", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among American women with over 200,000 new cases diagnosed annually. There is growing interest in the relationship between early life exposures as an antecedent for disease later in life.  Birth weight, which is associated with maternal hormone levels during pregnancy, is related to timing of puberty and incidence of hormone dependent cancers in adulthood.  The Dietary Intervention Study in Children (DISC) and Hormone Ancillary Study (HAS) was a multi-center, randomized controlled clinical trial that evaluated the effect of a reduced fat diet intervention during puberty on serum lipids, growth, maturation, and sex hormone concentrations in 301 girls enrolled at 8-10 years of age and followed for a median of 7 years.  The present investigation allows us to use the longitudinal data from the DISC in combination with birth weight and sex hormone concentrations available for a subset of DISC participants to further understand the role of early life exposures on known and suspected breast cancer risk factors.  \n Early age at menarche is a known risk factor for breast cancer.  The purpose of the first study was to test the hypothesis that birth weight is associated with age at menarche after controlling for potential confounders such as physical activity, body size, and mother\u2019s age at menarche.  Birth weight data was obtained via maternal / guardian report and was available for 203 girls (mean= 3399 g, standard deviation= 508, range 1899 \u2013 5103).  Information regarding onset of first menses was ascertained annually until menarche.   For the girls with a documented onset of menses during the study period, the mean age at menarche was 12.79 y (range 9.75 y \u2013 15.71 y).  Cox regression models were used to determine the independent effect of birth weight on age at menarche.  Follow-up or survival time was calculated in days from date of birth until date of menarche.  Low birth weight (defined as birth weight < 1 standard deviation below sample mean) was nearly significantly associated with age at menarche (HR= 1.53, 95% CI 0.96, 2.45, p = 0.07) after controlling for BMI-for-age percentile, physical activity, race and treatment group.  Among the 130 individuals for whom both birth weight and mother\u2019s age at menarche data were available, the relationship of earlier menarche among girls belonging to the low birth weight group was strengthened (HR= 1.92, 95% CI 1.07, 3.43, p = 0.03). \nThe purpose of the second study was to evaluate the association between birth weight and levels of serum hormones (estrone, estradiol, estrone sulfate, progesterone, testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS)) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).  Exposure to elevated estrogens throughout life is thought to play an important role in increasing breast cancer risk.  Serum hormone concentrations were collected at 5 points during the study, and capture the participants\u2019 hormone levels before, during, and after puberty.   Of the 301 girls randomized into one of two study arms of DISC, 286 participated in the HAS at one of more visits.  Girls were not eligible to participate in the HAS if they were pregnant or had used oral contraceptives within three months of blood collection, if they were postmenarcheal and had missing data on the date they started menses after blood collection, or if their next menses started more than 33 days after blood collection.  A total of 203/286 girls (71%) who participated in the HAS also provided birthweight data.  Mean birth weight for the sample was 3399 g (standard deviation = 508, range 1899 \u2013 5103).  Birth weight was associated with DHEAS concentration throughout the 7 years of follow-up and androstenedione concentration prior to menarche.  Low birth weight girls exhibited higher concentrations of these hormones compared to average birth weight girls.  Birth weight was also associated with post-menarche SHBG concentrations.  Low birth weight girls presented decreased SHBG concentrations compared to high birth weight girls.  In addition, certain luteal phase estrogen concentrations were positively associated with birth weight.  For pre-menarche DHEAS and androstenedione concentrations, the association with birth weight may have occurred via birth weight\u2019s effect on age at menarche.  Conversely, the relationship between post-menarche DHEAS, post-menarche SHBG, and luteal phase estradiol, non-SHBG estradiol and estrone appeared to be independent of the effect of birth weight on age at menarche.  \n\tThese studies provide evidence for the association of birth weight with age at menarache  (a documented risk factor for breast cancer); and pubertal concentrations of sex hormones.  In a secondary analyses, we the previsouly documented association of body composition with age at menarche was confirmed.  This research provides insight to understanding risk factors for an etiologically complex disease.  As the biologic mechanisms underlying these associations become better understood, there is potential for the increased development of breast cancer prevention strategies in early life and adolescence.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1816], "author_name_tesi": "Ruder, Elizabeth Hill", "last_name_ssi": "Ruder", "middle_name_ssi": "Hill", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Sibylle Kranz", "Michael J Rovine", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Joanne Dorgan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Chair", "Sibylle Kranz, Committee Chair", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "Joanne Dorgan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sex steroid hormones", "menarche", "pubertal development", "hormones adn cancer", "fetal origins", "breast cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Where Our Dead Lie Buried: Articulating American Indian Sovereignty", "id": "19618", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9374", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Where Our Dead Lie Buried argues that American Indian writer-activists of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries adapted English literacy and a variety of literary genres to their needs in order to strengthen and defend their peoples\u2019 sovereignty.

One aspect of the Black Arts Movement that critics and historians tend to agree about is its mission to use poetics to engender support for nationalist politics. Black Arts Movement writers, aesthetic activists who considered their work the \u201cspiritual sister\u201d of the Black Power movement, held poetics as the most powerful mode of persuasion. Advocating art for people\u2019s sake, these activists performed and promoted Black rhetoric through their literary productions and performances.

In practical terms, this is true. However, the activists of the Black Arts Movement did succeed to a great degree in winning the rhetorical struggle for Black consciousness. Although its legacies are more cultural than political, the Black Arts Movement has had far-reaching influence, particularly in developments in positive conceptions of blackness, in the valorization of language and its subsequent effects on educational policy, in establishing a legacy of populist dissemination of African American vernacular culture through both writing and popular music, and in setting the groundwork for important considerations of the aesthetic intersections of race with gender and sexuality.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9160], "author_name_tesi": "Rudewalker, Sarah Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Rudewalker", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Keith Gilyard", "Bernard W Bell", "Cheryl Jean Glenn", "Deborah Frances Atwater"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Keith Gilyard, Dissertation Advisor", "Bernard W Bell, Dissertation Advisor", "Cheryl Jean Glenn, Committee Member", "Deborah Frances Atwater, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rhetoric", "poetics", "Black Arts Movement", "epidectic", "vernacular theory", "Students Rights", "Hip Hop", "women writers", "Black Power", "Black English"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Organizational Learning and Disaster Management in a County Coroner's Office: A Case Study\n\n\n\n", "id": "7925", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "791", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This qualitative case study explores how a county coroner\u2019s office learns in the preparation for disaster management.

The increasing scope and sophistication of\natomically-detailed models has motivated the development of \u201chierarchical\u201d approaches, which parameterize\na low resolution, coarse-grained (CG) model based on simulations of an atomically-detailed model. The\nutility of hierarchical CG models depends on their ability to accurately incorporate the correct physics of\nthe underlying model. One approach for ensuring this \u201cconsistency\u201d between the models is to parame-\nterize the CG model to reproduce the structural ensemble generated by the high resolution model. The\nmany-body potential of mean force is the proper CG energy function for reproducing all structural distri-\nbutions of the atomically-detailed model, at the CG level of resolution. However, this CG potential is a\nconfiguration-dependent free energy function that is generally too complicated to represent or simulate. The\nmultiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) method employs a generalized Yvon-Born-Green (g-YBG) relation to\ndirectly determine a variationally optimal approximation to the many-body potential of mean force. The\nMS-CG/g-YBG method provides a convenient and transparent framework for investigating the equilibrium\nstructure of the system, at the CG level of resolution. In this work, we investigate the fundamental limitations\nand approximations of the MS-CG/g-YBG method. Throughout the work, we propose several theoretic con-\nstructs to directly relate the the MS-CG/g-YBG method to other popular structure-based CG approaches.\nWe investigate the physical interpretation of the MS-CG/g-YBG correlation matrix, the quantity responsible\nfor disentangling the various contributions to the average force on a CG site. We then employ an iterative\nextension of the MS-CG/g-YBG method that improves the accuracy of a particular set of low order correla-\ntion functions relative to the original MS-CG/g-YBG model. We demonstrate that this method provides a\npowerful framework for identifying the precise source of error in an MS-CG/g-YBG model. We then propose\na method for identifying an optimal CG representation, prior to the development of the CG model. We\nemploy these techniques together to demonstrate that in the cases where the MS-CG/g-YBG method fails\nto determine an accurate model, a fundamental problem likely exists with the chosen CG representation or\ninteraction set. Additionally, we explicitly demonstrate that while the iterative model successfully improves\nthe accuracy of the low order structure, it does so by distorting the higher order structural correlations\nrelative to the underlying model. Finally, we apply these methods to investigate the utility of the MS-CG/g-\nYBG method for developing models for systems with complex intramolecular structure. Overall, our results\ndemonstrate the power of the g-YBG framework for developing accurate CG models and for investigating\nthe driving forces of equilibrium structures for complex condensed-phase systems.

Each individual MAC policy is complex, the policies are independently developed, and the security goals that prevent vulnerabilities are usually not explicit.\nWe develop mostly-automated services to help administrators configure and deploy distributed MAC systems to prevent security vulnerabilities. Our results show that for commonly used deployments it is possible to use available information with little input from administrators to automate tasks that are manual currently. We reduce the burden of configuration on system administrators, thus making the deployment of MAC in distributed systems more practical.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5863], "author_name_tesi": "Rueda Rodriguez, Sandra Julieta ", "last_name_ssi": "Rueda Rodriguez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sandra Julieta", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Trent Ray Jaeger", "Trent Ray Jaeger", "Patrick Drew Mcdaniel", "Adam Smith", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Stephen George Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Trent Ray Jaeger, Dissertation Advisor", "Trent Ray Jaeger, Committee Chair", "Patrick Drew Mcdaniel, Committee Member", "Adam Smith, Committee Member", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Committee Member", "Stephen George Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mandatory Access Controls", "Policy Analysis", "Systems Security"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Formaldehyde Emissions Regulations: Implications for the North American Interior Wood Composite Panel Resin Industry \n\n", "id": "10593", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6146", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Formaldehyde is a known carcinogen and elevated formaldehyde levels in indoor environments can induce a variety of undesirable respiratory conditions.  Therefore, governmental agencies such as the California Air Resources Board (CARB) have enacted legislation to limit indoor formaldehyde concentrations.  Pressed wood composite panels (WCPs) and the resins that act as binders for these panels have been identified as major sources of indoor formaldehyde; and therefore have been targeted by formaldehyde emissions regulations.  The purpose of this study is to examine domestic and international formaldehyde emissions regulations for WCPs and determine the effect of formaldehyde emissions regulations on WCP resin development.\n\nA thorough review of public documents and scientific literature was conducted to develop an understanding of domestic and international formaldehyde emissions regulations that apply to WCPs.  Additionally, contacts were developed in governmental agencies and trade associations to confirm our understanding and interpretation of each regulation.  Historical context, product-specific emissions limits, test methodologies, and product certification requirements were detailed for each emissions standard.  In particular, the recently enacted California Air Resources Board (CARB) formaldehyde regulation was compared to established international formaldehyde regulations and four key differences in the areas of emissions limits, documentation, deconstructive testing, and enforcement were highlighted.\n\nEight North American resin suppliers participated in an exploratory phone survey (conducted July \u2013 August, 2008), designed to better understand their product positioning and \u201cgreen\u201d resin strategies.  These eight firms were identified as the largest suppliers to the interior wood composite panel (IWCP) industry, which includes particleboard, medium density fiberboard, hardwood plywood, and hardboard.  In 2007, the IWCP resin industry was highly concentrated and dominated by urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins.  The regulatory environment (i.e. CARB) was the most important driver of IWCP resin manufacturers\u2019 green resin programs.  Results showed a trend of increasing importance for green IWCP resin market development for the time periods defined as today, next 2 years, next 5 years, and next 10 years for pMDI suppliers whereas UF suppliers rated green IWCP resin market development as highly important over all four time periods.

Such adaptive structures have been researched heavily and put to use extensively in the aerospace industry. Currently however, little research has been conducted on the possibility of using adaptive capabilities with maritime systems. This thesis examines the possible uses and feasibility of morphing structures in Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs). UUVs are continually becoming more integral components of maritime operations, especially those associated with defense systems. The growing r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of uses and successes associated with UUVs, as well as their unique abilities, make them an excellent subject of study for morphing concepts. This thesis focuses on the possible uses of flexible hull morphing, specifically the feasibility of such adaptability in terms of range, endurance, and speed. Furthermore, methods of actuating a morphing hull system are investigated as is the construction of a small scale morphing UUV model.\nA variety of notional UUV missions including constant speed survey, constant speed survey with high speed dash, and constant power operation, were examined for notional morphing and rigid hull UUVs. Increases in range ranging from 8% to 38% were predicted for vehicles initially containing 726 to 50,000kg and operating at speeds of 3 to 12 knots respectively for the constant speed survey mission designation. For the notional mission of constant speed survey with high speed dash, increases in range of 21% to 30% were predicted for the entire operation for a 6 knot constant speed survey with dashes ranging from 9 to 15 knots. Examining the high speed dash only reveals impressive increases in range of 86% to 90% and 141% to 149% for dashes of 9 to 15 knots for initial fuel amounts of 20,000kg and 50,000kg respectively. For the constant power operation notional mission, modest increases in range of 11.5% to 12.5% were predicted for vehicles initially containing 50,000kg of fuel and operating at initial speeds of 3 to 12 knots respectively.\nA truss actuation system was designed to actuate the flexible hull of a morphing UUV. The truss actuation system is based upon a scissor linkage concept that converts horizontal translation into vertical displacement. The system is powered via a compound power screw. This truss system was constructed, tested, and situated around a small scale hull to demonstrate the proposed concept. The proposed morphing truss actuation concept is shown to be feasible and suggestions for scalability to a full-size system are made. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5187], "author_name_tesi": "Rufino, Russell John", "last_name_ssi": "Rufino", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Russell", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi", "Timothy Francis Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy Francis Miller, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adaptive Structures", "Morphing", "Torpedos", "UUVs", "Unmanned Underwater Vehicles", "Submarines"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "From Chip-in-a-lab to Lab-on-a-chip:  The Development of a Prototype for Acoustofluidic Nanoparticle Separation", "id": "25102", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11336", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) is a commonly used analytical technique for measuring the size distribution of particles in solution. DLS is an attractive technique because it is non-invasive (a low power laser is used so as not to damage the samples), requires very little sample preparation, and can extract information from small volume samples with relatively low particle concentrations. For these reasons, DLS has become a widely used analytical technique in many industries. For example, in the development of new biopharmaceuticals, one of the major limitations is the large number of tests that must be performed on limited amounts of sample.  DLS allows researchers to extract size distribution information from as little as 2 \u03bcL of sample, saving the rest of the sample for other required tests. \nAlthough the size range of particles that can be analyzed via DLS is large (ranging from .03 nm to 10 \u03bcm), careful attention must be paid to the concentration of particles larger than 500 nm. If the concentration of larger particles is too high, it can prevent accurate measurement of the smaller sized particles. However, many applications produce samples containing particles above and below 500 nm (i.e. proteins and protein aggregates). The goal of this thesis was to develop an acoustic-based separation technique that could establish a tunable cutoff diameter and remove all particles larger than the cutoff diameter. The concept of acoustic-based separation was initially demonstrated in a laboratory setting with polystyrene beads. First, mixed samples were analyzed by DLS. The samples were then passed through our acoustic filter, and the smaller fraction was again analyzed by DLS and compared to both the initial measurements and samples of known concentrations. Results showed that our acoustic filter drastically improved the quality of the DLS measurements. Finally, we replaced the expensive lab equipment with custom electronics and constructed a prototype for acoustic nanoparticle separation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10872], "author_name_tesi": "Rufo, Joseph Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Rufo", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Huang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Huang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microfluidics", "Acoustofluidics", "Dynamic Light Scattering", "Nanoparticle", "Separation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Great Maine Bathroom Case: Contesting Sex Segregation and Gender Regulation in America", "id": "13340jjr5411", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13340", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Great Maine Bathroom case is the fictional name I assigned to a series of lawsuits and appeals that were contested in the state of Maine from 2008 through 2014. They were brought by a young elementary school child who was blocked from using the girl\u2019s bathroom because she was a transgender girl. For all social intents and purposes the plaintiff was a girl, but her pre-pubescent genital anatomy, if examined, was contradictory. When the case reached the state\u2019s Supreme Court it marked the first time that any high court in the nation was asked to decide whether gender, or sex, was to be the determinant for admission to a sex-segregated space. Among the many issues the case opened for interrogation was the long history and practice of sex-segregation in (post-discovery) America and its reflexive function in shaping the nation\u2019s socio-political ideology. I use a narrative of the case to provide intellectual portals into this and other problems related to the ways the sex/gender system operates to provide and maintain hierarchical advantage in America\u2019s liberal democracy. \nThroughout the dissertation I focus on how those who cross gender\u2014those whom we call \u201ctransgender\u201d today\u2014have served to disrupt and destabilize not only the man/woman dualism, but also the gender/sex and mind/body dualisms. Inasmuch as these individuals provoke categorical crises in a Western culture that relies upon such a framework to maintain order, they have been vigorously persecuted. Examining two figures from the 19th century, I argue that the gender-crosser\u2019s subversive existence has also offered a beneficial mode of influence in and through its ability to mediate and transcend seemingly oppositional dichotomies. However, as this accomplishment has been less than welcomed in today\u2019s neo-liberal political ideology, I note the current juridical-medical effort to fit this unruly group into traditional, manageable categories. This is possible because contemporary technology has allowed the sexed body to be transformed to match the gendered brain, potentially offering a resolution to the mind/body conflict. I argue that this solution serves the capitalistic state well, but that it does so by denying the possibility of an equitable, gender-egalitarian society. I show how the current \u201ctransgender agenda\u201d to accept and assimilate transgender students\u2014that is so vigorously attacked by social conservatives\u2014actually serves to reify and maintain the traditional sex/gender system. I conclude by positing that the transcendent, mediatory figure of the uncategorizable gender-crosser offers our divided, dogmatic society an ideal deus ex machina.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13037], "author_name_tesi": "Ruhsam, Jonatha Jeanine", "last_name_ssi": "Ruhsam", "middle_name_ssi": "Jeanine", "first_name_ssi": "Jonatha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "American Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Rogers Haddad", "John Rogers Haddad", "Charles David Kupfer", "Anthony Buccitelli", "Kamini Grahame"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Rogers Haddad, Dissertation Advisor", "John Rogers Haddad, Committee Chair", "Charles David Kupfer, Committee Member", "Anthony Buccitelli, Committee Member", "Kamini Grahame, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["American Studies", "gender", "sex segregation", "gender crossing", "transgender", "liberal democracy", "third gender", "L.

CO2 uptake and water evaporation are controlled at the plant surface by the opening and closure of stomatal pores. Each stoma is surrounded by a pair of guard cells, and guard cell identity is acquired through a series of cell differentiation and division events, which are transcriptionally regulated by intercellular signaling. However, subsequent steps in stomatal development, including stomatal pore initiation and enlargement, remain unexplored. To investigate how pores arise, we combined 3D time-lapse confocal imaging with genetic and pharmacological perturbations of pectin modification or turgor pressure to test the enzymatic and mechanical contributions to the spatially limited separation of paired guard cells. Our data suggest that although pectin modification, but not turgor increase, plays a significant role in pore initiation, both processes contribute to stomatal pore enlargement. \n\nFast and reversible stomatal movements are driven by changes in turgor pressure in guard cells, but how the walls that surround guard cells facilitate stomatal dynamics is unclear. Using genetic, cytological, and biochemical approaches, we observed that cell walls are actively synthesized and modified in young guard cells in seedlings, and that the deposited walls provide the structural basis for stomatal movements in mature guard cells in adult plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, stomatal pore widths and changes in guard cell length during stomatal movements are increased in mutants deficient in cellulose, a major determinant of wall mechanics, but reduced in mutants lacking xyloglucan, a hemicellulose, suggesting that cellulose constrains, whereas xyloglucan facilitates the anisotropic expansion and contraction of guard cells. Pectins, a third class of wall polysaccharide, confer flexibility to the guard cell wall through the modulation of pectin size and abundance by pectinases. Mutants with more abundant and crosslinked pectins have defects in stomatal closure dynamics, whereas reductions in pectin abundance, size, and crosslinking cause faster stomatal opening. Our experimental data also allow us to predict that cell wall reorganization in guard cells might underlie stomatal dynamics: during stomatal closure, cellulose microfibrils become bundled and pectins are crosslinked by Ca2+; during stomatal opening, cellulose distributes diffusely and pectin networks are uncoupled. Cellulose reorganization depends on sufficient production of cellulose and xyloglucan, whereas pectin reorganization is maintained by the right amount and size of pectins.  \n\nIn summary, our findings shed light on the mechanisms by which guard cells are separated in a spatiotemporally controlled fashion to form a stomatal pore, and how different classes of wall polysaccharides allow stomata to function as tunable valves for the control of photosynthesis and transpiration in plants.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16440], "author_name_tesi": "Rui, Yue ", "last_name_ssi": "Rui", "first_name_ssi": "Yue", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles T Anderson", "Charles T Anderson", "Sarah Mary Assmann", "Gabriele Brigitte Monshausen", "Virendra Puri"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles T Anderson, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles T Anderson, Committee Chair", "Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Member", "Gabriele Brigitte Monshausen, Committee Member", "Virendra Puri, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stomata", "plant cell walls", "dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Assessing the persuasive effects of temporal distance and social distance on intentions to volunteer", "id": "15361", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7833", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current study examined the persuasive impact of employing various levels of psychological distance in prosocial communications, specifically social and temporal distance.

Both of these species are formidable fruit pests that are associated with many plants and are considered economically important pests.  Both species have a wide geographic distribution with occasional infestations occurring in the US.  This research evaluates the utility of a sequence-based approach for two mitochondrial genes and nuclear markers.   We assess these markers as genetic tools for revealing historical processes, for delineating populations, and examining for population structure.  \nThe Mexican fruit fly is a major pest of orange and grapefruit occurring in Mexico and C. America.  I analyzed 543 A. ludens individuals from 67 geographic collections and found one predominant haplotype occurring in the majority of specimens.  I observed 68 haplotypes in all and see a substantial difference among haplotypes belonging to northern and southern groups of collections.  The results show that COI and ND6 are useful for phylogeographic studies of A. ludens and may be used for pathway analysis. \nThe West Indian fruit fly is a major pest of mango and plum contributing to millions of dollars in damage each year throughout its geographic range.  The current geographic distribution for A. obliqua includes areas stretching from N. Mexico, C. America, and S. America as far and N. Argentina, as well as the Caribbean.  West Indian fruit fly specimens were examined for genetic variation at two spatial scales.  The first study is of specimens gathered from five different host species over three years in the Mexican state of Veracruz represent those geographic collections examined at a local scale.  Additional collections gathered from throughout the geographic range represent the second study of this species. \nIn Veracuz, numerous specimens were examined for variation that may be due to the influence by ecological factors using mtDNA and nuclear markers.  Here, five species of infested fruit was collected over three years and fruit fly larvae were allowed to emerge and mature to adults.  I sequenced two genes (COI and NDI) and used 17 nuclear loci from these flies and revealed that the populations examined in Veracruz represent one panmictic population. The value of this information is especially important to the management of this pest because it reveals that one management strategy is sufficient.  Additionally, this information is used in knowing the diversity of this pest at this window in time. \nFifty-four collections of A. obliqua were sequenced in a broader geographic study.  Mitochondrial regions from the COI and ND6 genes reveal six populations throughout the distribution of this fly.  I recovered 61 haplotypes from the 349 individuals gathered from 54 localities.  Many of these haplotypes were either site specific or region specific making this a useful tool for pathway analysis.  There were substantial differences seen among the lineages represented by the haplogroups.  The amount of divergence seen among these four haplogroups is in line with differences seen among other closely related taxa I analyzed.  This would suggest that a review of taxanomic keys is needed. Also, additional analyses perhaps with unlinked loci are needed to evaluate the level of interaction among different lineages that co-occur. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5348], "author_name_tesi": "Ruiz, Raul ", "last_name_ssi": "Ruiz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Raul", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Mc Pheron", "Bruce A Mc Pheron", "Michael Craig Saunders", "Shelby Jay Fleischer", "David Michael Geiser", "Norman Barr"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Mc Pheron, Dissertation Advisor", "Bruce A Mc Pheron, Committee Chair", "Michael Craig Saunders, Committee Member", "Shelby Jay Fleischer, Committee Member", "David Michael Geiser, Committee Member", "Norman Barr, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Phylogeographic", "PCR", "Anastrepha"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "EFFECTS OF THE FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS CELERATION CHART ON DECISION MAKING FOR BOARD CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR ANALYSTS ", "id": "15040sur190", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15040", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Functional Analysis (FA) has contributed significantly to the field of Applied Behavior Analysis.

Significant progress has been demonstrated but the performance degrades rapidly when occlusion occurs. We propose a binary quadratic optimization framework for multi-pedestrian detections to improve pedestrian detection, especially when there is an occlusion. The pedestrian detection problem is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. The formulation reasons directly over the space of overlapping among object detections as a pairwise measurement and an individual detection confidence score as a unary measurement. The tradeoff between detection confidences and amounts of overlap is optimized thereby allowing a more relaxed selection compared to conventional non-maximum suppression approach. Although QUBO is an NP-hard problem, efficient approximate methods are available, and these yield high quality solutions on large problem sizes.\n   The core concept of optimized detection framework is to generate a large set of possible detection candidates and then use the optimization method to select a subset of those candidates that best represents the detection. The optimized detection framework is further applied to a multiple-body-part representation called \"body plan\". With the adoption of multiple parts, reasoning about occlusions among pairs of overlapped detections \n,by applying a positive (reward) and negative (penalty) pairwise scores, can help to decide whether the missing body part is likely due to being occluded. Besides detection candidates, it is also applicable to use tracklets of matching as candidates and formulate the problem as non bipartite matching graph. We reformulate the non bipartite matching problem into a Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization that solves for a set of detections along with data association.\nThe proposed optimized detection framework shows that quadratic optimization for reasoning about overlapping detections and quality of an individual detection can improve the performance of a pedestrian detection system, especially when there are multiple occluded persons.

This dissertation aimed to (1) clarify how peers may shape the development of problem behavior and promote the diffusion of intervention effects and (2) address several measurement challenges that arise in longitudinal studies of peer relationships and behavior.\n\n  Study 1 used actor-oriented social network models to test hypotheses about selection and influence while controlling for other processes that impact friendship and aggression. Data were from 480 youth followed biannually from 6th to 7th grade. After controlling for selection in other domains, there was no evidence for selection with respect to aggression, but there was evidence of influence. Girls were more likely to select aggressive friends and low status youth were more susceptible to influence. Rejected youth were not more likely to select or be influenced by aggressive friends.\n\n  Study 2 was motivated by the possibility that effects from family-based interventions may diffuse through peer networks allowing non-participants to benefit from the intervention. Indices that capture network-level features of diffusion potential were identified within a sample of 33 6th grade networks participating in an intervention trial. These indices were uncorrelated with non-network measures of diffusion potential (e.g. participation rate), demonstrating discriminant validity. Diffusion potential indices varied considerably across networks, suggesting that some networks were more likely to support diffusion than others.\n\n  Study 3 demonstrated that the Graded Partial Credit Model for Repeated Measures (GPCM-RM) could recover reasonable estimates of latent trait and change scores across multiple conditions. When the GPCM-RM was applied to data from the National Youth Survey, inter-individual differences in delinquency were highly stable across adolescence with population-level increases over time. Observed average scores indicated that delinquency was moderately stable, increasing then decreasing over time. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored.\n\n  Taken together, these studies demonstrate how different measurement models can inform our understanding of peer relationships and problem behavior.

The first study (Chapter 3) explores the photoisomerization of the rotor probe 9-(2-carboxy-2-cyanovinyl)julolidine, or CCVJ. Rotor probes are a class of fluorophores that undergo photoinduced isomerization reactions resulting in non-radiative relaxation out of the excited state. Literature reports had suggested that CCVJ exhibited a \u2018flow effect,\u2019 in which the emission intensity of CCVJ increases when the fluorophore solution is flowed at modest rates. Using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence and 1H-NMR spectroscopy we show that the flow effect can be attributed to creation of a mixture of fluorescent and non-fluorescent CCVJ isomers by the excitation.\n\nThe next study, Chapter 4, examines the the fluorescence of DNA G-quadruplex structures (GQSs), non-helical single-stranded DNA structures that exhibit quantum yields significantly higher than helical DNA or its constituent bases. By using a constant GQS core sequence we show that the addition of \u2018dangling\u2019 nucleotides can modulate emission from the GQS whereas conventional quenchers do not. The emission can also be altered by changes in temperature and addition of crowding reagents such as poly(ethylene glycol). Using time-resolved emission spectroscopy we show that GQS emission can be approximately dissected into two emitting populations with distinct kinetics.\n\nChapters 5 and 6 report on the effects of solvation on charge transfer reactions in conventional\nmolecular solvents and ionic liquid/conventional solvent mixtures. In Chapter 5 the excited state intramolecular proton transfer reaction of 4\u2032-N,N-diethylamino-3-hydroxyflavone (DEAHF) is studied using sub-picosecond Kerr-gated emission spectroscopy in mixtures of acetonitrile and propylene carbonate. Previous studies of DEAHF tautomerization had shown that the proton transfer rate and equilibrium constant are highly dependent on both solvation dynamics and solvent polarity. Using acetonitrile/propylene carbonate mixtures, which have nearly identical polarity but have solvation times that vary over an order of magnitude, we were able to demonstrate that fast solvation dynamics introduces a barrier to the reaction and slows down the proton transfer rate. In Chapter 6 the intramolecular electron transfer reaction of 9-(4-biphenyl)-10-methylacridinium (BPAc+) is studied in mixtures of an ionic liquid and acetonitrile. Using KGE and picosecond time-correlated single photon counting measurements we show that the BPAc+ electron transfer rate is highly correlated with the mixture solvation time, consistent with rates observed in conventional solvents.\n\nFinally, Chapters 7 and 8 are an exploration of solute rotational dynamics in ionic liquids (ILs). Solute rotations in these unique solvents have been shown to be non-diffusive and poorly predicted by hydrodynamic theories of friction. We set out to explore the mechanisms of solute rotation in ILs using a combination of experimental methods and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In Chapter 7 the rotational dynamics of benzene and the IL cation 1- ethyl-3-methylimidizolium are studied using a combination of 2H longitudinal spin relaxation (T1) measurements and MD simulations. Using the simulations for guidance, we were able to interpret T1 measurements outside of the extreme narrowing limit. After the realism of the simulations was validated, they were then used to show that benzene exhibits markedly different dynamics for \u2018spinning\u2019 about the C6 symmetry axis and \u2018tumbling\u2019 (rotation of the C6 axis), and that large amplitude jump motions and orientational caging are prominent features of benzene\u2019s rotations in ILs. Chapter 8 extends the benzene work to examine the effect of molecular size and charge distribution on solute rotational dynamics in ILs. Combining fluorescence anisotropy and T1 relaxation measurements with MD simulations of a carefully chosen set of probe molecules we show that molecular charge has only a modest effect of friction experienced by a rotating solute, whereas an increase in molecular size results in a substantial increase in rotation times. After validation of the simulations, we showed that large amplitude jumps and orientational caging dynamics, similar to what was observed with benzene, are also present in these solutes.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14586], "author_name_tesi": "Rumble, Christopher Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Rumble", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Maroncelli", "Mark Maroncelli", "John B Asbury", "William George Noid", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Maroncelli, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Chair", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "William George Noid, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electron transfer", "proton transfer", "ionic liquids", "ultrafast spectroscopy", "rotational dynamics", "solvation dynamics", "T1 relaxation", "G-quadruplexes", "charge transfer", "molecular rotors", "fluorescence", "molecular dynamics simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Framework for MIME Type Identification and Content Filtering in the Firefox Web Browser", "id": "16186", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8242", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Modern Web browser architectures allow for extensibility in order to support an evolving variety of content.

In order to increase our understanding of the post-stocking loss of hatchery-reared trout, and to improve current management of cold-water fisheries, we examined the survival rates, dispersal, behavior, and great blue heron predation of recently stocked salmonids.  The number of trout recaptured after release was low, with the majority of the loss occurring within the first two weeks of release.  No interspecific differences in survival and recapture rates were observed among brook, brown, and rainbow trout.  Trout remaining within the area of initial release were consistently smaller, in terms of total length and mass, than those that had dispersed beyond the area of initial release.  During behavior observations, trout that had remained within the area of initial release initiated more aggressive encounters and were more active than trout that had dispersed to sites beyond the area of release.  The loss of hatchery reared trout appeared to be a combination of active dispersal and mortality due to predation.

The parametric approach takes statistical noise into account, which can provide accurate measures in a stochastic environment. In this study the static shadow price approach and the dynamic duality model of intertemporal decision making are integrated to formulate theoretical and econometric models of dynamic efficiency in the presence of intertemporal cost minimizing firm behavior. The dynamic efficiency model measures the firms\u2019 inefficiency and accounts for allocative and technical inefficiencies of net investment and variable inputs.\n\nA theoretically consistent method to measure the decomposition of dynamic total factor productivity growth in the presence of inefficiency is used to construct the dynamic total factor productivity growth that is adjusted for deviations from the long-run equilibrium within an adjustment-cost framework. This leads to the specific decomposition of the efficiency gain or loss as a source in explaining the growth.\n\nThe dynamic efficiency model is implemented empirically using a panel data set of 72 U.S. major investor-owned electric utilities using fossil fuel-fired steam electric power generation during the time period of 1986 to 1999. Given a quadratic functional form to specify a value function of the dynamic programming equation, the dynamic efficiency model is applied to estimate the cost inefficiency of electric utilities and to decompose the cost inefficiency into allocative and technical inefficiencies of net investment and variable inputs, and to characterize the cost structure of the electric utilities under dynamic adjustment. The decomposition of the dynamic total factor productivity growth in the presence of inefficiency is estimated as a means to evaluate how different electric utilities participate in the deregulation of electricity generation. Finding that the electric utilities are perfectly technically efficient in net investment, the empirical results of this study are summarized as follows. First, electric utilities with relatively high technical inefficiency of variable input demand in states adopting a deregulation plan improve the performance of the utilities. The results indicate that the difference of allocative efficiencies of variable inputs and net investment by the group of electric utilities affected by the deregulation plan is not significant. Second, the estimates of the input price elasticities indicate the substitution possibilities among the inputs. Most electric utilities in this study are over-capitalized in the production and the estimates suggest the supporting evidence of increasing returns to scale in the production of the electricity industry. Finally, the results indicate that electric utilities located within states with the deregulation plan had lower average annual total factor productivity growth than those located outside of these states. The lower total factor productivity growth of electric utilities located within states with the deregulation plan results from the lower technological progress and combined scale effects but they have a higher combined efficiency effect than those located outside of these states. The results suggest that electric utilities located within states with the deregulation plan anticipated deregulation to a greater extent than those located outside these states.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6007], "author_name_tesi": "Rungsuriyawiboon, Supawat ", "last_name_ssi": "Rungsuriyawiboon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Supawat", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mineral Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou", "Edward C Jaenicke", "Timothy J Considine", "Adam Zachary Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Spiro E Stefanou, Committee Chair", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Member", "Timothy J Considine, Committee Member", "Adam Zachary Rose, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Adjustment Cost", "Shadow Cost Approach", "Productivity", "Efficiency", "Dynamic Duality Model", "Deregulation", "Restructuring", "Electricity"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Tight Junction Protein Occludin Contributes to Centrosome Separation, Cell Cycle Progression, and Barrier Properties\n", "id": "11595", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1715", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The transmembrane tight junction (TJ) protein occludin has been implicated in a variety of cell processes including barrier properties particularly towards small cations, regulation of permeability through endocytosis, and growth control. A number of studies have identified phosphorylation sites on occludin that regulate its interaction with other junctional proteins and may regulate its function. The overall goal of this dissertation was to test the hypothesis that phosphorylation of the tight junction protein occludin on Ser490 contributes to growth control and barrier function.\nIn this study, the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line was used to study the function of a previously identified occludin phosphorylation site, Ser490. Stable transfection of the phosphomimetic Ser490 (S490D) and the non-phosphorylatable (S490A) mutants along with the wild type (WT) and empty vector (EV) were used to determine the role of occludin Ser490 in growth control. Here, we show that occludin is present at centrosomes in interphase and occludin Ser490 is phosphorylated throughout mitosis and co-localized with mitotic centrosomes in MDCK cells. Occludin S490D expressing cells showed localization of occludin at centrosomes and increased proliferation. Conversely, occludin S490A impeded centrosome separation, lowered the mitotic index following release from S-phase synchronization, and reduced proliferation. This chapter of the dissertation provides evidence that occludin is present at centrosomes and potentially regulates cell cycle progression through Ser490 phosphorylation mediated centrosome separation and subsequent mitotic entry. \nIn primary bovine retinal endothelial cells (BREC), phosphorylation of occludin Ser490 controls vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced permeability. While this process is now well-defined in the retinal vasculature, an understanding of the occludin Ser490 phosphorylation contribution to small molecule permeability of epithelial cells and TJ assembly is lacking. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) treatment of MDCK cells results in occludin phosphorylation and redistribution from the TJ concurrent with increases in permeability similar to the changes observed in endothelial cells treated with VEGF. Here, we verified conservation of occludin Ser490 phosphorylation in MDCK cells in response to PDGF treatment. Occludin expression was sufficient to reduce transcellular permeability to 467 Da tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) and arginine (Arg); however, occludin S490A further reduced TAMRA permeability while occludin S490D failed to reduce Arg permeability to the extent of wild-type (WT) and S490A. In addition, occludin S490D cells assembled the TJ in a manner similar to those expressing the empty vector, while expression of occludin WT accelerated TJ assembly. Interestingly, occludin S490A further accelerated TJ assembly. No construct affected protein content; however, in cells that stably express occludin S490A ZO-1 appeared at the TJ earlier during the recovery period. Collectively, this chapter of the dissertation provides evidence that inhibition of occludin Ser490 phosphorylation tightens the barrier and accelerates TJ assembly.\nAngiogenesis is a major feature of pathology of retinal diseases and complications including retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and diabetic retinopathy. A common feature of these pathologies is an increase in VEGF. Here, we show that similarly to epithelial cells, occludin Ser490 phosphorylation is increased during mitosis. In addition, occludin Ser490 phosphorylation is increased during early angiogenesis in the oxygen-induced retinopathy model, which mimics ROP. Further, transient expression of occludin S490A in BREC reduced proliferation basally and in response to VEGF while occludin Ser490 phosphorylation state did not affect endothelial cell migration in a wound healing assay. Finally, in agreement with previous studies, reduction of occludin in human retinal endothelial cells increased proliferation. This chapter of the dissertation provides data that identifies occludin as a growth regulator in endothelial cells and suggests occludin Ser490 phosphorylation is important to retinal angiogenesis, likely as an early event, and while phosphorylation status is critical to VEGF-induced proliferation and permeability, it likely does not affect migration. The work presented here extends previous findings in regards to occludin Ser490 phosphorylation to state that this residue is critical to growth control as well as barrier function. The data described in this dissertation, taken together with published reports, strongly implicate occludin Ser490 phosphorylation as a potential point of therapeutic intervention in diseases of angiogenesis. Thus, this dissertation demonstrates that the tight junction protein occludin contributes to centrosome separation, cell cycle progression, and barrier function.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1701], "author_name_tesi": "Runkle, Edwin Aaron", "last_name_ssi": "Runkle", "middle_name_ssi": "Aaron", "first_name_ssi": "Edwin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Antonetti", "David A Antonetti", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Scot R Kimball", "Christopher J Lynch", "Lisa M Shantz", "Christopher Charles Norbury"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Antonetti, Dissertation Advisor", "David A Antonetti, Committee Chair", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Committee Chair", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Christopher J Lynch, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mitosis", "Centrosomes", "Tight Junctions", "Occludin", "Barrier Function"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Bif-1 Regulates EGFR Endocytosis and Chemotactic Cell Migration in Breast Cancer", "id": "15551", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7472", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and perpetual signaling are well documented as contributing factors to disease progression and metastasis in several types of cancer including breast cancer. Ligand (EGF)-stimulated EGFR activation leads to receptor internalization and endocytic trafficking to the lysosome for cargo degradation which functions as a mechanism to control EGFR expression and downstream signaling pathways. The EGFR degradation process is frequently dysregulated in cancer cells, leading to enhanced EGFR expression and mitogenic signaling. Therefore, gaining a more thorough understanding of the mechanisms governing EGFR endocytic trafficking is of great importance to both cell and cancer biology. \n\nThe findings presented in this dissertation demonstrate that the tumor suppressor Bif-1 plays an important role in the regulation of EGFR endocytic degradation and chemotactic migration in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Specifically, loss of Bif-1 expression delays EGFR degradation and sustains downstream signaling through extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in response to EGF stimulation. During endosome maturation, active Rab5 is displaced from the early endosome concomitant with the recruitment and activation of Rab7 on endosomal membranes. This process of Rab conversion is critical for the proper endocytic trafficking of EGFR to lysosomes for degradation. Mechanistically, loss of Bif-1 results in prolonged co-localization of EGF with Rab5-positive endosomes and delays EGFR trafficking to lysosomes. Furthermore, the recruitment of Rab7 to EGF-positive vesicles and the activation of Rab7 are impaired in Bif-1 knockdown cells. Additionally, the pH and the localization of acidic vesicles are altered by suppression of Bif-1. These findings support a function for Bif-1 in regulating endosome maturation during EGF-induced EGFR endocytosis. \n\nInterestingly, these findings demonstrate that inhibition of Bif-1 does not alter cell proliferation but increases chemotactic cell migration in response to EGF or serum, which correlates with prolonged cytoskeletal reorganization. Importantly, the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib, abolishes the effect of Bif-1 on EGF-induced cell migration. Taken together, the data described in this dissertation demonstrate a novel function for Bif-1 in endosome maturation during EGF-induced EGFR endocytosis and identify Bif-1 as a suppressor of breast cancer cell chemotaxis. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7418], "author_name_tesi": "Runkle, Kristin Beth", "last_name_ssi": "Runkle", "middle_name_ssi": "Beth", "first_name_ssi": "Kristin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Gang Wang", "Jin Ming Yang", "Carl Bart Rountree", "Richard Bernard Mailman", "Edward Joseph Gunther"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Gang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jin Ming Yang, Committee Member", "Carl Bart Rountree, Committee Member", "Richard Bernard Mailman, Committee Member", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["EGFR", "Endocytosis", "Cell Migration", "Breast Cancer", "Bif-1", "Rab7"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Chemically-mediated interactions between the parasitic plant Cuscuta pentagona, its host plants, and insect herbivores", "id": "8287", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2573", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Parasitic plants are some of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most destructive agricultural pests and have significant impacts on the dynamics of the communities they inhabit.  Yet, the ecology of interactions between parasitic plants and their hosts remain largely unexplored.  In this work we investigate the chemical-mediation of interactions between the economically important parasitic plant, Cuscuta pentagona, and its host plants.  Cuscuta spp. (dodders) are yellowish vines that lack roots or expanded leaves, and are dependent on aboveground attachment to other plants for water and nutrients.  After germination, seedlings must forage and locate a suitable host within a few days in order to survive.  We show that location and discrimination of hosts by C. pentagona seedlings is guided by plant volatiles, thus providing a compelling example of volatile communication between plants.  We next examined how C. pentagona affected host plant (tomato) defenses against insect herbivores.  Parasitism greatly reduced host-plant production of the anti-herbivore phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) and plant volatiles induced by caterpillar feeding, in part via antagonism of the herbivore- and parasite-induced defense signaling pathways.   We also examined the induced responses of tomato to attack by C. pentagona and show that both JA and salicylic acid (SA) defense pathways are sequentially activated.  Moreover, these pathways both regulate effective defenses against C. pentagona.  Lastly, we review the chemical ecology of seed germination and host location by the major parasitic weeds of crops and discuss the potential for manipulating these mechanisms for sustainable control of these agricultural pests.

First, is a continuous GAD diagnosis better able to predict the treatment response of worried individuals than a categorical GAD diagnosis? Second, can the known benefits of stimulus control and problem solving interventions for worry be improved by the addition of relaxation training and cognitive restructuring commonly used in the treatment of GAD? Third, does the GAD status of a worried individual interact with the number of therapy components that are received to predict treatment outcome? To address these questions, 72 highly worried individuals were diagnosed under both a categorical (DSM-IV) and a dimensional (severity) GAD model and then provided with one of two brief cognitive-behavioral interventions for severe worry. The two interventions were compared using an additive methodological design and involved a single, group-administered treatment session followed by approximately four weeks of self-guided skills rehearsal and application using a therapy workbook. Participants were assessed for GAD, worry, anxiety, depression, global functioning, and quality of life before and after treatment. Results revealed the dimensional GAD diagnosis to predict some important treatment outcomes more powerfully than the categorical GAD diagnosis, particularly the symptoms and functioning observed at the end of treatment. Results also showed both of the inexpensive, stimulus-control-based anxiety treatments to yield substantial improvement in worrying and associated pathology, with relaxation training and cognitive restructuring providing a small but consistent increment in treatment benefit that appeared especially helpful for non-GAD worriers. Finally, results revealed that while GAD-diagnosed and nondiagnosed high worriers benefited considerably from these worry-focused treatments, GAD worriers generally evidenced greater improvement -- but poorer endstate functioning -- than non-GAD worriers. These preliminary findings contribute to ongoing discourse over the relative utility of categorical versus continuous classification models of psychopathology. In addition, they advance efforts to better understand, more usefully diagnose, and more effectively and efficiently treat the symptoms of generalized anxiety.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [287], "author_name_tesi": "Ruscio, Ayelet Meron", "last_name_ssi": "Ruscio", "middle_name_ssi": "Meron", "first_name_ssi": "Ayelet", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas D Borkovec", "Louis Georges Castonguay", "Michelle Gayle Newman", "Craig Edelbrock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas D Borkovec, Committee Chair", "Louis Georges Castonguay, Committee Member", "Michelle Gayle Newman, Committee Member", "Craig Edelbrock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["generalized anxiety disorder", "worry", "diagnosis", "classification", "predictive validity", "stimulus control interventions", "self-administered treatments"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Assisted Reproduction of Race: Thinking Through Race as a Reproductive Technology\n", "id": "18412", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "8857", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project explores how notions of race and racial identity function within assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), offering two important philosophical contributions. The first contribution is to philosophical discussion surrounding ARTs. While feminists and bioethicists have engaged in a variety of critical analyses of ARTs, often exploring their gendered dimensions, the role of race in ART practices has gone undertheorized. Employing an approach based less in bioethics than in philosophy of technology, Chapter One addresses this deficit by highlighting the racialized construction of \u201cinfertility,\u201d the ways in which ART practices participate in and further racialized systems of global inequality, and the role of race in the construction and maintenance of the \u201cnatural\u201d in and through ART use. The second contribution is to philosophical discussion surrounding race itself. In an effort to shift our thinking on race from debates over what race is to investigations of what race does (and how), Chapter Two argues that race should be considered technologically. This consideration makes use of several different (though not fully distinct) conceptions of technology and examines how race might be considered as technology in several different (though not fully distinct) contexts, highlighting the fact that race is both produced and productive. Race ideas and racial science are both human inventions, and have been used (and continue to be used, consciously or unconsciously) to carry out a variety of political projects. Chapter Three describes the growth of racial science as undergirded by beliefs both in the power of race to drive history and in the need to take control of this power. Chapter Four discusses how notions of race have organized the American concept of kinship, arguing that this history of the association of race and kinship in the American imaginary allows race to serve as a proxy for kinship in the contemporary fertility clinic. Finally, Chapter Five looks at our current era of (neo)liberal (repro)eugenics and argues that race is operating within and being transformed by what Foucault called technologies of the self.

This dissertation explains the practices and characteristics of a unique group of these American sport riders who embraced off-road motorcycle competition in the 1960s and 1970s. It reveals a cultural entity vastly different from the more flamboyant \u201cbiker\u201d and \u201coutlaw\u201d groups, investigated by scholars over the past few decades. These enthusiasts relied on a close-knit group of fellow riders and dealers, and usually maintained and modified their bikes themselves. This group continued an American racing subculture far removed from that of the on-road motorcyclists. The freedom to try new things, expressed in early 1970s world culture, further propelled off-road riding and racing, contributing to the \u201cmotorcycle boom\u201d and the 1973 high point of motorcycle sales in the United States.\n \tOne of the several high-quality racing motorcycles available to these sport riders was the German Maico. Maico developed a particularly exceptional motorcycle that attracted many of the most committed riders in the United States in the 1950s through 1981. While several other motorcycle brands attracted similar followings, and could perhaps provide an equally good material culture object from which to assess the men who rode them, Maico\u2019s status as the finest of the brands and its very unique rise and fall, lend the story special appeal and make Maico a optimal touchstone for the culture. \n\tThe young men who embraced this culture came from varied backgrounds, but were largely working class and, despite long hair and their devotion to motorcycles, conservative in outlook. These socio-economic markers will each be analyzed. Many of the young men structured their lives in order to be able to race. Maico, in turn, sponsored these racers on a limited basis and used images of their successes to promote their motorcycles. Some period photographs of young men on Maicos have become iconic, and these will be analyzed.\n\tThe successes and ultimate failure of the Maico Company are important in themselves, revealing a complex transnational relationship with the United States that at times flourished, but on other occasions hastened the company\u2019s downfall. As Maico management displaced their American distributers in the mid-1970s and roiled with family infighting at home, the company\u2019s fortunes declined. Examination also reveals a unique and sometimes contentious relationship among American consumers and the German manufacturer. The peculiarities of Maico motorcycles, combined with internal struggles and competition from around the world, further pressured Maico. In 1983, two years after introducing the off-road motorcycle considered by many to be the single best ever made, Maico collapsed.\n\tMaico devotees left the field as better motorcycles were available and as age, injuries, and life events pressured them. Many discovered after joining professional life late, that their adventure had been purchased at a cost. Yet the memories of exhilaration, freedom, and joy remain, and these memories prod men today to collect, restore, and ride Maico motorcycles.\n\tThis work chronicles the object\u2019s origins in Germany and especially its use in the United States. \tMy methodology comprises four approaches, including: examining the motorcycle/artifact through the lens of material culture; ethnography of individuals and examination of the group\u2019s practices (largely derived from oral histories); the rhetorical and visual analysis of personal letters, advertisements, and articles; and photographic analysis. Texts by prominent motorcycling writers and American Studies scholars are used to support my thesis. This work is hoped to be of use to those examining American leisure activities and middle/working-class life in the period surrounding the 1970s, as well as anyone desiring insights into American motorcycle racing and off-road riding culture of the late 1900s.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10551], "author_name_tesi": "Russell, David Wayne", "last_name_ssi": "Russell", "middle_name_ssi": "Wayne", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "American Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles David Kupfer", "Charles David Kupfer", "Simon Josef Bronner", "Anne Ayer Verplanck", "Seth Wolpert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles David Kupfer, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles David Kupfer, Committee Chair", "Simon Josef Bronner, Committee Member", "Anne Ayer Verplanck, Committee Member", "Seth Wolpert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Maico", "motorcycling", "motorcycle", "racing", "Seventies", "1970s"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Stochastic Models for Individual and Collective Animal Movement", "id": "m039k489b", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12877", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Several novel models for analyzing animal movement data are presented in this dissertation.

Taken together, these observations raise the question of how many proteins are localized in a bacterium, which is the focus of Chapter 2. With the discovery of localized proteins, another question is how proteins are directed to the correct sub-cellular address. In accordance, the findings presented in Chapter 3 suggest that localization signals direct proteins to subcellular positions.

In a size regime where dimensions and structure may dictate material properties, colloidal nanoparticles are versatile nanoscale building blocks with the ability to order into diverse periodic arrangements, called colloidal crystals. There have been tremendous advancements in the area of colloidal crystal fabrication over the past few decades, but new syntheses and assembly techniques continue to develop in order to unite scale and desired material structure. In this dissertation, I describe my work from three different projects: silica binary colloidal crystal assembly, the use of colloidal crystal films in template replication synthesis, and silica nanoparticle morphological changes during assembly.  \nIn Chapter 1, I introduce colloidal crystals and review synthetic methods for silica colloid synthesis and techniques for their assembly into colloidal crystals. I also discuss template replication synthesis and provide an overview of the projects detailed in the remaining chapters. I will discuss my first project in Chapter 2, in which the phase behavior of 36 nm and 22 nm silica binary colloidal crystal films was mapped over a range of compositions and temperatures in order to optimize AB2-type binary colloidal crystal film growth. While thermodynamic phase diagrams can serve as a guide in selecting binary systems based on size ratios and what phases are energetically favorable, they do not account for the intricacies of experimental non-equilibrium conditions.  Therefore, this systematic experimental approach to determining growth conditions was employed. We found that low temperature (30-35\u00b0C) film growth and a range of excess 22 nm silica produced the largest, most widespread AB2 domains in film samples. I present the phase mapping results and discuss the possible reasons for the deposition conditions-dependent phase behavior and how it might extend to future binary colloidal crystal film studies.  \nIn Chapter 3, I describe double replication of silica colloidal crystal films with the use of contracting polymers. I quantify the lattice contraction of several polymer inverse replicates of the silica colloidal crystal films through the extensive use of electron microscopy.  I discuss lattice contraction as a function of colloidal template size and also polymer elastic moduli using AFM nanoindentation. It was discovered in this project that polymer inverse opal lattices re-expand upon filling with inorganic oxide sol gels. This finding negates the use of double replication for shrinking periodic structures with these contracting polymers; but the results are still interesting for double replication methodology and presented evidence of the role of surface energy in the polymer contraction/expansion process. Finally, I extended the method to double replication of binary colloidal crystal film templates of silica nanoparticles <50 nm, which produced second-generation binary colloidal crystal films in silica as well as in titania. \nIn Chapter 4, I discuss my investigation into the shape-shifting character of L-arginine stabilized silica nanoparticles during evaporative self-assembly. First, I describe the phenomenon observed in previous experiments, which appear to be due to a combination of solution chemistry and interfacial tension factors. In order to deconvolute the many solution components possibly involved, I performed comparison analyses of purified and unpurified colloidal sols based on composition via solid-state NMR, as well as electron microscopy studies of dried sols. I systematically added reactive components to the unpurified and purified sols then evaporated them into colloidal crystal films for characterization by electron microscopy. I discuss the findings, which reveal a tendency for silica nanoparticle dissolution in L-arginine, as well as encapsulation of L-arginine and under-condensed silicate groups during silica nanoparticle synthesis. The findings suggest silica nanoparticle \u201csoftness\u201d in solution that could ease capillary-driven deformation during drying. Additionally, results of additions of L-arginine and silicate precursor to depositing solutions are discussed and how the presence of these components contributed to morphological changes by shape-ripening during evaporative film deposition. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16079], "author_name_tesi": "Russell, Jennifer Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Russell", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Benjamin James Lear", "Lauren Dell Zarzar", "Suzanne E Mohney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas E Mallouk, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Chair", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Lauren Dell Zarzar, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["colloidal crystal", "silica", "nanoparticle", "template replication", "self-assembly", "polymer"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "An Empirical Study Investigating Math Preparedness for University Students with Engineering Career Goals: \"Savage Inequalities\"\u009d Thirteen Years Later\n\n", "id": "6998", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6113", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the type of high school math completed and the percent of variance in university math placement scores for 515 students enrolled in the College of Engineering at a large Research I university.

For many cases the electronic preamplifier noise is dominant, and as such, the mechanical and acoustical sources of noise in the capsule can be neglected. However, the relative levels of various noise components are strongly dependent on frequency and the design of the transducer, as each source of noise is filtered through the successive signal path. The thermal-acoustic noise in the capsule can then be the dominant source of noise in certain frequency ranges for some microphone designs. Previously, Zuckerwar has employed an acoustic isolation vessel to separate the noise present in the motion of the microphone diaphragm from the total output noise and found a significant component of 1/f noise on the diaphragm. To date, no physical explanation has been given for this spectral shape. \n\nThis study uses the finite element method to examine the thermal-acoustic noise that is present in the back volume of microphones, a noise source that has historically been neglected. A simple finite element method for determining the thermal distributions in acoustic enclosures is described, and from this solution the impedance of any arbitrarily shaped enclosure may be obtained. This impedance is complex, in contrast to the usual adiabatic compliance approximation, which is purely imaginary. It is demonstrated using simple shapes that the resistive part of this impedance is flat at low frequencies and falls off as f^(-3/2) at higher frequencies. According to the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem, this resistance causes a noise fluctuation, which is proportional to the resistance. The frequency dependence of the resistance thus controls the spectral shape of the resultant noise. \n\nThis method is applied to the internal geometries of two commonly used and commonly studied measurement condenser microphones. The simulation results reveal that the enclosure resistances of these microphones have the same frequency dependence as for the simple enclosure shapes. Equivalent circuit models for these microphones with their preamplifiers are presented. Using a circuit simulator, the relative noise contributions of each acoustical noise source are compared. The simulated back volume noise dominates the other sources of acoustical noise for about two decades in the mid-band of the audible frequency range.

I explore the utility of network theoretical models in quantifying, visually representing, and analyzing mutualistic community structure, as well as the potential for such models to direct management objectives. \nThe first chapter is an introduction that gives an overview and definitions of frequently used terms in the work. It is followed by an investigation of the importance of taxonomy in structuring mutualistic interactions (chapter two). Using a large legacy dataset of plants and insect visitors, I provide evidence that specialization at the regional level is lineage-specific and find that patterns of significant taxonomic conservatism are common; in other words, closely related species are more likely to interact with similar partners. I also identify groups of plant species and their insect visitors that have correlated taxonomies, suggesting subsets of strongly interacting groups within the whole.\nCommunities of wild bees have been shown to be capable of fully supplying the pollination requirements of agricultural fields. For this reason, many land managers seek to supplement the pollination services provided by honeybees by supporting the diversity and abundance of wild bees. In chapter three, I identify plant species capable of provisioning communities of wild bees with floral resources, and demonstrate how floral provisioning habitat can be targeted to support individual species, or groups of species, over time.\nIn chapter four, I construct theoretical models to explore the impact of the integration of a novel plant species into a community of interacting plants and pollinators.  I find that the impact of a novel species on community structure is mediated both by the number and type of interactions it forms with native species. Testing experimental data from a community of plants and pollinators, I find that certain network properties are reliably predicted by these interaction models, while more complex properties are dependent on link identity.\nThough much of this work focuses on communities of pollinators specifically adapted to the collection of floral resources, I also demonstrate that groups of lesser-known taxa can contribute to pollination services, and that their association with plants can be important for one or both of the interacting organisms. In chapter five, I therefore emphasize the importance of capturing and examining groups of species other than those which are commonly thought to be the most important floral visitors as a way of quantifying the diversity of arthropods. \nI have also found that disturbances, such as species invasions, do not always necessarily have negative connotations for mutualistic partners. Indeed, I show in chapter six that the weed species that persist in marginal habitat may be strongly preferred by groups of threatened pollinators, and therefore may contribute significantly to the persistence of pollinator communities.  Thus, the invasion of non-native species may have both detrimental and beneficial effects.\nFinally, in chapter seven, I find that structural properties of the interactions between plants and insects can be manipulated on a community level. In addition, I find that subtle manipulations can lead to large changes in the composition of plant-pollinator communities. I also show that insects forage opportunistically and respond rapidly to perceived changes in the quality and attractiveness of flowers. Thus, the identity of the species in the community does strongly influence the structure of interactions. \nUsing community-level approaches, as I do in this thesis, demonstrates that networks can be a useful tool for studying emergent ecosystem services, such as pollination. I synthesize my findings in a conclusion chapter (chapter eight). Overall, I find that the structure of mutualisms between plants and insect visitors can provide insights into both fundamental ecological questions and applied contemporary challenges.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9085], "author_name_tesi": "Russo, Laura Alexandra", "last_name_ssi": "Russo", "middle_name_ssi": "Alexandra", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katriona Shea", "David A Mortensen", "Ottar N Bjornstad", "John Frazier Tooker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katriona Shea, Dissertation Advisor", "David A Mortensen, Committee Chair", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Member", "John Frazier Tooker, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plant-pollinator", "community ecology", "ecology", "management", "agroecosystems", "floral resource provisioning", "invasive species"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS OF CLUSTER\nBOMBARDMENT\n", "id": "8961", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4120", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The overall objective of this thesis is to elucidate the physics that govern the bombardment\nevents of cluster projectiles in SIMS experiments.

Understanding sources of natives\u2019 anti-immigrant attitudes is important for creating effective policies that will create more positive attitudes toward immigrants.\n\tThis dissertation explores three aspects of native\u2019s attitudes toward immigrants using data from the European Social Survey and Eurostat/OECD. These combined datasets allow for analysis of individual, regional and national level factors that are related to natives\u2019 attitudes toward immigrants. The three substantive chapters (Chapters 2-4) examine the relationship between nine individual level factors and anti-immigrant attitudes: educational achievement, income, unemployment experience, political interest, left/right political leaning, interpersonal trust, feeling safe, resides with a family member, and ever experienced discrimination. In addition, the second and fourth chapters include regional and national explanations for anti-immigrant attitudes: national foreign direct investment and regional and national gross domestic product (GDP) and unemployment rates.\n\tThe first chapter is an introductory chapter that provides an overview of the dissertation. Chapter two explores which explanations for anti-immigrant attitudes are weakest and which are strongest. The third chapter identifies six categories of individuals as it relates to their attitudes toward immigrants by applying latent class analysis to the individual level variables. The fourth chapter explores a controversial finding from the second chapter: why economic explanations for anti-immigrant attitudes are not more salient. Finally, the fifth chapter provides a summary of the findings and my dissertation process. \n\tAcross the substantive chapters, findings indicate that interpersonal trust is the strongest explanatory factors for anti-immigrant attitudes. Higher education and political interest are also consistently related to lower anti-immigrant attitudes. In contrast, economic explanations and number of immigrants are weak predictors of anti-immigrant attitudes. These findings indicate that policies aimed at increasing community involvement and multi-cultural events at the local level would be most effective in lowering anti-immigrant attitudes.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [618], "author_name_tesi": "Rustenbach, Elisa ", "last_name_ssi": "Rustenbach", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Elisa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Alan Booth", "Alan Booth", "Nancy Landale", "Glenn A Firebaugh", "Susan Mc Hale"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Alan Booth, Dissertation Advisor", "Alan Booth, Committee Chair", "Nancy Landale, Committee Member", "Glenn A Firebaugh, Committee Member", "Susan Mc Hale, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Anti-Immigrant Attitudes", "Europe", "Immigration", "Cross-National Research"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "\"See Everything, Hear What is Not Being Said\": A Phenomenological Investigation of Intuition in Novice Registered Nurses Practice", "id": "6242", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3709", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-02-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\nKnowing is multifaceted and encompasses several different ways to process information. Ways of knowing that lay outside of the rational domain such as intuitive, spiritual, emotional, tacit, and unconscious knowing, have traditionally been ignored and silenced in the traditional obsession with objective, positivistic, and rationalistic knowing. In the field of nursing, it is recognized that in practice expert nurses use many different sources of knowledge too gain a holistic perspective of their patient situation, to guide their decision-making and inform patient care. Inclusion of novice nurses in previous research on intuition has been very limited. \nTherefore, the primary purpose of this interpretive Heideggarian phenomenological study was to discover the meaning of intuitive knowing to novice registered nurses. Secondly, it was intended to identify how the use of intuitive knowing impacts their practice.  Sixteen nurses, twelve females and four males representing a variety of clinical specialties were interviewed. Cognitive learning theory and Women\u2019s Ways of Knowing guided this theory theoretically.  The methods of data collection were in-depth interviews using a semi-structured interview guide, as well as documents and artifacts. The interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim. When analyzing the data, a constant comparative technique was utilized.   \nThe findings of this study revealed that these novice nurses defined intuition as being a \u201cgut feeling\u201d and identified multiple sources of intuition. They contextualized intuition based on previous life and job experiences and were influenced by intuitive mentors.  When accessing intuition the novice nurses felt this was dependent on their self-trust, whether or not they trusted their colleagues and patients, their ability to reposition themselves in time and space to connect with their patients and lastly, patient variables. Outcomes of using intuition in practice were noted to be that it guided their decision-making, enhanced holistic patient care, influenced their navigating around and between professional relationships and enhanced their ability to deal with limited hospital and human resources.  Lastly, the novice nurses shared that the culture of nursing education and practice continues to reify the medical model and give mixed messages regarding accepted ways of knowing. Many ways the novice nurses dealt with and unlearned fear associated with nonrational ways of knowing as well as the desire to find a balance among intuition, science and other ways of knowing were also shared. Based on these findings that emerged, implications for nursing education and practice are presented. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3690], "author_name_tesi": "Ruth-Sahd, Lisa Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Ruth-Sahd", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Lisa", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Edward W Taylor", "Helen Margaret Hendy", "Holly L Angelique", "Ian E Baptiste"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Chair", "Edward W Taylor, Committee Member", "Helen Margaret Hendy, Committee Member", "Holly L Angelique, Committee Member", "Ian E Baptiste, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Intuition", "Novice Registered Nurses", "Phenomenology", "Ways of Knowing"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The CSAO as a Leader at Small, Private Four-Year Institutions: A Multi-Perspective Analysis on Developing and Maintaining Trust Among Key Institutional Stakeholders                        \n\nTRUST AMONG KEY INSTITUTIONAL STAKEHOLDERS\n\n\n\n", "id": "12536", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4904", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Researchers from a variety of disciplines have provided robust evidence to indicate that trust is an indispensable element of organizational leadership.  Although the scholarship on chief student affairs officers has also frequently referenced the significance of trust, there has been a lack of rigorous empirical research designed to understand the complexities of this construct in the unique context of student affairs leadership.  The main impetus of this study was to offer a multi-perspective conceptualization of how trust in CSAO leadership is initially developed and then maintained over the course of time.  \n\n     This examination was conducted from the diverse viewpoints of CSAO subordinates, administrative peers, college presidents and CSAOs themselves.  Guided by an interpretive paradigm, a purely qualitative methodology was employed that consisted of a six case comparative analysis and grounded approach to build theory from the cases.  In order to foster an authentic understanding of how trust is initially created and then sustained over time, the final case selections were based on the CSAOs\u2019 years of experience in their current roles.  More precisely, the final case selections included two new CSAOs who had less than three years of experience at their current institutions, two CSAOs who had between four to six years of experience and two CSAOs who had ten or more years of experience in their current positions.  Subsequently, the constant comparative method was employed to conduct a cross case analysis of the patterns between participants at each of the three pairs of institutions.  In total, interviews were conducted with six CSAOs, six college presidents, eight subordinates and seven administrative peers.   \n\n     The findings from this study categorically confirmed the magnitude of trust in CSAO leadership and resulted in distinct grounded theories of trust for 1) CSAO subordinates, 2) administrative peers and 3) college presidents.  While there were common strands interwoven throughout each of the three separate theories, there proved to be prominent differences in the overall sets of behaviors and practices associated with trust among each of the three stakeholder groups.  In the end, the results offer current and aspiring student affairs leaders with a broad framework that can be used as they set out to engender trust in their leadership across campus.  In addition, the main tenets of the three grounded theories also have a broader value that can be applied to other administrative positions on college and high school campuses such as vice presidents, academic deans, department chairs, college presidents, principals and superintendents.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4881], "author_name_tesi": "Ruthkosky, Philip James", "last_name_ssi": "Ruthkosky", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Philip", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson", "Robert M Hendrickson", "Robert D Reason", "Timothy Grant Pollock", "Michael John Dooris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert M Hendrickson, Committee Chair", "Robert D Reason, Committee Chair", "Timothy Grant Pollock, Committee Member", "Michael John Dooris, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Student Affairs Leadership", "Chief Student Affairs Officer", "Trust"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A Search for Neutrino-Induced Electromagnetic Showers in the 2008 Combined IceCube and AMANDA Detectors", "id": "12130", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1476", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA) and its successor\nexperiment, IceCube, are both Cherenkov detectors deployed very near the geographic\nSouth Pole.

Relatively young and frequent users risk lifelong physical and mental health problems and relatively low socioeconomic success. Adolescent substance use also has been linked to risky behaviors that lead to early and unwed pregnancy, teenage marriage, and premarital cohabitation. Role Strain Theory argues that illegal substance users take the atypical path into adult family roles and choose cohabitation or parenthood over marriage. This study assessed the influence of alcohol and illegal drug use on the choice of parenthood, cohabitation, not forming a family, or marriage as the first family type. It also examined whether the effects, if any, of substance use differed by gender, race/ethnicity, and residence.\n     The sample consisted of the 4,011 14 to 16 year old respondents to the 1979 wave of the NLSY79 who had not formed a family before 1979. Multinomial Logistic Regression analysis was used to predict the likelihood that a subject was classified into each of three types of first families versus marriage. Indicators of the type of substance use by type and use of multiple types assessed the effects of polydrug use on first family type. Measures of the age at first alcohol, marijuana, or other illegal drug use; the frequency of alcohol or marijuana use in 1979; binge drinking; and familial alcoholism assessed the effects of characteristics of specific substances among users of those substances. First, the effects of alcohol and illegal drug use on first family type were assessed and then net of the effects of 27 control variables. Separate analyses that mirrored the analysis of the entire sample were performed for males and females, among racial/ethnic groups, and by rural and South regional residence.\n     The statistical findings of the full sample analysis suggested that those who used alcohol and illegal drugs before forming their first adult families were much more likely to cohabit than marry as a first union and were less likely to become parents before first marriage. Age at first use and frequency of use did not predict group membership except among those who started at the youngest ages and used at the highest frequencies. Males\u2019 family formation behavior appeared to be significantly more influenced by their marijuana use but not by their alcohol or other illegal drug use than their female counterparts. Substance use was not predictive of first family type among Blacks or Hispanics, was mildly predictive of parenthood or cohabitation as the first family type among American Indians, and was strongly predictive of cohabitation or parenthood versus marriage among non-Hispanic whites. First family type was significantly influenced by alcohol and illegal drug use among those living in the rural South, less so among those in the rural non-South, and did not significantly influence the odds of atypical family formation versus marriage among those in the two non-rural groups.\n     While most research finds significant effects of alcohol and illegal drug use on the likelihood of premarital pregnancy, this analysis found little effect on parenthood.

This thesis project makes use of line SV11 mice, which express the oncoprotein SV40 large T antigen (Tag) as a transgene, in order to study the tumor-specific T-CD8 cell response in mice that develop spontaneously-arising choroid plexus tumors.  Similar to some cancer patients, the T-CD8 cell response to the major tumor antigen in these mice - the Tag - is hindered by the development of T cell tolerance.  Although T-CD8 cells specific for the three immunodominant Tag epitopes are deleted from the repertoire of SV11 mice during T cell development, a subset of Tag-specific T-CD8 cells, specific for the immunorecessive epitope V, survive in SV11 mice.  This residual population of T-CD8 cells is composed of a mixture of both low and high avidity epitope V specific cells that can be recruited following a prime and boost immunization approach.  To determine the effect of the tumor-bearing environment on higher avidity epitope V specific T-CD8 cells, the fate and anti-tumor potential of na\u00efve T cell receptor transgenic T-CD8 cells (TCR-V cells) following adoptive transfer into SV11 mice with advanced tumors was investigated.  TCR-V cells recognized the endogenous Tag post transfer into tumor-bearing SV11 mice, resulting in proliferation and acquisition of effector functions, but failed to accumulate in either the lymphoid tissues or at the tumor site.  Specific immunization of SV11 mice following adoptive transfer of na\u00efve TCR-V cells resulted in a modest expansion in the lymphoid organs, but failed to induce significant T cell accumulation at the tumor site.  \n\nApproaches aimed at augmenting epitope V targeted adoptive immunotherapy of SV11 mice bearing advanced stage tumors were thus investigated, and it was found that the cellular source of antigen, mode of antigen presentation, and timing of immunization played critical roles in eliciting the TCR-V cell response in vivo.  The results demonstrate that the anti-tumor response of TCR-V T cells in tumor-bearing mice could be significantly enhanced by activation against both endogenous and exogenous sources of Tag.  Specifically, strategically-timed cellular immunization targeted against the immunorecessive epitope promoted dramatic accumulation of functional TCR-V cells at the tumor site, which was associated with prolonged survival of SV11 mice.  Tumor infiltration correlative with delayed tumor progression was also induced following the administration of an agonistic anti-CD40 mAb, suggesting that TCR-V cells were effectively triggered and primed against the endogenous Tag following activation of resident antigen presenting cells, even in the presence of advanced tumors.  Although both therapeutic approaches yielded comparable effects on the enhancement of SV11 survival, high levels of TCR-V cells did not persist long-term following either treatment regimen, and mice eventually succumbed to tumor burden.  However, in contrast to either regimen administered individually, a combinatorial immunotherapeutic approach, consisting of both anti-CD40 pre-conditioning and immunization synergistically promoted long-term maintenance of TCR-V cells in the brain and extended SV11 survival.  These data implied that adoptive T-CD8-mediated immunotherapy against spontaneously-arising tumors was optimized by enhanced sensitization against the endogenous tumor antigen and well-timed exogenous immunization.\n\nIt was also found that T-CD8 cell persistence at the tumor site did not always predict therapeutic efficacy, and that tumor burden at the onset of combinatorial immunotherapy may pose limitations on the capacity for TCR-V cells to control disease progression.  Exploration of mechanisms contributing to the ultimate loss of tumor control despite long-term maintenance of TCR-V cells in SV11 mice post combinatorial immunotherapy, revealed that eventually the tumor environment in SV11 mice was characterized by the accumulation of anergic TCR-V cells and tumor infiltration by bone marrow-derived DCs expressing inhibitory receptors.  These findings implicated TCR-V cell anergy - associated with persistent up-regulation of the inhibitory receptor PD-1 on tumor-infiltrating TCR-V cells compared with peripheral TCR-V cells - in the promotion of tumor escape from immune surveillance.  However, the anergic phenotype was reversible, evidenced by the ability to restore function of non-responsive TCR-V cells ex vivo through blockade of a PD-1 receptor ligand.  Furthermore, in spite of the failure of TCR-V cells from the initial transfer to exert continued anti-tumor function, SV11 tumors remained receptive to a second round of combinatorial therapy that included a fresh adoptive transfer of na\u00efve TCR-V cells.  These findings implicate critical checkpoints during tumor progression at which therapeutic intervention is necessary, namely (i.) optimizing initial enhancement of the priming event against endogenous tumor antigen, (ii.) providing appropriately-timed immunization to prolong the anti-tumor response, and (iii.) monitoring disease at late time points to overcome negative regulation of persisting cells.  These studies demonstrate the potential for strategically-executed immunotherapeutic manipulations to dramatically augment a relatively weak anti-tumor response of immunorecessive epitope-specific T-CD8 cells in the face of advanced tumors, and imply that similar combinatorial therapeutic approaches toward cancer patients could yield promising results in clinical practice.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1073], "author_name_tesi": "Ryan, Christina Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Ryan", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Christina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Todd Schell", "Sarah Bronson", "Mary Judith Tevethia", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "Shao Cong Sun", "Witold B.

In addition to the network bonding, however, these materials have also exhibited a strong propensity to include carbon-carbon bonding \u2013 so-called \u201cfree carbon\u201d \u2013 within the structure regardless of synthesis method.  While evidence for the presence of free carbon is overwhelming, traditional diffraction methods have been unable to characterize the degree of ordering and spatial distribution in the material.  The primary theme of this thesis is the structural characterization of this elusive phase, hopefully leading to a better understanding of how to engineer the presence or absence of this phase to tailor the material properties for certain applications.  To this end, rf-magnetron sputtering was utilized to synthesize silicon oxycarbide thin films over a wide composition range.  The inorganic and amorphous nature of sputter-deposited films offers an opportunity for an in-depth study of this material with limited complications from phase separation, the presence of residual organics and hydrogen, or a limited range of available compositions.  \nOne example of the effect of free carbon on material characteristics is given in a study of the mechanical and tribological properties of the films.  A relatively new transmission electron microscopy technique known as variable coherence fluctuation electron microscopy (FEM) is applied to probe the possibility of ordered regions in silicon oxycarbides on the length scale of roughly 8 to 50\u00c5.  We utilize this method to identify semi-ordered bonding present in silicon oxycarbide thin films similar to turbostratic carbon.  An interesting approach to variable resolution FEM is also presented which holds promise as a means to extract the characteristic length scale of any ordered regions in the material.  This data is utilized in conjunction with other film characterization and a full review of the literature to propose a new model for free carbon in silicon oxycarbide glasses. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3114], "author_name_tesi": "Ryan, Joseph V", "last_name_ssi": "Ryan", "middle_name_ssi": "V", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carlo G Pantano", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Mark William Horn", "Paul Voyles", "Paolo Colombo", "Joseph Patrick Stitt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carlo G Pantano, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member", "Paul Voyles, Committee Member", "Paolo Colombo, Committee Member", "Joseph Patrick Stitt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fluctuation electron microscopy", "thin films", "sputtering", "silicon oxycarbide", "carbon nanoparticles", "tribology"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Energetic  Particle Bombardment of Molecular Solids\n\n\n", "id": "9759", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3405", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to elucidate the physics surrounding secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).

Our findings illustrate that energy and GHG emission reductions associated with integrating legume cover crops and reducing tillage frequency are viable ways of increasing the sustainability of grain production. However, management improvements are needed for organic growers to realize benefits from reduced tillage. \n\tOne challenge is growing enough cover crop biomass (i.e. mulch) to adequately suppress weeds. In Chapter 2, we report on an experiment designed to test two approaches to increase cereal rye biomass: (1) increasing soil fertility and (2) increasing cereal rye seeding rate. Rye biomass increased with poultry litter applications (675, 768, and 787 g m-2 in the 0, 80 and 160 kg N ha-1 treatments, respectively), but this increase did not result in a decrease in weed biomass. In contrast, increasing rye seeding rate did not increase rye biomass, but did result in a reduction in weed biomass (328, 279, 225 g m-2 in the 90, 150 and 210 kg seed ha-1, treatments respectively). \n\tIncreasing cash crop density can compliment the use of cover crops for weed suppression.

The key feature of these models is the incorporation of interbacterial interactions motivated by recent experimental observations suggesting their importance in the emergence of collective swimming. Results on well-posedness, effective properties and the onset of the collective state are established through rigorous asymptotic and numerical analysis. Each problem considered is highly multiscale in that microscopic interactions result in changes in the macroscopic state. This work provides a better understanding of the physical mechanisms governing the transition to collective motion.\n\nThroughout this dissertation, novel models are employed where a bacterium is represented as a point force dipole subject to two types of interactions: hydrodynamic interactions and excluded volume type interactions introduced through the use of a short-range Lennard-Jones type repelling potential. The point dipole model accounts for the particle size through this potential and shape via Jeffery\u2019s equations modeling how an ellipsoid interacts with the surrounding fluid. Confirming experimental observation, the mathematical analysis reveals that the alignment of asymmetrical particles and the presence of self-propulsion change the effective rheological properties of the suspension such as a drastic reduction in the effective viscosity. By providing explicit formulas for the effective viscosity as well as the effective normal stress differences, the theory presented herein can describe the complete rheological behavior of an active suspension undergoing planar shear in terms of known physical parameters.\n\nThe first few chapters (1-4) of this dissertation are concerned with introducing the PDE/ODE model for the suspension allowing for the investigation of this decrease in the effective viscosity. The main challenge is added complexity due to the incorporation of interbacterial interactions, in contrast to previous models valid only in the dilute regime. Rigorous mathematical analysis is then performed on the associated nonlinear non-local kinetic equation governing the evolution of the particle distribution function for bacterial positions and orientations. Using this approach, an explicit asymptotic formula for the effective viscosity in terms of known physical parameters is derived. This formula reveals the physical mech- anisms responsible for the striking decrease in the effective viscosity observed in experiment; namely, the combination of self-propulsion, a non-uniform spatial distribution of bacteria due to interactions, and a non-spherical shape of bacteria. The model developed in this dissertation also allows for computationally efficient GPU numerical simulations containing a large number of particles, which are in agreement with the analytical results and experiment. This work is the first to capture the qualitative behavior of the effective viscosity observed in active suspensions for all experimental concentrations. In addition to the effective viscosity, the effective normal stress coefficients are also computed. The main mathematical result, which is presented in Chapter 4, is that the model proposed is well-posed and provides the existence of unique particle trajectories for all time.\n\nThe later chapters (5-6) of this dissertation explore more recent work, which involves understanding the onset of collective motion by investigating the spatiotemporal correlations associated with bacterial velocities. Numerical analysis of a thin film PDE model provides novel understanding of which physical mechanisms govern the onset, size, and duration of the collective state. Using the proposed model, this work confirms the recent experimental observation that particle size and shape rather than the concentration of bacteria or swimming speed governs the size and duration of the collective state in bacterial suspensions. In addition to verifying experimental observation, this work studies the effects of system pa- rameters that are difficult to control in experiment such as the particle aspect ratio as well as the decoupling of swimming speed and the tumbling rate of bacteria. The current state of experiments does not allow for such an investigation, but our theory provides testable predictions for future work.

Unfortunately, the nature of the transition from anoxia is poorly resolved with interpretations relying heavily on numerical modeling. Recently, it has been hypothesized that oxygen levels may have overshot their ultimate Proterozoic steady state during the transition. The Fennoscandia Arctic Russia \u2013 Drilling Early Earth Project (FAR\u2013DEEP) recovered over 400 m of the anomalously oxidized 2.06 Ga old Kuetsj\u00e4rvi Volcanic Formation, which may be the manifestation of the oxygen overshoot in the geologic record.\n\nDetailed petrographic and geochemical analyses resulted in the discovery of an oxidized paleosol that fills in a key gap in the Precambrian paleosol record. Oxidation within the Kuetsj\u00e4rvi paleosol appears to be strongly correlated with the extent of chemical weathering. U-Th-Pb geochronology constrained the timing of oxidation to between eruption and metamorphism. However, the incorporation of rounded, oxidized KVF clasts with conspicuous hematite rinds into the overlying sedimentary formation indicates that oxidation occurred prior to erosion. Non-traditional, redox sensitive heavy stable isotope analyses revealed that iron was largely oxidized in situ within the Kuetsj\u00e4rvi paleosol, but that chromium was added to the paleosol profile at drilling site 8B. \n\nGiven the extent of weathering, the Kuetsj\u00e4rvi paleosol is oxidized compared to older Precambrian aged paleosols, but not anomalously so compared to younger Proterozoic paleosols. Qualitatively, this observation suggests the oxidation of the Kuetsj\u00e4rvi paleosol occurred during the progressive increase towards, but not necessarily above, the Proterozoic pO2 steady state. Our modeling results, using a previously published mass balance model, broadly corroborate this interpretation, and suggest that paleoatmospheric pCO2 and pO2 levels ca. 2.06 Ga ago in Fennoscandia were between 0.4 and 6,500 times PAL and 1 x 10\u20133 and 12 times PAL, respectively. The broad range in estimated pCO2 and pO2 values for the Kuetsj\u00e4rvi paleosol demonstrate how sensitive the current model is to parameters that are difficult to estimate accurately for Precambrian-aged paleosols (e.g., annual precipitation rate, groundwater table depth, and soil age). Thus, our results reveal the need to refine the current model to improve the accuracy of future paleoatmospheric pCO2 and pO2 during early Earth\u2019s history.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11191], "author_name_tesi": "Rybacki, Kyle S", "last_name_ssi": "Rybacki", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lee Kump", "Lee Kump", "Hiroshi Ohmoto", "Maureen Feineman", "Patrick Joseph Drohan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lee Kump, Dissertation Advisor", "Lee Kump, Committee Chair", "Hiroshi Ohmoto, Committee Member", "Maureen Feineman, Committee Member", "Patrick Joseph Drohan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Precambrian oxygen", "paleosol", "iron isotopes", "chromium isotopes", "Great Oxidation Event (GOE)", "oxidation", "U-Th-Pb geochronology"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "ELECTROMAGNETIC MODELING OF NANOWIRES AND OPTICAL NANOANTENNAS ", "id": "8698", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "839", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Both the fabrication and placement of nanostructures (i.e. structures whose dimensions are on the order of nanometers) has matured to the point where antenna- and waveguide-like elements may be manufactured and precisely placed into useful configurations.

To support these inquiries, it is necessary to correctly describe the electromagnetic properties with proper modeling. This thesis will address a few specific topics in the modeling of nanoscale electromagnetics and novel applications at terahertz and optical frequencies. First, an analytical treatment of the scattering from GaP nanowires and asymptotic forms of the average internal intensities are derived. The ratio of orthogonally polarized intensities with a vanishingly thin nanowire confirms the presence of the \u2018antenna effect\u2019 in this limit. The simulation of arrays of metallic nanowires shows that they may function well as frequency selective surfaces in the mid-infrared. By introducing a small gap in each nanowire, large near fields are produced at resonance that may find use in field enhanced spectroscopy. The excitation of nanowires allows them to function as optical nanoantennas and they are well described by conventional antenna parameters such as input impedance, radiation efficiency and directivity.

Phosphate glasses provide a unique opportunity for studying radiation damage resistance due to their high rare-earth solubility, ~25 mol%.  Two series of glasses, nominally AlP3O9-CeP3O9 and CeP3O9-SiP2O7, were synthesized to investigate structure-property relationships in a range of compositions near the metaphosphate. \n\nThe presence of cerium clustering, or sharing of oxygen between cerium cations, was predicted using the chain fragment cluster model, an extension of earlier models for rare-earth phosphate glasses.  Using the atom% composition determined by XPS from vacuum fracture surfaces, and cation coordination measured by Ce K-edge EXAFS, 29Si CPMG NMR, and 27Al MAS NMR, it was determined that clustering occurs for glasses containing \u2265 14 mol% Ce2O3 in the aluminophosphate glass series and \u2265 18 mol% Ce2O3 in the silicophosphate glass series. Many measured properties have been observed to correlate with the presence or absence of cerium clustering, cluster size, or other concomitant structural changes, including: visible coloration, density, refractive index, Ce3+ photoluminescence, and Ce3+ paramagnetic resonance.\n\nAdditionally, radiation damage resistance was identified in the aluminophosphate and silicophosphate glasses which were predicted to have clustered cerium cations through the absence of radiation-induced phosphorus-related paramagnetic defects.  This resistance is attributed to a structural implication of clustering.  Specifically, cerium cations will be in close proximity to defect precursor sites at the concentrations required for clustering and are thus able to prevent localization of electrons and holes on those sites.\n\nFinally, irradiation-induced optical absorption was measured in all glass compositions and was attributed to a change in the local electronic structure of cerium which is similar to intervalence charge transfer.

Out of the vast diversity of fish species, sharks are thought to have a particularly acute sense of smell, and it is well known that hammerhead sharks have several morphological advantages for olfaction due to their unique head shape. The functional significance of this morphology has been studied to some extent, but the detailed hydrodynamics and odorant transport phenomena related to olfaction have not been thoroughly investigated in any fish. Since odorant transport from the aquatic environment to the sensory epithelium is the first critical step in olfaction, a proper understanding of olfactory function in fish is important.\n\nThe objective of this study is to expand on the current knowledge of underwater olfaction by elucidating the hydrodynamics and odorant transport phenomena of olfaction in the hammerhead shark. An anatomically accurate, three-dimensional model of the head and olfactory organ of a cadaver hammerhead shark (Sphyrna tudes) specimen is reconstructed from micro-CT and MRI scans. Using this model, computational fluid dynamics simulations are carried out to investigate the hydrodynamics in the nasal region of the shark. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to calculate water/mucus partition coefficients for four underwater feeding stimulants. The partition coefficients are then utilized in mass transport simulations of odorant deposition in the hammerhead olfactory organ. Finally, a theoretical comparison of olfaction in aquatic and terrestrial species is presented, which is used to elucidate bio-inspired design principles for artificial chemical sensing in both water and air.\n\nThe hydrodynamics results reveal that flow is induced through the hammerhead olfactory organ via a ram ventilation mechanism as the shark swims. The major nasal groove, which runs along the leading edge of the cephalofoil, is shown to facilitate sampling of a large spatial extent by directing oncoming flow towards the incurrent nostril. Additionally, several internal and external morphological features appear to serve as flow regulation mechanisms to limit flow speeds through the sensory channels, which may protect the delicate internal structures of the olfactory organ from otherwise high flow rates incurred by sampling a larger area.\n\nMolecular dynamics simulations reveal that the variation of seawater/mucus odorant partition coefficients is approximately one order of magnitude, in stark contrast to air/mucus odorant partition coefficients that can span up to six orders of magnitude. This limited range of underwater partition coefficients is shown to preclude appreciable chromatographic odorant separation along the sensory epithelium, as demonstrated in mass transport simulations of odorant deposition in the hammerhead olfactory organ. Thus, olfaction in fish appears to be fundamentally distinct from olfaction in air-breathing animals.\n\nA theoretical comparison of olfaction in aquatic and terrestrial species by means of dimensional analysis demonstrates that odorant uptake by the sensory epithelium of the hammerhead shark is more efficient than odorant uptake in the olfactory region of the canine, a keen-scented terrestrial animal, for comparable odorants. Phenomenologically, it appears that this is due to an increased nondimensional odorant permeability and nondimensional residence time in the olfactory organ of the hammerhead shark.\n\nThe present results contribute to an improved understanding of olfaction in the hammerhead shark (Sphyrna tudes), and fish in general.

Clinically, LGL leukemia can manifest as a chronic lymphocytosis or as an aggressive leukemia that is fatal within a short period of time. A segment of LGL leukemia patients are unresponsive to immunosuppressive therapy and currently there is no known curative treatment for this disease. Another hematological malignancy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent leukemia in adults in Western countries and accounts for approximately 30% of all diagnosed leukemia cases. Around 95% of all CLL cases involve clonal expansion and abnormal proliferation of neoplastic B lymphocytes in lymphoid organs, bone marrow and peripheral blood. Similar to LGL leukemia, CLL is also incurable with current therapies. Therefore, this represents a need for new therapeutic approaches for treatment of these diseases. Recent advances in nanotechnology have illustrated the feasibility of generating nanoliposomes that encapsulate hydrophobic compounds, like ceramide, to facilitate treatment of LGL leukemia and CLL.\n\nCeramide is an anti-proliferative sphingolipid metabolite that has been shown to selectively induce cell death in cancer cells. However, the use of ceramide as a chemotherapeutic agent is limited due to hydrophobicity. While it is understood how nanoliposomal ceramide induces cell death in several types of cancers and hematological malignancies, the effect of nanoliposomal ceramide treatment in LGL leukemia and CLL remains unclear.\n\nIn this study, we investigate the differential mechanisms of cell death induction following nanoliposomal C6-ceramide treatment in both LGL leukemia and CLL. We show that nanoliposomal C6-ceramide displays minimal cytotoxicity in normal donors&#8223; peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and is a well-tolerated therapy during in vivo treatment in these leukemia models. To further examine this mechanism of selectivity, we utilize CLL as a cancer model which has an increased dependency on glycolysis. As most tumors exhibit a preferential switch to glycolysis, as described in the \u201cWarburg effect,\u201d we hypothesize that ceramide nanoliposomes selectively target this activated glycolytic pathway in cancer. We demonstrate that nanoliposomal ceramide inhibits both the RNA and protein expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), an intermediate enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, which is overexpressed in a subset of CLL patients.\n\nTaken together, our results suggest that C6-ceramide nanoliposomes preferentially inhibit the enhanced metabolism of glucose in leukemic CLL cells, which results in induction of cell death. We conclude that selective inhibition of the glycolytic pathway in CLL cells with nanoliposomal C6-ceramide could potentially be an effective therapy for this leukemia by targeting the Warburg effect. In addition, we conclude that nanoliposomal C6-ceramide could also be an effective therapy for patients with LGL leukemia. Collectively, the results of this dissertation emphasize exploitation of sphingolipids and sphingolipid metabolism in design and development of novel chemotherapeutics.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3763], "author_name_tesi": "Ryland, Lindsay Kate", "last_name_ssi": "Ryland", "middle_name_ssi": "Kate", "first_name_ssi": "Lindsay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Kester", "Mark Kester", "Thomas Loughran", "Hong Gang Wang", "Jin Ming Yang", "Richard Robert Young"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Kester, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Kester, Committee Chair", "Thomas Loughran, Committee Member", "Hong Gang Wang, Committee Member", "Jin Ming Yang, Committee Member", "Richard Robert Young, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sphingolipid", "ceramide", "nanoliposome", "chronic lymphocytic leukemia"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A Study of Native Human Papillomavirus Structure and Capsid Stabilty", "id": "3b5918567", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10955", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-02-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted virus and infects through skin to skin contact. This virus is the main causative agent of cervical cancer and remains a major human health problem. HPV capsids are composed of the major capsid protein, L1, and the minor capsid protein, L2. Viral capsids are held together through a complex network of hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds. Historically, studying HPV was difficult, as viral production was limited to expensive animal models. Eventually, recombinant systems using monolayer cells transfected with L1 expression vectors were created to produce viral particles. These particles retain properties of native virions, but are produced in the absence of cellular differentiation. This method led to the generation of a first phase HPV vaccine to prevent HPV infection. The similarities of recombinant virions and virions produced in a differentiated epithelium are not understood. Organotypic raft technology is an alternative to recombinant systems that produces HPV in an in vitro, differentiated epithelium. The goal of this dissertation was to study HPV capsid structure and stability of native virions produced in the organotypic raft system. From this study, vulnerabilities in HPV capsid structure could be exploited to design future vaccines or disinfectants against the virus. Specifically, we investigated the biological significance of  methionines in-frame of the L1 open reading frame (ORF) and upstream of the predicted translational start site of L1, conserved cysteines in the L1 major capsid protein thought to mitigate capsid assembly, and the efficacy of disinfecting HPV using clinical disinfectants.\n\tWe explored the biological significance of upstream methionines found in the L1 ORF in two of the most common HPV types that to cause cancer in humans, HPV16 and HPV18. Recombinant systems use expression vectors containing non-native HPV codons and promoters to produce L1. These expression vectors are designed to produce L1 starting from a consensus methionine found by aligning the N-terminus of the L1 ORF from different HPV types. In many HPV types, the consensus methionine is not the first in-frame methionine in the L1 ORF [11].  HPV18 has two upstream, in-frame methionines, which are 61 (M(-61)) and 26 (M(-26)) amino acids away from the consensus methionine (M(1)). We found that HPV18 produce two different L1 isoforms that originate from M(-61) and M(1). Both forms of L1 are included in the virion. Silencing either M(-61) or M(1) caused changes in virus stability, infectivity, and conformation.\n\tL1 cysteines are important to providing stabilizing disulfide bonds in the final conformation of the capsid. C175, C185, and C428 are the cysteines responsible for forming disulfide bonds between L1 pentamers in HPV16. It was reported that HPV16 VLPs containing mutations in C161, C229, and C379 have less stable capsids than wild-type. These cysteines do not participate in disulfide bonds linking pentamers in the mature capsid. We hypothesized that if C161, C229, and C379 are involved in the final structure of the capsid, it occurs during the early events of capsid assembly. We show that these cysteines contribute to the final capsid conformation, potentially through the formation of transitional disulfide bonds.\n\tThe development of an HPV vaccine has provided protection against HPV infection and in extension, cervical cancer. However, HPV DNA has been detected on human finger tips. Free papillomavirus genomes cause papillomas in animal models. Also, virions are protected inside sloughed off keratinocytes, making them an excellent candidate for long-term survival on surfaces. All of these factors lead to the potential of HPV being transmitted through non-sexual avenues, such as fomites. HPV disinfection guidelines are derived from similar viruses. There are no studies that utilize native virions. We found that a majority of the disinfectants used in healthcare settings are ineffective at neutralizing HPV.\n\tThese data in this thesis demonstrate multiple mechanisms in which HPV structure and stability are controlled in differentiated epithelium and how current disinfectants fair against destroying the virus. This study should expand the knowledge about HPV structure and capsid stability in its natural environment, as well as aid in the design of future vaccines and disinfectants to prevent infection.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12353], "author_name_tesi": "Ryndock, Eric Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Ryndock", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Matthew Meyers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Matthew Meyers, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["HPV", "Virus", "Capsid", "Stability"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Achievement Goal Orientation and its Implications for Workplace Goal Setting Programs, Supervisory/subordinate Relationships, and Training\n", "id": "25903", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11408", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous research on achievement goal orientation theory has considered the influence of an individual\u2019s performance or learning goal orientation on goal setting, motivation to continue working towards a goal, and ultimate goal attainment.

Because knowledge is inseparable from context, situated learning emphasizes the use of authentic situations as learning environments. To promote the use of knowledge in different situations, transfer should be the main consideration because the same knowledge appears differently in different situations according to situative perspective. Many studies, however, indicate that transfer is a weakness of situated learning.\nSalomon and Perkins (1989) introduced a framework consisting of two different types of transfer employing different transfer mechanisms. Low-road transfer occurs through automatization built from repeated practice, while high-road transfer occurs through deliberate recognition of similarities between a new situation and prior experience. Recognition is accomplished by explicit elicitation of abstraction, that is, abstracting principles from prior situations that can be used in new situations. Based on the framework, situated learning induces low-road transfer at best, but not high-road transfer because the learning model does not provide explicit abstraction practice.\nThe abstraction process involves decontextualization of situations and representation of what is decontextualized into more general symbolic forms. Analogy is one of the well known strategies to abstract general principles, and many studies using analogy to elicit abstraction show transfer in learners\u00a1\u00af performance.\nTwo factors are known influence effective abstraction practice. The first factor is knowledge about analogues used for eliciting abstraction. Because analogy needs an analogue for comparison with a given situation to elicit abstraction effectively and for use of an analogue, the analogue must be understood first. The second factor that is influential for effective abstraction practice is the degree of mindfulness for the abstraction process. Mindfulness refers to a state of conscious awareness for exertion of active cognitive activities. The more the abstraction is mindful, the more the activities are generative. However, high-level mindfulness may cause mental exhaustion which may hinder effective and efficient learning achievement.\nIn this study, the effect of different levels of mindful abstraction activities on two types of transfer and the relation with knowledge about analogues were investigated to promote transfer in situated learning.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3202], "author_name_tesi": "Ryu, Jiyeon ", "last_name_ssi": "Ryu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiyeon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara L Grabowski", "Francis M Dwyer Jr.", "Kyle Leonard Peck", "Rayne Audrey Sperling"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara L Grabowski, Committee Chair", "Francis M Dwyer Jr., Committee Member", "Kyle Leonard Peck, Committee Member", "Rayne Audrey Sperling, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["situated learning", "low-road transfer", "high-road transfer", "mindful abstraction", "analogue knowledge"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "CAUSAL MODELING APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAFFIC SAFETY COUNTERMEASURES\n\n\n", "id": "12474", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3867", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nMore than 5.5 million police-reported traffic crashes occurred in the United States in 2009, resulting in 33,808 fatalities and more than 2.2 million injuries. Significant funds are expended annually by federal, state, and local transportation agencies in an effort to reduce traffic crashes. Effective safety management involves selecting highway and street locations with potential for safety improvements; correctly diagnosing safety problems; identifying appropriate countermeasures; prioritizing countermeasure implementation at selected sites; and, evaluating the effectiveness of implemented countermeasures.  Accurate evaluation of countermeasure effectiveness is a critical component of the safety management process. \nIn this study, a statistical causal modeling framework is described to assess countermeasure effectiveness from non-randomized observational data. Randomized experiments, which are ideal for determining countermeasure effectiveness, are seldom feasible in transportation studies due to legal, ethical, and safety reasons. The causal models mimic randomization based on observed covariates by incorporating the treatment assignment mechanism model into the analysis. A selected group of observed covariates, which may influence the countermeasure selection, are used to identify the treated and untreated entities with equal probability of receiving and not receiving the treatment. \nAverage treatment effects were determined using semi-parametric estimation methods based on the dual modeling of propensity scores and potential outcomes. Several causal methods are available to compute the average treatment effect of interventions. This study explored the applicability of three different causal methods -- matching, stratification, and regression estimation. To demonstrate the framework, the average treatment effect of fixed roadway lighting at intersections in Minnesota was determined. The average treatment effect of intersection lighting was based on the frequency and severity of crashes. The results indicate that fixed roadway lighting reduces the expected number of nighttime crashes by approximately 9 percent, which compares favorably to other, recent lighting-safety research findings. Daytime crashes were considered as a control. Lighting is not turned on during the day and therefore, it was hypothesized that the presence of fixed roadway lighting would not affect daytime crash frequency. The average treatment effect of intersection lighting based on daytime crashes was slightly above zero and the confidence intervals included zero, indicating no significant change in safety during the daytime at lighted intersections when compared to unlighted intersections. The comparability of the results from a sensitivity analysis conducted for different caliper values and sample sizes indicated the stability of the method. The average treatment effect values computed based on the frequency of crashes from causal models are comparable to the treatment effect that was found using standard cross-sectional models. \n\tThe treatment effect of intersection lighting based on the probability of occurrence of fatal and severe injury crashes indicate that the installation of intersection lighting will reduce the occurrence of these crash types at unlighted intersections by 16.67 percent. Based on the consistency of the results using different causal methods, and the comparability of the treatment effect values with other recent studies, causal methods appear to be a viable method for determining the effectiveness of traffic safety countermeasures. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3841], "author_name_tesi": "SASIDHARAN, LEKSHMI ", "last_name_ssi": "SASIDHARAN", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "LEKSHMI", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Todd Donnell", "Eric Todd Donnell", "Paul Peter Jovanis", "Martin T Pietrucha", "Joseph Francis Schafer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Todd Donnell, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Todd Donnell, Committee Chair", "Paul Peter Jovanis, Committee Member", "Martin T Pietrucha, Committee Member", "Joseph Francis Schafer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["regression estimation", "causal models", "propensity scores", "matching", "stratification"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Stress Reactivity in Borderline Personality Disorder\n", "id": "12058", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3834", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Emotional dysregulation is seen by many clinicians and researchers as a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD).  However, studies of emotional reactivity among individuals with BPD have yielded mixed findings, leaving uncertainty regarding the nature of emotional dysregulation in BPD.  The current study examined neuroendocrine, autonomic, and subjective emotional reactivity in response to a social stress paradigm (the Trier Social Stress Test; Kirschbaum, Pirke, & Hellhammer, 1993) in 33 women with BPD as compared to two psychologically healthy comparison groups: 27 women who scored similarly to the BPD group on measures of trait negative affect and impulsivity (temperamentally-matched controls (TMCs)); and 30 women who scored in the average range on these traits (non-temperamentally-matched controls (NTMCs)).  Repeated saliva samples were taken at eight time points and assayed for salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase (sAA).  In addition, subjective stress response and changes in negative affect were measured through self-report instruments.  It was hypothesized that the BPD group, in comparison to both control groups, would demonstrate greater cortisol, sAA, and subjective negative affective reactivity and impaired recovery to baseline levels after stress.\n     Contrary to the hypotheses, the results suggested neuroendocrine and autonomic hyporeactivity accompanied by high general negative affectivity in those with BPD.  Specifically, the BPD group demonstrated attenuated cortisol and sAA reactivity to the stressor as compared to both comparison groups.  Although the BPD group reported more negative affect overall across the experiment than both comparison groups, there was only a marginally significant difference between the NTMC and BPD groups in post-stress negative affect when controlling for pre-stress negative affect.  In addition, both the BPD and TMC groups reported experiencing the procedure as more stressful than the NTMC group.  BPD patients who reported higher levels of childhood trauma tended to have higher baseline sAA, less sAA reactivity, and a trend toward higher overall sAA output, in comparison to both healthy controls and BPD patients who reported less severe childhood trauma.  \n     These results add to the emerging body of literature suggesting extreme negative affectivity, but not necessarily hyperreactivity, of emotional responses in those with BPD.  Moreover, the attenuated cortisol and sAA reactivity in the BPD group suggests dysregulation of the stress response system in these patients that manifests in hyporeactivity, rather than hyperreactivity, at the level of glucocorticoid and central noradrenergic output in response to stress.  The differences between the BPD and TMC groups in most indices of emotional response suggest that trait negative affect and impulsivity cannot fully explain extreme negative affectivity or neuroendocrine abnormalities in patients with BPD.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3810], "author_name_tesi": "SCOTT, LORI NICOLE", "last_name_ssi": "SCOTT", "middle_name_ssi": "NICOLE", "first_name_ssi": "LORI", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Levy", "Kenneth Levy", "Aaron Lee Pincus", "Reginald Adams Jr.", "Douglas A Granger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Levy, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth Levy, Committee Chair", "Aaron Lee Pincus, Committee Member", "Reginald Adams Jr., Committee Member", "Douglas A Granger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["emotional dysregulation", "emotion", "stress", "alpha-amylase", "cortisol", "borderline personality disorder", "HPA axis", "autonomic", "affect", "reactivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "WALL MODEL EFFECTS ON TWO PHASE FLOWS AND PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION IN NANOCHANNELS\n\n", "id": "9998", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4745", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Molecular simulations of single phase bounded nanoflows, especially at high density, showed discrepancies from the classical Navier Stokes solutions: the failure of predicting the slip value at the wall, stratification of the density close to the wall and excessive heating which affects the natural thermal fluctuations of the atomistic system (NVE ensemble). These discrepancies are a direct consequence of the importance of the surface effects for such scales as the surface to volume ratio increases dramatically at the nanoscale. To alleviate some of these observed phenomena, the modeling of the solid boundaries progressed from implicit mathematical wall models to explicit multi-layered atomistic structure including temperature/pressure control mechanisms and heat transfer exchanges. However, the wall models used in molecular simulations vary greatly in physical characteristics such as the wetting property (under static conditions) or momentum and heat exchange (under flow conditions) and consequently, the equilibrium and steady state conditions reached depend on the complexity of the model and the application it is developed for. \nThis work investigates the characteristics of different wall models found in the literature and compares their effects for the specific applications of single phase flows and nanojets (two-phase flows). It is found that the system thermodynamic pressure varies considerably depending on the parameters and complexity of the surface models and consequently alters both the flow and the jet behaviors. Assessments of these differences in terms of the system pressure, slip value at the surface and the injection velocity for different wall categories (atomistic, stochastic/diffuse and functional wall models) and parameters are provided. Another important consequence is the dependency of nanojet stability on the dense flow-surface interactions and liquid-gas-solid surface interactions.\n    A new integrated and sinusoidal wall model was developed to satisfy the requirements of our main application: two-phase flow injection. It provides agreement with thermodynamic data and flow profiles as well as injection velocity. Other numerical tools were also introduced to better serve this specific numerical experiment. A new Lennard-Jones modified potential for long range corrections and a preliminary pressure driven flow method were developed and implemented and promising results for pressure, energy and flow profiles are found. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4710], "author_name_tesi": "SELLAMI, NADIA ", "last_name_ssi": "SELLAMI", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "NADIA", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Matthew Micci", "Michael Matthew Micci", "Robert Graham Melton", "Deborah A Levin", "Melik C Demirel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Matthew Micci, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Matthew Micci, Committee Chair", "Robert Graham Melton, Committee Member", "Deborah A Levin, Committee Member", "Melik C Demirel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Molecular Dynamics", "Nanoflows", "Surface interactions", "Virial Pressure", "Nanojets"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of two procedures for treatment of knee prosthetic joint infection (PJI)", "id": "14015xxs5101", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14015", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Background PJI remains a tremendous burden for individuals and the global health care industry because it can bring severe adverse outcomes.

System codes were developed for modeling the entire primary system, yet they use a relatively coarse nodalization that introduces some inaccuracies into the analysis. Sub-channel codes apply a finer discretization to the PWR core and therefore reduce some of these limitations, but at a higher computational cost.\nTo achieve relatively accurate solutions while maintaining reasonable computational costs, one of the best options would be to couple codes in order to analyze the entire system. The coupling concept offers clear advantages for analysts because it permits a higher level of detailed modeling that avoids the limitations of certain computer programs. In the past few years, numerous coupled thermal-hydraulic system codes have been developed enabling the modeling of different portions of the integrated domain with programs that will include their own available features that users can fully employ.\nFurthermore, in order to get more realistic information about some transient phenomena, not only do the models need to improve, but the numerical robustness and stability satisfying the qualitative accuracy requirements must also be fulfilled. The numerical solution of nonlinear systems involves an iterative process. Picard iteration has been widely used for solving nonlinear systems because it is easy to codify, has a relatively low computational cost, involves a symmetric linear system, and has low continuity requirements.\nThe main goal of this thesis is to describe the work carried out in the coupling of the COBRA-TF sub-channel code to the RELAP5-3D system code.

The model is forced with an idealized radiative equilibrium temperature profile which consists of a global-scale base profile and additional tropical heating and high-latitude cooling. The tropical heating controls the intensity of the subtropical jet, whereas the high-latitude cooling modulates the meridional width of the baroclinic zone.\n\n\nA large number of dry model runs are carried out by varying the values of the tropical heating and high-latitude cooling parameters. This parameter study shows that, in a regime with weak tropical heating and strong high-latitude cooling, the polar-front jet separates from the subtropical jet, forming a double-jet state. In contrast, if the tropical heating rate is greater than a certain value, a strong single jet emerges. These results indicate that the presence of one or two jets is dependent upon the relative values of both the tropical heating and the baroclinic zone width. It is also found that the boundary between the single- and double-jet regimes is often sharp. This nonlinear behavior is compared with linear theory and differences are discussed with the aid of spectral analysis. \n\n\nKeeping an application to the real atmosphere in mind, a set of moist model runs is also examined in which the moisture content is systematically varied. For a relatively small moisture content, the circulation prefers a double-jet state.  However, for a moisture content greater than a certain value, the two jets collapse into a single jet. This threshold response is explained with the aid of the aforementioned dry model results. Based on the results of the dry and moist model calculations, we further discuss various physical interpretations of circulation responses to global warming presented in the literature. \n\n\nThe structure of the westerly jet has a significant influence on its internal variability, which is quantified by determining the first two leading empirical orthogonal functions of the zonal-mean zonal wind (EOF1 and EOF2). In the single-jet regime, characterized by strong tropical heating and weak high-latitude cooling, EOF1 represents a latitudinal meandering of the jet, the so-called zonal index. In contrast, in a double-jet regime of weak tropical heating and strong high-latitude cooling, EOF1 and EOF2 combine to represent coherent poleward propagation of zonal-mean flow anomalies. \n\n\nGiven the recent finding that the spatial structure of EOF1, also known as the annular mode, shows a remarkable resemblance to the spatial pattern of the recent trend in the observed circulation (Thompson and Wallace 2000), for each simulation, we compare the EOF1 and zonal-mean low change with respect to changes in the tropical heating and the high-latitude cooling.  It is found that the `climate predictability' as determined by EOF1 is generally high in the strong single-jet regime, but is markedly low in the double-jet regime. It is also found that the 'climate predictability' by EOF1 tends to be higher with respect to changes in the high-latitude cooling, and thus the baroclinic zone width, than to changes in the tropical heating. The implications of these findings for Southern Hemisphere climate predictability are presented.\n\n\nThe above parametric behavior of the westerly jet and its internal variability are realized through the response of baroclinic eddies to thermal driving. In addition to their impact on westerly jets, one of the most important consequences of the baroclinic eddies in the general circulation is known to be the formation of the extratropical tropopause. Various theories indicate that it is the baroclinic eddy heat transports that raise and sharpen the tropopause. This is evaluated by examining the intraseasonal variability of the zonal-mean tropopause height derived from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) - National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) reanalysis data.\n\n\nA composite zonal-mean heat budget analysis for the Northern Hemisphere winter shows that fluctuation in the extratropical tropopause height results not only from a warming of the troposphere but also from an even stronger cooling of the lower stratosphere. While the tropospheric warming is caused by poleward eddy heat transport of baroclinic eddies, the stratospheric cooling is primarily driven by planetary-scale waves. Furthermore, the results from the analysis of synoptic- and planetary-scale eddy kinetic energy and Eliassen-Palm fluxes are consistent with the stratospheric planetary waves gaining their energy through an upscale energy cascade. These results indicate that, although the height of the extratropical tropopause is modulated by baroclinic eddies, which is consistent with various theories, the amount of the modulation is highly influenced by other processes such as stratospheric planetary-scale eddies.\n\n\nThe study is further extended to include the tropical tropopause. Intraseasonal variability of the zonal-mean tropical tropopause height is shown to be modulated by localized tropical convection. Most of this convective activity is identified as being part of the Madden-Julian Oscillation during the boreal winter, and part of the Indian Monsoon during the boreal summer. While the convection is highly localized, a large-scale circulation response to the convective heating rapidly warms most of the tropical troposphere, and cools most of the lowest few kilometers of the tropical stratosphere. The zonal mean tropical tropopause rises at most longitudes as a result of this tropic-wide upper tropospheric heating and lower-stratospheric cooling. This rise in the tropical tropopause height occurs within 10 days of the convective heating maximum.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5868], "author_name_tesi": "SON, SEOK WOO ", "last_name_ssi": "SON", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "SEOK WOO", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sukyoung Lee", "Peter R Bannon", "John H Clark", "Steven B Feldstein", "David Pollard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sukyoung Lee, Committee Chair", "Peter R Bannon, Committee Member", "John H Clark, Committee Member", "Steven B Feldstein, Committee Member", "David Pollard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Poleward propagation", "Zonal index", "Hadley cell", "Upscale energy cascade", "Baroclinic instability", "Madden-Julian oscillation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Development and Testing of an Expert System for Coalbed Methane Reservoirs using Artificial Neural Networks\n\n\n", "id": "8801", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3689", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reservoir simulators serve as excellent tools in predicting production performance of oil and gas reservoirs at a good level of accuracy. However, during initial stages of exploitation, for most of the reservoir properties and production parameters, there is a good level of uncertainty. In such cases, Expert Systems offer a screening tool to achieve the purpose of a simulator at a lower cost and reduced time. An expert system consists of a knowledge base and set of algorithms that are capable of inferring facts based on existing knowledge and incoming data. The level of accuracy of predictions from an expert system depends on the quality of data, rules that define the problem at hand and human expertise.\t\n\tArtificial neural networks are being used in a large number of reservoir engineering applications such as performance optimization, reservoir characterization, field development applications, well stimulation, formation evaluation and pressure transient analysis. The expert system described in this work is a tool which can be used to predict the performance of a coalbed methane reservoir just like any other numerical model. Starting with a simple model where predictions are confined to coal seams of known reservoir parameters and varying production parameters, a generalized model is developed. The developed expert system is designed for universal applications and provides gas and water production profiles for a period of about ten years as outputs. \n\tIn addition to this model, an inverse expert system, in which, for an expected percentage recovery from a coal seam, optimum ranges of well design parameters that satisfy the requirements of the producer are predicted. Conventional reservoir simulators may not provide the user with a list of suggestive design parameters that can help achieve a certain desired production performance from a coal seam of known reservoir properties before it can be put into production. This is achieved by the inverse model which otherwise can only be accomplished by trial and error procedures. \n\tUnderstanding the ability of the network to predict the output parameters is crucial in such developments. As expected, the complexity of the network topology is bound to increase with increased number of inputs and outputs.  Due to inherently existing nonlinearities in relationships between inputs and outputs, several modifications are required to institute a sound combination of inputs that can improve predictions significantly.

Transition metal enantioselective catalysis is certainly among the most challenging and widely investigated areas in organometallic chemistry. The design and synthesis of efficient chiral phosphorus ligands and the exploration of their applications in transition metal-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations are the main focus of this dissertation. \nBy introducing a bridge with variable length to link the chiral atropisomeric biaryl groups, a novel class of conformationally rigid Cn-TunePhos (n = 1-6) ligands was designed and synthesized in three different routes. The additional non-chiral linkage not only minimizes the conformational rotation but also defines the dihedral angle and the bite angle with improved precision. This family of TunePhos ligands has proven highly efficient in a variety of asymmetric hydrogenations. Ru/Cn-TunePhos catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of allyl phthalimides provided an efficient method for the synthesis of \u00a6\u00c2-methyl chiral amines.\nA series of C3-TunePhos derivatives with different steric and electronic properties was prepared by atropdiastereoselective Ullmann coupling reaction of the biaryl diethyl phosphonate.

Currently, formal ontologies attempt to provide semantic interoperability for our computational technologies, but they are problematic in that they simultaneously overspecify and decontextualize information, which to be meaningful must be adaptive in context. Folksonomies, on the other hand, are less well defined; they don\u2019t have any formal structure and are able to evolve as the lexicon of a community adapts to newly developed understandings among its members. Researchers have made various efforts, with limited success, at coupling ontologies and folksonomies to derive some sort of semantic interoperability. The difficulty with this coupling reveals a multifaceted tension between 1) structured ontologies and unstructured folksonomies, 2) lexicality, syntax and semantics, 3) social and cultural dimensions of tags, and 4) emergence and reification.  \n\nIn this dissertation I propose an original model, the Emergent Culture Model (ECM), which allows for structuring the relationships between the social and cultural dimensions of tags as a means of discerning the emergent semantics of folksonomies. The ECM posits cognitive schemas as a mediating mechanism between the social and cultural dimensions of tags. Schemas, when shared as cultural schemas, illustrate the importance of identity and how we employ multiple identities in the creation of semantics within folksonomies. The mediating role of schemas leads to a reconceptualization of folksonomies as semantic networks that serve as ready-to-hand entry points into networks of cultural schemas. These schemas help us navigate the complex cultural landscapes that comprise our human conceptual ontologies and provide a flexible structure through which we share these landscapes in a social context. The ECM is used to illustrate that current folksonomy research focuses solely on the social dimensions of tags and reifies the link between signifier and signified (i.e., between tag and resource) based on the traditional semiotic model. Current research fails to consider the cultural dimensions of tags, which are necessary for discerning their emergent semantics.  \n\nThe structure of the ECM enables a discussion of tags using a Heideggerian phenomenological frame to explore tags-as-equipment, tags-as-patterns, and tagging-as-practice. When tags function as equipment, they exist as part of a semiotic relationship as a sign, which Heidegger says, \u201cfunctions both as this definite equipment and as something indicative of the ontological structure of readiness-to-hand, of referential totalities.\u201d In exploring tags-as-patterns, I contend that a tag is ontic, not ontological, and only fulfill their ontic function as part of the phenomenological care-structure of Dasein, where the Heideggerian ideas of thrownness, mood, solicitude and falling hold sway. The interactions between equipment and care-structure reflects the social and cultural dimensions of tags and reveals the semantics of folksonomies to be an emergent phenomenon that can be modeled with the ECM.\n\nThe integration of our semantic networks and cultural landscapes is achieved through ontologization, a phenomenological characterization of the entwined processes of sense-making and meaning-making. Ontologization has significant implications for semantic interoperability, as it makes clear that the information is better conceived as a phenomenology rather than \u201cdata + meaning.\u201d Semantic interoperability involves not simply the transfer of information through a conduit, whether that conduit is human language or machine bits, but involves the connecting of semantic network data to cultural landscapes by way of schemas and ontologization.  The ontologization of tags allows for the emergence of semantics within folksonomies and the delineation of the ontologization process is a first step towards the creation of schematic ontologies that will facilitate semantic interoperability among our sociotechnical systems.\n\nIn order to demonstrate the viability of the ECM and a phenomenology of ontologization to folksonomy research, I apply the model and framework to tags gathered among two sets of interdisciplinary scholars, whose endeavors are necessarily intercultural and involve the semantics of several domains. With these collected tags, I am able to illustrate how the ECM has an inherent scalability that allows for the incorporation of multiple cultural identities, and I apply this capability to explore the building of conceptual networks through tags-as-equipment, tags-as-patterns and tagging-as-practice. Tags are revealed to be a form of informational equipment and function as signs. I am able to illustrate how the configuration of tag-as-equipment into semantic networks reveals the underlying care-structure of the participants, which reflects the second element of the phenomenological framing: tags-as-patterns. Applying the notion of tagging-as-practice addresses three issues: 1) the multiplicity of cultural identities and their importance to discerning semantics; 2) the limitations of current research on folksonomies that mistakes the collective nature of folksonomies as lexicon for the collaborative nature of semantics as cultural practice; and 3) how tag sets, as useful equipment, withdraw from present-at-hand experience and fade into the background to become ready-to-hand. Through tagging-as-practice I am able to underscore the need for disaggregation of folksonomies into culturally meaningful tag sets based in cultural identities arising from the care-structure. It is only through linking cultural identity to the tags in folksonomies can semantics be appropriately discerned and semantic interoperability using folksonomic tags be realistically achieved among our sociotechnical systems.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1430], "author_name_tesi": "Saab, David J", "last_name_ssi": "Saab", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Frederico T Fonseca", "Frederico T Fonseca", "Andrea H Tapia", "Michael Mc Neese", "Richard Doyle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Frederico T Fonseca, Dissertation Advisor", "Frederico T Fonseca, Committee Chair", "Andrea H Tapia, Committee Member", "Michael Mc Neese, Committee Member", "Richard Doyle, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tags", "ontologies", "cultural schemas", "folksonomies", "phenomenology", "Heidegger"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Dynamic Modeling of Biological and Physical Systems", "id": "15348", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7719", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Given the complexity and interactive nature of many biological and physical systems, constructing informative and coherent network models of these systems and subsequently developing efficient approaches to analyze the models is of utmost importance. The combination of network modeling and dynamic analysis enables one to investigate the behavior of the underlying system as a whole and to make experimentally testable predictions about less-understood aspects of the processes involved. This dissertation reports on a combination of theoretical and computational approaches for network-based dynamic analysis of several highly interactive biological and physical systems. Various dynamic modeling approaches, ranging from Boolean to continuous models, are employed to carry out a systematic analysis of the long-term behavior (attractors) of the respective systems. First, we employ a Boolean dynamic framework to model two biological systems: the abscisic acid (ABA) signal transduction network in plants and the T-LGL leukemia signaling network in humans. Given the relatively large number of components in these networks, we develop a network reduction technique leading to a significant decrease in the computational burden associated with the state space analysis of Boolean models while preserving essential dynamical features. For the ABA system, we utilize a synchronous and three different asynchronous Boolean dynamic methods and compare the attractors of the system and their basins of attraction for both unperturbed and perturbed systems. For the T-LGL signaling network, the best-performing asynchronous Boolean dynamic method identified in our first study is used to determine the disease states of the components of the system and to propose several novel candidate therapeutic targets. Next, we apply a Boolean-continuous hybrid (piecewise linear) dynamic formalism to model a pathogen-immune system interaction network, and present the results of a comparative study of the dynamic characteristics of Boolean and hybrid models. Finally, we rely on continuous dynamic modeling to prove the existence of traveling wave solutions in a better-characterized physical system, namely, a chain of coupled pendula in the presence of damping and forcing. Overall, the theoretical and computational approaches developed in this dissertation provide a bird\u2019s-eye-view of the avenues available for model-driven analysis of complex biological and physical systems.
