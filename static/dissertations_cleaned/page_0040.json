Changes to this habitat, via plant invasions, can therefore affect multiple aspects of the ecology of native fauna. Life histories maybe affected by plant invasions through the creation of mutualistic relationships between native animals such as those between frugivorous birds and invasive fleshy-fruited plants. The native bird-invasive plant relationship is important to understand since birds are an integral part of many ecosystem processes. The abundance of invasive fruit has been found to positively influence the abundance of some bird species; however, the effect that nesting in invasives has on avian ecology is still unclear. Here, I investigate how the presence of the invasive fruiting shrub honeysuckles (Lonicera spp.) affects multiple aspects of avian nesting ecology. During the breeding season of 2011, I found 227 nests in seven locations around the central Pennsylvania area to determine the nesting patterns of shrub-nesting birds. In addition, the parental care behavior of Dumetella carolinensis (gray catbird) was observed and morphological measures of the pre-fledgling chicks were taken to test whether there are effects of honeysuckle on the care and development of catbird nestlings. I found that shrub-nesting birds did not show a bias for honeysuckle dominated habitat, but did show a bias for honeysuckle nest substrates when honeysuckle was available. The abundance of honeysuckle also had no effect on the nest predation rates of shrub-nesting birds. In addition, the pre-fledging condition, measured by the mass:tarsus length ratio, of the nestlings in honeysuckle dominated habitat was 4% higher than in habitats dominated by other shrubs. The results of this study suggest the effects of honeysuckle habitats may be confounded by other factors and not directly related to the abundance of honeysuckle shrubs.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7920], "author_name_tesi": "Gleditsch, Jason Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Gleditsch", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tomas Carlo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tomas Carlo, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["nesting ecology", "Lonicera spp.", "Dumetella carolinensis", "nest habitat usage", "parental behavior"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Gender differences in leisure motivation, participation, and constraints for South African adolescents\n", "id": "8338", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5662", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Adolescence is an important developmental period and the leisure context is one that is particularly salient for adolescent development. However, there is currently a lack of research on adolescents from developing countries and the leisure experiences of this specific group. In particular, adolescents from South Africa face a number of obstacles, such as high rates of HIV/AIDS and seriously under-resourced neighborhoods, that can further impede their development. HealthWise, a preventive intervention program designed to increase positive use of free and leisure time, whilst also reducing substance use and engagement in risky behavior, has been successfully implemented in Mitchell's Plain, South Africa. Although the program appeared to be successful, the program developers acknowledged that some components warranted further attention. Therefore, focus groups were established to obtain more information on the free time experience for these adolescents. \n\nThis study utilized a mixed methods approach, including data from the focus groups and survey data from the larger HealthWise project, to obtain greater insight into the free time experience for adolescents from this area. In particular, this study addressed leisure motivation, participation, and constraints and the influence of both gender and the context on these variables. Two research assistants conducted a total of nineteen focus groups but only those from HealthWise schools were included in this study: 8th and 10th grade females (eight groups, n = 62), and 8th and 10th grade males (seven groups, n = 52). The quantitative sample consisted of 941 students from schools in Mitchell's Plain: 501 8th grade students and 440 10th grade students. There were a greater number of females (51.9%, n = 260) than males (48.1%, n = 241) in the 8th grade. This was also the case for the 10th grade, with a higher number of females (54.8%, n = 241) than males (45.2%, n = 199). \n\nAnalysis of the qualitative data showed that intrinsic motivations were the most frequently mentioned reasons for participation by both females and males, indicating that the free time experience was predominantly leisure-like for these adolescents. The most frequently discussed activity category was sports and physical activities and this was the case for both females and males. Males tended to discuss sports and physical activities more frequently than females and this difference was particularly evident in quantitative data, which indicated that there were inconsistencies between the two methods. Discrepancies between the two forms of data also emerged with other constructs. First, males reported higher levels of introjected motivation compared to females in the quantitative data but this trend was not evident in the focus groups. On the other hand, analysis of the sub-categories demonstrated gender differences: Males frequently reported participation to achieve social status, while females frequently discussed participation in order to conform to others' wishes. Amotivation was another area where the two data forms did not match; both groups discussed this construct equally in the focus groups but males reported higher levels in the quantitative data. This difference was ascribed to the category, \"inherent to one's gender\" (e.g., \"It's just what boys do\"), where males mentioned this as a reason for participation more often compared to females.   \n\nHowever, there were instances where both forms of data matched. Specifically, intrinsic motivation was more important to females than males, identified motivation was equally important to both genders, and extrinsic motivation was more important to males than females. However, the qualitative data did provide further insight into gender differences in intrinsic motivation: Females talked about social/relatedness reasons more frequently than males. Males, however, tended to talk about challenge more often than females. The motivation model applied to these data, the Self-Determination Theory, was developed in the West and, overall, appeared to be applicable in this context. Yet, it is also important to note that neither females nor males discussed autonomy as a motivation for participation in free time activities. Given this finding, it was expected that gender differences in constraints, or more specifically, parents as a constraint, would emerge from either the qualitative or the quantitative data. However, this was not the case.\n \nOverall, the constraints discussed appeared to follow a constraints model commonly utilized in Western research. However, closer analysis demonstrated that contextual factors influenced the salience of certain constraints. In particular, safety was a primary concern for adolescents in this area but this was more evident for females. Gender emerged as an underlying but extremely influential variable in this context: Females were unable to participate in \"boy's sports\" because of general social disapproval and a lack of resources. Participation in certain activities was also seen as being inappropriate for males because of gender and many participants did not want to be called \"moffy\" (gay). \n\nIn sum, gender played a vital role in the free time experience of adolescents from Mitchell's Plain, South Africa. This study identified a number of ways that the HealthWise curriculum can be modified to better meet their needs. Moreover, this study also contributes to the literature by demonstrating that, overall, models from the West are applicable to these adolescents but that there are some important differences. This suggests that care needs to be taken when applying such models to a different context. Further research on adolescents from developing countries is needed to ensure that youth worldwide have opportunities to engage in developmentally beneficial free time activities.\n \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5659], "author_name_tesi": "Gleeson, Sarah Laree", "last_name_ssi": "Gleeson", "middle_name_ssi": "Laree", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Linda L Caldwell", "Edward Smith", "Careen M Yarnal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Linda L Caldwell, Thesis Advisor", "Edward Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Careen M Yarnal, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Leisure motivation", "South Africa", "Adolescents", "Leisure", "Leisure constraints"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "X-RAY CRYSTAL STRUCTURES EXPLAIN DNA-HAIRPIN PROMOTER BINDING AND DE NOVO TRANSCRIPTION INITIATION FOR THE N4 VIRION RNA POLYMERASE", "id": "8815", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4234", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "N4 vRNAP is a virion-encapsidated RNA polymerase (vRNAP) from the N4 bacteriophage that is injected into host E.coli K12 cells to transcribe N4 early genes.  Its central domain (mini-vRNAP) contains all RNAP functions of the full-length vRNAP, which recognizes a five- to seven-base pair stem and three-nucleotide loop hairpin DNA promoter.  I have determined X-ray crystal structures of promoter bound and transcription initiation complexes of N4 mini-vRNAP at 2.0 and 1.8 \u00c5, respectively.  Structural motifs in N4 mini-vRNAP participating in promoter recognition are similar to those found in the T7 RNA polymerase, although T7 recognizes a double-stranded DNA promoter. The binary complex structure revealed that the plug and motif B loop, which block the access of template DNA to the active site in the apo-form mini-vRNAP, undergo a large-scale conformational change upon promoter binding, explaining the restricted promoter specificity that is critical for N4 phage early transcription.\n\nWhile much is known about RNA polymerization with a pre-existing primer (called transcription elongation), the structural study presented in this thesis elucidates how the RNA polymerase synthesizes RNA without a primer (de novo transcription initiation).  Here I report the first transcription initiation complex for a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase - N4 mini-vRNAP- that has both initiating nucleotides as well as both catalytic metals in the active site.  This structure provides for a detailed analysis of the conformations and interactions of both the substrates and protein side chains.  I report pre-catalytic de novo transcription initiation complexes, with and without catalytic metal A, that reveal that the gamma phosphate group of the +1 nucleotide is involved in metal binding and positions proximal to its own 3\u2019-OH group, suggesting a possible role in catalysis.  X-ray crystallographic analysis of a K437A N4 mini-vRNAP mutant transcription initiation complex revealed that K437 plays a role in +1 triphosphate stabilization.  Lastly, I have solved the structure of a pre-translocated 2-mer product and pyrophosphate transcription initiation complex that completes a structural description of the beginning and end events of the first phosphodiester bond formation.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4207], "author_name_tesi": "Gleghorn, Michael L", "last_name_ssi": "Gleghorn", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katsuhiko Murakami", "Biao He", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "B Tracy Nixon", "Song Tan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katsuhiko Murakami, Committee Chair", "Biao He, Committee Member", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Song Tan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["X-ray crystallography", "RNA polymerase", "transcription", "de novo transcription initiation", "two-metal catalysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Selection and Retention of Certified Nursing Assistants in Nonprofit Long-term Healthcare Facilities and the Impact on Quality of Care", "id": "28839", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12359", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study is to examine existing practices in staffing and selection methods at nonprofit long-term healthcare facilities in Pennsylvania in order to discover which are the most viable for optimal hourly certified nursing assistant retention.

The goal of this work is to conduct a spore release and recapture field experiment, coupled with a Lagrangian Stochastic Particle Dispersion Model (LSPDM), to investigate how properties of canopy turbulence impact the dispersion of spores inside the canopy and the fraction of spores that escape from the canopy.\n\nAn extensive \ffield experiment was conducted to study spore dispersion inside and outside a maize canopy. The spores were released from point sources located at various depths inside the canopy. Concentration measurements were obtained inside and above the canopy by a 3-dimensional grid of spore collectors. The experimental measurements of mean spore concentration are used to evaluate a LSPDM for spore dispersion. In the LSPDM, a second-order closure model for turbulence within plant canopies specifies flow \ffield statistics used to drive particle dispersion. The dispersion model includes spore deposition on and rebound from canopy elements. The combination of experimental and numerical simulations is used to quantify the fraction of spores that escape the canopy.

The first two concern topics centering on addition to the S&P 500 Index. In chapters two and three, I examine the price and liquidity effects (respectively) of additions to the S&P500 Index from January 1993 to December 2000. The results from chapter two indicate that previous inferences about long run buy and hold returns are fallaciously obtained from a test statistic with low power. Consequently, while the short run\ndemand curve for newly added S&P stocks appears to slope down, the data suggest that no S&P effect exists in the form of a permanently downward sloping demand curve.\n\nIn chapter three, I present the lasting liquidity improvements that arose from index addition. Permanent reductions in several static and dynamic measures of liquidity are statistically significant but are confined to NYSE firms.  The spread decomposition and static trade analyses agree with previous research and imply a perennial increase in liquidity through a\n15% reduction in the quoted and effective spreads. The dynamic liquidity measure indicates a permanent increase in market resilience.  Post addition, smaller quote revisions obtain.\nCumulative mid-quote revisions to buy side shocks fell by 25% and revisions to sell side shocks fell by 27%, implying that private\ninformation in the order flow fell after addition.\n\nThe final chapter is a spread decomposition model that allows for nonlinearities in the data. Most spread decomposition models utilize volume and/or trade signs in a linear specification to explain observed price changes. This paper illustrates the importance of another variable, unexpected trade intensity, in\nexplaining and forecasting effective spreads. I use Engle's (1996) WACD(p,q) model and other proxies for unexpected trade intensity in a generalized version of Glosten and Harris' (1988) spread decomposition model. I adapt Hansen's (1999) technique for testing for the presence of nonlinearities in the relationship between price changes and trade volume and between price changes and unexpected trade intensity. The data suggest that volume and\nintensity are priced independently and on average place a 22% premium on large volume and a 8% premium on immediacy conditional on a given volume. Selecting a suitable proxy for trade intensity and incorporating the threshold values into the model not only allows for enhanced estimation of the effective spread, but also for more precise forecasts.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1708], "author_name_tesi": "Glidewell, Edward ", "last_name_ssi": "Glidewell", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Edward", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herman J Bierens", "Quanwei Cao", "Oliver Hansch", "Timothy T Simin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herman J Bierens, Committee Chair", "Quanwei Cao, Committee Chair", "Oliver Hansch, Committee Member", "Timothy T Simin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["S&P", "spread decomposition", "trading costs"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Polyphenol-rich foods as interventions for obesity and fatty liver disease", "id": "27544", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12195", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the United States, approximately 68% of adults are overweight or obese, and this number is projected to rise to 86% by 2030. Obese individuals are at a greater risk for the development of several pathologies including diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and some cancers. It is therefore imperative to investigate dietary interventions to combat obesity and its comorbidities. Obese individuals have been shown to be in a chronic state of inflammation due to increases in systemic endotoxin availability, a condition known as metabolic endotoxemia. Epidemiological evidence suggests that a high intake of plant-based foods rich in polyphenolic compounds is associated with decreased inflammation and a lower risk of chronic diseases. The overall goal of this project was to investigate the extent to which polyphenolic compounds and polyphenol-rich foods modulate markers of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in vitro and in vivo, and to explore the underlying mechanisms of action.\nPrevious studies have reported that tea polyphenols that contain one or more galloyl ester moieties and proanthocyanidins with a high degree of polymerization potently inhibit digestive enzymes including pancreatic lipase (PL) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in vitro. We investigated the importance of the position and number of galloyl groups in the PL inhibitory potency of tea polyphenols. We found that theaflavin-3,3\u2032-digallate (TFdiG), theaflavin-3\u2032-gallate (TF3\u2019G), theaflavin-3-gallate (TF3G), theaflavin (TF), (\u2013)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), (\u2013)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG), and (\u2013)-epigallocatechin (EGC) inhibited PL with 50% inhibition (IC50) of 1.9 \u00b5M, 4.2 \u00b5M, 3.0 \u00b5M, and 32.9 \u00b5M, 13.3 \u00b5M, 13.9 \u00b5M, and > 100 \u00b5M, respectively, confirming that the presence and indicating that the location of the galloyl ester moiety is essential for inhibitory potency. Using in silico modeling approaches, theaflavins were found to bind to Asn263 and Asp206 in PL. These amino acids form a pocket adjacent to the active site; galloyl-containing theaflavins were then able to form a hydrogen bond with His264, which forms part of the catalytic triad. This interaction is predicted to perturb the protonation status of His264 and reduce PL catalytic activity. The same mechanism of inhibition is seen with green tea catechins. I also observed that tea catechins inhibited PLA2 and this inhibition appears to be due to the catechins occupying a tunnel that leads to the active site. We also investigated the PL inhibitory activity of a panel of spices and berries, which have been reported by others to have high antioxidant activity. Of the extracts tested, cinnamon and cranberry extract (CBE) inhibited PL with the greatest potency, with IC50s of 10.03 \u00b5g/ml and 19.49 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. The total polyphenol content significantly inversely correlated with PL inhibitory potency for both spice (Pearson r = -0.90, p = 0.015) and berry extracts (Pearson r = -1.0, p = 0.001). These findings suggest a potential chemical basis for the inhibition of these two digestive enzymes by tea polyphenols and demonstrate potential beneficial inhibitory effects of berry and spice extracts on PL and PLA2.\nNAFLD is a spectrum of diseases that ranges from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NASH is an inflammatory disease that can eventually progress to cirrhosis. Polyphenols, such as those found in cranberries, have been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. C57BL/6J mice were fed a 60%kcal from fat diet (HF). After 11 weeks, half of the mice were switched to HF diet supplemented with 0.8% CBE. After an additional 10 weeks of treatment, mice were euthanized and markers of obesity and NAFLD/NASH were examined. CBE supplementation had no effect on final weight gain, but it did significantly decrease total lipid area in the liver and plasma alanine aminotransferase levels compared to the HF group, indicating a decrease in liver injury. Supplementation with CBE decreased hepatic toll-like receptor 4 gene expression (63%) and hepatic nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB gene expression (24%) compared to the HF group. Hepatic expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, a pro-inflammatory cytokine gene regulated by NF-\u03baB, and C-C chemokine receptor 2, a receptor for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, were also significantly decreased by CBE supplementation compared to HF mice. In addition, CBE supplemented mice demonstrated reduced expression of nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 inflammasome-related genes compared to HF-fed controls. Sirtuin-1 (Sirt1) gene expression was significantly increased by CBE supplementation, while Sirt1 target genes such as sterol response element-binding protein-1c, nuclear respiratory factor-1, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1\u03b1 showed decreased expression compared to HF-fed mice. These data suggest that CBE may mitigate obesity-related hepatic inflammation and liver damage; however, additional experiments are needed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of action.\nGut permeability and microbiota play an important role in the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into systemic circulation. Caco-2 monolayers grown in a trans-well system, a model of the gastrointestinal epithelial barrier, were treated with CBE and/or TNF-\u03b1 on the apical side, basolateral side, or both as an in vitro model of intestinal permeability. Interestingly, TNF-\u03b1 did not induce permeability as has been previously reported. By contrast, CBE treatment alone, when added to the basolateral side, significantly increased permeability compared to control. TNF-\u03b1 treatment did induce a significant inflammatory response, as measured by interleukin (IL)-8 production. CBE attenuated this response. Similar anti-inflammatory effects were observed in TNF-\u03b1 and LPS induced HT-29 human colon cancer cells pre-, co-, and post-treated with CBE. Aggregates of lymphoid tissue found in the small intestine known as Peyer\u2019s patches, were isolated from both CBE supplemented mice and HF-fed control mice. Stimulation of these tissues with LPS resulted in production of IL-6.  The production of this inflammatory cytokine was significantly lower in Peyer\u2019s patches isolated from CBE-supplemented mice compared to those isolated from the HF group.\nWe investigated the effect of CBE treatment on the fecal microbiota of high fat-fed mice. We observed a decrease in the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, a change associated with improvements in obesity and metabolic syndrome, in the CBE mice. CBE supplementation also caused a significant decrease in the levels of Clostridium, Lactococcus, Eubacterium, and Enterorhabdus spp. (p < 0.05) and a decreasing trend in Oscillibacter and Lactobacillus spp. (p < 0.1) compared to the HF group. A significant decrease in the unclassified Erysipelotrichaceae family (p < 0.05) and an insignificant decrease in the unclassified Clostridiales family in the CBE group was also observed. These changes have all been associated with improvements in NAFLD.\nIn conclusion, the structure of a compound is important in determining its inhibitory potency due to interactions with key amino acids in digestive enzymes.

The most effective tools yet available to reduce disease incidence and interrupt transmission are chemical insecticides directed against the mosquito vectors. However, in the face of insecticide resistance, it is becoming clear that continuing to use insecticides in the current way will not be enough to eradicate malaria. Here, we aimed to establish proof-of-principle for a new approach to insecticide deployment: the dilution solution. Using reduced concentrations of currently-used compounds to selectively eliminate only the mosquitoes that are infected or that have lived long enough to have developed the Plasmodium parasites and be infectious would allow us to achieve effective malaria control, yet reduce the selection pressure for exposed mosquito populations to become insecticide resistant. \n\nWe showed that reduced concentrations of permethrin or malathion, representatives of two classes of insecticides used in public health, can preferentially kill older, potentially-infectious, Anopheles stephensi females in the laboratory. Parameterizing a model with our data, we also showed that certain reduced concentrations of these chemicals can also delay the spread of insecticide resistance, though being able to use the intervention longer trades off with the initial, maximum level of disease control. \n\nThis low-dose insecticide strategy also comes with the potential problem that there could be sub-lethal effects of exposure that reduce mosquito fitness, negating the resistance management gains garnered by allowing some young females to reproduce. Indeed, in our experiments, mosquitoes exposed to permethrin immediately after bloodfeeding produced fewer offspring than unexposed members of their cohort, which advanced the spread of resistance alleles through our modeled populations.  \n\nDue to the decay of insecticide residues from treated walls and bednets, low-dose insecticide exposure might already be common in the field; how it might affect mosquitoes under highly variable field conditions remains a largely open question. We investigated one environmental condition that is highly variable and known to interact with many aspects of mosquito- and malaria parasite- life history: temperature. Temperature significantly affected insecticide susceptibility even at high concentrations. At lower concentrations, under simulated daily temperature fluctuations, insecticide susceptibility differed at different times of day, depending on the chemical to which the mosquitoes were exposed.   \n  \nIt is clear that there is still a lot to be discovered about how chemical insecticides work to control mosquitoes and, especially, how they work to control malaria in the field. Overall, our results show that, when assessing the efficacy of chemicals during new compound screening, during field tests of residual persistence, and insecticide resistance monitoring, it is important to take into account variables such as the age of the mosquitoes you wish to control and the environmental temperatures at which you wish to control them.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9318], "author_name_tesi": "Glunt, Katey Diana", "last_name_ssi": "Glunt", "middle_name_ssi": "Diana", "first_name_ssi": "Katey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Fraser Read", "James Harold Marden", "Matthew Brian Thomas", "Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Christopher Albert Mullin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Fraser Read, Dissertation Advisor", "James Harold Marden, Committee Chair", "Matthew Brian Thomas, Committee Member", "Tracy Lee Langkilde, Committee Member", "Christopher Albert Mullin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mosquito", "Anopheles", "insecticide", "insecticide resistance", "mosquito control", "malaria control", "Plasmodium"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Perpetual Outsiders?: Learning Race in the South Asian American Experience\n", "id": "28872", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11953", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Following Schueller (2003), I use critical race theory (Delgado & Stefancic, 2005, 2012; Goldberg, 1993, 2009; Harpalani, 2003, 2013; I.

The focus in this study was on how participants learned, understood and made sense of their racialized experience. Learning was defined from a sociocultural perspective using Cultural Historical Activity Theory (Engestr\u00f6m, 1987, 1999c, 2001; Sawchuk, 2003). Feminist ethnography was the approach used to capture the thick descriptions of the SAA experience. Multiple case study (Stake, 1995, 1998, 2005) was used as a process and product of analysis (Patton, 2002, p. 447). Thematic narrative analysis (Riessman, 1993, 2008) complemented by Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), postcolonial feminist theory, and critical race theory was the analytical lens used in this study. The participants in the study learned to be racialized and learned to become South Asian American, a distinct racial identity. The data suggested that religion and caste (culture) in conjunction with skin color, hair color and other physical attributes (biology) constitute the SAA racial category. This shows that SAAs are racialized differently from other minority groups, and following Goldberg\u2019s (2009) typology, I call this this type of differential racialization (Delgado & Stefancic, 2005, 2012), Racial South Asian Americanization. This decenters the dominant American perspective on race and racism, thus calling for a radical retheorization of race as Loomba (1998) recommends. This study contributes to postcolonial theory, Desicrit (the form of critical race theory that focuses on SAAs), CHAT, race theory, South Asian American Studies, and adult learning by demonstrating the relevance of race in the SAA experience. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11395], "author_name_tesi": "Gnanadass, Edith N", "last_name_ssi": "Gnanadass", "middle_name_ssi": "N", "first_name_ssi": "Edith", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Michael Schied", "Fred Michael Schied", "Paul C Taylor", "Gabeba Baderoon", "Adnan A Qayyum", "Mrinalini Sinha", "Ian E Baptiste"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Michael Schied, Dissertation Advisor", "Fred Michael Schied, Committee Chair", "Paul C Taylor, Committee Member", "Gabeba Baderoon, Committee Member", "Adnan A Qayyum, Committee Member", "Mrinalini Sinha, Special Member", "Ian E Baptiste, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["CHAT", "Critical Race Theory", "Desicrit", "South Asian Americans", "Postcolonial Theory", "Adult Learning", "Race", "Racism", "Indian Americans"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Performance Modeling and Resource Allocation for Adaptive Agent-Based Systems ", "id": "8059", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5818", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Applications are increasingly becoming networks of individual application components spread over an infrastructure of physical resources (servers and computing entities). Such distributed agent-based applications are not only prevalent in military domains but also in commercial domains such as data centers. To assure the survivability of a distributed application, repeatedly estimating what sort of multi-dimensional guarantees (such as response time or availability) can be made as a function of the offered load and environmental conditions is paramount. This thesis studies how such guarantees can be computed and negotiated in a distributed MAS that is situated on an unreliable infrastructure.\n\nFirstly, this work concentrates on identifying relevant service-level attributes that can be estimated for the failure-prone infrastructure. Queueing models with single and multi-class traffic are studied in scenarios with breakdown, repair and catastrophic failure, and are utilized for the estimation of performance and reliability attributes in steady state. These analytical results serve as internal models for the agents which aid them in evaluating the quality of service that can be attained given the environmental conditions (stresses and information load). Secondly, two resource allocation mechanisms are studied that are used to assign the agents to the nodes forming the infrastructure which are constrained by capacity, and are non-homogeneous in terms of their capability and the stresses experienced. Since the assignment problem is in general NP-hard, a few allocation heuristics with varying roles on the part of the agents and the infrastructure are proposed. Finally, in order to use resources efficiently, a usage price is computed based on the application\u2019s demand for the service-level attributes (which are the information goods sold by the infrastructure).\n\nThe main contributions of this work are the analytical solutions for the queueing models \u2013 which include multi-class traffic, service disruption (both temporary and catastrophic failure) and non-preemptive priority scheduling.  The analytical models pave the way for rapid negotiation between the MAS and the infrastructure as opposed to relatively slower simulation models. The analytical solutions are applicable to other domains including web-servers and hosting. The other contribution is the study of decentralized mechanisms that aid in the negotiation of quantitative service-level agreements in multi-agent systems and, in general, service-oriented architectures. While negotiation protocols and methods are widely studied, automatic negotiation using internal models are novel to this work, especially to distributed MAS.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5815], "author_name_tesi": "Gnanasambandam, Shanmuganathan ", "last_name_ssi": "Gnanasambandam", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shanmuganathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "M Jeya Chandra", "Tao Yao", "Dr Jun Shu", "Dr Natarajan Gautam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Chair", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "Dr Jun Shu, Committee Member", "Dr Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["queueing", "performance", "resource allocation", "agents", "logistics", "supply-chain", "optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Does message interactivity help or hinder the effects of anthropomorphic online chat agents?

Chat agents provide numerous benefits, including low cost and ease of use. However, using online chat agent, especially, a chat-bot poses challenges as well, in that their conversation styles are somewhat limited and impersonal. Given that chat-bots are designed to substitute for actual human agents, this study suggests that the message interactivity that is characteristic of human-to-human conversation may be one means for improving chat-bots\u2019 communication. In particular, this study aims to investigate how the ability of chat-bots to exchange messages in a contingent manner may compensate for their lack of humanness. In order to investigate this effect, this study conceptualizes the ability to exchange messages in a contingent manner as message interactivity and humanness in terms of the chat agents\u2019 visual representation (as anthropomorphic or not) and role identity (as chat-bot or human).\nA human-like conversation style of a chat-bot is expected to compensate for the chat-bot\u2019s lack of its humanness; however, it is also possible that if its conversation style is too contingent in style, and thus too human-like, an expectancy violation may occur. Thus, this study pays special attention to these two possibilities (i.e., the compensation effect and the expectancy violation effect) to explain the effects of message interactivity using the Interactivity Effects Model (Sundar, 2007) and the theory of interactive media effects (TIME) proposed by Sundar et al. (2015b). \nThese possibilities were investigated with a 2 (anthropomorphic visual cue: high vs low anthropomorphism) \u00d7 2 (identity cue: chat-bot vs. sales associate) \u00d7 2 (message interactivity: high vs. low message interactivity) between-subjects experiment. Participants were asked to interact with an online chat agent by using \u201clive chat\u201d function on an e-commerce website. By examining the interactions of visual cue, identity cue and message interactivity, this study revealed distinctive mechanisms through which message interactivity affects users\u2019 psychological, attitudinal, behavioral and relational responses. Specifically, findings show that message interactivity works to compensate for the impersonal nature associated with low anthropomorphic visual cue and chat-bot identity cue. Moreover, the identity cue turned out to be a key factor in eliciting certain expectations regarding the agent\u2019s performance in conversation. Therefore, this study suggests using chat agents on organizational websites in order to help mitigate users\u2019 negative evaluations or experiences due to high expectations given that users tend to have different expectations of agents\u2019 performances, depending on whether the agents are human or chat-bots. Therefore, agents\u2019 actual communication styles should align with users\u2019 expectations.

Certifying adequate part quality remains a barrier to implementation, and process monitoring and part qualification during metallic AM processes may serve as a crucial enabler for the widespread adoption of metallic AM in industrial, military and commercial settings. Post build evaluation techniques, such as x-ray computerized tomography (CT), can identify discontinuities in AM parts, however post-build inspection is costly, and embedded defects may be difficult or impossible to repair. The layerwise construction of metallic powder bed fusion AM(PBFAM) parts presents the opportunity to repair defects during the build process, and so the ability to detect flaws in situ could enable cost-effective in-process re-melting and correction of detected flaws in AM parts. High resolution imaging of build layers may provide a cost-effective means to realize in situ flaw detection, compared to melt pool monitoring and post-build evaluation techniques, to achieve in-process certification. This research investigates and explores a discontinuity detection scheme implemented in a metallic PBFAM system using supervised machine learning on sensor data collected in situ during each layer of the AM build process. A PBFAM system was instrumented with a high resolution digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera that captured multiple images of the entire build platform following each powder recoating and laser fusion step of each layer in the build. Ground truth labels defining part condition, e.g. anomalous or nominal, were extracted from post-build high resolution CT scans of a single AM part utilizing advanced image processing tools. The anomalous features detected within the CT scan were manually verified to correspond to discontinuities within the component, and were depicted in a 3D representation to provide insight into the development of part flaws during the build process. An affine transformation was generated to map the CT scan data and 3D location of discontinuities into the DSLR layerwise image data using reference points in the AM part, enabling the definition of anomalous and nominal ground truth labels of discretized locations obtained from CT scan data to be properly located within the DSLR layerwise images. Based on knowledge of the AM process and the accuracy of the generated affine transformation, multi-dimensional features were extracted from labeled anomalous and nominal DSLR image locations. Supervised machine learning was employed to study the severability of the labeled anomalous and nominal features directly within the domain of the in situ layerwise images. Linear support vector machine (SVM) models were used to create two discontinuity detection strategies, which were then validated through four-fold cross-validation.

A more efficient process would be to provide new faculty with an overview of their pedagogical options at the outset of their work, preferably one grounded in data about current teaching norms at their institution; however, after considerable research, such an overview was not found to exist either locally or nationally. This study attempted to correct for this by investigating 36 teaching activities used by faculty teaching primarily undergraduates at Bucknell University in Lewisburg, PA.

A modular product design software is then created based on the definition of Interface, which has additional functionality like working directly with the black box function model of the product, and inherently handling branching and merging. The flexibility of the algorithm is demonstrated with a case study. This modular product design software tool is developed using Integer Programming (IP) formulation to solve the design problem using Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning.

The pool of dead roots can be of similar or higher magnitude as the living fine root biomass pool. While root turnover is fastest among root order branches with a diameter less than 1 mm, tissue chemistry varies among even the finest root orders and between white roots and older, pigmented roots. Yet the effects of pigmentation and order on root decomposition have rarely been examined. We utilized root litter-bags and pre-installed minirhizotron tubes (MR) to examine rates of decomposition and rates of persistence between 1st & 2nd and 3rd & 4th order roots among temperate tree species at a common garden site in southwestern Poland.  In the root litter-bag study, roots were enclosed in litterbags and buried under their own and under a common species canopy in a 34-year-old common garden in Poland.  When comparing decomposition of different root orders over 36 months, pigmented 3rd and 4th order roots with a higher C:N ratio decomposed more rapidly, losing 20 to 40% of their mass, than pigmented 1st and 2nd order roots, that lost no more than 20%. When comparing decomposition of roots of different levels of pigmentation within the same root order over 14 months, pigmented (older) 1st & 2nd order roots lost approximately 10% of their mass, while white (younger) 1st and 2nd order roots lost about 30%. In contrast to root mass loss, root N content declined more rapidly in the 1st and 2nd order roots than in 3rd and 4th order roots. In higher order roots, N increased in the first 10 months from about 110% to nearly 150% of initial N content depending on species; by the end of the study N content had returned to initial levels. The findings of our root litter bag study suggests that in plant communities where root mortality is primarily of pigmented 1st and 2nd order roots, microbial decomposition may be slower than estimates derived from bulk fine root litter bag experiments, which typically contain at least four root orders. \n\tFor the MR study, we took image sessions on MR tubes two months prior to a trenching application. Persistence of dead fine roots was assessed by tracking severed roots on trenched minirhizotron tubes, from August 2004 until August 2007. We observed 902 roots, during the two months before trenching around MR tubes, of which 97 % were less than 1 mm in diameter. New roots growing next to severed roots are a major accelerator of severed root decomposition (< 1 mm) in all temperate tree species. Persistence of severed roots increased with soil depth, while increasing soil microbial biomass carbon, labile soil carbon content and earthworms decreased severed-root persistence, as did soil porosity and percent clay content. Severed older roots had higher root persistence than severed younger roots of the two maple tree species. Persistence of dead roots was relatively long in this sandy, infertile soil, ranging from 320 to greater than 974 days, depending on species.  \n\tIn an additional study, using remaining sample material from the root litter-bag study, we addressed the recalcitrance of lignin in fine root orders.  Due to small root specimen availability we utilized the FTIR technique to observe changes in peak area around the FTIR spectra wave number of 1510 cm-1, which is linked to oscillations of aromatic ring structure, the basic molecular structure of monolignol units. Contrary to our expectations, estimates of initial lignin concentration did not show significant differences between 1st & 2nd and 3rd & 4th order roots in the three species. In contrast to Acer. platanoides and Tilia cordata, Pinus sylvestris was the only species that showed variations in lignin concentration over time in the two root-order categories. Our results confirm the recalcitrant nature of lignin. However, our results warrant further detailed verification, since oscillations of aromatic ring structure at a wave number of 1510 cm-1 could also represent other chemical compounds, e.g. phenolic or suberin. \n\tIn conclusion, a more mechanistic understanding of root decomposition and its contribution to ecosystem carbon and nutrient dynamics requires a fundamental shift in experimental methods that stratifies root samples for decomposition along more functionally based criteria such as root order and pigmentation, which parallels the markedly different longevities of these different root classes. In addition, the hidden nature of belowground process needs to be approached with different methods at the same time in order to overcome limitations of individual techniques.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8385], "author_name_tesi": "Goebel, Marc ", "last_name_ssi": "Goebel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Marc", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Eissenstat", "Jason Philip Kaye", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye", "Eric Zenner", "Dr Sarah Hobbie"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Eissenstat, Dissertation Advisor", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye, Committee Member", "Eric Zenner, Committee Member", "Dr Sarah Hobbie, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["decomposition", "fine roots", "root pigmentation", "root order", "litter bags", "nitrogen", "root persistence", "soil depth", "root neighbors"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Interleukin-6 Contributes To Immunity Against Bordetella Pertussis.\n\n", "id": "8697", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6354", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bordetella pertussis, an endemic human respiratory pathogen, causes whooping cough, a severe coughing illness.

Here, we investigate the effect of a pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-6, on clearance of this respiratory pathogen using a murine model of infection. B. pertussis cleared from the lungs of wild-type mice approximately 40 days postinoculation. However, in the absence of IL-6, B. pertussis grew to higher numbers and persisted more than 77 days. Also, IL-6 contributed to infection-induced immunity. B. pertussis specific serum antibody titers were decreased in the absence of IL-6, most of which were T cell dependent antibody subtype, IgG2b. Splenic T cell cytokine responses were dampened in helper T cell (TH) 1 and TH2 cytokine production in response to B. pertussis. CD4+ T cells and neutrophils, both required to clear B. pertussis infection, were found to be IL-6 dependent for recruitment to the lungs. Together, these results indicate that IL-6 contributes to clearance of B. pertussis in both na\u00efve and previously infected hosts. Delay in clearance of this bacterium is likely caused by a defective T-cell response in the absence of IL-6.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6354], "author_name_tesi": "Goel, Tania ", "last_name_ssi": "Goel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tania", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bordetella pertussis", "Respiratory pathogen", "Interleukin-6"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "From Self to Character: Narration, Acknowledgment and Theatricality", "id": "18684", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8852", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This is a dissertation on the relation between narrative and selfhood.

However, I object to the narrative conception of the self on the grounds that it is unable to fix on what the content of our self-narrative should be.\nI introduce a concept that has so far been left out of discussions of narrative and selfhood, Stanley Cavell\u2019s concept of acknowledgment. I argue that selfhood requires that we acknowledge who we are. One of the ways in which we can acknowledge who we are, as I illustrate through the use of the example of Hal from Shakespeare\u2019s Henriad, is through theatricalizing ourselves. This involves being beheld by an audience and turning ourselves into a character.\nIn the final chapter of this dissertation, I argue that we can theatricalize ourselves and acknowledge ourselves through writing a literary narrative based on our lives. In a literary narrative we create a character out of ourselves and present ourselves to an audience. Therefore, I argue, the role narrative plays in selfhood is not to define who we are but to serve as a means of acknowledging ourselves, which is requisite for selfhood.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8698], "author_name_tesi": "Goff, Alastair Peter", "last_name_ssi": "Goff", "middle_name_ssi": "Peter", "first_name_ssi": "Alastair", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Emily Rolfe Grosholz", "Brady Lee Bowman", "John Philip Christman", "Patrick G Cheney", "Emily Rolfe Grosholz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Emily Rolfe Grosholz, Committee Chair", "Brady Lee Bowman, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Patrick G Cheney, Committee Member", "Emily Rolfe Grosholz, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["self", "character", "narration", "acknowledgment", "theatricality", "literature", "autobiography", "Shakespeare"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Linking Energizers to Academic Performance in Rural Elementary Schools (Project LEAP)\n\n", "id": "11015", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1148", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite the documented benefits of physical activity, many schools have not implemented such programs due to concerns about taking time from academic instruction (Sibley & Etnier, 2003).

When the material is properly digested and stabilized, it can meet state regulations to be land applied. Increasing the volume of biosolids that are land applied is the only practical option to reduce the likelihood of the material being landfilled or incinerated. Land application is the only disposal method that sustainably recycles the material.\n        A typical application rate for agriculture ranges from 9.1 to 18.2 Mg/ha and the one-time application rate for site remediation allowed in Pennsylvania is 136.4 Mg/ha. Higher application rates which would require a smaller land area for a given mass of biosolids have not been widely investigated in Pennsylvania. This research project evaluated land applying biosolids in a deep-row hybrid poplar trench system at an application rate of 386.5 Mg/ha on a 1.62 ha (4 ac) site in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania. Because this rate results in application of nitrogen (N) far in excess of that required annually by any vegetation on the site, potential leaching of nitrates into groundwater is the major concern. The fate of the N in the biosolids and how much of it goes through the nitrification process to form nitrate will likely determine if the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection will permit biosolids trenching.  \n\tThis research project was conducted to monitor the fate and transport of the biosolids N and track the establishment and initial growth of the poplars.  Preliminary sampling and tests were conducted to determine if the biosolids met state regulations to be land applied and the extent of N loss through volatilization during the stabilization process. Groundwater was monitored to determine if nitrate-nitrogen levels remained under 10 mg/L (the state drinking water standard) and lysimeters were installed in the research area to sample soil water around the trenches. Gas was sampled at the soil surface to determine if N was being lost as nitrous oxide. About 6 mo after being entrenched, biosolids redox conditions were measured and samples were analyzed to assess compositional changes in the material. Chlorophyll readings and a tree assessment were used to determine if poplars were assisting in N removal.  \n\tAll water samples collected from the lysimeters and groundwater monitoring wells had nitrate levels below detection. Redox measurement indicated that the biosolids were extremely anaerobic and therefore conditions were not suitable for nitrification to occur. Previous trenching research found that nitrate in pan lysimeter water beneath trenches was essentially zero for 3-yr (Felton et al., 2008).\n\tThe tree assessment indicated that the research poplars were, on average, larger than the control poplars. Chlorophyll readings were used to estimate N content. Out of the 139 poplars sampled in both the research and control area only 5 and 6 poplars, respectively, were considered N deficient (foliar N content below 3.5%). From the poplar data, it was concluded that the root system of the poplars had not yet reached the biosolids. However, biosolids samples pulled 6-7 mo after entrenchment indicate that N content in the entrenched biosolids has been reduced. Data collected from pre/post-liming emissions supports the conclusion that the majority of the N lost was in the form of ammonia after the stabilization process. \t\n\tAfter about 1 year from the initial entrenchment, it appears that land applying biosolids at an application rate of 386.5 Mg/ha has had no negative impacts on groundwater. However, as the soil structure evolves around the biosolids and the poplar roots begin to transport oxygen down to the biosolids, nitrates may begin to form. This research needs to be continued for several more years to conclusively determine the extent to which biosolids entrenchment with poplar production will impact underlying groundwater nitrate levels. For future trenching operations it is recommended that a better soil surface management plan be implemented. Soil pH and nutrient levels in the root zone should be altered. Both pH elevation and fertility improvement can be accomplished by amending the surface soil with an appropriate mixture of lime and lime-stabilized biosolids. This would stimulate early growth of the poplars and allow volunteer vegetation growth between poplar rows to reduce soil erosion which contributed to poplar mortality in the research area. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11421], "author_name_tesi": "Gogno, Jacob Brophy", "last_name_ssi": "Gogno", "middle_name_ssi": "Brophy", "first_name_ssi": "Jacob", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Land Application", "Biosolids", "Hybrid Poplars"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Smooth conjugacy in hyperbolic dynamics\n\n", "id": "9503", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "575", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis is devoted to the study of smooth conjugacy in hyperbolic dynamics.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [572], "author_name_tesi": "Gogolyev, Andriy ", "last_name_ssi": "Gogolyev", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Andriy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anatole Katok", "Anatole Katok", "Omri Sarig", "Vadim Kaloshin", "Alexay Kozhevnikov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anatole Katok, Dissertation Advisor", "Anatole Katok, Committee Chair", "Omri Sarig, Committee Member", "Vadim Kaloshin, Committee Member", "Alexay Kozhevnikov, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Anosov diffeomorphism", "structural stability", "smooth conjugacy", "periodic data"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Detecting Potential Cultural and Translation Biases in Kuder\u00ae Assessments", "id": "20522", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9659", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As cross-cultural comparisons are becoming more prevalent, there is an increasing need for linguistic and cultural equivalence of original and translated tests.

The initial study describes a novel role of p53 in controlling the rate-limiting enzyme in the pyrimidine catabolic pathway, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) and its effect on pharmacokinetics of and response to 5-FU. P53 binds to a p53 DNA-binding site (p53BS) downstream of the DPYD gene and reduces its expression at both the mRNA and protein level. The reduced expression of DPYD follows the inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS) and is dependent on DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) signaling. Overall this study highlights the regulation of DPYD and its implications on toxicity and efficacy of 5-FU.\n\n(Chk2) is a serine/threonine kinase that transduces DNA damage response (DDR) signals from the kinases ATM and to some extent also Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-Related Protein (ATR). It plays a critical role in inducing cell death following radiation in a p53-dependent manner. However, the role of Chk2 in toxicity of chemotherapeutics is less well studied with regard to involvement of the ChK2-ATM-p53 pathway. Our experiments addressed the role of Chk2 in Dose Limiting toxicity (DLT) of Topisomearase II (TOP2) inhibitors. We found Chk2 mediates toxicity from TOP2 inhibitors but not with other classes of chemotherapeutics, both in-vitro and in-vivo. Functional screens identified NSC105171 as a novel Chk2 inhibitor. NSC105171 protected from DLT following Etoposide treatment. This study has implications for a potentially effective strategy to preventing DLT.  \n\nThus, we have identified a role for p53 in controlling nucleotide metabolism through repression of DPYD following DNA damage through the involvement of TS inhibition. The study highlights different responses to chemotherapeutic agents that signal through p53 activation. In the second study, we described targeting the ATM-Chk2 p53 pathway in the context of Topoisomerase 2 inhibition to preferentially limit toxicity. Depending on the nature and type of damage there appears to be a differential response mediated by p53. Taken together, this research explores ways in which p53 signaling and biology can be used to enhance efficacy and limit toxicity following specific chemotherapy treatments.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15840], "author_name_tesi": "Gokare, Prashanth Ravishankar", "last_name_ssi": "Gokare", "middle_name_ssi": "Ravishankar", "first_name_ssi": "Prashanth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wafik El-Deiry", "Charles H Lang", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby", "Jin-Ming Yang", "Nelson Shu-Sang Yee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wafik El-Deiry, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles H Lang, Committee Chair", "Rosalyn Bryson Irby, Committee Member", "Jin-Ming Yang, Committee Member", "Nelson Shu-Sang Yee, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DPYD", "p53", "5-FU", "chemotherapeutic", "toxicity", "DNA damage", "Chk2", "etoposide", "metabolism"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "COMPARATIVE NUMERICAL ANALYSIS OF FLOW DEVELOPMENT\nIN THE PRESENCE OF ENDWALL FENCES\nUPSTREAM OF A VERTICAL CYLINDER IN CROSS FLOW", "id": "10896", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6960", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nSecondary flow properties and related total pressure losses have negative effects on the\nperformance of turbines. Horseshoe vortices which complicate turbine flow are particularly\nadverse determinants of turbine function. The development of horseshoe vortices within turbines\ncould possibly be decreased by modifying the environment through which the flow passes.\nHowever, there are a large number of modifications that could be designed for this purpose. Thus,\nstudying each one experimentally under real time conditions would be very difficult. Studying\ncomputerized simulations of relevant modifications in modeled turbine systems, on the other\nhand, could provide a fast, numerical and inexpensive method of evaluating the effects of such\nmodifications on flow characteristics and thereby contribute to improved turbine design by\nhighlighting the options most likely to be beneficial, as well as preventing loss of man power and\neconomical resources for the study of unfavorable configurations. This view comprises the\nstarting point of the current study which focuses on comparative analysis of flow characteristics\nin a domain containing a vertical cylinder subjected to a relatively uniform duct flow and endwall\nfences placed upstream of the cylinder. The vertical cylinder in cross flow was chosen as the best\nvirtual representative of the leading edge diameter of a turbine nozzle guide vane (NGV) blade.\nThe main postulations of this research were that analyzing the flow around a turbine NGV blade\ncould be simplified by modeling it as a vertical cylinder with a diameter equal to the leading edge\ndiameter of the NGV blade and that adding upstream endwall fences could, completely or partly,\nattenuate the effects of the horseshoe vortex that naturally forms around the cylinder in cross flow\nand thus reduce total pressure loss within the horseshoe vortex region. The goal in mention was\ntested by inserting three fences of various shapes at a location considered critical to the formation\nof the horseshoe vortex. To our knowledge, the current study is the first comparative numerical\nstudy of flow characteristics around a system consisting of a vertical cylinder subjected to cross flow and endwall fences placed upstream of the cylinder. A commercial computational fluid\ndynamics (CFD) software package, Fluent, was used to conduct the numerical analysis. The flow\nwithin the computational domain was assumed to be fully turbulent, which would be the best\nrepresentation of the flow within a turbine, just downstream of a combustor. Numerical results\nderived for different fence configurations were compared with each other and the baseline\nconfiguration which models the flow around the cylinder only. For further validation of the\nmodeling strategy, conventional cylinder in cross flow data available in the literature were reobtained\nunder virtual conditions using the parameters provided by the authors of the\nexperiments.\nThe current study showed that, placing an endwall fence 1 mm high, 1 mm deep and\neither 4 mm or 2 mm long upstream of the cylinder, results in a 7% decrease in the lateral\ndistance between the two legs of the horseshoe vortex when compared to the baseline case,\ndownstream of the cylinder. A 1 mm high, 1 mm deep and 4 mm long fence having oblique\nlateral sides placed upstream of the cylinder creates a 14% decrease in the lateral distance\nbetween the two legs of the horseshoe vortex, downstream of the cylinder. These findings\nindicate that an endwall fence can result in decreased interaction between the horseshoe vortices\ncreated by consecutive blades in a row of NGV blades, which would result in improved flow\nconditions within turbine passages. The oblique fence provided an additional benefit: Secondary\nvortices were completely removed, both in front of and behind the fence. All fence types\neffectively changed the location of the main horseshoe vortex roll-up. Furthermore, it was\nobserved that the height of the fence was more influential than the length of the fence, in\nmodifying flow characteristics. When compared to the baseline case, the existence of the fences\nslightly increased the mass averaged total pressure loss far downstream of the cylinder; however,\nbeneficial near-fence flow characteristics were observed for all cases containing a fence.\nInvestigating the effect of adding upstream endwall fences on the flow attributes of\nphysical models of turbine systems is warranted. Therefore, detailed wind tunnel tests and other\nexperiments must be conducted to further understand the effects of using endwall fences to\nreduce the detrimental effects of the horseshoe vortex.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6957], "author_name_tesi": "Gokce, Zeki Ozgur", "last_name_ssi": "Gokce", "middle_name_ssi": "Ozgur", "first_name_ssi": "Zeki", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci", "Cengiz Camci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Thesis Advisor", "Cengiz Camci, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["horseshoe vortex formation around a vertical cylin", "upstream endwall fences"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "ENDWALL SHAPE MODIFICATION USING VORTEX GENERATORS AND FENCES TO IMPROVE GAS TURBINE COOLING AND EFFECTIVENESS", "id": "16097", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8009", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The gas turbine is one of the most important parts of the air-breathing jet engine. Hence, improving its efficiency and rendering it operable under high temperatures are constant goals for the aerospace industry. Two types of flow within the gas turbine are of critical relevance: The flow around the first row of stator blades (also known as the nozzle guide vane blade - NGV) and the cooling flow inside the turbine blade cooling channel. The behavior of the former flow type affects the total pressure level downstream of the NGV, thereby affecting the efficiency of the gas turbine. The behavior of the latter flow type affects the cooling performance of turbine blades, having a direct effect on the maximum total temperature the turbine material can withstand, as well as affecting the level of thrust produced via the total temperature. The flow in the vicinity of the turbine blades and the endwall boundary layer has a great effect on the behavior of the overall flow through the gas turbine. The flow near the pin-fins contained inside turbine blade cooling channels dictates the cooling performance of the blade. These two facts have prompted the aerospace industry to investigate the potential benefits of modifying the shape of the endwall. The results of various studies showed improvements in both flow types. Following this thought process, this thesis study focused on finding innovative ways of attaining even higher performance. We previously demonstrated that adding upstream endwall fences leads to beneficial changes in the flow near the NGV blade. Inspired by our prior findings, we decided to analyze the effects of endwall shape modifications on turbine cooling channel flow, in addition to the flow near the NGV. In short, the subject of this thesis work was to search for methods that could improve the characteristics of these two types of flows, thus enabling superior engine performance. The innovative aspect of our work was to apply an endwall shape modification previously employed by non-aerospace industries for cooling applications, to the gas turbine cooling flow which is vital to aerospace propulsion.\n\nSince the costs of investigating the possible benefits of any idea via extensive experiments could be quite high, we decided to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) followed by experimentation as our methodology. We decided to analyze the potential benefits of using vortex generators (VGs) as well as the rectangular endwall fence. Since the pin-fins used in cooling flow are circular cylinders, and since the boundary layer flow is mainly characterized by the leading edge diameter of the NGV blade, we modeled both the pin-fins and the NGV blade as vertical circular cylinders. The baseline case consisted of the cylinder(s) being subjected to cross flow and a certain amount of freestream turbulence. The modifications we made on the endwall consisted of rectangular fences. In the case of the cooling flow, we used triangular shaped, common flow up oriented, delta winglet type vortex generators as well as rectangular endwall fences. The channel contained singular cylinders as well as staggered rows of multiple cylinders. For the NGV flow, a rectangular endwall fence and a singular cylinder were utilized.\n\nUsing extensive CFD modeling and analysis, we confirmed that placing a rectangular endwall fence upstream of the cylinder created additional turbulent mixing in the domain. This led to increased mixing of the cooler flow in the freestream and the hotter flow near the endwall. As a result, we showed that adding a rectangular fence created a 10% mean heat transfer increase downstream of the cylinder.\n\nWhen vortex generators are used, as the flow passes over the sharp edges of the vortex generators, it separates and continues downstream in a rolling, helical pattern. Combined with the effect generated by the orientation of the vortex generators, this flow structure mixes the higher momentum fluid in the freestream with lower momentum fluid in the boundary layer. Similar turbulent mixing behavior is observed over the entire domain, near the cylinders and the side walls. As a result, the heat transfer levels over the wall surfaces are increased and improved cooling is achieved. The improvements in heat transfer are obtained at the expense of acceptable pressure losses across the cooling channel. When the vortex generators are used, the CFD\nmodeling studies showed that overall heat transfer improvements as high as 27% compared to the baseline case are observed inside a domain containing multiple rows of cylinders. A price in the form of 13% pressure loss increase across the channel is paid for the heat transfer benefits. Experiments conducted in the open loop wind tunnel of the Turbomachinery Aero-Heat Transfer Laboratory of the Department of Aerospace Engineering of Penn State University supported the general positive trend of these findings, with a 14% overall increase in heat transfer over the constant heat flux surface when vortex generators are installed, accompanied by an 8% increase in pressure loss.\n\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first to demonstrate the positive effects of vortex generators used in conjunction with circular pin-fins on the heat transfer properties of gas turbine blade cooling channel flow. The findings of our study may also have practical implications for other scientific and industrial fields using flows of similar Reynolds numbers.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7957], "author_name_tesi": "Gokce, Zeki Ozgur", "last_name_ssi": "Gokce", "middle_name_ssi": "Ozgur", "first_name_ssi": "Zeki", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci", "Cengiz Camci", "Sven Schmitz", "Savas Yavuzkurt", "Timothy Francis Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Dissertation Advisor", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Chair", "Sven Schmitz, Committee Member", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Committee Member", "Timothy Francis Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vortex generator", "heat transfer enhancement", "gas turbine cooling channel flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The role of small organic molecules in atmospheric chemistry and particle formation", "id": "11305", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1764", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Flow tube experiments were performed on two small organic molecules in order to determine the roles these chemicals play in the atmosphere, specifically solvation and particle growth.

While methanol undergoes a switching reaction with water clusters, formic acid clearly causes growth of the water clusters.  It is concluded that formic acid enhances the growth of water clusters.  This hypothesis is examined further by theoretical calculations on small, neutral formic acid-water clusters as well as calculations on protonated clusters in the size range of 21 molecules.  It was determined that formic acid strongly interacts with the hydrogen bonding network of the water clusters, altering the stability and ability to grow.

Research summarized in this dissertation focuses on contact activation of FXII in buffer and blood plasma frequently referred to as autoactivation. The extant theory of contact activation imparts FXII autoactivation ability to negatively charged, hydrophilic surfaces. According to this theory, contact activation of plasma involves assembly of proteins comprising an \u201cactivation complex\u201d on activating surfaces mediated by specific chemical interactions between complex proteins and the surface. This work has made key discoveries that significantly improve our core understanding of contact activation and unravel the existing paradigm of plasma coagulation. It is shown herein that contact activation of blood factor XII (FXII, Hageman factor) in neat-buffer solution exhibits a parabolic profile when scaled as a function of silanized-glass-particle activator surface energy (measured as advancing water adhesion tension  in dyne/cm, where  is water interfacial tension in dyne/cm and  is the advancing contact angle). Nearly equal activation is observed at the extremes of activator water-wetting properties    dyne/cm ( ), falling sharply through a broad minimum within the   dyne/cm ( ). Furthermore, contact activation of FXII in buffer solution produces an ensemble of protein fragments exhibiting either procoagulant properties in plasma (proteolysis of blood factor XI or prekallikrein), amidolytic properties (cleavage of s-2302 chromogen), or the ability to suppress autoactivation through currently unknown biochemistry. The relative proportions of these fragments depend on activator surface chemistry/energy. We have also discovered that contact activation is moderated by adsorption of plasma proteins unrelated to coagulation through an \u201cadsorption-dilution\u201d effect that blocks FXII contact with hydrophobic activator surfaces. The adsorption-dilution effect explains the apparent specificity for hydrophilic activators pursued by earlier investigators. Finally a comparison of FXII autoactivation in buffer, serum, protein cocktail, and plasma solutions is shown herein. Activation of blood plasma coagulation in vitro by contact with material surfaces is demonstrably dependent on plasma-volume-to-activator-surface-area ratio. However, activation of factor XII dissolved in buffer, protein cocktail, heat-denatured serum, and FXI deficient plasma does not exhibit activator surface-area dependence. Instead, a highly-variable burst of procoagulant-enzyme yield is measured that exhibits no measurable kinetics, sensitivity to mixing, or solution-temperature dependence. Thus, FXII activation in both buffer and protein-containing solutions does not exhibit characteristics of a biochemical reaction but rather appears to be a \u201cmechanochemical\u201d reaction induced by FXII molecule interactions with hydrophilic activator particles that do not formally adsorb blood proteins from solution. Results strongly suggest that activator surface-area dependence observed in contact activation of plasma coagulation does not solely arise at the FXII activation step of the intrinsic pathway.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7727], "author_name_tesi": "Golas, Avantika ", "last_name_ssi": "Golas", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Avantika", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Erwin A Vogler", "James Hansell Adair", "Coray M Colina", "Christopher Alan Siedlecki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Erwin A Vogler, Dissertation Advisor", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Coray M Colina, Committee Member", "Christopher Alan Siedlecki, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hematology", "Blood coagulation", "Human Factor XII"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "GENDER DIFFERENCES IN NEW YORK CASE PROCESSING:         \nAN EXPLORATION INTO CASE DISMISSALS AND CHARGE REDUCTIONS\n\n", "id": "11857", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3467", "abstract_tesi": "Research on gender disparities in the stages between arrest and conviction is sparse. The present study contributes to this neglected area of research by examining gender disparities in case dismissals and charge reductions.  While previous gender and sentencing research has found women receive more lenient treatment in sentencing decisions, research concerning gender disparities at the charge reduction phase has produced mixed results. Furthermore, samples in prior literature are often outdated with small female samples. The current study overcomes these limitations by using a more recent and relatively large sample of female offenders. Additionally, the focal concerns theory, which has been used to explain decision-making processes at the sentencing stage, is further extended in this paper to apply to decisions made at the prosecutorial level. \n     All arrests in the state of New York in the year 2000 are included in the dataset. The dataset is unique in its ability to track individual arrestees over an extended period of time. Information is given on both defendants\u2019 initial arrest charges and final charges. The charges are rank-ordered by grade levels according to New York\u2019s penal law system, allowing for a comprehensive comparison as to whether charges were reduced, remained the same, raised, or dismissed between these two stages. \n     The New York data provide a diverse, as well as large sample of female and male offenders (N=93,593, and N=395,647 respectively). We hypothesize that the leniency found in prior sentencing literature for female defendants will again be observed in case dismissal and charge reduction outcomes. To test our hypotheses, we run separate logistic regressions for case dismissal and charge reduction controlling for the defendant\u2019s gender, race, age, and grade level of their initial arrest. We then run separate logistic regressions for each grade level to further examine whether the gender effect may vary across arrest grade levels. Finally, we conduct supplemental analyses to explore how a defendant\u2019s prior criminality may impact case dismissal and charge reduction outcomes, as well as how the gender effect may vary across specific statutes. \n     The results of the analyses partially support the overall hypothesis. Women are consistently more likely than men to have their charges dismissed. The gender effect is significant for four of the eight grade levels for case dismissal. However, gender is not found to be a significant predictor of charge reduction. A closer examination of charge reduction by grade level reveals, however, that gender is in fact a significant predictor for four of the seven arrest grade levels.  The gender effect is favorable for women for three of the grade levels and favorable for men for one of the grade levels. When the defendant\u2019s prior criminal history is included as a control in the models, any leniency previously extended to female defendants in case dismissal and charge reduction is attenuated. Thus, controlling for prior criminality results in a smaller favorable effect for women in case dismissal and a slight advantage to males in charge reduction. The findings from the study thus provide support that a gender effect exists in case dismissal and charge reduction for some grade level offenses (notably, more serious offenses). However, female defendants are also more likely to be penalized for their criminal records in case dismissal and charge reduction than male defendants are.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3454], "author_name_tesi": "Gold, Kimberly Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Gold", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Kimberly", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Crime, Law and Justice", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier", "Darrell J Steffensmeier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell J Steffensmeier, Thesis Advisor", "Darrell J Steffensmeier, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["charge reduction", "case dismissal", "gender"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "On water resources, downscaling and the chance of future precipitation in the Florida Everglades", "id": "26563", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10916", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Florida water resources are vulnerable to salt water intrusion when sea level rises or freshwater wells are depleted by either overdrawing or insufficient recharge.

In the first I study the implementation of risk (or merger) arbitrage by hedge funds and other institutional arbitrageurs and document the increasing role of hedge funds in the takeover process.  I find evidence of superior performance by hedge fund arbitrageurs compared to non-hedge fund institutional arbitrageurs.  Specifically, within merger arbitrage, hedge funds significantly outperform other institutional arbitrageurs by 4% annually on a risk-adjusted basis.  The superior performance does not reflect hedge fund managers' ability to predict or affect the outcome of merger and acquisition deals; rather, my findings suggest that it is attributed to hedge fund managers' ability to avoid deals with the largest downside when deals are withdrawn.  Hedge fund and non-hedge fund investments in target shares are both associated with a higher probability of deal completion and shorter deal duration.  I also study the relationship between hedge funds and investment banks within the context of mergers and acquisitions, and find that when hedge funds' prime brokers also serve as advisors in merger deals, hedge funds are significantly more likely to invest in risk arbitrage. This is consistent with an information updating model of risk arbitrage investment.

I find that hedge funds only outperform when their prime brokers work as advisors in deals.

These improvements have been implemented in the aeroacoustic prediction code PSU-WOPWOP.\nThis thesis focused on two general problems. The first problem deals with memory management for cases with large amounts of data. As the size and power of computers have grown, so too have the scale and resolution of do- mains applied to aeroacoustic prediction codes over the past several decades. Various methods have been used to overcome these memory demands, yet these methods simply bypass the underlying issue of inefficient data management. This thesis describes the developement and validation of a computational algo- rithm that provides a solution to this problem by working with data from only a few source time steps at a time.\nThe second problem deals with the development and implemention of a package within PSU-WOPWOP that allows for rapid testing and analysis of rotors for FAA certification of civil helicopters. The metric used by the FAA for certification is the effective perceived noise level (EPNL) which is computed from a vehicle\u2019s acoustic time history for a given flight condition. A significant contribution to the noise profile of such cases is the broadband noise compo- nent. Distinct from discrete-frequency noise sources, the physical mechanisms responsible for broadband noise are stochastic in nature and current prediction approaches are primarily semi-empirical. The use of multiple empirical mod- els of varying fidelity can provide reasonable solutions across a wide range of cases while also forming an explicit heirarchy with which to compare with first- principle predictions as they are developed. The new noise certification pack- age developed in PSU-WOPWOP consists of EPNL prediction, which includes\nbroadband noise prediction, as well as an easy-to-use flight path system devel- oped to shorten the setup time for cases. Details of the package\u2019s design and implementation are discussed in this thesis. In particular, the implementation of two semi-empirical broadband noise prediction models in PSU-WOPWOP is described in detail.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7753], "author_name_tesi": "Goldman, Benjamin A", "last_name_ssi": "Goldman", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Steven Brentner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Steven Brentner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Benjamin", "Goldman", "FW-H", "PSU-WOPWOP"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Development of a Rollover-Warning Device for Road Vehicles", "id": "5901", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5374", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-08-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation describes the research and development of a rollover-warning device (RWD) to be used for road vehicles, particularly heavy vehicles with high center-of-gravity height to track-width ratios.

First, in Chapter 1, I present the motivation for my research and explain why the research questions that I pose are both important and timely.\n\nIn Chapter 2, I experimentally investigate how sourcing decisions are affected by experiencing a supply disruption and the lack thereof. I predict, and find evidence for, an oscillating pattern of sourcing, where the supply base is temporarily increased following the experience of a severe supply disruption, which is then followed by a gradual reduction of the supply base when there is no subsequent disruption. This oscillating sourcing pattern results in a tendency for decision makers to under-diversify their supply base. I propose an explanation of this behavior pattern to be the lack of reinforcement of the realized cost of a supply disruption and the lack of saliency of the expected cost of supply disruptions.\n\nIn Chapter 3, I expand upon this research and consider two options for diversification: supplier diversification (as presented in Chapter 2) and regional diversification. Specifically, I fix the cost of supplier diversification and vary the cost of regional diversification, resulting in three conditions, where theory predicts it is optimal to source from one region, source from either one or two regions (indifference), and source from two regions. The results indicate that decision makers tend to adopt and retain a sourcing strategy, utilizing suppliers that are perceived to be less risky. I also identify additional support for the tendency of decision makers to under-diversify their supply base in both the number of suppliers and regions. \n\nLastly, in Chapter 4, I summarize the results of the dissertation and discuss the implications for practitioners. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9912], "author_name_tesi": "Goldschmidt, Kyle Hein", "last_name_ssi": "Goldschmidt", "middle_name_ssi": "Hein", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher William Craighead", "Christopher William Craighead", "Douglas J Thomas", "Mirko Kremer", "Saurabh Bansal", "Paul Griffin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher William Craighead, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher William Craighead, Committee Chair", "Douglas J Thomas, Committee Member", "Mirko Kremer, Committee Member", "Saurabh Bansal, Committee Member", "Paul Griffin, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["supply chain", "procurement", "behavioral operations"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Unsteady Force Measurement Using Small Piezoelectric End Sensors", "id": "22842", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10196", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Most marine propellers operate in a nonuniform flow field.

New, simpler sensors have been designed to replace current instrumentation. These sensors take advantage of the oscillating nature of the unsteady lift, as at increasing inflow harmonics the rapidity of the unsteady lift fluctuations suggests that the lift nearly cancels out over the blade radius, and that the total unsteady force across a propeller blade can be found from parameters at the root and tip.

In this study I seek to define engagement and integration from the perspective of both the online student and the institution. Using a qualitative phenomenological approach I interview participants from two prominent brick-and-mortar institutions with online campuses: The Pennsylvania State University and Arizona State University. Twenty fully-online bachelor\u2019s students who self-identify as engaged and eight administrators whose primary responsibilities relate to these constructs are interviewed. \nData from student interviews surface three engagement themes: engagement as a personal choice, engagement as academic, and engagement as relational. Participants felt no institutional requirement regarding engagement, but sought opportunities closely related to academics and relationship-building. Three integration themes emerged: integration and institutional pride, engagement and integration as interrelated, and integration as different for online students. Participants were most eager to partake in activities related to university culture, felt immediate connections upon acceptance of admissions offers, and pointed to engagement activities as instrumental in reinforcing their sense of belonging. Participants perceived the online student experience as different than the residential student experience, but felt that was inherent in their decision to study online. \n\nAdministrator interviews reveal differences in organizational goals and the understanding and promotion of engagement interventions. Administrators each held slightly differing views of these constructs, and both institutions recently executed changes in organizational structure that provide for greater centralization of these efforts. Further, data indicate that only one characteristic influenced students\u2019 attitudes toward these constructs: students\u2019 own expectations of how engaged/integrated they should be, which were formed independent of their institutions.\nFindings indicate differences in expectations between online students and the institution in addition to observable variation in the environments (and opportunities for engagement within those environments) that students were exposed to in each of their online classes. This dissertation concludes with the presentation of an adapted input-expectations-environment-environments-outcomes (I-E-E-E-O) model developed to assist in further investigation of these constructs for online learners. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16004], "author_name_tesi": "Goldstein, Allison S", "last_name_ssi": "Goldstein", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Allison", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Geiger", "Roger Geiger", "Karly Sarita Ford", "Craig D Weidemann", "John David Mccarthy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Geiger, Dissertation Advisor", "Roger Geiger, Committee Chair", "Karly Sarita Ford, Committee Member", "Craig D Weidemann, Committee Member", "John David Mccarthy, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Keywords: engagement", "integration", "involvement", "online education", "online campuses", "I-E-O model", "I-E-E-E-O model", "engagement", "integration", "involvement", "online education", "online campuses", "I-E-O model", "I-E-E-E-O model"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "TAXONOMIC REVIEW OF THE GENUS TROPHEOPS (CICHLIDAE) WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW SPECIES FROM LAKE MALA&#372;I, AFRICA", "id": "9096", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2229", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Seven new species of the cichlid genus Tropheops from Lake Mala&#373;i, Africa, are described.

The ablation process within liquid produces nanoparticles of an assortment of size and composition. The transition metals studied represent some of the transition metals studied previously within the Castleman research group, as the purpose of this research was to use prior studies and discoveries as a framework to achieve a materials-oriented synthesis by means of similar experimental methods.  In creating nanoparticles via this solution-phase approach, discoveries were made regarding the behavior of metals in the ablation process.  It was found that this technique could produce a variety of nanoparticles by variation of solvent and laser parameters.  Much of the work is devoted towards creating new nanomaterials by controlling factors such as laser fluence and pulse duration, as well as choosing solvents with specific properties.  By focusing on characterization of these nanoparticles at each condition, a better understanding of how the variables affect nanoparticle formation was attained.  Through an improved understanding of the ablation process, control over the properties of the resultant nanoparticles can be obtained, and thusly nanoparticles can be tailored with specific properties.  Creation of nanoparticles via laser ablation in solution is a relatively young technique for nanoparticle synthesis, and the work presented should prove useful in guiding further exploration in ablation processes in liquids for nanomaterial production.  \n  When a laser is focused onto a target under a liquid environment, the target material and its surrounding liquid are vaporized.  The concoction of vapor is ejected normal to the surface as a bubble.  The bubble has a temperature reaching the boiling point of the metal, and has a gradient to the boiling point of the solvent.  The bubble expands until it reaches a critical volume, and then subsequently collapses.  It is within this bubble that nanoparticle formation occurs.  As the bubble expands, the vapor cools and nanoparticle growth transpires.  During the bubble collapse, pressures reaching GigaPascals have been reported, and a secondary nanoparticle formation occurs as a result of these high pressures.  Chapter 1 delves a little more into the nanoparticle formation mechanisms, as well as an introduction to the analytical techniques used for characterization.  \nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques were used as a primary method of analysis.  A combination of TEM images, selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns, and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDS/EDAX) provided a great deal of information about the as-formed nanoparticles.  The images provided size and shape information, as well as electron density information, which correlates to metal content.  The diffraction patterns supplied information about the crystallinity of the nanoparticles, helpful in determining their composition, as well as providing clues about the formation process.  The EDS analysis provided elemental content to compliment the SAED patterns and TEM images.  Additional analysis was provided by Raman spectroscopy, utilizing a micro-Raman tool, which aided characterization by yielding bonding information.  The UV-Vis spectrum showed the absorption behavior by the nanoparticles in their nascent solution.  Electrospray ionization (ESI) was a useful tool for analyzing the colloidal solutions in search of stable nanoparticles too small to be analyzed by electron microscopy methods.  \nAblation of titanium took place in isopropanol, ethanol, water, and n-hexane, under various fluences, with a 532 nm Nd:YAG operating at 10 Hz.  It was found that a myriad of nanoparticles could be made with vastly different compositions that were both solvent and fluence dependent.  Nanoparticles were made that incorporated carbon and oxygen from the solvent, showing how solvent choice is an important factor in nanoparticle creation.  Chapter 3 discusses the results of the titanium work in great detail and demonstrates carbide production with ablation in isopropyl alcohol.  Ablation in n-hexane also showed diffraction patterns correlating with carbides, and water showed oxygen incorporation.  These results showed the ability to utilize the solvent in tailoring nanoparticles to achieve desired properties.  \nZirconium and nickel were ablated with the Nd:YAG at 532 nm.  These studies utilized a stainless steel chamber designed and built to improve control over the experimental variables.  The nickel study showcased the new chamber\u2019s ability for reproducibility in a size dependence study based upon laser fluence.  The results of ablation with the Nd:YAG were compared to femtosecond ablation experiments performed with a titanium:sapphire femtosecond laser system.  The Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser operated at 10 Hz, produced femtosecond pulses centered at ~795 nm.  The pulse duration was varied from 100 fs to 390 fs, the nanoparticles created from each condition were characterized, and the results are presented in chapters 5 and 6.  \nAluminum nanoparticles were made using both nanosecond and femtosecond laser ablation techniques.  Aluminum nanoparticles have a great deal of potential for use as fuel additives as well as in paints and coatings.  The nanosecond ablation process rendered large nanoparticles (over 200 nm) and the results are briefly shown in Appendix A.  The femtosecond system produced a much smaller distribution of nanoparticles, with nanoparticles remaining in suspension for over a month\u2019s time, as evidenced by their unique UV-Vis absorbance.  These nanoparticles were produced in isopropyl alcohol, and were stabilized by the solvent, as TEM analysis showed nanoparticles with very little oxygen incorporation.  The solvent is bound to the nanoparticles as a result of the formation process and as a result forms a protective coating, which prevents further oxidation over time.  The remarkable stability of these aluminum nanoparticles is a testament of employing the high energy scheme of the laser ablation process in a manner to tailor the production of novel nanomaterials.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2995], "author_name_tesi": "Golightly, Justin Samuel", "last_name_ssi": "Golightly", "middle_name_ssi": "Samuel", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Nicholas Winograd", "Henry Foley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Member", "Henry Foley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Laser Ablation", "Nanoparticles", "irradiation", "metal nanoparticles", "synthesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Application of Reactive Molecular Dynamics in Biomaterial Science and Computational Biology", "id": "21213", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9974", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, the potential applications of reactive molecular dynamics in computational biology have been evaluated.

Similarly, recruiters can use expert search to track potential\nemployees for their companies. Although significant progress has been made on this problem,\nexisting models for expert search are not tailored for academic domains. In academic domains,\nexpert search and similar expert finding involve ranking researchers in response to topic and\nname queries based on academic documents. Academic or research documents are different from\nwebpages in terms of their type (e.g., homepages, publications, grant proposals), structure (e.g.,\nabstract, sections), associated metadata (e.g., venue, authors) and connections (e.g., citations).\nEnabling expert search in an open-access digital library such as CiteSeer [2] is challenging since\nacademic documents are not directly available for estimating expertise. Instead, CiteSeer ac-\nquires freely-available publications and other relevant academic documents by crawling the Web.\nPrevious studies indicate that researchers list their publication information online using their\nhomepages since this substantially increases the impact of their work [3]. It becomes imperative,\ntherefore, to periodically track researcher homepage URLs in CiteSeer for obtaining up-to-date\ncollections of academic documents. In addition to their use as a resource for academic documents,\nprofessional homepages of researchers also typically include descriptions of research interests and\nother metadata that is crucial in tasks such as author disambiguation and profile extraction [4].\nDespite several studies on homepage finding in the context of the general web, academic home-\npage finding is not fully addressed in existing research. The first question we address in this\ndissertation is: how can we acquire an accurate homepage collection? We study this question in two settings. First, we study academic homepage finding on the Web. Given the results of\nweb search for a researcher name query, our goal is to identify the correct homepage in the set\nof pages retrieved from the Web. We design features based on insights from content analysis of\nknown academic homepages to learn a ranking function for academic homepage retrieval. In the\nsecond setting, we address homepage finding on university department websites where academic\nhomepages need to be discriminated from other kinds of academic webpages. Despite training\nthe classifier on \u201coutdated\u201d webpage instances, we show that unlabeled data and multiple views\nof webpages can be used to adapt our classifier to current-day academic websites.\nIn the second part of this dissertation, we address expert search for academic domains. We study ranking models for researchers in response to topic and name queries. We use the content\nof research documents and the structural connections among documents to build query-dependent\ngraphs for scoring researchers. We propose a simple extension to PageRank for combining evi-\ndence from multiple types of documents.

Surface site densities, distributions, and structural identities are closely tied to the formation and processing of the glass surface, and exert a direct influence on strength and coating performance. The surface of a glass sample may vary markedly from the composition and chemistry of the bulk glass. We are taking a physicochemical approach to understanding adsorption sites on pristine multicomponent glass fibers surfaces, directly addressing the effect of processing on surface reactivity. This project aimed to understand the energy distributions of surface adsorption sites, the chemical/structural identity of those sites, and the relationship of these glasses to glass composition, thermal history, and in future work, surface coatings.\nWe have studied the bulk and surface structure as well as the surface reactivity of the glass fibers with solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, inverse gas chromatography (IGC), and computational chemistry methods. These methods, solid-state NMR and IGC, typically require high surface area materials; however, by using probe molecules for NMR experiments or packing a column at high density for IGC measurements, lower surface area materials, such as glass fibers, can be investigated. The glasses used within this study were chosen as representative specimens of fibers with potentially different reactive sites on their surfaces. The two glass compositions were centered around a nominal E-glass, which contains very little alkali cations and mainly alkaline earth cations, and wool glass, which contains an abundance of alkali cations. The concentration of boron was varied from 0 to 8 mole % in both fiber compositions. Fibers were drawn from each composition at a variety of temperatures and draw speeds to provide a range of glass samples with varying diameters and thermal histories.  \nThe bulk structural features in both compositions of glass fibers were identified using high-resolution 29Si, 27Al, and 11B magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopic measurements. In multi-component glasses, the determination of silicon, aluminum, and boron distributions becomes difficult due to the competitive nature of the network-modifying oxides among the network-forming oxides.  In pure silicates, 29Si MAS NMR can often resolve resonances arising from silicate tetrahedron having varying numbers of bridging oxygens. In aluminoborosilicate glasses, aluminum is present in four-, five-, and six- coordination with oxygen as neighbors. The speciation of the aluminum can be determined using 27Al MAS NMR. The fraction of tetrahedral boron species in the glass fibers were measured using 11B MAS NMR, which is typically used to study the short-range structure of borate containing glasses such as alkali borate, borosilicate, and aluminoborosilicate glasses. \nWhile solid-state NMR is a powerful tool for elucidating bonding environments and coordination changes in the glass structure, it cannot quantitatively probe low to moderate surface area samples due to insufficient spins. Chemical probes either physisorbed or chemisorbed to the fiber\u2019s surface can increase the surface selectivity of NMR for analysis of samples with low surface areas and provide information about the local molecular structure of the reactive surface site.  Common chemical probe molecules contain NMR active nuclei such as 19F or may be enriched with 13C. A silyating agent, (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)dimethylchlorosilane (TFS), reacts with reactive surface hydroxyls, which can be quantified by utilizing the NMR active nucleus (19F) contained in the probe molecule. The observed 19F MAS NMR peak area is integrated and compared against a standard of known fluorine spins (concentration), allowing the number of reactive hydroxyl sites to be quantified. \nIGC is a method used to study the surface properties of a material by examining the retention behavior of a probe molecule. The IGC method provides information on the surface chemistry of a wide range of samples based on high sensitivity, linearity, and stability of flame ionization detectors (FIDs) employed in IGC, but especially to probe and characterize the distribution of both weak and very strong adsorption sites on oxide surfaces. The drawback to IGC is the inability to identify the surface species reacting with the probe molecule. By adsorbing gas phase 13C labeled ethanol onto glass fiber surfaces and analyzing with 13C cross-polarization (CP) MAS NMR, the structural identity of the adsorption sites can be determined based upon chemical shifts of the carbon nuclei. The 13C chemical shifts are indicative of chemisorption and physisorption, and in the case of chemisorption, the next nearest neighbor atoms can be identified. The glass fiber surfaces exhibited three distant peaks in TPD-IGC plots and an extra peak in the 13C CP MAS NMR spectra and when adsorbing an alcohol to the surface. \nA simpler model system assisted with the identification of two of the three/four peaks from the multicomponent glass fibers. The model system chosen was fumed silica, which contains only silicon sites. Alcohol was adsorbed to the surface of fumed silica and IGC and 13C CP MAS NMR experiments were performed. In each of the experiments on fumed silica, two peaks were present. One peak corresponded to a weakly adsorbed alcohol, since the desorption temperature was low and had a narrow linewidth in the NMR spectrum. The second peak corresponded to a chemisorbed alcohol, which was identified by the higher desorption temperature and the broad peak in the NMR spectrum. The desorption temperatures and the chemical shift values from the reactive sites on fumed silica relate to two of the peaks in the multicomponent experiments and are identified as a physisorbed alcohol and a chemisorbed alcohol bound to a silicon site. The third and fourth peaks (middle temperature range in TPD-IGC) present in the 13C CP MAS NMR spectra were identified through ab initio chemical shift calculations using model oxide clusters that underwent condensation reactions with ethanol. The third and fourth reactive sites were identified as a chemisorbed alcohol to a three-coordinated and four-coordinated boron sites, respectively. \nThis study investigated the bulk structural distributions, as well as investigating reactive sites via desorption plots using IGC methods, interactions with NMR sensitive probe molecules, ab initio chemical shift calculations, and density functional theory reaction pathways. Multicomponent fibers containing 8 mole % boron indicated the presence of four distant reactive sites: physisorbed alcohol, chemisorbed alcohol to tetrahedral silicon species, chemisorbed alcohol to three-coordinated boron species, and chemisorbed alcohol to a four-coordinated boron species. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5070], "author_name_tesi": "Golombeck, Rebecca ", "last_name_ssi": "Golombeck", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller", "Alan James Benesi", "Ayusman Sen", "William D Burgos", "Carlo G Pantano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Chair", "Alan James Benesi, Committee Member", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Member", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["glass fibers", "inverse gas chromatography", "NMR", "calculations"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Essays in Game Theory", "id": "df65v784d", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13107", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present dissertation consists of two independent essays related to Game Theory. The first essay investigates the strategic information transmission between two biased experts and the decision maker. Experts possess complete information about the state of the nature and the decision maker is only partially informed.

The first essay compares two standard communication protocols: simultaneous\u2014when experts provide their reports to the decision maker at the same time and based solely on their private information, and sequential\u2014when the second expert observes the report of the first expert, as well as the reaction of the decision maker to the first report before making a decision. I show that under certain conditions the decision maker benefits from consulting experts sequentially.\nThe second essay, which is based on a joint work with Volodymyr Baranovksyi, explores the implications of the seller, of a single indivisible good through a winner-pay auction, being able to verify the true winner\u2019s value after the sale and to punish him for underbidding. A first-price auction is an optimal auction format among all winner-pay auctions, the optimal reserve price is lower and each bidder submits higher bid than in standard auctions. We also found that revenue equivalence principle does not hold in this environment and that even small punishment leads to a significant increase in the revenue. The later makes us to believe that the seller should be extremely tempted to develop the way of punishing for underbidding, even if there was no one in the first place. For our leading example of a government privatizing a firm through an auction, this may include making a small non-favorable by a winner changes in regulations or being more strict on current regulations.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12458], "author_name_tesi": "Golovko, Sergii ", "last_name_ssi": "Golovko", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sergii", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijay Krishna", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Edward James Green", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijay Krishna, Dissertation Advisor", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Edward James Green, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mechanism Design", "Optimal Auctions", "Ex-Post Verification", "Limited Punishments", "Strategic Communication", "Persuasion", "Revenue Equivalence"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Modeling of the Al-rich Region of the Al-Co-Ni-Y System Via Computational and Experimental Methods for the Development of High Temperature Al-Based Alloys", "id": "6784", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6518", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-07-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present thesis focuses on the understanding and development of high temperature Al alloys based on the Al-Co-Ni-Y system through experimental and computational investigations.  The phase relations of the phases present in the Al-Co-Ni-Y system have been studied with special emphasis on the Al-rich region, to produce an accurate thermodynamic model. \n\nInitially, the structure \u2013 property relationship of three spray-formed alloys, one of which was fabricated in this work, was determined experimentally with respect to changes in composition and processing parameters.  Phase identification and microstructural analysis was performed via LOM, SEM, TEM and XRD.  Mechanical property measurements for fracture toughness, tensile strength, yield strength and elongation were also obtained.  Each alloy consists of three types of intermetallic particles: Al3Y, Al9Co2, and an Al-rich Al-Ni-Y particle, embedded in an Al matrix.  \n\nInitially, two alloys were created with the same nominal composition.  Elevated temperature (300\u00b0C) yield strength values of 165 \u2013 190 MPa and ambient temperature elongation values of 2 \u2013 3 percent were determined.  Increased secondary processing temperatures caused significant coarsening of the intermetallic particles in the matrix, altering the mechanical properties.  A third alloy was created having one-half of the alloying element content of the previous alloys.  This reduction in alloying element content, coupled with careful control of the extrusion temperature resulted in a significant increase in ambient temperature elongation (13 percent) and moderate decrease in elevated temperature yield strength (145 MPa).\n\nTo systematically study the phase relations in the quaternary Al-Co-Ni-Y system, a computational thermodynamics approach is employed.  The thermodynamic model was created using the CALPHAD technique with the aid of first-principles calculations and available experimental information.  In the CALPHAD modeling, the Gibbs energies of the individual phases (pure elements, binary phases, ternary phases, etc.) of a given system are optimized to produce a self-consistent thermodynamic database.  First-principles calculations, based on Density Functional Theory, have been performed to obtain relevant thermodynamic information to input into the thermodynamic model.\n\nThe first-principles calculations are determined not only for structures relevant to the optimization of the Al-Y-Ni-Co quaternary system, but have been rigorously analyzed to determine the validity of current state-of-the-art calculations, when compared to known experimental values.  0 K total energy calculations for ten Al-rich Al-Ni-Y ternary compound show excellent agreement with the experimental results, differing by approximately 1 kJ/mol-atom.  Finite temperature enthalpy and entropy of formation values were also determined for the ternary compounds.  Their validity is based upon the agreement with the available experimental information of the pure elements.  The results are implemented into the CALPHAD model for the quaternary system.  \n\nIn the present work, the quaternary thermodynamic database is created and model predictions of the three spray formed alloys are performed and compared with the relevant experimental results.  The quaternary model is built upon the foundation of the existing binary models, including the complete re-modeling of the Co-Y binary system, performed in this work.  The Al-Ni-Y ternary phase information was obtained through a combination of experimental calculations and experimental phase diagram approximations obtained from the literature and first-principles calculations performed in this work.  \n\nWith only minimal changes of the Al-rich Al-Ni-Y ternary compound model parameters based upon experimental work from the literature, a first approximation of the quaternary database is produced and capable of providing accurate predictions for the type and amount of phases present within the Al-rich region of this system.  Solidification simulations were performed to determine the stable phases present in three alloy compositions and compared favorably with the corresponding experimentally determined results.\n\nThis work provides a foundation for the coupling of the thermodynamic database with experimental knowledge to produce an Al-rich alloy with an enhanced combination of the elevated temperature yield strength and ambient temperature toughness for structural applications.  Experimental analysis of the three alloys from this work defines a range of compositions and processing parameters from which an optimum combination of mechanical properties can be explored and further refined.  Beyond the specific scope of this work, this procedure for alloy optimization via combined experimental and computational methods can be applied for many other alloy systems, since the fundamentals of this approach transcend the quaternary Al-Co-Ni-Y system.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6517], "author_name_tesi": "Golumbfskie, William Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Golumbfskie", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu", "Maurice Francis Amateau", "Paul Raymond Howell", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Timothy John Eden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Maurice Francis Amateau, Committee Chair", "Paul Raymond Howell, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Timothy John Eden, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Alloy Development", "Thermodynamic Modeling", "First-Principles Calculations", "Al-based Alloy"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Object Recognition Using Structured Feature Extraction With A Reconfigurable, Neurosynaptic Processor", "id": "13945pkg5076", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13945", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Neuromorphic hardware has culminated increased interest, with a focus on designing efficient platforms that can support neural network tasks.

Theyhave been isolated from microbial mats, from below the chemocline of stratified lakes, from sediments and even from the surroundings of deep-sea hydrothermal vents.  Theanaerobic environments in which GSB usually thrive are normally very light-limited. GSB have developed a large light-harvesting antenna, the chlorosome, in order to survivein such environments. Chlorosomes are unlike any other known light-harvesting antenna, because they do not require a protein scaffold for assembly. Structures formed from theself-aggregation of BChls c, d or e form the bulk of the chlorosome. The antenna BChls share unique characteristics that allow the formation of the chlorosome aggregates.These BChls have a hydroxyl moiety at the C-3(1) position that chelates the Mg of a neighboring molecule, which allows the formation of the higher order aggregates of thechlorosome. These chlorophylls also lack the C-13(2) methyl-carboxyl moiety found in other (B)Chls, which would otherwise interfere with aggregate formation. GSB alsomethylate these antenna BChls at the C-20, C-8(2) and C-12(1) positions. In addition to the antenna BChls, GSB produce Chl a and BChl a. Although the pathways for thebiosynthesis of Chl a and BChl a have been elucidated in plants and algae and purple bacteria, respectively, very little was known about the biosynthesis of the chlorosomeantenna BChls. By using the wealth of data available from the sequencing and annotation of the genome of the GSB Chlorobium tepidum, genes possibly involved in (B)Chlbiosynthesis were identified and targeted for inactivation. Mutants of C. tepidum, affected in (B)Chl biosynthesis were constructed and characterized. The characterization of themutants enabled the identification of previously unknown enzymes responsible for the C8 vinyl reduction (BciA), and C-8(2) (BchQ) and C-12(1) (BchR) methylations. Severalorange mutants of C. tepidum, impaired in their ability to synthesize wild-type levels of BChl c, were also characterized. These mutants were impaired at different points in theBChl c biosynthetic pathway.  A mutant of bchS, a paralog of the gene encoding the large Mg-chelatase subunit BchH, produced only 10% the BChl c of the wild type and excretedlarge amounts of protoporphyrin-IX into the growth medium. A strain carrying amutation in bchJ, a gene that had been incorrectly assumed to encode the C-8 vinyl reductase, produced 9% the wild-type levels of BChl c and excreted large amounts ofdivinyl-protochlorophyllide into the media. Finally, a bchU bchQ bchR triple mutant of C. tepidum, which is unable to methylate the BChl c molecule, produced less than 30% ofthe BChl c of the wild type. Based on these results, a pathway for the biosynthesis of (B)Chls in C. tepidum was proposed.

To generate the flood forecast maps, a one-dimensional hydraulic model (HEC-RAS) is coupled to a regional hydrological ensemble prediction system (RHEPS). The RHEPS is in this case comprised by: i) weather ensembles from the National Center for Environmental Prediction Global Ensemble Forecast System Reforecast version 2 program; ii) distributed hydrological model (HL-RDHM); iii) quantile regression (QR) as the statistical postprocessor and iv) verification strategy. The coupled hydrometeorological-hydraulic system is tested in the riverine-estuarine transition zone of the Delaware River near the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The approach is used to generate 2-hourly high-resolution flood inundation forecast maps at lead times from 0 to 7 days, over the period 2008-2013. \nTo comprehensively and rigorously verify the forecast maps, the following four different sets of flood maps are generated: i) observed, ii) deterministic, iii) raw ensemble, and iv) postprocessed ensemble. The observed map is generated by forcing the hydraulic model with streamflow and water level observations at the boundary conditions and tributaries of the model. The deterministic and raw ensemble maps use hydrometeorological deterministic and ensemble medium-range forecasts as the forcing, respectively. Given that tide and storm surge forecast were not available for the study period, we force the hydraulic model with observed water levels at the downstream boundary for the deterministic and raw ensemble forecast maps. Lastly, the postprocessed maps are generated by using QR to postprocess the raw ensemble forecasts at individual cross-sections of the hydraulic model. \nResults show that the tidal fluctuations of the estuary are highly influential on the forecast skill in the transition zone. Nevertheless, upstream of the head of the tide hydrometeorologic uncertainties are dominant and can cause relatively high errors and biases in the flood inundation forecasts, especially for the later lead times. Moreover, the raw ensembles flood inundation forecasts show higher skill than the deterministic flood inundation forecasts, with higher improvement at lead times from 3 to 7 days. Furthermore, statistical postprocessing improves the skill of the raw ensemble flood inundation forecasts, with an evident improvement across all lead times but is higher at the later lead times. In conclusion, we find that the medium-range flood forecast maps can be skillful and thus provide an alternative for representing and communicating medium-range forecasts. We find that statistical postprocessing can improve the skill of the forecast maps.

Creating such models is a challenging task in complex diseases such as cancer, in which numerous components are known to play an important role. To model the dynamics of the networks underlying complex diseases I use network-based models with discrete dynamics, which have been shown to reproduce the qualitative dynamics of a multitude of cellular systems while requiring only the combinatorial nature of the interactions and qualitative information on the desired/undesired states.\n\nI developed analytical and computational tools based on a type of function-dependent subnetwork that stabilizes in a steady state regardless of the state of the rest of the network, and which I termed stable motif. Based on the concept of stable motif, I proposed a method to identify a model's dynamical attractors, which have been found to be identifiable with the cell fates and cell behaviors of modeled organisms. I also proposed a stable-motif-based control method that identifies targets whose manipulation ensures the convergence of the model towards an attractor of interest. The identified control targets can be single or multiple nodes, are proven to always drive any initial condition to the desired attractor, and need to be applied only transiently to be effective.\n\nI illustrated the potential of these methods by collaborating with wet-lab cancer biologists to construct and analyze a model for a process involved in the spread of cancer cells (epithelial-mesenchymal transition), and also applied them to several published models for complex diseases, such as a type of white blood cell cancer (T-LGL leukemia). These methods allowed me to find attractors of larger models than what was previously possible, identify the subnetworks responsible for the disease and the healthy cell states, and show that stabilizing the activity of a few select components can drive the cell towards a desired fate or away from an undesired fate, the validity of which is supported by experimental work.

Despite the effort, China is still at the primary stage of a zero carbon community design. China\u2019s limited environmental progress is partially attributable to the urban planning method that it has adopted.  Following the pattern that the US used in the last century, China uses the mono functional urban method.  The core characteristic of mono functional urban plan method is to segregate land use through zoning: each geographic area can only be used for one purpose such as residential or commercial use. \n\nAdopting a zero carbon community model is essential to any successful environmental plan for China. From 2000 to 2010, the Chinese government invested 18 billion yuan (2.3billion U.S. dollars) to build the Shanghai World Expo Park.

Utilizing a balanced transportation system to reduce transportation pollution.\n2. Increase efficiency by adopting a mixed use community design (in contrast to the mono functional urban model). \n3.

This result held up regardless of whether the bucket was light or heavy (even as heavy as 7 lbs). In Experiment 4, I reversed the bucket locations to the second half of the walking path, so the buckets stood 2 feet, 4 feet, 6 feet, or 8 feet away from the ending position, not the starting position. With this arrangement, I found that the number of participants who chose the near bucket did not exceed the number of participants who chose the far bucket, in contrast to what I found in Experiments 1, 2 and 3, where there was a strong near-bucket preference. In Experiment 5, I found that participants picked up the near bucket to minimize pre-lift distance rather than to maximize post-lift distance.

Then we consider particles with glassy bound polymer layers are bridged together (either rubbery bridge or glassy bridge) by polymer chains and form small clusters. Clusters finally percolate to form a particle-polymer network as loading fraction increases. Rheology is used to study the network formation, and to predict the boundary of rubbery bridge and glassy bridge regimes. The distance between particles determines the type of polymer bridging. The particle spacing larger than Kuhn length makes flexible (rubbery) bridge with rheology described by a flexible Rouse model for percolation.

To reduce the electrode overpotential and increase cell performance, the exploration of new catalytic materials as substitutes for the traditionally preferred platinum-only catalyst has been extensively carried out in recent decades. Appling transition metal modified Pt bimetal electrocatalyst instead of Pt is one of the main approaches for this purpose. \nThe objectives of this research are to identify potential Pt-modified electrocatalysts for the cathode in hydrogen and methanol PEM fuel cells and provide better understanding of the promoting effect of the synthesized electrocatalysts as a function of material atomic ratio, particle distribution and alloying composition.\n The physical properties and ORR activity of carbon supported PtFe and PtCr electrocatalysts were studied extensively. All the electrocatalysts were prepared by colloidal method and subsequent catalytic properties and performance were studied. Catalyst surface area was determined by BET nitrogen adsorption and electrochemical methods.  Particle size and their distribution were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

These novel materials may provide differential advantages over the established large-area thin film technology based on silicon, which has been extensively employed in applications such as large-area flat panel displays, high-speed active matrix thin film circuits, flexible and wearable electronics, etc. The dissertation begins with the discussion of high-performance plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) of ZnO thin films and ZnO thin film transistors (TFTs) with a field effect mobility of ~ 10 to 20 cm2/Vs, which have been demonstrated. Offset-drain ZnO TFTs, which are able to withstand or switch voltage beyond 80 V, have also been demonstrated. These results shed light on the realization of large-area active-matrix circuits beyond the capabilities of the current display industry where high circuit speed or high operation voltage is required. \n\nTo further improve the performance of ZnO-based electronics, many related materials, including doped ZnO, zinc nitride, and aluminum nitride, have been investigated. Doped ZnO has been proposed as the carrier injection layer that can improve the conductivity of metal-semiconductor contact in ZnO TFTs. Aluminum-doped ZnO thin films have been deposited using triisobutyl aluminum (TIBA) as the dopant precursor instead of trimethyl aluminum (TMA) in order to improve the uniformity of dopant distribution because TIBA has much lower vapor pressure than TMA. AZO thin films with resistivity ~ 10-2 \u03a9\u00b7cm have been achieved by PEALD. Besides, aluminum nitride and zinc nitride thin films have also been studied using PEALD. In addition to the showerhead PEALD system, a novel inductively coupled plasma ALD system has been designed and set up that provides RF power up to 500 W in order to generate a highly reactive nitrogen plasma source and enable the deposition of high-quality metal nitride at relatively low temperature. These metal nitride thin films may provide additional building blocks to enhance the speed and thermal stability of ZnO-based thin film devices and circuits.\n\nOwing to their excellent electrical and mechanical properties, 2D-TMD thin films have been studied for flexible electronics applications. High quality MoS2 and WS2 thin films have been achieved via mechanical exfoliation and chemical vapor deposition. To fabricate MoS2- and WS2-based TFTs, a 5-step device fabrication process has been developed, which is compatible to both the conventional rigid substrate and the ~ 4.8 nm thick solution-cast polyimide (PI) flexible substrate. The MoS2 and WS2 TFTs fabricated on PI substrate exhibit a field effect mobility of between 1 to 20 cm2/Vs, which is similar to that of those fabricated on rigid silicon substrate. More importantly, extraordinary mechanical strength and stability have been demonstrated for MoS2 and WS2 TFTs fabricated on PI substrate. A reasonably small degradation in device performance has been observed in these flexible 2D-TMD TFTs under static bending to the radius of ~ 2mm and after cyclic bending up to 100,000 cycles. \n\nFinally, attempts to create integratable 2D-TMD circuits have been demonstrated. To realize large-area 2D-TMD based circuits, growth of wafer-scale continuous WSe2 thin films has been demonstrated using metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Deposition has been achieved at as low as 400 \u00b0C, which allows deposition on glass and polymeric substrate and enables the transfer-free fabrication of WSe2 TFTs and circuits on arbitrary platforms. Patterning and post-growth thickness modulation of continuous WSe2 thin film have been demonstrated using CF4 plasma and O2 plasma, whereby high-speed etching and nanometer-scale film thinning can be realized. With the capability of depositing and patterning wafer-scale WSe2 thin films, an array of p-channel WSe2 TFTs have been fabricated with a field effect mobility of ~0.01 cm2/Vs and an on-off ratio greater than 104. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14889], "author_name_tesi": "Gong, Yiyang ", "last_name_ssi": "Gong", "first_name_ssi": "Yiyang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado", "Ying Liu", "Roman Engel-Herbert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Chair", "Mauricio Terrones Maldonado, Committee Member", "Ying Liu, Committee Member", "Roman Engel-Herbert, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thin Film Transistor; ZnO; Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition; High Voltage Transistor; 2D Transistion Metal Dichalcogenides; WS2; WSe2; Flexible Electronics"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "From metabolites to continents:host-parasite interaction across spatio-temporal scales", "id": "29608", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12699", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The selective force for parasites to manipulate host behavior operates in a complex arena.

Calcite to vaterite ratios varied within the reactors between 0.1 and 187 and were dependent mainly on saturation state, though the location of growth within the reactor was also important. Both calcite and vaterite precipitated concurrently and phase transitions were limited to small amounts of vaterite spheres becoming calcite. The presence of additives such as Na2HPO4, L-arginine, and, to a lesser extent, NH4Cl inhibited the precipitation of vaterite, while NaCl slightly promoted to precipitation of calcite. The results suggest that the interpretation of Ca isotope data from precipitation experiments may be marked affected by sampling protocol, the effects of additives, and the method by which saturation is achieved to initiate precipitation.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9666], "author_name_tesi": "Gonzales, Matthew Scott", "last_name_ssi": "Gonzales", "middle_name_ssi": "Scott", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Scott Fantle", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Peter J Heaney", "James David Kubicki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Scott Fantle, Thesis Advisor", "Michael Allan Arthur, Thesis Advisor", "Peter J Heaney, Thesis Advisor", "James David Kubicki, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Calcite", "vaterite", "calcium isotopes", "paleoproxy development"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "INTRAMOLECULAR [3 + 2] CYCLOCONDENSATIONS OF ALKENES WITH INDOLIDENE AND INDOLIDENIUM CATION INTERMEDIATES: APPLICATION TOWARDS THE SYNTHESIS OF LECANINDOLE D", "id": "13762izg105", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13762", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An allenyl azide cyclization reaction was developed to access the skeleton of the indolosesquiterpene family of natural products, while addressing the challenges of synthesizing indole-fused trans hydrindanes.

I posit that the fall of the Berlin Will and the rise to dominance of neoliberal globalization caused a shift in the structure of feeling that has characterized the educated U.S. classes.  While the Cold War produced a certain apocalyptic anxiety, the hegemony of global capital engenders uneasiness precisely because the problems it produces seem endless and intractable without anything to oppose it. Consumerism, corporatism, atomizing individualisms, gentrification, legacies of violence and inequality abetted by neoliberalism: the contemporary U.S. intellectual has no answer to these issues.  \n\tIn bringing together a group of authors usually considered separately, I demonstrate how these anxieties are reflected in this literature\u2019s consistent use of the tragic view.  I borrow this term from Lucien Goldmann, who used it to describe the outlook that produced Pascal\u2019s wager.  Each author that the dissertation analyzes makes wagers that hope to return meaning, hope, or possibility to a life that seems utterly overdetermined.  I call these \u201cfictions\u201d because these writers, aware that postructuralism has undermined the humanism these texts espouse, emphasize the use-value rather than the truth-value of their claims.

In discerning the consistent ideological underpinnings across a disparate group of writers, Necessary Fictions takes an important step toward defining the literature that appears to be succeeding postmodernism.   \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2578], "author_name_tesi": "Gonzalez, Jeffrey C", "last_name_ssi": "Gonzalez", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathryn Hume", "Kathryn Hume", "Benjamin Jared Schreier", "Claire Mary Colebrook", "Eric Robert Hayot"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathryn Hume, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathryn Hume, Committee Chair", "Benjamin Jared Schreier, Committee Member", "Claire Mary Colebrook, Committee Member", "Eric Robert Hayot, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["globalization", "postmodern novel", "literary criticism", "Contemporary literature", "critical theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "I Have More Immediate Concerns Than Body Weight: The Relationship Between Mexican - American Stressors And Weight Perceptions ", "id": "16146", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8099", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent work has shown that, among Mexican-American men, recently-arrived immigrants have the lowest tendencies to self-classify as overweight (net of BMI).

According to democratic theorists, civic engagement is tantamount to a functioning democracy. According to higher education researchers, there are short- and long-term benefits associated with college student civic engagement. Short-term benefits range from higher gpa\u2019s to critical thinking. Long-term benefits include graduate school attendance, promoting racial understanding, and interest in the social good among others. However, literature on minority student civic engagement is sparse. The political science literature states that differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic Whites when it comes to voting, party affiliation, charity donations, etc., is considerable. Moreover, most of the college student civic engagement literature is survey based and does not take into account the effects of civic engagement programming on campuses or the process of how students become civically engaged in the first place.\n   Thus, in this study, I interviewed and observed 14 Cuban American and 15 non-Hispanic White students at FIU, a predominantly Hispanic, urban university in Miami, Florida. This study took place in the Fall of 2002 and was finished in May of 2003 for a total of two semesters or 8 months. I also compared and contrasted FIU\u2019s civic engagement practices to three different national studies on successful college civic engagement practices. When compared to these national studies, FIU\u2019s civic engagement practices were disparate and concentrated in a handful of colleges and offices. Even though FIU\u2019s civic engagement programming did not measure up to successful civic engagement practices at other colleges and universities in the U.S., both Cuban American and Non-Hispanic White students relied on student established networks when it came to civic engagement. Additionally, there were no differences between both of these distinct ethnic groups when it came to the types of civic engagement in which they participated at FIU. A possible explanation for this is \u201creverse acculturation,\u201d or the process whereby Non-Hispanic Whites in Miami, Florida begin to adopt Cuban American cultural customs and behaviors.   \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5154], "author_name_tesi": "Gonzalez, Roger Geertz ", "last_name_ssi": "Gonzalez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Roger Geertz", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Post", "Lee Ann Banaszak", "M Christopher Brown", "Constance A Flanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Post, Committee Chair", "Lee Ann Banaszak, Committee Member", "M Christopher Brown, Committee Member", "Constance A Flanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["civic engagement", "colllege students", "Cuban Americans", "Non-Hispanic Whites", "transculturation", "reverse acculturation", "hybridity"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF BIOCONJUGATION OF CALCIUM PHOSPHOSILICATE NANOPARTICLES ON THE DELIVERY TO BREAST CANCER CELLS", "id": "12461vlg5065", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12461", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conventional chemotherapeutic treatments for breast cancer produce high systemic concentrations while local concentrations in the diseased tissue are relatively low. In contrast, targeted therapeutics provide the promise of low systemic dosage, and therefore, modest or no side effects, while producing high local concentrations at the tumor. Fluorescent, 20nm diameter, calcium phosphosilicate nanoparticles (CPSNPs) synthesized in our laboratory were used as in vitro model particulate systems to evaluate targeted uptake in human breast cancer. The uptake of the CPSNPs in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was analyzed to demonstrate the efficacy of the target approach using anti-CD71 as a target for the triple negative MDA-MB-231. To simulate the circulating conditions of human blood in vitro, the breast cancer cells were exposed to the CPSNPs for 30, 60, or 120 minutes under shear provided by a cone-plate viscometer placed in an incubator maintained at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 to mimic the conditions of blood circulation. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the uptake of the CPSNPs, doped with Rhodamine-WT, by the cells. \nIn addition, commercial, fluorescent, 1 micron diameter polymeric spheres were used as a control to demonstrate the efficacy of the target approach using anti-CD71 as a target for the triple negative MDA-MB-231. The results support the in vitro anti-CD71 targeted uptake of both the CPSNPs and the microspheres by the MDA-MB-231 cells.  The uptake of the anti-CD71 functionalized particles was significantly higher under both high and low shear conditions than either the methoxy-PEG or citrate functionalized particles. \nFurthermore, preliminary steps were taken to test the efficacy of docetaxel-encapsulating CPSNPs in mitigating tumor cell extravasation during metastasis.

This study uses the \u201cOpen Payments\u201d data that contain general payments and transfer of value made from pharmaceutical industries to physicians. Each observation in the dataset is a physician payment that specifies demographic information, the corresponding drug that is associated with a payment, and the nature of payments. To estimate the influence of disclosure policies, states were classified according to the level of regulation: strict, lenient or no disclosure policy. Physician specialty and the therapeutic class of drugs associated to the payment are covariates that the study controls for. The study exhibits that physician payments are negatively correlated to strict and lenient disclosure policies. The results of the study show strict disclosure policies public release of payment information decreased the probability of physicians' receiving payments by 8% points and disclosure policies without public report (lenient) decreased 16% points, compared with no disclosure policy.

Clitic pronouns in the Romance languages have long occupied the interests of generative linguists. In the field of morpho-syntax there exists a rich body of literature on the nature and distribution of object clitic pronouns in Romance, addressing a diversity of questions, among these, whether clitic pronouns behave as independent words or bound morphemes, and how and where they are to be represented in the grammatical structure of a sentence. The answers to such questions have had implications for the advancement of theories and models in other fields of study, such as language contact and language acquisition. To date, French and Italian have been the primary focus of attention in research addressing clitic pronouns; the facts of Spanish have gone largely unexamined. Redressing this oversight, the present project examines data on the placement of pronouns across dialects of Spanish. The findings will afford a more complete account of clitic pronouns in Romance than is available in the extant literature and contribute to theories of syntactic micro-variation.\nUnlike other Romance languages, Spanish allows clitic pronouns to appear attached to the non-finite verb, as in (1a) and (2a), or attached to the main conjugated verb, as in (1b) and (2b), a phenomenon known as \u201cclitic climbing\u201d: \n\t\t<p>(1) a.

At the center of the present study is the development of a proposal in which clitic pronouns may be generated in two structural positions in the clause, as dictated by the selectional properties of particular predicates.\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal resides principally in understanding the mechanisms that govern the placement of clitic pronouns in clitic climbing structures. It is novel in focusing specifically on the analysis of clitic pronouns in Spanish and in seeking to achieve an adequate and complete description of these elements both morphologically and syntactically. A broader contribution of the work is its focus on reaching a better understanding not only of Spanish clitic pronouns, but also of Spanish syntactic structure in general, as the study of clitic placement largely overlaps with other areas of syntactic research, such as verb movement. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6455], "author_name_tesi": "Gonzalez Lopez, Veronica ", "last_name_ssi": "Gonzalez Lopez", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Veronica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Almeida Jacqueline Toribio", "Barbara E Bullock", "John Lipski", "Marie Gillette Speicher", "Karlos Arregi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Almeida Jacqueline Toribio, Committee Chair", "Barbara E Bullock, Committee Member", "John Lipski, Committee Member", "Marie Gillette Speicher, Committee Member", "Karlos Arregi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["clitic pronouns", "clitics", "clitic climbing", "syntactic theory", "Spanish syntax"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Sediment of Soft Spheres Arranged by Effective Density\n\n", "id": "11122", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1238", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Colloidal suspensions often contain mixtures of particles that must be sorted by size or density. One route to sorting gram-size quantities of particles is sedimentation, which has been studied for decades from both dynamic and thermodynamic perspectives. However, an important question remains unanswered: What sediment structure results when bi-disperse or poly-disperse particles settle rapidly, but remain non-glassy in the final dense sediment? This document shows that bi-disperse colloids having soft-sphere interactions spontaneously arrange into two macroscopic layers after a sedimentation process at Peclet number greater than unity. The layering can be explained without appealing to complex hydrodynamic or thermodynamic arguments; rather, the layering is readily explained simply by minimizing the free energy of the system, which is primarily the gravitational energy. The contribution of entropy and interparticle forces to the total energy of the system is negligible. When minimizing the gravitational energy, it has been found that the way that particles pack is a key parameter. However, the particles may start to aggregate under high centrifugal force or great sediment height. This can be a limitation to the particle reordering. The results presented here may lead to designs for preventing de-mixing of colloidal products during shipment, for improving sorting or size-refinement operations for colloidal particles of different size or density, for sorting mixtures of biological components, or for purifying mixtures of colloidal assemblies.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1227], "author_name_tesi": "Gonzalez Serrano, Cesar ", "last_name_ssi": "Gonzalez Serrano", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Cesar", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Darrell Velegol", "Darrell Velegol"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Darrell Velegol, Thesis Advisor", "Darrell Velegol, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Colloids", "Packing", "Bidisperse", "Gravity"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Estimating the Safety Effects of Horizontal Curves on Pennsylvania Two-lane Rural Roads", "id": "24835", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11192", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Roadway departure crashes are three times more likely on horizontal curves than on tangent sections of two-lane rural highways. Research is needed to better quantify the safety performance (e.g., crash frequencies) of these crash-prone locations. Existing safety performance functions (SPFs) for two-way rural highways in the Highway Safety Manual (HSM) rely on base conditions that assume all roadway segments are tangent sections. The resulting predictions of crash frequency are then modified using a crash modification factor (CMF) that includes as independent variables the curve length, curve radius and presence of a spiral transition. Unfortunately, the CMF in the HSM does not have a standard error associated with it, which greatly limits its practical application and provides no indication of the level of uncertainty associated with the CMF. Other existing CMFs for horizontal curves in the FHWA CMF Clearinghouse also suffer from a lack of standard error and dated statistical methods, resulting in low to average star quality ratings (three or less). Furthermore, these existing CMFs treat individual curves as isolated geometric elements, even though recent research has shown that the safety performance of a horizontal curve is significantly influenced by its proximity to neighboring curves. Curves in close proximity to each other are expected to have lower crash frequency than those that are isolated because they are less likely to violate driver expectation. Failure to account for this distance may lead to erroneous predictions of crash frequency on horizontal curves.\n\nThe objective of this study is to develop a high-quality CMF for horizontal curves on two-lane rural roads that takes into consideration the proximity of neighboring geometric elements using the most statistically rigorous modeling technique available, which reduces the potential for bias in the estimate of the CMF and provides a standard error that can be used to estimate the CMF uncertainty. This CMF is estimated using eight years of crash data (2005-2012) obtained from over 10,000 miles of state-owned two-lane rural roads in Pennsylvania. This comprehensive data includes information on roadway geometry (e.g., horizontal curvature, lane width, and shoulder width), traffic volume, access density, roadside hazard rating, and the presence of various low-cost safety countermeasures (e.g., centerline and shoulder rumble strips, curve and intersection warning pavement markings, and aggressive driving pavement dots). The propensity scores-potential outcomes method is applied, which matches each horizontal curve with tangent sections that are similar with respect to all other site characteristics (excluding crash frequency). The propensity scores are estimated using binary logistic regression, and curves and tangents are matched based on the propensity scores using the nearest neighbor matching technique with calipers and without replacement.  Matching is performed across county lines to avoid individual horizontal curves being matched with its neighboring upstream or downstream tangent sections, which are likely to have very similar features and endogenous effects. Crash prediction is performed by means of random effects and mixed negative binomial regression using the explanatory variables mentioned above as well as distance to adjacent horizontal curves.  The results indicate that degree of curvature, curve length, and traffic volume must be considered when predicting the frequency of total and fatal and injury crashes on horizontal curves.  The presence of a horizontal curve and degree of curvature increase crash frequency, while the length of curve and traffic volumes decrease expected crash frequency.  These results were consistent for both random and mixed effects models.  The impact of the distance to adjacent curves was not found to be statistically significant.  When predicting fixed object crashes, a proxy for roadway departure crashes, only degree of curvature and the presence of a horizontal curve were found to be statistically significant.  All crash modification estimates for degree of curvature were consistent with the existing literature.  The crash modification functions estimated are supplemented with formulas to estimate a conservative value for the standard error of the resulting CMF.  The resulting crash modification functions in this thesis are recommended to evaluate safety at rural two-lane horizontal curves in Pennsylvania.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10738], "author_name_tesi": "Gooch, Jeffrey Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Gooch", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Todd Donnell", "Vikash Varun Gayah", "Martin T Pietrucha"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Todd Donnell, Thesis Advisor", "Vikash Varun Gayah, Thesis Advisor", "Martin T Pietrucha, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Highway safety", "traffic safety", "horizontal curves", "propensity scores", "potential outcomes", "negative binomial", "mixed effects"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "TOWARDS A FLUID-STRUCTURE INTERACTION MODEL OF THE PENN STATE PNEUMATIC PULSATILE PEDIATRIC VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE ", "id": "13935bcg5069", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13935", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Congenital heart disease affects over 36,000 newborns annually in the United States and over 1.35 million worldwide, with heart transplantation the only option for many. Additionally, pediatric patients waiting for a heart transplant face the highest wait-list mortality rate in all of transplantation medicine with 23% dying within 6 months of being added. As part of developing a reliable pulsatile pediatric ventricular assist device (PVAD), it is necessary to accurately predict the hemodynamics within the device due to higher hemolysis and thrombosis rates in PVADs compared to adult VADs. Due to the moving components and the strong fluid-structure interactions that occur within these devices, very little work has been done on the modeling of these type of blood pumps and the work that has been done has used many simplifications including modeling the blood and VAD membrane with Newtonian and linear-elastic constitutive models, respectively, and the lack of experimental validation.\nTo address the limitations in the previous work and to improve the design of future pulsatile blood pumps including the Penn State pneumatic PVAD, a tightly-coupled FSI framework is developed to accurately model all of the fluid and solid interactions within the device. This includes a viscoelastic fluid solver specific to pediatric blood and a hyper-viscoelastic solid solver specific to the Penn State PVAD membrane. The PVAD membrane material was first characterized using uniaxial tensile testing to determine an accurate constitutive model. The experimental data was then used to validate a finite-volume solid mechanics solver simulating the cyclic loading of the dog-bone geometry. The solver was further validated against both steady and dynamic experiments of an actual PVAD membrane\u2019s motion under pressure loading conditions in a mock PVAD acrylic chamber.\nIndividual FSI solvers were then developed using a RANS turbulence solver for air, the viscoelastic solver for blood, and the visco-hyperelastic solver for the PVAD membrane. The FSI solvers were validated using the same mock circulatory flow loop but with an additional blood analog fluid. The FSI solvers showed the ability to accurately model the interactions between air and the PVAD membrane while limitations in the temporal modeling of the interactions between blood and the membrane with similar densities still remained. Overall, the FSI framework showed great potential in simulating the complex interactions of air, a PVAD membrane and a blood analog and with additional work on coupling at the membrane-to-blood interface could be used in the future to investigate the hemodynamics within the PVAD.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14419], "author_name_tesi": "Good, Bryan C", "last_name_ssi": "Good", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Bryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Keefe Manning", "Keefe Manning", "Peter Butler", "William Weiss", "Robert Campbell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Keefe Manning, Dissertation Advisor", "Keefe Manning, Committee Chair", "Peter Butler, Committee Member", "William Weiss, Committee Member", "Robert Campbell, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pediatric", "fluid-structure interaction", "ventricular assist device", "computational"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Saccharin Civic Engagement, Rhetoric, and Popular War Movies ", "id": "14210tkf118", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14210", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since the September 11, 2001 attacks United States citizens have not been asked to directly sacrifice or be involved in the wars against terror. Citizens have been presidentially excused from their civic engagement in matters of war since the Bush Administration. This study examines how popular war films substitute actual engagement and give audience feelings of being engaged through rhetorical analysis. I demonstrate their ability to craft vicarious experiences and intense identification with those who fight in war. This has a political end. Popular war films that induce this type of experience for the audience direct attention toward the soldiers and veterans of war, focusing audience attention away from war itself. These films cooperate in post-9/11 discursive formations to terministically screen war through the experience of those who fight. The context of these films are influenced by neoliberal and biopolitical justificatory rhetoric that mandate war as necessary for national security. Furthermore, war is justified as how our nation honors victims of September 11, 2001. By examining four popular war films as case studies from the years 2009-2014, during supposed draw down of troops in the longest war in national history, the study develops a theory of saccharin citizenship. A passive citizen, heeding presidential rhetorical calls to leave war up to the military and continue their daily lives, feels as though they are civically engaging in matters of war through economic modalities. Characters in the films model \u201cgood citizen\u201d behavior and non-obtrusive responses to war and post-war issues. The films participate in post-9/11 discursive formations that justify and depoliticize the sacrifice of soldiers, veterans, and military families. Post-traumatic stress, a signature injury of the wars on terror, and soldier reintegration difficulties are terministically screened as part and parcel of sacrifice for the nation in a dangerous world filled with never-ending threats and enemy combatants. The war is continually blamed upon an external enemy and the saccharin citizen, the audience of popular war films, is convinced soldier sacrifice is continually necessary. National security equals perpetual war. The films also, through their immersive quality, induce feelings of being engaged and expressing adequate civic attention to war and post-war issues.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14672], "author_name_tesi": "Good, Tiara Kay", "last_name_ssi": "Good", "middle_name_ssi": "Kay", "first_name_ssi": "Tiara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeremy Engels", "Jeremy Engels", "Michele Jean Kennerly", "Bradford James Vivian", "Matthew Frank Jordan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeremy Engels, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeremy Engels, Committee Chair", "Michele Jean Kennerly, Committee Member", "Bradford James Vivian, Committee Member", "Matthew Frank Jordan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["saccharin citizenship", "war", "war movies", "war films", "PTSD", "soldier representation", "rhetoric"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Bordetellae and their interactions with the host: Improving the fight against infection.\n", "id": "22732", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10243", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The classical bordetellae are comprised of respiratory pathogens that infect a wide range of hosts.  This dissertation focuses on surveying Bordetella species and investigating host-pathogen interactions.  Chapter 2 identifies 22 different PFGE types of B. pertussis, including newly identified PFGE types, which were isolated during outbreaks in California and Washington from 2010-2012.  Although the isolates are genetically distinct, they have similarities in susceptibility to antibiotics and in vivo growth in the murine respiratory tract. Three (ptxA, fim2, and fim3) of 5 genes encoding vaccine antigens were conserved while two others contained mutations (prn and fhaB) in approximately half of the isolates.  Investigation of current vaccine efficacy revealed that the current acellular pertussis vaccine reduced colonization of clinical B. pertussis strains in the murine respiratory tract, though not necessarily to the same extent as it reduced that of the laboratory strain.  These data provide evidence that the current vaccine is still effective, but the circulating B. pertussis isolates have evolved since the generation of the vaccine.\nChapter 3 investigates an avirulent B. bronchiseptica strain isolated from human sputum.  This B. bronchiseptica strain 99R-0433 is beta-hemolytic when grown on a blood agar plate and appears to be negative for O-antigen serotypes O1 and O2.  Additionally, in contrast to B. bronchiseptica strain RB50, which is an efficient colonizer of the murine respiratory tract, B. bronchiseptica strain 99R-0433 cannot colonize the murine respiratory tract of wild type or immunodeficient mice.  Based on genome wide SNP analysis, B. bronchiseptica strain 99R-0433 is divergent from other Bordetella isolates.  Furthermore, B. bronchiseptica strain 99R-0433 lacks several important virulence factors including pertactin, tracheal colonization factor, dermonecrotic toxin, adenylate cyclase toxin, Type VI secretion system, and O-antigen.  Using this strain as a tool, we can begin to understand which virulence factors are required for different aspects of pathogenesis.\nInvestigating the host side, Chapter 4 discusses the interactions between Bordetella species and microfold (M) cells.  The data provide evidence that B. bronchiseptica is capable of colocalizing with M cells in vivo and in vitro, and Bordetella species associate with and are translocated by M cells in a Bvg-dependent manner. Following infection with Bordetella species, induction of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin-6 by M cells are observed.  These preliminary data provide support for determining whether M cells play a role in the initiation of an immune response.\nChapter 5 questions the experimental mouse model of a high dose inoculation system and discusses the capabilities of using B. bronchiseptica at a low dose inoculum in order to mimic natural conditions.  The low dose inoculum grows in the nasal cavity and results in high bacterial numbers of approximately 100,000 by 7 days post-inoculation, and the bacteria are capable of persisting long term to day 56.  Toll like receptor-4 (TLR4) signaling is required for the control of bacterial growth in the nasal cavity in a low dose inoculum, which is in contrast to high dose inoculation systems.  In contrast, Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) signaling is not required for control of bacterial numbers following a low dose inoculation.  Cell recruitment analysis revealed that while a high dose inoculum induces ~6,500 leukocytes to the nasal cavity 7 days post-inoculation, the low dose inoculum does not induce recruitment of leukocytes or neutrophils beyond a basal level (< 3,000).  Finally, despite the inability of the low dose to induce leukocytosis to the nasal cavity, serum antibody levels are the same in both high and low dose inoculated mice.\nThrough these studies, we can understand the breadth of Bordetella species and their interactions with the host system while beginning to elucidate remaining questions concerning their pathogenesis.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9926], "author_name_tesi": "Goodfield, Laura Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Goodfield", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill", "Eric Thomas Harvill", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna", "Girish Soorappa Kirimanjeswara", "Mary J Kennett", "David Peter Hughes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Thomas Harvill, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Chair", "Margherita Teresa Anna Cantorna, Committee Member", "Girish Soorappa Kirimanjeswara, Committee Member", "Mary J Kennett, Committee Member", "David Peter Hughes, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bordetella", "Whooping cough", "host-pathogen interactions", "vaccination", "microfold cell", "respiratory pathogen"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "WORK AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS FOR FATHERS IN DIVERSE SAMPLES: \nAN ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE\n\n", "id": "10287", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6491", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although considerable progress has been made toward a greater understanding of fathers as parents and individuals, less is known about the characteristics that shape the work and family experiences of fathers in diverse social, cultural, and geographic samples. Guided by an ecological perspective on the work-family interface, the current investigation sought to advance research on fathers and fathering by examining paternal work and family experiences in low-income and working-class rural families and working- and middle-class African American families. Further, person-oriented analytic techniques were incorporated to provide more nuanced explorations of fathers as parents and individuals. First, the implications of rural fathers\u2019 (n = 492) experiences of work stress for father-infant parenting quality across multiple dimensions were examined. Latent profile analysis revealed five classes of fathers based on social-affective behaviors and linguistic stimulation and complexity. Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that multiple work stressors predicted membership in the fathering classes, although in several instances these associations differed depending on the number of hours fathers spent in the workplace. Second, levels and determinants of African American fathers\u2019 involvement in middle childhood and adolescence were examined (n = 270 youth in 135 families). African American fathers spent approximately seven hours per week with youth and were involved in approximately 20 percent of all youth-reported activities, although considerable variability was observed. Further, multiple family characteristics, including fathers\u2019 worker role attitudes and child age and gender predicted paternal involvement with youth. Finally, associations between paternal individual and family characteristics and person-oriented profiles of family-to-work spillover were examined (n = 403). Latent profile analysis revealed clear and meaningful spillover classes based on combinations of both positive and negative family-to-work spillover. Further, multiple sources of family strain and support, as well as several characteristics of fathers themselves, were associated with patterns of spillover. Fathers\u2019 membership in spillover classes characterized, in part, by high negative family-to-work spillover, was associated with significantly higher paternal depressive symptoms. Collectively, these studies make several unique contributions to our understanding of the work-family interface for fathers in diverse samples and suggest the need for future research examining the development of these linkages over time.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6488], "author_name_tesi": "Goodman, William Benjamin", "last_name_ssi": "Goodman", "middle_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ann Caverly Crouter", "Ann Caverly Crouter", "David Manuel Almeida", "Michael J Rovine", "Valarie Elizabeth King"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ann Caverly Crouter, Dissertation Advisor", "Ann Caverly Crouter, Committee Chair", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member", "Valarie Elizabeth King, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Family-Work Spillover", "Parenting", "Work Stress", "Fathers", "Work and Families", "Latent Profile Analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Stopover ecology of autumn-migrating raptors in the Central Appalachians\n\n", "id": "10270", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3769", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Migration can be the most hazardous period of a bird\u2019s life cycle.  Conditions at stopover sites may influence individual condition, survival, and affect future reproductive potential and population numbers.  Availability of suitable habitat for resting and feeding en route can be an important component determining the success of migration for many birds.  In eastern North America, raptors follow two main corridors during autumn migration, the Atlantic coast and the Appalachian Mountains.  In the Central Appalachians, the Kittatinny Ridge is a key autumn corridor for eastern raptors.  However, little is known about how migrants use the ridge and associated habitats en route.  To better understand migration behavior and habitat use by raptors along an inland flyway, I studied migrating raptors during autumn along the Kittatinny Ridge.  My objectives included to assess the frequency of travel and stopover in individual raptors and document behavior during stopover to understand the role and importance of stopover in migration in raptors.  I also studied which habitats were used by raptors during stopover and the frequency of use of the Kittatinny Ridge to determine the importance of habitat to raptors and whether a flyway corridor could be identified\nIn one part of the study, I radio-tagged and followed 34 Sharp-shinned (Accipiter striatus)  and 14 Cooper\u2019s Hawks (A. cooperii) during autumn migration 2003 and 2004.  Birds were trapped on the Kittatinny Ridge, and followed for one to 12 days each through Pennsylvania and neighboring states.  Both species spent 1-5 days on stopover between travel periods (mean= 2 d.).  Sharp-shinned Hawks spent an average of 33.6% of daylight foraging (+ 24.5 SD) and 32.6% of day roosting (+27.4), and Cooper\u2019s Hawks spent 33.8% (+ 6.8) of day foraging and 47.2% (+26.2) roosting.  Sharp-shinned Hawks spent less time roosting than Cooper\u2019s Hawks; however, neither species differed in behavior by age, except that adults spent more time in non-migrating flight.  On travel days, migrant Cooper\u2019s and Sharp-shinned hawks spent an average of 45% and 35% of daylight in migratory flight respectively, reducing time spent roosting and foraging.  Travel days were not strongly associated with cold front passage, but were associated with days of low cloud cover and for Sharp-shinned Hawks, northerly winds, and higher temperature.  Travel time was longer on days with northerly (tail) winds for both species.  The ratio of hours in travel to hours on stopover per bird during tracking was 1:7 (including night hours) suggesting that rest and foraging periods are an integral aspect of their migration journey.\nThe two species traveled in different compass directions with Sharp-shinned Hawks flying to the southwest (mean= 216.5\u00ba +5.8 SE) and Cooper\u2019s Hawks traveling more to the south (mean= 190.2\u00ba +8.3 SE).  Direction did not vary by age, region, or date.  Cooper\u2019s Hawks spent more time per day traveling on migratory travel days than Sharp-shinned Hawks.  Adult Cooper\u2019s Hawks flew farther and faster on average than Sharp-shinned Hawks and hatch-year Cooper\u2019s Hawks.  Both species spent more time in active travel flight on the Kittatinny Ridge than in the adjacent valley or other regions, although the valley and northern ridges were equally available.  When in the Piedmont and Coastal Plain region both displayed longer, faster flights than in Ridge and Valley region.  Both species exhibited faster travel on days with tail winds, and Cooper\u2019s Hawks also flew faster on days with strong thermals and light winds.  Headwinds appeared to shorten the migration distance for hatch-year Sharp-shinned Hawks whereas adults compensated by flying longer to cover a similar distance.  \nCooper\u2019s and Sharp-shinned hawks may use different strategies to migrate through the Central Appalachians. Cooper\u2019s Hawks exhibited short travel periods with longer stopovers along the Kittatinny Ridge followed by long-distance \u2018power\u2019 flights with short stopovers when traveling south across the more open and developed Plain and Piedmont region.  Sharp-shinned Hawks appeared less likely to undertake long flights and more consistently flew close to the Appalachians where more abundant forest habitat could be found.  Both species seemed to use thermals and updrafts to aid their migration and save energy.\n  Forest patch size was one of the most important factors in stopover site selection with both species choosing larger forests more than occurred at random at both the landscape scale and near scale.  At a regional scale, both species selected more rural areas for stopover sites, selecting areas with more mixed forest and pasture.  Sharp-shinned Hawks avoided suburban areas as well.  Hatch-year Sharp-shinned Hawks used contiguous forest, wetlands, and evergreen forest less than adults.  Nearly half of all roosts of both species were on the Kittatinny Ridge suggesting either an affinity to large forests or the flyway itself.  Both species combined roosted at an average of 6.9 km from the ridge flyway when found within the Ridge and Valley region.  Hatch-year birds roosted farther from the ridge than adults in both species and Sharp-shinned Hawks roosted farther from the ridge than Cooper\u2019s Hawks. \nCooper\u2019s Hawks were more selective in their habitat choice during migration than during nesting, choosing large forests in more rural landscapes. The selection of roosts by Sharp-shinned Hawks near wetlands may indicate that the opportunity to drink is important during migration or that wetlands concentrate their songbird prey.  Evergreen stands could provide important protective cover to roosting Sharp-shinned Hawks, as they may be more vulnerable to avian predation and more likely to seek out evergreen forest during stopover than the Cooper\u2019s Hawk. \nDuring road surveys of all raptors on stopover, birds were most abundant within 1 to 6 km of the ridge and less numerous farther from the ridge or on the ridge itself.  The lowest abundance was observed at the farthest distance from the ridge, 16 km.  The pattern of higher abundance near the base of the ridge remained consistent regardless of changes in forest cover .  The abundance near the Ridge indicates that distance to the flyway could be an important factor influencing migrant distribution.  Habitat influenced  distribution of migrants on stopover as well.  Forest raptors were more numerous on the north side where forest cover was more abundant, and open habitat raptors, e.g. Red-tailed Hawk and Northern Harrier, were more numerous on the south slope where farmland predominates.  Although age influences patterns of migration, no age difference was observed in habitat or distance of migrant raptors surveyed during road surveys. \nThe road survey results together with the radio-tracking data on two accipiters suggests that migrant raptors may prefer to roost near the migration flyway during stopover, but will move away from the flyway to find appropriate habitat when necessary.  Although songbirds demonstrate greater flexibility in habitat use on migration as compared the breeding season (Petit 2000, Rodewald and Brittingham 2004, Keller et al. 2009), raptors appear more conservative in their habitat selection during migration.  \nMigrating raptors expend considerable energy to travel between breeding and wintering areas.  As part of their migration strategy, many utilize updrafts along ridges, to save energy en route.  In this study, accipiters relied extensively on thermal lift to aid their migration south but also used the Ridge for energy-savings and stopover.  Migration travel occurred in a wide variety of weather conditions, excluding days of heavy cloud cover or rain.  Migrant raptors appear to prioritize replenishing energy and finding safe areas to rest during their journey.  Migrating accipiters regularly integrated stopover into their migration journey, perhaps following an energy-minimization strategy of migration (Newton 2008).  Raptors settled preferentially near the migration route during stopover, a behavior that is also supportive of an energy minimization strategy of migration.\n Long-term conservation of North American raptor populations may rely on the protection of a rural mix of habitats along key migration corridors including large patches of contiguous forests, rural fields, and wetlands.  Although more research is needed, raptors appear to show more conservative habitat selection patterns during migration than during breeding or wintering periods.  The avoidance of suburban areas by migrant accipiters also suggests that conservation planning should limit suburban and urban development within important migration corridors.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3748], "author_name_tesi": "Goodrich, Laurie J", "last_name_ssi": "Goodrich", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Laurie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham", "Margaret Brittingham", "Duane R Diefenbach", "George Spencer Young", "Richard Tucker Yahner", "Christopher Barry Goguen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham, Dissertation Advisor", "Margaret Brittingham, Committee Chair", "Duane R Diefenbach, Committee Member", "George Spencer Young, Committee Member", "Richard Tucker Yahner, Committee Member", "Christopher Barry Goguen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stopover", "raptors", "behavior", "habitat use", "migration", "Kittatinny Ridge", "Appalachians"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Identity Uncertainty, Communication, and Subjective Well-being during the Transition to College", "id": "9867", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "123", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation was founded on the assumption that identity uncertainty negatively affects people\u2019s subjective well-being, and that communication may impact the experience of identity uncertainty. Chapter 1 reviewed literature on theories of identity and explored how communication shapes identity. Chapter 2 explored the developmental aspect of identity, especially during the period of emerging adulthood. This chapter advanced identity uncertainty as a construct that encompasses the doubts and questions people have about their self concept, which may be especially prominent during emerging adulthood. Chapter 3 described how friendships are formed and maintained, as well as the unique role that friends play during emerging adulthood. Then, hypotheses were advanced that specified the associations between identity uncertainty and subjective well-being, and communication and identity uncertainty.\nA pilot study exploring the construct and measurement of identity uncertainty is described in Chapter 4. A longitudinal study spanning the course of a semester was conducted. Participants completed 2 online surveys and a series of online diary-like surveys. Specifically, results from the pilot study indicate that the identity uncertainty measure has construct validity and discriminant validity. The results also suggest a negative relationship between identity uncertainty and subjective well-being, and that communication may reduce identity uncertainty.\nChapter 5 described the methods of the main study, which involved 3 online surveys and a diary-like survey conducted over the course of a semester. Measures for the online surveys included identity uncertainty, subjective well-being, contingencies of self-worth, willingness to self-disclose, and tolerance for uncertainty. For the diary survey, participants were asked to describe conversations about identity uncertainty. \nChapter 6 presents the results of the main study. A series of correlations, regression analyses, and HLM analyses were used to test the hypotheses. First, I tested the association between identity uncertainty and subjective well-being. Results indicated an overall negative association between the variables. Next, I tested the affect of contingencies of self-worth on the association. The relationship between identity uncertainty and subjective well-being was more negative when people\u2019s self-worth about a facet of identity was tied to that facet. Finally, I explored the association between communication and identity uncertainty. Willingness to self-disclose and identity uncertainty were negatively related, and tolerance for uncertainty did not moderate that association.\nFinally, Chapter 7 discusses the implications of the pilot and main studies for understanding identity uncertainty, subjective well-being, and communication.

In this study we strive to characterize bovine leukemia virus (BLV) induced immunosuppression in the rabbit. BLV has been previously reported to induce persistent infection in rabbits resulting in an immunosuppression-like disease pathogenesis after a long (>12 months) incubation.1,2 This model will be valuable to study concurrent viral infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/ AIDS patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate parameters and establish criteria for bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-induced immunosuppression in rabbits.  Proviral DNA (pBLV913) or virus producing fetal lamb kidney cells (BLV-FLK) were used to initiate infection in rabbits over the course of 6 months. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected biweekly to quantitate helper T, cytotoxic T, and B lymphocyte populations using anti-CD4, anti-CD8, and anti-MHCII antibodies respectively. Serum samples were collected for detecting anti-BLV antibody generation by ELISA. Our results showed that, within the confines of the short observation period, BLV did not significantly alter the peripheral blood lymphocyte populations. BLV-FLK inoculation resulted in significant lower body weights in rabbits when compared with those in the control rabbits. All of the BLV-FLK cell-inoculated but none of the pBLV913-inoculated rabbits produced antibodies against BLV Gp51.

In humans, the intracellular heterotrimeric G-protein complexes play critical roles in our sense of sight, taste, smell, emotion,and central physiology by receiving extracellular signals perceived and transduced by plasma-membrane localized seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These numerous and diverse physiological processes are facilitated by  > 800 predicted and known GPCRs in humans which signal to a large number of G-protein compexes with a theoretical combinatorial complexity of over 900 configurations. Similar to metazoan organisms, plants also sense and respond to their environment and it is abundantly clear that plants propagate a numerous and diverse set of signals through the hetrotrimeric G-protein complex. But in plants the number of known G-protein complex subunits is greatly reduced. There are no confirmed GPCRs, and prior to finishing this dissertation, the number of Arabidopsis G-protein complex configurations was limited to three. The question remains as to how the relatively sparse repertoire of plant G-proteins can be responsible for the wide range of physiological processes affected by G-protein subunit mutation.

The aim is to analyze the correlation between different attributes of data recorded in a search engine transaction file.

This thesis presents a proof-of-concept that tensor analysis is a valid methodology for mining search engine logs to study correlation of characteristics, identify patterns, and isolate outliers. One of the main challenges involved in analyzing search engine transaction logs is the huge volume of data that is continuously evolving with time, which tensor analysis resolves.\n\tThe experimental design consisted of two main scenarios aimed at studying trends and attribute correlation in five log files from Web search engines. The trend analysis presents the variation of a set of attributes over a period of 24 hours. The correlation analysis detects two kinds of patterns occurring over this 24-hour period. One of these patterns is recognized as the normal or main trend, while the other as an abnormal trend that is deviating from this main trend. The results show that three of the four search attributes (Search Pattern, Number of Queries and Query length) are positively correlated with each other and negatively correlated with the fourth attribute (User Intent) in the main trend analysis. In the abnormal trend, first and third attributes (Search Pattern and Query length) are negatively correlated with the other two attributes. This type of analysis allows us to identify the outliers in these log entries that contribute towards occurrence of an abnormal pattern.

In Escherichia coli, the housekeeping sigma factor, \u03c370, recognizes the majority of promoters for transcription during exponential growth. In addition to \u03c370, E. coli has other sigma factors, termed alternative sigma factors, which are activated in response to specific environmentally induced and internal stresses. The ability of bacteria to adapt to varying conditions is dependent on the ability of the sigma factors to bind core RNA polymerase and direct transcription of specific genes whose products promote survival. What governs these sigma factors is hence an important area of research. The focus of my thesis work has been the extracytoplasmic function sigma factor, \u03c3E, which is the only essential alternative sigma factor in E. coli. \n\n\u03c3E activity increases in a growth phase -dependent manner and is subject to two types of regulatory mechanisms. Levels of active \u03c3E are maintained in the cell by the cognate anti-sigma factor, RseA which under non-stress conditions binds to most \u03c3E in the cell. Cell envelope stresses caused by overexpression or disruptions in the proper folding of outer membrane proteins results in a proteolytic cascade that degrades RseA, releasing \u03c3E into the cytoplasm, thereby activating \u03c3E -dependent transcription. While \u03c3E is best characterized for its role in maintaining cell envelope homeostasis, \u03c3E activity can also be independently regulated during nutrient limitation in the absence of obvious cell envelope damage. \n\nEntry into stationary phase leads to an increase in \u03c3E activity via the action of the signaling molecule, guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) and its co-regulator, DksA. In my thesis work, I determined the contribution of ppGpp and DksA to upregulation of \u03c3E activity during starvation for specific nutrients or under specific starvation regimes. I report that while ppGpp and DksA act in concert to regulate \u03c3E activity during amino acid starvation and entry into stationary phase in LB, ppGpp regulates \u03c3E in a DksA -independent manner during phosphate starvation and entry into stationary phase in rich defined media (EZ-Rich). The DksA -independent regulation did not fit with models based on any of our previous data including in vitro transcription results where DksA is required to potentiate the effect of ppGpp on E\u03c3E -dependent transcription. To determine how ppGpp regulates \u03c3E in the absence of DksA, I focused my work on phosphate starvation. I found that ppGpp levels were slightly elevated in the absence of DksA during phosphate starvation. We made an additional finding that the increase in ppGpp during phosphate starvation is not necessarily dependent on regulation by SpoT hydrolase as previously assumed. My data suggests that the combined action of ppGpp and additional unknown regulator(s) results in the observed DksA -independent regulation of \u03c3E activity. \n\nTo find additional factors that may compensate for the lack of DksA to regulate \u03c3E activity, we employed a genetic screen. The screen-based approach led to the discovery of a novel regulatory mechanism mediated by the LysR-like regulator, LeuO. LeuO is a DNA-binding transcription factor. Overexpression of LeuO results in overall decreased \u03c3E activity during exponential and stationary phase. I found that LeuO overexpression leads to lower levels of outer membrane porins (OMPs), specifically those of OmpC, OmpX and OmpL. I propose that LeuO overexpression represses OMP expression, thereby lowering \u03c3E activity via RseA. Additionally, loss of or overexpression of LeuO did not compensate for the lack of DksA to regulate \u03c3E activity; hence LeuO is not part of the ppGpp-dependent, DksA-independent regulation of \u03c3E activity. Overexpression of LeuO also led to filamentation in growing cells. The septal murein-binding protein, DamX, is involved in the observed LeuO -mediated filamentation defect. The filamentation defect was unrelated to the effect of LeuO on \u03c3E activity, hence these are two independent pathways mediated by LeuO. My findings suggest that LeuO -mediated regulation may be a widely used mechanism to control various aspects of cellular physiology. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8111], "author_name_tesi": "Gopalkrishnan, Saumya ", "last_name_ssi": "Gopalkrishnan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Saumya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Ellen Ades", "Paul Lee Babitzke", "B Tracy Nixon", "Katsuhiko Murakami", "Edward G Dudley", "Sarah Ellen Ades"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Ellen Ades, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul Lee Babitzke, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member", "Katsuhiko Murakami, Committee Member", "Edward G Dudley, Special Member", "Sarah Ellen Ades, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["sigmaE", "ppGpp", "starvation", "transcription", "Escherichia coli"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Knowledge Discovery of Gamification Features Relevant to Immersive Virtual Reality Environments", "id": "25149", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11148", "abstract_tesi": "Virtual Reality (VR) is a three dimensional interactive world that gives users the impression of being somewhere other than where they actually are. Over the last decade, a wide range of VR applications have been developed, based on VR environments. Immersive VR environment is a type of VR environment that produces an interactive computer generated world of high ecological validity, in which the users can \u201cimmerse\u201d themselves using a variety of 3D stimuli. On the other hand, non-immersive VR environment is the least immersive implementation of VR techniques in which the virtual environment is viewed through a portal or window by utilizing a standard high resolution monitor and interactions occur using 2D interaction devices such as keyboards and mice. A major limitation of non-immersive VR environments is the lack of immersive experience that not only provides content to users, but also enables them to interact in a completely 360 degree immersive environment. Furthermore, a knowledge gap exists in terms of what motivates individuals to utilize such systems. This thesis aims to fill these research gaps by first i) exploring whether there exists statistically significant differences in performance between users in immersive VR and non-immersive VR environments and then ii) proposing the use of video game design elements in non-game contexts (i.e., immersive VR environments) to motivate and increase user engagement, otherwise known as \u201cgamification\u201d. A case study involving 54 individuals carrying out a product functional analysis task is used to test the hypothesis that immersive VR environments, such as those achievable through head-mounted displays, enhance performance outcomes when compared to non-immersive VR environments. A case study involving 60 games from the Android market is used to understand the fundamental aspects of video games that make them engaging and motivating. Seven game design elements (challenges, levels, win states, social graph, rewards, content unlocking and leaderboards) are found to motivate users and maintain user engagement for extended periods of time and could be potentially integrated into immersive VR environments to make them more engaging and motivating for users.

Regulation of these diverse responses requires a series of highly coordinated cellular events that include binding of ligand, association with a heterodimeric partner, recruitment of transcriptional machinery, and multiple protein-protein interactions.  This thesis will examine a subset of these protein-protein interactions and detail the effects of the association on PPAR-alpha transcription activity.\nThe ribosomal protein L11 (rpL11) is a PPAR alpha-interacting protein that inhibits receptor transcriptional activity. Ablation of rpL11 expression by RNAi resulted in increased ligand-induced mRNA levels of PPAR-alpha target genes, and increased PPAR-alpha transactivation in PPRE-dependent reporter assays. Growth inhibitory conditions such as serum deprivation and treatment with low concentrations of Actinomycin D facilitate increases in the level of non-ribosomal L11; these conditions decreased transcriptional activity of PPAR-alpha. Ribosomal protein L11 also acts as a negative regulator of murine double minute 2 (MDM2), mediating p53 stabilization. Whether interactions with rpL11 resulted in a convergence of PPAR-alpha and p53 pathways in response to peroxisome proliferators (PPs) was examined. Although treatment of Hepa-1 cells with the PPAR-alpha ligand Wy-14,643 decreased transcriptional activity of p53, this effect could not be attributed to rpL11. Increased p53 activity mediated by rpL11 remained unaffected by Wy-14,643 or coexpression of PPAR-alpha. Thus, rpL11 regulates both p53 and PPAR-alpha pathways, although the effects of peroxisome proliferators on p53 activity cannot be attributed to rpL11 associating with PPAR-alpha.\nThe identification of rpL11 as an MDM2-interacting protein and regulator of the MDM2/p53 pathway prompted further studies investigating the role of MDM2 in regulation of PPAR-alpha. MDM2 interacted with the A/B domain of PPAR-alpha and regulated the transcriptional activity of the receptor. Knockdown of MDM2 by siRNA in FaO hepatoma cells decreased ligand-induced mRNA levels of several PPAR-alpha target genes involved in lipid metabolism, indicating that MDM2 enhances the transcriptional activity of PPAR-alpha. MDM2 associated with PPAR-alpha on target gene promoters, and this association increased in the presence of Wy-14,643. Interestingly, treatment of mice with clofibrate resulted in decreased protein expression of MDM2 in wildtype, but not PPAR-alpha null mice, suggesting that PPAR-alpha controls MDM2 through a negative feedback mechanism. MDM2 coexpression increased ubiquitination of PPAR-alpha; the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2 regulated PPAR-alpha protein expression and transcriptional activity. PPAR-alpha protein expression was decreased in FaO cells transfected with MDM2 siRNA indicating that MDM2 stabilized PPAR-alpha protein levels. In support, MDM2 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressed lower levels of PPAR-alpha protein and responded to Wy-14,643 only upon re-introduction of MDM2. These studies identify MDM2 as a component of PPRE-associated coregulator complex that increases PPAR-alpha transcriptional activity in response to ligand, and that is in turn regulated by PPAR-alpha through a negative feedback loop.\nAlthough MDM2 ubiquitinates PPAR-alpha, it is not the only E3 ligase that is capable of regulating this nuclear receptor. The E6-associated protein (E6-AP), previously identified as a nuclear receptor coactivator, was examined as a potential PPAR-alpha interacting protein and ubiquitin E3 ligase. E6-AP is a PPAR-alpha-interacting protein that when overexpressed resulted in ligand-independent inhibition of PPAR-alpha transcriptional activity. This effect required the ubiquitin ligase activity of E6-AP. Treatment of mice with clofibrate resulted in an increase in E6-AP expression in wildtype, but not PPAR-alpha null mice, suggesting that E6-AP acts as a feedback regulator of PPAR-alpha.\n Emerging studies suggest a role for MDM2 in insulin signaling via interactions with the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3). Understanding the role of the PPAR alpha-MDM2 interaction in insulin signaling and manipulating this interaction may have important implications in developing improved PPAR-based therapeutics. The significance of the MDM2-rpL11 interaction in tumorigenesis is highlighted by reports of cancer-associated mutations in MDM2 that disrupt its interaction with ribosomal proteins such as rpL11. The studies presented in this thesis also provide a basis for examining the role of PPAR-alpha in regulating the MDM2-rpL11 association during cancer development.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3738], "author_name_tesi": "Gopinathan, Lakshmi ", "last_name_ssi": "Gopinathan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lakshmi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Patrick Vanden Heuvel", "Gary H Perdew", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Patrick Vanden Heuvel, Committee Chair", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PPAR", "ribosomal protein L11", "MDM2", "E6-AP", "ubiquitin ligase", "nuclear receptor"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "MODELING OF PIEZOELECTRIC SMART STRUCTURES FOR\nACTIVE VIBRATION AND NOISE CONTROL APPLICATIONS\n", "id": "5863", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5896", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Active vibration control and active structural acoustic control using piezoelectric\nsensors and actuators have recently emerged as a practical and promising technology.\nEfficient and accurate modeling of these structures bonded to or embedded with actuators\nand sensors is needed for efficient design of smart structures. This dissertation addresses\nthe modeling of these structures and the associated control system design technique.\nModeling of structures with both laminated and discrete type of actuators and sensors are\naddressed.\nFor piezoelectric laminates the governing equations of motion are derived using\nFirst Order Shear Deformation Theory (FSDT) and for the first time the dynamic\nresponse fields inside the laminate are obtained and compared with full elasticity\nsolutions. This comparison brought out the effect of assumptions made with respect to the\nelectric and mechanical fields using FSDT and Classical Laminate Theory (CLT) in\nprevious work. It is expected that this analysis and the interior field estimations would\nhelp designers to understand the shortcomings of FSDT in modeling piezoelectric\nlaminates, and help them to adopt this theory properly for use in FE or other numerical\nmodels.\nFor surface bonded discrete patch type actuators/sensors, the governing dynamic\nequation of motion for a plate is derived. The solution to this equation is obtained using a\nFourier series method and the effect of passive stiffness and mass on the natural\nfrequency is studied. The studies showed that ignoring the mass and the passive stiffness of actuators/sensors leads to large errors in estimating the vibration characteristics of the\nsmart plate. A Rayleigh-Ritz (RR) approach is then presented for studying the active\nvibration and transmitted noise control of a smart plate with discrete piezoelectric\npatches. Classical laminated plate theory is used to model the composite plate and electro\nelastic theory is used model the piezoelectric patches. The dynamic equations of motion\nfor the coupled smart panel-cavity system are derived using Hamilton\u2019s principle. Close\nagreement between the present approach and the finite element and experimental results\nconfirmed the validity of the approach. The RR approach is thus presented as a simple,\ncomputationally inexpensive approach when compared to the finite element method. The\nRR method also proved to be powerful method for modeling the adjacent acoustic\nmedium and for the associated control system design.\nA finite element approach for the integrated design of a structure and its control\nsystem for suppressing vibration and the radiated noise are presented. A finite element\nmodel for a smart plate with surface bonded piezoelectric patches is developed using\nshell, brick and transition elements. The free and forced vibration characteristics of the\nplate are studied with and without closed loop feedback control. An optimal (multi-input\nmulti-output) MIMO controller design for the vibration suppression of a clamped plate\nusing the FE model is proposed. Numerical simulation showed that an optimal controller\ndesigned for controlling the smart plate vibration also reduces the transmitted noise to 20\ndB for the first mode and to 40 dB for the second mode of plate.\nThe RR approach accurately models rigid walled acoustic cavities, but flexible elastic boundaries or sound absorbing walls cannot be modeled using this approach. To\nmodel such acoustic domains, a novel hybrid Rayleigh-Ritz/Boundary Element solution\nmethod is proposed. This method would enable designers to model the panel with\npiezoelectric actuators and sensors and the adjacent acoustic medium with the presence of\npassive absorbers at the interface. The predicted sound pressure attenuation for three\ndifferent thicknesses of passive absorber in the frequency range of 200 to 1200 Hz is\ncalculated and an optimal thickness value of for the absorber for the smart panel is\ncalculated. The attenuation in sound pressure levels due to an active control system in\nthe presence of passive absorber is also computed. The system matrices resulting from\nthis method are very smaller in size when compared to the FE models, which makes this\napproach most suitable for optimization studies.

Usulut\u00e1n pottery can be divided into two type-varieties: Izalco Usulut\u00e1n and Bolo Orange. Both type-varieties distinctive for their burnished surface and orange on cream resist decoration. Izalco Usulut\u00e1n is made with fine textured cream colored clays. Bolo Orange is made with medium to fine texture buff to orange colored clays. Although they are similar in appearance, each type has a different pattern of distribution throughout this region. These patterns of distribution have lead researchers to argue for increased interaction among the chiefdoms. The region marked by this interaction is called the Uapala Ceramic Sphere. While some level of interaction is agreed upon, the specific behaviors that caused these patterns has been debated. \n\tThis thesis identifies patterns of Usulut\u00e1n production and distribution using INAA, which measures the chemical composition of pottery by bombarding samples with neturons through irradiation and then measuring the characteristic energy released by different elements as they release them. The amounts of different elements for each sample are used to group sherds statistically based on compositional similarity. Examination of these groups can identify loci of production and the subsequent movement of pots from these loci to where they are used and deposited.\n\tA total of 229 Usulut\u00e1n sherds were submitted to INAA and their chemical compositions were compared. Grouping based on compositional similarities revealed that the majority of Usulut\u00e1n pottery in the Uapala Ceramic Sphere was made locally, although the majority of regions within the sphere either exported or imported Usulut\u00e1n pottery in varying amounts. These patterns of production and distribution suggest that a combination of exchange and stylistic emulation lead to the Uapala Ceramic Sphere.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1135], "author_name_tesi": "Goralski, Craig ", "last_name_ssi": "Goralski", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Craig", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Anthropology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth", "David Lee Webster", "Lee Ann Newsom", "Barry Earl Scheetz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Chair", "David Lee Webster, Committee Member", "Lee Ann Newsom, Committee Member", "Barry Earl Scheetz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["INAA", "Trade", "Ceramics", "El Salvador", "Honduras", "Formative Period"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Asymptotic Analysis of Effective Properties of Highly Concentrated Composites", "id": "7155", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6898", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The modeling and design of composite materials, which are at the forefront of modern technology, raises fundamental questions of physics, materials science, and mathematics.

Hence, the main objective of this thesis is to characterize in a rigorous mathematical framework with a controlled error estimate the dependence of the overall properties of high contrast composites on the irregular geometry (e.g., variable distances between neighboring particles, the percolation effects), and on the boundary conditions.\n\nIn the thesis, asymptotic formulas for overall properties of high contrast composites are obtained as a characteristic interparticle distance parameter tends to zero. Variational bounds are used to justify approximations in all problems.

However, meeting the needs of today\u2019s technological frontiers, such as electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage, will require radical new battery designs.  Although many factors contribute to the viability of new designs, surface features are often a critical component.  With that in mind, the work herein delves into analysis and control of surface features in two promising battery systems: lithium-sulfur batteries and phosphorous anodes for sodium-ion batteries.  Lithium-sulfur batteries often suffer from mediocre capacity, poor cycling stability, low efficiency, and high self-discharge caused by the dissolution and diffusion of lithium polysulfides and their side-reactions with the lithium anode.  Two approaches for controlling this behavior are thus presented.  In Chapter 2, mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbon is shown to have dramatically enhanced ability to adsorb lithium polysulfides compared with undoped mesoporous carbon; this was found to significantly improve both the cyclability and the capacity of the battery.  In Chapter 3, a new electrolyte additive, bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) ether, is shown to help form a more robust anode solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and thus to mitigate self-discharge over prolonged a rest at an elevated temperature.  Phosphorus anodes, in contrast, experience severe volume change (~300%) with cycling, leading to particle fracture and SEI instability.  Fluoroethylene carbonate has been shown to be a good electrolyte additive for mitigating the capacity fading caused by these effects.  In Chapter 4, the changes in the SEI growth and composition brought about by FEC are investigated in detail by impedance spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and spectroscopic techniques.  In addition, it is shown that severe sodium metal deposition can occur on phosphorus electrodes cycled in FEC-free electrolyte.  Put together, this work adds to the knowledge of surface behavior in promising battery systems and identifies new directions for future research.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10312], "author_name_tesi": "Gordin, Mikhail ", "last_name_ssi": "Gordin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mikhail", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donghai Wang", "Chao Yang Wang", "Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Sulin Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donghai Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Member", "Hosam Kadry Fathy, Committee Member", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["battery", "energy storage", "lithium-ion", "lithium-sulfur", "sodium-ion", "electrolyte", "solid-electrolyte interphase", "surface analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "LATINO ENVIRONMENTAL PERCEPTIONS\nAND USES OF OUTDOOR RECREATION AREAS:\nCOMMUNITY AND NATURAL RESOURCES IN PENNSYLVANIA\n", "id": "10534", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3007", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although Latinos are the fastest growing population in the United States, environmental organizations\nand natural resource managers have relatively little information on their attitudes and behaviors\ntoward the natural environment. The U.S. Latino population originates from over twenty nationalities,\nincluding the U.S., and represents a broad diversity of demographic backgrounds, cultural traits, and\nimmigration experiences which have been understudied in the environmental concerns literature. As a\nresult of this diversity, perspectives and concerns are likely to be highly variable among Latinos,\nmaking it even more critical to center attention on the needs and concerns of this population regarding\nthe environment.\nFocusing on eleven counties of eastern Pennsylvania, this study aimed to investigate how Latino\ngroups use and perceive natural areas such as parks, forests, and neighborhood open space. For each\nanalysis, I examined if and how Latino perceptions and uses varied by sociodemographic background,\nethnicity, and community social interactions. Then I explored associations between outdoor\nrecreation, environmental values, and environmental behaviors. Community field theory guided the\nresearch.\nAs a mixed methods study, successive data collection techniques built on previous methods. The four\nmethods used were key informant interviews, a face-to-face household survey, facilitated discussion\ngroups, and an intercept survey. This dissertation presents findings from the interviews and surveys.\nAlthough variables corresponded to a single conceptual model, several of the variables differed\nbetween analyses in order to gain a more complete understanding of relevant processes.\nResults evidenced the ways uses of natural resources and environmental behaviors reflected diverse\nLatino cultural characteristics and the context of residents\u2019 daily experiences in the places where they\nlived. Among other factors, Latino uses of natural areas were influenced by social and physical\nbarriers to community, rural-urban experiences, homeland narratives, and cultural identity.\nParticipants generally showed a high level of appreciation for parks and natural areas. Passive forms\nof recreation such as picnicking, hang out, and playing sports dominated rural and urban park\nactivities. Nature was considered a social experience, critical to maintaining cultural identity.\nOverall, the three separate analyses indicated community, ethnicity, a sense of connectivity with\nnature, and recreation behaviors differentially explained Latino environmental behaviors. Interviews\nsuggested virtually no involvement in community-wide environmental initiatives. Analysis of the\nhousehold survey dataset revealed all concepts significantly influenced communication about\nenvironmental issues. Community, connectivity, and recreation behaviors predicted environmental\nbehaviors outside the home while sociodemographics, community, ethnicity, and connectivity\npredicted behaviors in the home. In the intercept survey, environmental behaviors were predictable\nfor Latinos of three nationalities and two communities. Recreation behaviors were not related to\nenvironmental behaviors. Inconsistencies among methods suggest the continued importance of\nexploring community effects and connectivity with nature in future research.\nResults provide important information for an improved understanding of well-being in communities\nwith large ethnic populations. This contribution to the understanding of the interrelation between the\nsocial context, race/ethnicity, and the natural environment represents a conceptual and\nmethodological advance over prior work, which has tended toward single method techniques and\nlimited theoretical perspectives.

Section 404 of the Clean Water Act regulates wetlands and gives the USACE the authority to issue permits that allow dredging or filling wetlands. These section 404 permits often require the creation or restoration of wetlands elsewhere on the landscape to mitigate for the loss of the area and function of the impacted wetlands. While wetland mitigation is widely practiced, there is increasing evidence that many of these created wetlands do not replace the functions of the impacted sites. SOM has been proposed as a good indicator of soil quality and is related to a number of wetland functions, including water storage and the retention or transformation of nutrients and pollutants. Many studies have found that created wetlands contain significantly lower concentrations of SOM than natural wetlands and some studies suggest that SOM does not increase with wetland age. Limited pools of SOM may impact the ability of created wetlands to function similarly to natural wetlands. More information about the patterns of SOM concentration in created wetlands is necessary to understand the functioning of these wetlands and to inform the design of future created wetlands. The objectives of this study were to examine patterns of processes potentially related to the accumulation of SOM in two central Pennsylvania created wetlands and to develop a carbon budget for one of the created wetland study sites. The hypotheses tested include 1) the concentration of SOM is greater in areas that are more frequently inundated or saturated, with high biomass, low litter quality and low rates of soil respiration and 2) the exports of carbon via respiration and DOC export are limiting the accumulation of SOM in a created wetland. The study sites, Stewart 1 and Stewart 2, are located in central PA and were constructed in 2002/2003 as mitigation for impacts to wetlands during the construction of I-99. A previous study included these sites in a comparison of the functional capacity of created and reference natural wetlands and found that the created sites functioned differently than the natural wetlands and contained significantly lower levels of SOM. Since SOM accumulates when inputs of organic material (e.g., primary productivity or hydrologic import) are greater than outputs (e.g., decomposition or hydrologic export) some of these controlling processes were assessed. The vegetation communities at each site were mapped and biomass (a proxy for net primary productivity), biomass C:N ratio (a proxy for decomposition) and soil respiration (a proxy for decomposition) were sampled within each community. Wetland hydrology was also assessed through the use of automatic water level recorders coupled with detailed elevation information obtained from lidar and topographic surveys. Soil samples were collected from each wetland site on a 20 m grid and were analyzed for SOM using a Loss on Ignition protocol. The relationships between the measured variables and SOM (concentration and density) were assessed using a spatial regression analysis. A strong negative correlation between bulk density and SOM concentration was able to explain 69-74 percent of the variance in SOM concentration at Stewart 1 and about 45- 47 percent of the variance in SOM concentration at Stewart 2. SOM densities were significantly spatially autocorrelated at both sites. At Stewart 2, the negative correlation between percent time inundated or saturated and SOM density was able to explain 24-27 percent of the variance in SOM density. The hypothesis that the concentration of SOM is greater in areas that are more frequently inundated, with low litter quality and low rates of soil respiration was not supported by the results of this study. Biomass was insufficiently sampled to draw any definitive conclusions about the relationship between productivity and SOM. It is likely that the relationship between hydrology and SOM is largely due to the effect of hydrology on productivity, with low levels of SOM found in the open water areas where NPP is low and the litter quality of the aquatic vegetation is high. Additional research is needed to determine whether similar relationships are present in other created wetlands and to further investigate the links between SOM accumulation and NPP, litter quality, soil respiration, hydrology and topography. Studies should examine whether alternate wetland designs can promote the accumulation of SOM. Depending on the assumptions made when developing the carbon budget for Stewart 2, that site could either be a source or a sink for carbon. The hypothesis that the loss of carbon via respiration and DOC export are limiting the accumulation of SOM in Stewart 2 could not be confirmed or rejected. Further investigations are necessary to better quantify the carbon budget of created freshwater wetlands. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3365], "author_name_tesi": "Gordon, Katherine Dorothy", "last_name_ssi": "Gordon", "middle_name_ssi": "Dorothy", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wayne Lawrence Myers", "Charles Andrew Cole", "Wayne Lawrence Myers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wayne Lawrence Myers, Thesis Advisor", "Charles Andrew Cole, Thesis Advisor", "Wayne Lawrence Myers, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["soil organic matter", "created wetlands", "carbon cycle"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Role of Parenting Behaviors and Neighborhood Quality in Delinquent Behavior and Substance Use\n\n\n", "id": "10343", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3770", "abstract_tesi": "The current study examined the relation among parenting behaviors, neighborhood quality, and adolescents\u2019 delinquent behavior and substance use in a sample of Black and Latino adolescent males.

One area of particular interest is in the design of arrays with wider operating bandwidths.  Two main developments have driven the need for wider bandwidths.  First, there has been a push to reduce the footprint of radio frequency (RF) systems on space-limited platforms such as manned aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and naval vessels.  Developing arrays with wider bandwidths that cover the required operating frequencies of multiple RF systems enable these systems, including their antennas, to be combined into one unified, space-saving, multi-functional system.  Second, modern radar systems and high-speed communication links are constantly being developed that require wider bandwidths to reach their full potential; thus correspondingly wideband antenna arrays are required.  \nTypically, wideband operation of antenna arrays entails limiting input return loss to -10dB and avoiding the onset of grating lobes.  Grating lobes, which are array factor maxima in directions other than the principle intended direction, arise from the periodic spacing of antenna elements, the most commonly used element arrangement.  In a standard periodic array with \u03bb/2 wavelength spacing between elements, grating lobes would limit bandwidths to 2:1 if no beam scanning was desired, and this bandwidth reduces further as more scanning is desired.  Aperiodic array designs, however, inherently avoid this periodicity which leads to grating lobes, and, when properly designed, can achieve low relative sidelobe levels over decades of bandwidth.  The introduction of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation-Evolutionary Strategy, or CMA-ES, a powerful, efficient evolutionary strategy based optimization algorithm, to the electromagnetics community has enabled increasingly large high-performance antenna arrays to be designed.  \nThis thesis covers two studies of the potential of CMA-ES to develop wideband aperiodic antenna arrays that enable increasingly multi-functional and capable RF systems.  First, we investigate the design of CMA-ES optimized wideband aperiodic antenna arrays using realistic spiral elements.  While CMA-ES has recently been applied to aperiodic arrays with isotropic elements, its potential had yet to be extensively explored while incorporating realistic antenna elements.  Second, we develop a dual-band patch element and aperiodic array designed to operate at widely separated frequencies (\u22482.2:1) with array scanning.  This approach allows the transmit and receive antennas to be combined into one unified aperture, and shows the potential to allow the integration of other RF systems as well.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7651], "author_name_tesi": "Gorman, Philip John", "last_name_ssi": "Gorman", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Philip", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CMA-ES", "Spiral Antenna", "Antenna", "Antenna Array", "Wideband", "UWB", "Aperiodic Array", "Axial Ratio"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Language Structure Knowledge of Preservice Teachers: Connecting Speech to Print", "id": "6631", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5568", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigated the efficacy of an instructional training module focused on the alphabetic principle and more specifically, the speech sounds of English on letter-sound knowledge of preservice teachers enrolled in elementary or special education teacher certification programs.

The series of experiments investigating both kinetic and kinematic synergies resulted in the following conclusions: (1) The CNS can form synergies at both levels of the hierarchy involved in prehensile tasks. In natural tasks, salient performance variables are stabilized at both hierarchical levels, while variables that do not have to obey strict constraints are typically stabilized at the upper level only. (2) In comparison to unimanual prehension, force and moments of force produced by opposing effectors differs quantitatively in bimanual prehension. Specifically, bimanual prehension is marked by lower values of normal forces and safety margin measures as well as a decrease in the synergy index at the higher hierarchical level. (3) Synergies are present at both levels of an assumed control hierarchy in kinematic tasks involving object transport with both hands. In the presence of external perturbations to the upper limbs, tactile information from the hands is used to maintain stable grasp of an object, while the lack of such sensory information leads to loss of stability of the distance between the hands and dissociation between the limb trajectories. (4) The mechanical output and variability of the mechanical output of digits involved in prehension of fragile objects are qualitatively similar to patterns found during prehension of non-fragile objects in both unimanual and bimanual tasks.
