SPEs consist of a salt and a polymer host. The polymer host solvates the salt and transfers the cations, hence ionic conductivity is coupled to the polymer mobility. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) has been widely used as the polymer host because its ether oxygens (EO) can easily solvate the cations. However, the anions have high mobility in the SPEs and result in concentration polarization, which degrades the battery lifetime after several charge/discharge cycles. Thus electrolytes in which only cations are the mobile species are desired. Single ion conductors which incorporate anions in the backbone effectively reduce anion mobility and preclude concentration polarization. PEO-based sulfonate ionomers combine the advantages of single ion conductors and PEO. They have sulfonate anions covalently bonded to a PEO backbone through an isophthalate comonomer, and the PEO backbone to facilitate cation solvation. Despite their advantages, PEO-based sulfonate ionomers have conductivity too low to power devices at room temperature. Although we can increase conductivity by having faster polymer dynamics, this approach always leads to unwanted side effects, such as weaker mechanical strength. While experimental techniques have revealed some structural and dynamic aspects in these ionomers, the conduction mechanism and relevant factors still remain unclear. In this work, we aim to provide microscopic observations to fill the missing pieces, which hopefully will lead to a better design of solid polymer electrolytes. \n\nWe use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the PEO-based Na ionomer because it is the most studied sample by experimental techniques, and thus our simulation could best fill the knowledge gap and provide insights into experimental observations. The simulations are carried out with a non-polarizable united-atom force field with scaled partial charges. This is the first time a force field is assembled for such system, and the model is consistent with experimental observables. The simulations show a wide range of cation states, with more than 75% of cations associated with the counterions. Ion aggregates become more prevalent and longer as temperature increases at the expense of the number of solvated cations. The larger ion clusters form chain-like structures, consequently the Na ions at the edge of the cluster have a higher chance to encounter flexible PEO chains than those in the middle. PEO mobility increases with distance from the bound anion, resulting in spatial segragation of PEO dynamics. Slow Na and EO are spatially correlated and most of the slow Na ions belong to ion aggregates. Due to the chain-like structure, the edge/end Na ions have a higher chance to escape. This allows the chain-like aggregate to serve as a charge conduction pathway. We observe a mechanism that utilizes the chain-like aggregates to transfer positive charge without equivalent cation displacement, thus providing a conduction method that is decoupled from polymer motion.  \n\nWe realize that despite both PEO/salts and PEO-based ionomers containing PEO backbone, the two behave differently in terms of polymer dynamics, cation solvation (cation solvated by PEO chains), and the ion conduction mechanism. The different properties may be attributed to ionic interaction, ion content, molecular weight, and molecular structure. As this information has been obtained in PEO/salts and ionomers with different anions and cations, we use molecular dynamics simulation to study a PEO/salt system that has identical cation and anion species as the PEO-based ionomer. This enables us to isolate the effect of covalently bonding the anion to the backbone. Our study shows that the ionomer structure reduces PEO flexibility, PEO mobility, and cation solvation due to the less mobile PEO chains. In the PEO/salt, because anions are not incorporated in the polymer, they do not crosslink different PEO segments by forming ion complexes. The absence of ionic crosslinking results in PEO mobility evenly distributed along the polymer backbone, which is in contrast to the gradient mobility exhibited in the PEO-based ionomer. Due to the more mobile PEO chains in the PEO/salt, ion transport is controlled by the dynamics of the polymer matrix, whereas ion hopping is more important within the more rigid ionomer system. To improve cation mobility in the PEO/salt, the focus should be on polymer dynamics. For the PEO-based ionomer, additional attention should be focused on attaining cation states that promote cation hopping. \n\nAn ideal way to improve cation mobility in the ionomer is to use a weaker anion. Decreasing the ion-ion interactions increase the number of single cations, reduce ionic crosslinks, and improve polymer mobility. Therefore we expect to improve cation mobility in the PEO-based ionomers by decreasing the ionic interaction. We vary the charge delocalization in the ionomer to control the cation-anion interaction strength using molecular dynamics simulations. Varying ionic interactions successfully generates systems with different levels of ion aggregation: from mostly single cations (solvated cations) to mostly ion aggregates. We demonstrate that the interplay between ionic interaction strength and cation mobility is not straight-forward. When the interaction is stronger, cations initially in pair state are the fastest state but their fraction is insignificant. In the strong interaction model, less than 5% of the cations are in pair state, therefore it has a much lower overall Na mobility. When the interaction is weaker, single cations become the fastest. Although in the weak model, more than one third of the cations are in the single state and are mobile, they are unable to compensate for the slow aggregates. As a result, neither weaker nor stronger interactions enhance the overall cation mobility. In this work, we discuss the influences of ionic interactions on ion association, ionic crosslinks, PEO dynamics, and Na mobility in the PEO-based ionomers. \n\nOur ionomer simulation at 343 K demonstrates superionic behavior, as the charge diffusion is greater than the ions' self diffusion. We identify many common features that the superionic ionomer shares with superionic materials. The conduction mechanism that utilizes the chain-like aggregate as a conduction pathway is likely responsible for the fast charge transport. We investigate systems that have various lengths of chain-like aggregates. There is an ideal aggregate distribution and length to realize the superionic conduction. The balance between hopping rate and the aggregate lifetime also plays a role. Hopping has to take place before the conduction pathway disassembles. We demonstrate that the system which is superionic has a higher chance to undergo such conduction events even when the distribution of the aggregates is the same.\n\nWe conclude that to improve cation mobility in the ionomer, we need to focus on both high polymer dynamics and favorable cation states. Our work demonstrates a mechanism that depends on the ion aggregates to conduct charge, which is decoupled from the polymer matrix. This mechanism highlights the importance of arranging coordination sites, which may provide significant enhancement of conductivity while maintaining the strength of the solid polymer electrolyte. We propose several approaches that could improve either the aggregate lifetime or hopping rate while maintaining the other. These designs can help increasing the chance of the superionic conduction.

By properly engineering the electric and magnetic resonances of meta-atoms, which have a length scale smaller than the incident wavelength, novel artificial materials can be constructed. This research investigates novel optical metamaterials that are designed and fabricated with optimized subwavelength nanostructures and properly chosen constituent materials to meet user-specified criteria. Both top-down and bottom-up integration techniques were developed to explore the palette of materials and nanostructures that can be accessed. First, precisely defined subwavelength nanostructures fabricated using conventional top-down techniques were exploited to synthesize a metamaterial absorber, metamaterial waveplates, and a dielectric magnetic mirror. A single-layer metal nanostructure array that had been optimized by genetic algorithm was demonstrated to achieve near-ideal absorptivity from 1.77 \u03bcm to 4.86 \u03bcm and over incidence angles up to 45\uf0b0. The performance of the fabricated absorber was verified using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. A half-wave plate and a quarter-wave plate that exhibit polarization conversion ratios and reflectivity greater than 92% from 640 nm to 1290 nm with incident angles up to 40\uf0b0 were investigated. A Mie resonance-based amorphous silicon nanoresonator array was designed, resulting in a lossless magnetic mirror at 1 \uf06dm with near unity reflectivity and zero reflection phase. The fabricated waveplates and magnetic mirror were characterized with custom-built measurement setups, and the results show excellent agreement with the design targets. Secondly, an alternative hybrid top-down and bottom-up integrated technique was developed to increase the range of materials and nanostructures beyond those available when using conventional top-down techniques and to synthesize optical metamaterials with reconfigurable structures/functionalities. A directed self-assembly strategy was investigated using an applied electric field to deterministically assemble pre-synthesized nanoparticles into predefined locations and to modulate the patterned structures. Based on this approach, reconfigurable two-dimensional ordered gold nanowire lattices with AC frequency-dependent lattice spacing were demonstrated. Electric field simulations and electric force calculations were performed to understand the formation of the lattices. Finally, a simplified electrical equivalent resistor and capacitor (RC) model was developed to explain the observed frequency dependent periodicity change.

The combination of the mesh network and mobile reader gives the system the flexibility to find data paths that efficiently distribute energy consumption, reducing power consumption by up to 80% while maintaining query response times of under 40 seconds.  We also present a system of multiple mobile readers connected via a base station or ad-hoc network in a passive RFID tag-equipped warehouse.  We find that our flexible grid robot movement algorithm performed within 5% of the optimal naive algorithm in the base station case, and outperformed all other algorithms by up to 80% in the ad-hoc case.

Current methods for personal air monitoring involve estimation of time-weighted average(TWA) concentration using a traditional sampling pump (TSP) operating at a fixed flow rate. However, studies have shown that TSP-measured TWA concentration may not correlate well with actual inhaled dose when workload and VE vary considerably. A series of experiments divided into three phases was conducted to develop and evaluate a PSP: (1) development of VE prediction models, (2) verification of prototype PSP performance, and (3) laboratory evaluation of PSP for simulated workplace scenarios.\n\nPrediction models based on real-time hysiological and kinematic signals provided by an ambulatory monitoring system (the LifeShirt\u00ae) and subject demographic characteristics were developed using data gathered from a series of step-tests completed by nine volunteers.

Subsequent experiments conducted to verify the performance of a prototype PSP programmed with a VE prediction model for flow control showed\nexcellent agreement between actual air sampling rate, subject VE, total sampled volume, and reference measures with errors well below 5% and good reproducibility. Fifteen subjects completed replicate step-tests in an exposure chamber for two simulated workplace exposure scenarios in which m-xylene concentrations were correlated and uncorrelated with VE in order to compare PSP- and TSP-measured TWA concentrations. PSP results were significantly higher than the TSP (PSP/TSP = 1.18) when VE was highly correlated with m-xylene concentration (r = 0.93). Race, gender, age, and BMI did not significantly influence the relationship between PSP and TSP measured concentrations.

Direct laser acceleration (DLA) of electrons using the axial electric field of a radially polarized, guided laser pulse has the potential to lead to such compact accelerators. An acceleration gradient on the order of tens of GV/m can be achieved when a radially polarized femtosecond laser pulse with a few TW peak power is focused to \u223c10 \u00b5m diameter; as a result, the dimensions of the accelerator can be considerably reduced compared to conventional technologies. Density-modulated plasma waveguides can be used to simultaneously extend the acceleration distance beyond several Rayleigh ranges and to achieve quasi-phase matching between the laser field and the electrons. Through a set of detailed simulations and experiments, the objective of this dissertation is to contribute to the scientific basis for implementation of this laser acceleration technique.\n\nA deterministic test particle simulation has been developed to facilitate the design of the optimal axial structures in density-modulated plasma waveguides for achieving quasi-phase matched DLA. A simple analytical approach for DLA gain estimation was also derived, in which the walk-off effect between the injected electrons and the laser pulse is included. The results indicate that a positively chirped density modulation of the waveguide structure is required to accelerate electrons injected with low initial energies (<20 MeV). The walk-off effect can be significant and limit the overall DLA efficiency, especially when an ultrashort pulse (few fs pulse duration) is used. Larger axial and radial acceleration regions exist for electrons injected with a higher initial energy (>20 MeV), which sets stringent criteria on the source of injected electrons.\n\nA 3-D particle-in-cell simulation model was developed to gain a detailed understanding of the interactions among the electron bunch, the laser pulse, and the background plasma in the DLA process. To understand how the initial parameters of the injected bunch can be chosen to optimize the DLA, selected time delays (with respect to the laser pulse), bunch lengths, and bunch sizes were assigned to the injected electrons in a series of simulations. When a short bunch is injected, the results confirm that the injection delay is important for controlling the final transverse properties, but it also affects the final energy gain. With a long injected bunch length (of order of a quarter of the plasma wavelength), the enhanced ion focusing force helps to collimate the electrons and a relatively small final emittance can be obtained. DLA efficiency is reduced when a bunch with a greater transverse size is injected; in addition, microbunching is clearly observed due to the focusing and defocusing of electrons by the radially directed Lorentz force. Results indicate that a moderate laser power is preferred to maintain favorable final bunch transverse properties, while the waveguide length can be extended to obtain a higher maximum energy gain, with the commensurate increase of laser pulse duration and energy.\n\nAn important challenge for effective DLA is realizing the guided propagation of a radially polarized laser pulse in a density-modulated plasma waveguide. An all-optical method based on the ignitor-heater scheme was experimentally implemented to machine density-modulated plasma channels. Experimental results show that it is important to prevent the ionization of gas atoms by the heater itself; otherwise, the heating of plasma by the inverse bremsstrahlung mechanism is significantly inhibited. A density-modulated plasma structure was demonstrated with argon plasma using an intensity-modulated ignitor, which serves as a proof-of-principle foundation for producing the density-modulated plasma waveguides suitable for DLA in the future.\n\nTo characterize the radially polarized laser pulse, an angle-multiplexed spatial spectral interferometric technique able to extract the polarization state and relative spectral phase of an ultrashort laser pulse, was developed and experimentally demonstrated. In this device, the interferogram is produced between an arbitrary polarized signal pulse and two orthogonal linearly polarized reference pulses. This technique is limited by the interferometric phase drift, necessitating a calibration procedure prior to data collection. The accuracy of measurement was verified by reconstructing the known relative spectral phase arising from material dispersion and the known elliptical polarization state. Measurement of the relative spectral phase and the spatially variable polarization state of a radially polarized pulse was also demonstrated.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10869], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Ming-wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ming-wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Igor Jovanovic", "Kenan Unlu", "Jack Brenizer Jr.", "Zhiwen Liu", "Gil Travish", "Igor Jovanovic"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Igor Jovanovic, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Member", "Jack Brenizer Jr., Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Gil Travish, Special Member", "Igor Jovanovic, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Plasma physics", "particle-in-cell simulation", "electron accelerator", "ultrafast measurement"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "ACOUSTIC METAMATERIALS: TUNABLE GRADIENT-INDEX PHONONIC CRYSTALS FOR ACOUSTIC WAVE MANIPULATION\n", "id": "12457", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5783", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Acoustic metamaterials are of growing interest due to their ability to manipulate the propagation of acoustic waves in an extraordinary manner to benefit various applications, such as communications, biosensing, and medical diagnosis and therapy. Among various construction methods of acoustic metamaterials, artificially engineered elastic periodic structures, known as phononic crystals (PCs), are the strongest candidates since they exhibit complete phononic band gaps and negative refractions due to the periodicity of the structure. Perfect acoustic mirrors, high-efficiency waveguides, and frequency-selective filters have been demonstrated based on the strong localization of acoustic waves in phononic band gaps. PC-based flat acoustic lenses that break the diffraction limit of waves and achieve sub-wavelength focusing are also obtained, which is considered as a breakthrough in the development of the ultra-high-resolution imaging systems. In this dissertation, a new class of acoustic metamaterials---gradient-index phononic crystal (GRIN PC)---is introduced to overcome the limitations of regular PCs and further enrich the control over acoustic waves.\n\n\nGRIN PCs with a linear gradient profile are first introduced. The band structure for the propagating wave mode of the structure is calculated by a two-dimensional plane wave expansive (PWE) method without considering the temperature and piezoelectric effects. We show that continuous bending of acoustic waves can be obtained by consecutively modulating the filling fraction of the structure along the wave propagation direction. Wide-band acoustic self-collimation and wavelength-scale acoustic mirage effects are numerically demonstrated by simulating shear vertical-mode bulk acoustic wave propagation in such linear GRIN PCs by a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methods.\n\n\nLater, GRIN PCs with a hyperbolic secant gradient profile are presented. Through modulating the elastic properties of the cylinders or periodicity of the structure, a hyperbolic secant gradient distribution along the direction transverse to the acoustic wave propagation can be formed to induce converging of acoustic energy to a focal spot smaller than wavelength over a wide range of working frequencies. Therefore, hyperbolic-secant GRIN PCs are suitable for applications such as flat acoustic lenses and couplers. A high-efficiency acoustic beamwidth compressor is then constructed to couple acoustic waves into a PC waveguide with a beam-size conversion ratio of 6.5:1 and a transmission efficiency of up to 90%. An acoustic beam aperture modifier is invented to decrease or increase the beam aperture of a planar acoustic beam with minimum energy loss and wave form distortion.\n\n\nFinally, the tunability of phononic band gaps in two-dimensional PCs consisting of various anisotropic cylinders in an isotropic host is theoretically investigated. By reorienting the anisotropic cylinders, we show that phononic band gaps for bulk acoustic waves propagating in the PC can be opened, modulated, and closed. The anisotropic materials used in this study include cubic, hexagonal, trigonal, and tetragonal crystal systems, hence the study is comprehensive. Compare to other tuning methods, this technique is more practical and can be applied to all two-dimensional PCs, including GRIN PCs, to establish tunable acoustic metamaterials that have enhanced control over acoustic wave propagation.\n\nTo sum up, two-dimensional GRIN PCs with different gradient profiles are designed to guide acoustic waves in extraordinary manners that are not shown in nature or regular PCs. A practical method for tuning the phononic band gaps of a PC is investigated. The concepts presented in this dissertation serve as important foundations for the future development of acoustic devices.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5779], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Sz-Chin Steven", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "Steven", "first_name_ssi": "Sz-Chin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Huang", "Jun Huang", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Corina Stefania Drapaca", "Stephen A Hambric"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jun Huang, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Corina Stefania Drapaca, Committee Member", "Stephen A Hambric, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phononic crystal", "metamaterial", "acoustic", "tunable", "gradient-index"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "A DATA TRIAGE RETRIEVAL SYSTEM  FOR CYBER SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER", "id": "14787txl78", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14787", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Triage analysis is a fundamental stage in cyber operations in Security Operations Centers (SOCs). The massive data sources generate great demands on cyber security analysts' capability of information processing and analytical reasoning. Furthermore, most junior security analysts perform much less efficiently than senior analysts in deciding what data triage operations to perform. To help analysts perform better, retrieval methods need to be proposed to facilitate data triaging through retrieval of the relevant historical data triage operations of senior security analysts. This thesis conducts a research of retrieval methods based on recurrent neural network, including rule-based retrieval and context-based retrieval of data triage operations. It further discusses the new directions in solving the data triage operation retrieval problem.\nThe present situation is that most novice analysts who are responsible for performing data triage tasks suffer a great deal from the complexity and intensity of their tasks. To fill the gap, we propose to provide novice analysts with on-the-job suggestions by presenting the relevant data triage operations conducted by senior analysts in a previous task. A tracing method has been developed to track an analyst's data triage operations. This thesis mainly presents a data triage operation retrieval system that (1) models the context of a data triage analytic process, (2) uses recurrent neural network to compare matching contexts, and (3) presents the matched traces to the novice analysts as suggestions. We have implemented and evaluated the performance of the system through both automated testing and human evaluation. The results show that the proposed retrieval system can effectively identify the relevant traces based on an analyst's current analytic process.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16844], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Tao ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "first_name_ssi": "Tao", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Recurrent Neural Network", "Machine Learning", "Retrieval", "Security"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Design for Life Cycle: Modularity Considering End of Life Cycle and Carbon Footprint\n", "id": "12297", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6331", "abstract_tesi": "Modularity has been widely used and studied in both industry and academia. Modular products consist of detachable modules that can be manufactured, assembled, and serviced separately. Some modular components (or modules themselves) can be reusable, recyclable, or even re-manufacturable after reaching the end of their original product life cycle. Of interest, environmental issues including energy usage and the production of carbon waste gas during the manufacturing process have attracted attention in the modular design field. Thus it is incumbent upon module design developers to generate additional benefits along a product\u2019s life cycle to help alleviate negative environmental impact.\nThis study presents a modular design methodology for life cycle engineering that takes into consideration environmental factors. The methodology encompasses the following stages: problem definition, initial modularization, modularity considering multiple factors, and modularity analysis. The approach identifies factors related to design objectives, component connection, component end-life factors, and carbon footprint impact. A refrigerator case study is provided to illustrate the methodology.\nModularization differences under various factors are taken into consideration. Results are presented for two types of modularity methods, and each approach focuses on different objectives. The environmental impact (including energy waste and carbon footprint during assembly/manufacturing) was analyzed by dissecting a refrigerator and applying SimaPro (LCA simulation software) to the conditions. Results indicate that the proposed methods will allow a designer to find alternative solutions under multiple objective situations.

One of the combating issues is the development of a robust stem cell culture environment to maintain stem cells without differentiation for long-term culture, in other words, to support their self-renewal and pluripotency. Moreover, because hiPSCs and hESCs have practical use in in-vivo study, for such a clinical application, it is necessary to establish a chemically defined, feeder-free culture system to maintain large scale undifferentiated stem cells in-vitro. Various methods have been proposed for maintaining large scale stem cell culture Some major considerations are: culture media, extracellular matrix, and environment cues.

Iridescence may be caused by one of two processes: the interference of light by thin films or through diffraction by periodic substructures. Therefore, manmade gems with rainbow effects can be created by coating non-iridescent crystals with thin metal films (as with \u201cflame-aura\u201d quartz), or by synthesizing solids with modulated microstructures. However, naturally iridescent gemstones are rare and therefore highly valued. For this study, we have explored the cause of iridescence in a gem quality hematite from Jo\u00e3o Monlevade, Minas Gerais, Brazil and natural quartz crystals from the Jalgaon District, India.\n\nIridescent hematite, also known as \u201crainbow hematite\u201d, was investigated with field-emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. This study reveals that rainbow hematite has a microstructure that consists of spindle-shaped hematite nanocrystals with minor aluminum and phosphorus. The nanorods are 200-300 nm in length and 50-60 nm in width, and they are arranged in three orientations rotated by 120\u00ba with respect to each other and stacked layer by layer to form the bulk crystal. The distances between adjacent parallel spindle-shape particles in the same layer are in the range of 280 \u2013 400 nm, generating a diffraction grating for visible light. The sub-structure is apparent on all freshly fractured surfaces, indicating that it is not merely an exterior surface coating. Rather, we interpret the periodic sub-structure as the result of crystal growth by oriented aggregation of hematite nanorods.\n\nThe iridescent quartz specimens occur as euhedral quartz crystals within chalcedonic geodes that filled cavities in the Deccan Trap basalts. The quartz crystals exhibit strongly expressed terminal faces, and iridescence is visible only on the smaller z {011} faces and not on the r {101} faces. Our scanning electron microscopy ruled out the existence of a thin film on the iridescent faces and suggested a fine-scale substructure. AFM imaging revealed that the iridescent z faces exhibit periodic ridges, and the distance between the ridges varies from 400 nm to 700 nm, generating a diffraction grating for visible light. On the other hand, the non-iridescent r faces are quite flat with no apparent ridges observable by AFM. We interpret the modulated surface topography on the z faces as the result of preferential dissolution. Previous investigators have hypothesized that the iridescence in quartz is associated with Brazil twinning. Thus, we employed focused ion beam lift-out and transmission electron microscopy to determine whether Brazil twins were concentrated at the ridge boundaries. However, instead of Brazil twin boundaries, we observed periodic planar defects parallel to the c axis. The regularly spaced planar defects might have formed by the episodic injection of silica-rich fluids into the host rock cavities (leading to periods of crystal growth), followed by periods of quiescence and crystal stasis. The planar defects formed by the incorporation of fluid inclusions on crystal faces at the onset of a new growth cycle.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11149], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Xiayang ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiayang", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter J Heaney, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["iridescence", "quartz", "hematite", "gemstone", "diffraction grating"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Identification of gene expression markers associated with late blight resistance in tomato using gene expression profiling of a segregating F2 population", "id": "19885", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9500", "abstract_tesi": "Transcript profiling using DNA microarray was applied to 48 F2 tomato plants in which resistance to late blight disease caused by Phytophthora infestans segregates. The DNA microarray was designed using the publicly available cDNA library of Solanum lycopersicum and contains probes for 26,981 transcripts out of the total of 33,840 transcripts in the library. A group of 180 F2 tomato plants, derived from a cross between FL8059 (late blight susceptible fresh market tomato Solanum lycopersicum) and PSLP151 (late blight resistant accession of wild type tomato Solanum pimpinellifolium), were evaluated for resistance to late blight by inoculation with P. infestans (US-13) in the greenhouse. Prior to inoculation, healthy leaf tissues were collected from all of the F2 plants. The 24 most resistant and 24 most susceptible F2 plants were selected for RNA extraction and microarray hybridization. Genes that were differentially expressed between the two pools of resistant and susceptible F2 plants were defined as trait associated gene expression markers (TAGEMs) and identified by differential expression analysis of the microarray data. Of the 26,981 transcripts probed on the arrays, 269 were identified as TAGEMs associated with the inheritance of late blight resistance. The 269 transcripts were mapped on the tomato genome based on the published tomato genome sequence. Clusters of the transcripts on specific locations of the chromosomes were\nfound on 11 of 12 tomato chromosomes. The clustered TAGEMs had a combination of positive and negative associations with late blight resistance. No obvious patterns of functions of the TAGEMs were found based on the annotations. However, a few disease resistance-associated genes were identified among the TAGEMs. The TAGEM clustering\nregions identified in this study can be targeted for genetic marker identification to support tomato late blight resistance QTL mapping in this segregating population. The discovery of multiple TAGEM clusters indicates that this late blight resistance is probably controlled by more than one single QTL locus.

For example, travelers within the United States tend to drive to their destination or rent a car locally to do sightseeing. However, tourists in China typically choose to use tourist buses, operated by travel agencies.  Due to the excessive number of visitors in many scenic spots in China, the scenic spots encourage visitors to take group tours instead of individual tours since the group tours are easier to manage and arrange. Additionally, China\u2019s car-rental industry is less popular and less convenient than America\u2019s. As a result, tourist buses are commonly used by visitors. However, the large number of tourist buses within the central cities leads to many traffic problems. Tourist buses require parking spots on roadways to unload and load guests, which causes disruption to the traffic flow especially in the downtown of Beijing. Currently, the regulations for the parking spots for tourist buses is not well informed, and leads to large traffic jams and delays within the central city. To this end, the goal of this work is to provide general guidelines for regulating the parking spots of tourist buses within central cities, and as a case study use microscopic simulation to improve the traffic conditions in central Beijing by relocating tourist bus stops. The results of this work show that traffic delays in central Beijing can be reduced by up to 16.9% as a result of improving the parking locations.

Thus, parents\u2019 perceptions of children\u2019s growing and learning affect both their interaction with and the environment they provide for their children. In early childhood education, play is an increasingly important factor; in the specific context of Taiwan, little is known about Taiwanese parents\u2019 perceptions of it. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of Taiwanese parents\u2019 perceptions of child\u2019s play and examine whether their perceptions are related to their children\u2019s social competence and creativity.\n  The study was conducted in Hsinchu, Taiwan. In order to ensure greater variability in parents\u2019 backgrounds, criterion-based sampling was used. Three kindergartens were recruited for the study: two were located in Hsinchu County, where parents generally had lower socioeconomic status, and one was located in Hsinchu City, where parents generally had higher socioeconomic status.

I identify ICTs as actors that can create event potentials, a concept discussed by Elizabeth Ellsworth (2004). Event potentials, in this study, refer to social media\u2019s capacity to facilitate emergent knowledge by making social and cultural associations and differences visible. The pedagogical assemblages made visible by ICTs, in this study, are comprised of learning activities that network learners in constructing knowledge through interactions with others about their perspectives, knowledge, and life experiences. Building upon Ellsworth\u2019s pedagogic approach of creating event potentials, this study envisions a museum exhibition as a pedagogic assemblage of personal memory and public discourse and explores how to design ICTs for event potentials to translate a museum exhibition from an assemblage of events and meanings into a space of emergent knowledge. \nActor-Network Theory (ANT) is the analytic approach of this study. ANT is a theory that conceptualizes knowledge as mutual articulation through interactions between both human and non-human actors. From an ANT perspective, ICTs are actors with agency that create event potentials and negotiate between an exhibition\u2019s pedagogic address and individual narratives that visitors bring from their personal and cultural backgrounds. The ANT lens corresponds to Ellsworth\u2019s notion of pedagogic assemblage in that knowledge and the formation of social phenomena come through continual association and differentiation of both human and non-human objects. In understanding the pedagogic assemblage in an art museum context, ANT is both a theoretical lens and an analytical approach to observe associations between museum visitors, the design of ICTs, and the museum environment. By adopting the ANT approach, I traced how the processes of design and redesign of ICTs, as actors with event potentials, translate and expand learning activities in and beyond an art museum context. \nIn this study, I adopted feminist online pedagogy to frame my design and redesign of ICTs in Surveying Judy Chicago: Five Decades exhibition at the Palmer Museum of Art in 2014, and observed museum visitors\u2019 interactions and responses to my ICT designs and redesigns. My design of ICTs aimed to embody feminist online pedagogy to facilitate collaboration, distributed leadership, and mutual articulation between the self and others. The data for this research consists of artifacts, reflective journal entries, semi-structured participant interviews, systematic observations, and documentation of my process of designing with ICTs for event potentials in an art museum context. Through the examination of the process of designing ICTs in this exhibition, I investigated the process of designing ICT to engage visitors\u2019 active participation and to explore ways to facilitate museum audiences\u2019 interaction with the integration of ICTs. \nThe design and redesign of ICTs, the exhibition, and the Feminist Art Gallery Conversations were entangled with participants\u2019 experience in the pedagogic assemblage of the learning environment. Through an action research design of ICTs, I made visible the pedagogic assemblage of Surveying Judy Chicago: Five Decades, which consists assemblages of onsite interactions and online dialogue, of lived experience and emergent knowledge, of public space and personal voice, and assemblage of self and otherness.

Efforts to address satisfaction with trade show performance at the theoretical level have been quite limited or nonexistent. Furthermore, previous studies have failed to recognize the three key stakeholders in the trade show industry (i.e., visitors, exhibitors, and organizers) and the outcomes (e.g., satisfaction and behaviors) of their interactions. This dissertation fills this gap by 1) proposing a trade show performance evaluation framework that accounts for the relationships between visitors, exhibitors, and organizers; 2) constructing a measurement scale on exhibitors\u2019 satisfaction based on the proposed conceptual framework; and 3) applying the scale at multiple trade shows to examine its reliability and validity and the relationships between the three dimensions and behavioral intention.\nThe results of the dissertation are spread out across three chapters (i.e., Chapter 2, 3 and 4), each of which is written as a separate manuscript. In the first manuscript (Chapter 2) I proposed the Visitor-Exhibitor-Organizer (VEO) framework, which could be used by trade show organizers to measure their customers\u2019 (i.e., exhibitors and visitors) satisfaction and positive behavioral intention. Based on the VEO framework, an exhibitor and a visitor performance evaluation model were constructed. The results validated the VEO framework by indicating that it is not adequate to focus on one stakeholder when evaluating trade show performance.\nThe second manuscript (Chapter 3) focused on exhibitors\u2019 satisfaction. This manuscript outlined how I constructed and validated a measurement scale that accounts for the significant roles of all three key stakeholders through a pilot test, scale purification and validation. The final instrument consisted of 46-items that represented 12 sub-dimensions and 3 dimensions of exhibitors\u2019 satisfaction.

The choice of organic substrates utilized in low-cost, low-maintenance, passive treatment systems for AMD is crucial to maintain a diverse microbial community for successful remediation. Recent studies by our research team have shown that crab shell (CS) amendments improve the longevity and performance of traditional AMD treatment systems containing spent mushroom compost (SMC). However, the microbial contribution to this has not been thoroughly explained. In this research, both chemical and biological techniques were used to comprehensively evaluate microbial communities and their relationship with chemical performance under varying environmental conditions in passive AMD treatment systems amended with CS. This might shed light on future design and operation strategies for AMD bioremediation systems.\n    Previous performance data of five sulfate-reducing columns treating AMD suggested that columns amended with higher fractions of CS supported more efficient and stable performance in terms of alkalinity generation, sulfate reduction, and metal removal, as compared to columns with traditional SMC and limestone substrates. Accordingly, microbial analyses conducted on packing materials of the five columns in this study revealed significant advantages of CS amendment in sustaining the growth of functionally more diverse microbial groups including cellulose degraders, chitin degraders, fermenters, and sulfur or sulfate reducers. Remarkably, the 100% CS column supported the growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) from eight different genera\u2014key players in AMD treatment systems. PCoA and phylogenetic ARB trees showed that bacterial communities in 50% CS and 100% CS columns were more likely to cluster together. Archaea predominantly identified as methanogens and fungi capable of polysaccharide degradation were only detected in columns containing SMC. In the 100% CS column, copy numbers of the functional genes representing fermenters, sulfate reducers, and chitin degraders were approximately 2.4, 3.9, and 3.2 times higher than those in SMC column, respectively.\n    In a field study, four pilot-scale vertical flow pond (VFP) systems featuring different substrate combinations of CS and SMC and different underdrain materials were constructed and operated for 633 days at the Klondike-1 site in Cambria County, PA. Analyses of chemical performance data, 454 sequencing, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) data suggested that under changing environmental conditions at the Klondike-1 site, the VFPs containing CS sustained more efficient and reliable treatment of AMD coupled with functionally more diverse and stable microbial communities. Influent pH rapidly increased from < 3.0 to above 6.0 and was maintained circum-neutral by all VFPs. As compared to a control reactor containing SMC, the reactors containing CS sustained higher alkalinity (around 300 mg/L as CaCO3), slower alkalinity exhaustion, and steadier acidity neutralization. Apart from the dissolution of CaCO3 in CS and LS materials, fermentation and sulfate reduction contributed comparably to the generation of alkalinity in pilot VFPs. Correspondingly, copy numbers of genes representing fermenters and sulfate reducers were higher in the pilot reactors containing CS than in the SMC reactor. Similar to the column study, a higher diversity of SRB was observed in reactors containing CS. Due to higher alkalinity levels and sulfate-reducing rates, more thorough metals removal was observed in reactors containing CS than SMC: >90% for the removal of iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al), >50% for manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn), and no breakthrough above 50% of the influent concentration was observed for Fe, Al, and Zn throughout the course of the test. Geochemical modeling indicated that possible mineral phases of precipitation were goethite and mackinawite for Fe, gibbsite for Al, and rhodochrosite for Mn. Sorption onto the surface of Fe and/or Al minerals could be another mechanism for metal removal. Noticeably, the pilot VFP containing 70% CS was shown to maintain more stable performance while possessing comparable treatment efficiency to the 100% CS reactor over varying environmental and operational conditions during the pilot study. This agrees well with microbial observations under no flow condition, which is experienced by many field bioremediation systems due to seasonal changes or clogging: the relative abundance of core phyla shifted in all pilot reactors, but the smallest changes in functional gene copies were observed in the 70% CS reactor.\n    All of the observations summarized above make CS an apparently advantageous substrate for use in passive AMD treatment systems from the standpoints of both system performance and the support of robust microbial communities. Compared to the 100% CS reactor, the 70% CS pilot VFP sustained more diverse and stable microbial communities as well as comparable efficiency and more reliable system performance throughout the seasonal changes of environmental conditions at the field site. Therefore, the use of CS as a fractional amendment to substrate mixtures used in passive treatment systems for AMD or other environmental contaminants is attractive when considering both cost and system performance.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9190], "author_name_tesi": "Lin, Yishan ", "last_name_ssi": "Lin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yishan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rachel Alice Brennan", "Rachel Alice Brennan", "John Michael Regan", "William D Burgos", "Maryann Victoria Bruns"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rachel Alice Brennan, Dissertation Advisor", "Rachel Alice Brennan, Committee Chair", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "William D Burgos, Committee Member", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["acid mine drainage", "chitin", "bioremediation", "cloning", "qPCR", "454 sequencing", "sulfate-reducing bacteria", "Manganese removal"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "PROPERTIES OF SYNTHETIC TWO-DIMENSIONAL MATERIALS AND HETEROSTRUCTURES", "id": "14804yul194", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14804", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Graphene and other two-dimensional semiconductors have established their own research field, \u201c2D Materials\u201d that covers all of subjects related to fundamental and applied science, engineering, biology, medicine, and etc., where their layered structures and anisotropic properties can help to create interesting results. In particular, they play an important role as electronic materials because that their ultra-thin nature and excellent electrical properties make themselves prominent candidates for the next-generation electronics in the digital industries. \nHowever, many researchers using 2D materials are suffering one common issue: limited size of the samples prepared by exfoliating bulk layered crystals. Besides limited size, tape-assisted exfoliation usually leaves the contamination on the surface of 2D materials. Due to the disadvantages of exfoliated samples, the research community has moved on to synthetic 2D materials prepared by thin film deposition techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). For material engineers working on synthetic 2D materials, several challenges posed in front of them include: how to make them scalable and large area, how to grow these layers with high-quality and low-defect density, and how to integrate them with other substrates that have dissimilar features in terms of crystal structure and surface chemistry. This thesis is made to address the mentioned challenges thoroughly, or answers the questions associated with them. \nThis thesis covers two main discussions: 1) Vertical integration of 2D layers for van der Waals heterostructures and 2) Investigation on the properties of synthetic semiconducting 2D layers fabricated on insulating substrates. Each research chapter generally has three components in its experiment: 1) material synthesis by thin film deposition techniques, including CVD; 2) property investigation of the synthetic materials using spectroscopic, surface-probing, and electron microscope techniques; and 3) demonstration of optoelectronic devices made of 2D layers. \nThe first two chapters, Chapters 1 and 2, cover fundamental knowledge and short review on 2D semiconductors, heterostructures, and thin film, synthesis techniques; Chapter 3 has two parts covering the properties of synthetic WSe2: The first part is for the first demonstration of the metallic-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process for WSe2; the second part covers an improved MOCVD process for WSe2 on insulating substrate and studies the interface of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)/substrate and their devices. Chapter 4 discusses the direct synthesis of a variety of 2D layers on graphene, and how surface morphology and quality of graphene would impact their nucleation and growth; Chapters 5 and 6 discuss epitaxy relationship between monolayer WSe2 and graphene, the electrical transport through their junction vertically, and modulation of the Fermi level of graphene to improve the performance; In Chapter 7, the resonant tunnel diodes made of TMDC bilayer (MoS2/WSe2 and WSe2/MoSe2) will be thoroughly discussed, including material preparation, property investigation, and device transport; In Chapter 8, 2D TMDCs integrated on VO2, a phase transition material, and the phenomena arising from their interaction are discussed.

Gene duplication and evolutionary changes of protein-coding sequences are considered as important contributors to the species evolution. Highly conserved gene families that are ubiquitous in living organisms can be used as a powerful tool to study the evolution of living organisms. Because DNA repair pathways are crucial for maintaining genome stability, the pathways together with the key genes involved are usually conserved between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The evolutionary history of recombination repair genes recA/RAD51 family and mismatch repair genes MutS and MutL families were systematically examined in this study. Based on my results, I found that the origins of eukaryotic DNA repair genes are divergent. The eukaryotic RAD51-like genes were derived from the ancestral archaeal species. In contrast, the eukaryotic MutS and MutL genes likely originated from proteobacteria by endosymbiosis of mitochondria, indicating different origins of eukaryotic informational genes.\nAlthough the two types of eukaryotic DNA repair genes have different origins, they also share some similar evolutionary patterns during early stage of eukaryote evolution. The numbers of these genes have expanded by multiple gene duplication events before the divergence of major eukaryotic lineages. Functional innovation and specialization have occurred on these duplicate genes, which might have considerably enhanced the efficiency of DNA repairs. Furthermore, the birth of meiosis-specific genes in both DNA repair genes might have promoted the evolution of sexual reproduction, which creates gene diversity and has contributed to the evolution of eukaryotic species.\nIn addition to gene duplication, the evolutionary changes on the coding regions also play an important role in species evolution, especially in these genes that are involved in the animal development. The bilaterian animals share a common set of fundamental genetic framework to control embryo development. The Hox genes, encoding transcription factors, determine the identities of embryo along the anterior-posterior axis by regulating their downstream genes. All Hox genes contain a highly conserved homeobox which encodes homeodomain. Although the functions of homeodomain have been well studied, the roles of the non-homeodomain regions remain largely unclear. In this study, I identified many ultraconserved coding regions (UCRs) in the mammalian Hox genes. Both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites are ultraconserved in UCRs and most of them are located outside the homeobox. These UCRs are unique to mammals and formed before the divergence of placental mammals. Our study indicates that the formation of UCRs is partially due to local variation of genomic DNA mutability, but mainly due to strong purifying selections. Potential factors that lead to the formation of UCRs are also discussed. We therefore postulate that these UCRs might have contributed to the evolution of placental mammals.

Evidence for inhibition during speech planning has been accumulating in recent behavioral and neurophysiological studies of bilingual speech production. Recently, Levy, McVeigh, Marful, and Anderson (2007) reported that repeated picture naming in the second language (L2) induced inhibition of the picture\u2019s name in the first or dominant language (L1). This inhibition was argued to operate at the level of the phonology. The current study was designed to directly test this claim using an online measure of inhibition. In a series of four experiments, L2 learners and highly proficient bilinguals named pictures in English and Spanish. The English names of these pictures were later presented as items in a lexical decision task to examine whether naming pictures in Spanish had consequences for subsequent access to the English picture names. All four experiments failed to replicate the inhibitory effects reported by Levy et al. If anything, naming pictures in Spanish facilitated rather than inhibited retrieval of the corresponding English picture name.

Conflicts between labor and capital, between men and women, between races and ethnicities, and between groups associated with the broader counterculture and liberation movements were brought by political advocates into the sport. Nonetheless, throughout this same time, the league had political priorities of its own and endorsed certain political issues while not engaging others.\n \nIn this dissertation, I utilize a \u201cmultiple histories\u201d approach to analyze the effect of social movements on the NFL and demonstrate the influence of political football in American culture. To do so, I examine how four social movements (Civil Rights, the New Left and counterculture, labor, and the women\u2019s movement) intersected with professional football from the late 1950s through the 1970s.\n \nLeague representatives had varying reactions each time a social movement appeared on the gridiron. For example, some team owners and coaches supported black athletes fighting to desegregate the game and other areas of society through non-violent protest, but they reacted to the broader Civil Rights Movement by reaffirming notions of white supremacy. While league marketers promoted athletes who endorsed the Vietnam War and other \u201cpatriotic\u201d efforts to defeat communism, they avoided engaging with critics (particularly if they were players) who believed football was antithetical to an idealized \u201cAmerican way of life.\u201d League officials also separated from what they considered \u201clabor radicals\u201d during the labor movement of the 1960s and 1970s, instead reasserting their stronghold over players by officially recognizing only moderate union leaders. League officials endorsed women\u2019s inclusion as spectators and sideline cheerleaders, but discounted attempts of women to play the game themselves. Journalists, moreover, covered the women\u2019s game, but discounted it as not actually sport. Overall, I argue, while players offered undercurrents of opposition to the status quo from the late 1950s through the 1970s, people in the NFL, more often than not, disregarded and delegitimized such views, thus normalizing and popularizing certain political issues while making others seem unreasonably \u201cradical.\u201d\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13741], "author_name_tesi": "Linden, Andrew David", "last_name_ssi": "Linden", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jessica Lynn Schultz", "Jessica Lynn Schultz", "Mark Dyreson", "R.

There are several well-known risk factors for breast cancer including age, genetic factors, family history, reproductive characteristics, physical attributes (e.g. dense breast tissue) and diet and diet-related factors (e.g. alcohol consumption, weight, and body fatness).  While many of these risk factors remain consistent across the pre- and postmenopausal years, it has been established that menopausal status modifies the effect of obesity on breast cancer risk.  Body fatness decreases risk in premenopausal women but increases risk in postmenopausal women.  However, when assessing body fat distribution, central obesity has been positively associated with breast cancer risk in both pre- and postmenopausal women.  Breast density, or the ratio of dense fibroglandular area to total breast area, reflects breast tissue composition and is a strong breast cancer risk factor.  Breast density is higher in premenopausal women, postmenopausal women who use hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and those, regardless of menopausal status, who have a lower BMI.  In contrast, women who are older, parous, have their first birth at a young age, or are smokers often have lower breast density.  These factors can directly (e.g. through altering breast morphology) or indirectly (e.g. through influencing hormones) affect breast density.   Breast density may also be a marker for lifestyle exposures (e.g. diet and body size) and their effects on hormone levels. \n\nBecause breast density and body fatness have both been shown to be modifiable and susceptible to dietary influences, they are often targeted as potential breast cancer prevention strategies.  Many current studies examine single foods or nutrients, which often provide inconsistent results.  Our studies focus on measures of overall diet (e.g. dietary energy density and dietary patterns) and its influence on measures of breast density and body fatness.    Measures of overall diet have been shown to more appropriately account for naturally occurring food and nutrient interactions that are often not properly considered in single nutrient studies.  \nData for the following cross-sectional studies were collected from young women (25-29y) who were initially enrolled in the Dietary Intervention in Children Study (DISC) and later participated in the DISC06 follow-up study.  Informed consent was obtained at all points throughout the study. A total of 663 healthy, pre-pubertal, 8-10 year old children with elevated LDL-C, including 301 girls, were recruited from six clinical centers between 1988-1990.  They were randomly assigned to a behavioral dietary intervention or usual care control group.  The childhood DISC data collection included anthropometry which was used to calculate the childhood BMI-Z score based on the Center for Disease Control 2000 Growth Charts.  Trained study staff measured body composition, anthropometrics, breast density and blood was drawn for DISC06 participants as young adults.  Three 24-hour recalls were used to collect dietary information via telephone over the course of two weeks.\n\nThe objective of the first study was to evaluate the associations between dietary energy density (ED; kcal/g) and three measures of breast density.  Dietary ED is a property of food and can be calculated both with and without beverages.   Individual linear mixed effects models were fit by maximum likelihood with robust standard error for each breast density outcome.  After multivariate adjustment, a 27.0% (95% CI: 6.3 to 51.7%, p=0.009) change in the average percent dense breast volume (%DBV) and a -18.4% (-32.2 to -1.8%, p=0.03) change in the average absolute non-dense breast volume (ANDBV) was observed in our population for each 1 kcal/g increase of dietary ED from food-alone.  Dietary ED from food and caloric beverages was also significantly inversely associated with the ANDBV with a -13.9% (95% CI: -22.3 to -4.7%, p=0.004) change being observed for each 1 kcal/g unit increase of dietary ED using this method.  No associations were observed with the absolute dense breast volume (ADBV).  We also stratified the analysis by median childhood BMI-Z score and observed stronger associations with all three breast density measures and food-only dietary ED in women with a BMI-Z score above 0.2.  Overall, this research suggests that dietary ED, particularly from food alone, is associated with measures of breast density.\n\nThe objective of the second study was to examine the associations between dietary ED and measures of body fatness among young women.  Whole body percent fat as well as android and gynoid fat measurements were obtained via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and height (nearest 0.5 cm), weight (nearest 0.2 kg), and waist circumference (nearest 0.5 cm), were all obtained by trained study staff.  Individual linear mixed effects models were fit by maximum likelihood with robust standard error for each body fatness outcome.  After multivariate adjustment, each 1kcal/g unit increase in food-only dietary ED was significantly positively associated with several body fatness measures including BMI [0.59 kg/m2; \u03b2 (95% CI) = 0.59 (0.04 to 1.14), p=0.03)], whole body percent fat [2.08%; \u03b2 (95% CI) = 2.08 (0.63 to 3.53), p=0.005], android fat [3.38%; \u03b2 (95% CI) = 3.38 (2.26 to 4.50), p=<0.0001], gynoid fat [2.00%; \u03b2 (95% CI) = 2.00 (0.55 to 3.45), p=0.008], and the android:gynoid fat ratio [0.3; \u03b2 (95% CI) = 0.03 (0.01 to 0.05), p=0.007].  Food-only dietary ED was also positively associated with waist circumference; however, it did not reach statistical significance.  This could be due to the larger amount of error associated with waist circumference measurements.  There were no associations with dietary ED calculated with either food and caloric beverages or food and all beverages.  Overall, this research suggests that dietary ED from food alone is positively associated with several measures of body fatness. \n   \nIn our third study, the primary objective was to assess the relationship between a posteriori dietary patterns derived via finite mixture modeling (FMM) and measures of body fatness and breast density, as described above.  Finite mixture modeling, unlike other dietary pattern methodologies, does not restrict an individual to a particular dietary pattern, but rather each subject has a probability of belonging to one of the derived dietary patterns.  An individual\u2019s membership to a particular pattern was based on their highest respective posterior class-membership probability.  Dietary patterns were derived using complete dietary data from 203 subjects.  Five dietary patterns were derived and labeled based on the model-predicted servings of the 15 food groups in each of the intake patterns: \u201cWestern\u201d [n=21, (10.3%)], \u201cDietary Guidelines\u201d [n=40, (19.7%)], \u201cHealth Conscious\u201d [n=47, (23.2%), \u201cAlcohol and Vegetables\u201d[n=39, (19.2%)], and \u201cNon-Drinkers\u201d [n=56, 27.6%)].  Briefly, the \u201cDietary Guidelines\u201d pattern was the most consistent with the current 2010 Dietary Guidelines while the \u201cHealth Conscious\u201d pattern had mediocre diet quality (as evidenced by dietary ED), but had a low prevalence of smoking and the highest amounts of physical activity.  The \u201cAlcohol and Vegetables\u201d pattern had high intakes of alcohol (primarily beer and wine), healthy fats, and non-starchy vegetables.  The \u201cWestern\u201d pattern had high intakes of red and processed meats, sweets, and refined grains and finally, the \u201cNon-Drinker\u201d pattern consumed the lowest amount of alcohol.  Individual linear mixed effects models were fit by maximum likelihood with robust standard error for each body fatness or breast density outcome.  After multivariate adjustment, the \u201cDietary Guidelines\u201d had a significantly lower dietary ED from food alone and food and all beverages than all of the other patterns.  The \u201cWestern\u201d pattern had the most unfavorable diet and often the least favorable body fatness outcomes.  There were no associations with any of the dietary patterns and breast density measures except for a 34.7% (95% CI: 18.6 to 52.8, p=0.02) and 41.7% (95% CI: 26.7 to 58.5%, p=0.002) change in the ADBV in the \u201cNon-Drinker\u201d and \u201cAlcohol and Vegetables\u201d when compared to the \u201cDietary Guidelines\u201d pattern.\nIn conclusion, both dietary ED and dietary patterns were associated with body fatness and breast density, with the least healthful diets (High dietary ED from food-alone and the \u201cWestern\u201d dietary pattern) often having the most unfavorable body fatness and breast density outcomes.  Our research examines dietary profiles that may better aid in the development of future dietary recommendations.  Future research should include the examination of dietary change across childhood and adolescence and its influence on body fat and breast density in adulthood.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8703], "author_name_tesi": "Lindgren, Jessica Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Lindgren", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Dr Joanne Dorgan", "Jennifer Savage Williams", "Donna Coffman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Terryl Johnson Hartman, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Joanne Dorgan, Committee Member", "Jennifer Savage Williams, Committee Member", "Donna Coffman, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Breast density", "Body composition", "Breast cancer", "Diet", "Nutrition", "Premenopausal women"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "WHEN PUBLIC RADIO GOES PRIVATE: THE CONSEQUENCES OF PRIVATIZATION ON THE NPR NETWORK OF STATIONS", "id": "15999", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8073", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores the consequences of the privatization of National Public Radio for the NPR network of stations. In Chapter 1, I introduce the major questions posed by this dissertation and review some of its limitations. In Chapter 2, by analyzing the rates of stations\u2019 adoption of NPR membership and departure from the network, this research tests several hypotheses from literature on organizational population ecology, crowding in/out theory, and political composition. The results indicate that after an initial wave of departures from NPR in the wake of privatization, the NPR network of stations has continued to grow. At the same time, greater dependence on federal funding tends to be associated with more stability in the network of stations (fewer adoptions and departures), while business funding increases the rate of departures. These findings suggest that in the privatization era of reduced government funding, the NPR network of stations may operate more like a private marketplace. I also find that the concepts of the liability of newness, density delay, and density dependence while significantly shaping the dynamics of the organizational population\u2019s pattern of growth, must be significantly adapted to apply to adoptions and departures rather than organizational foundings and mortalities. Finally, the results suggest that, controlling for levels of government funding for the NPR network, Republican control of at least one house of Congress does little to increase the probability of the departure of any individual station, but were associated with higher rates of departures at the national level. Though further research is needed, this finding may suggest that Republican anti-NPR rhetoric creates unease throughout the system that discourages continued membership for stations.

Results showed that cohabiting parents had significantly lower psychological wellbeing, attended religious services significantly less, had more nontraditional views about parenting, and volunteered less often compared to married parents. Few duration differences between cohabiting and married parents were present, and the two that were statistically significant were in the direction of finding larger differences for those with the oldest children.\nChapter 3 used a sample of adolescents in Add Health to compare those in long-term stable biological cohabiting-parent families (n = 128) to those in long-term stable biological married-parent families (n = 9,101), unstable cohabiting families (n = 400), and unstable married families (n = 4,324).

The phyllomanganates within the birnessite family, for example, exhibit a diversity of Mn oxidation states, interlayer cations, water contents, and octahedral vacancy concentrations. These differences lead to subtle structural modifications that control the redox and cation exchange capacities of birnessite phases in soils, and they determine the usefulness of birnessites for environmental applications, such as the remediation of contaminant metals.  Although powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) can offer deep insights into birnessite crystallography, spectroscopic techniques provide complementary information when structural disorder is high. \n\nThis study introduces Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) as a method for analyzing birnessite varieties, coupling our analyses with synchrotron X-ray diffraction and absorption spectroscopy for comparison.  We found that FTIR can readily differentiate synthetic triclinic Na-birnessite and hexagonal H-birnessite.  The region from 400 to 750 cm-1, which is most sensitive to Mn-O bond vibrations, displays the most prominent distinctions between the two varieties, with peaks at ~418, ~478, and ~511 cm-1 in synthetic triclinic Na-birnessite, and peaks at ~440 and ~494 cm-1 in hexagonal H-birnessite.  Spectral unmixing of known mixtures of triclinic and hexagonal birnessite yielded errors comparable to results from linear combination fitting (LCF) of extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) data.  Spectral unmixing of synthetic cation-exchanged birnessites, including K-birnessite, Ba-birnessite, Ca-birnessite, and two hexagonal birnessite samples prepared in pH 3 and HEPES-buffered pH  7 solutions, also yielded fractions of triclinic and hexagonal birnessite comparable to those calculated by LCF of EXAFS data.  Our EXAFS, FTIR, and Rietveld refinements of XRD data all confirmed that as Mn3+ content increases, the triclinic character of the birnessite also increases, as manifested by an increase in the \u03b2 angle and in the length of the a-axis of the unit cell.\n\nWith these synthetic samples providing a baseline for comparison, natural birnessite samples next were interrogated using the same suite of techniques.  Contrary to the common assumption that most natural birnessites are hexagonal, our FTIR and EXAFS investigations revealed natural birnessite varieties as either triclinic or hexagonal or, most commonly, a mixture of the two.  Further, this work demonstrates that the use of biological buffers such as HEPES and MES can promote the transformation of synthetic triclinic Na-birnessite into hexagonal H-birnessite, perhaps accounting for the presumption of hexagonal symmetry in natural biogenic samples.  When our EXAFS and FTIR analyses were combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data in an allied study (Ilton et al. 2016), a relation between Mn3+ content in birnessite and deviations from hexagonal symmetry appeared, suggesting that when Mn3+ exceeds ~25 mol% in birnessite, Jahn-Teller distortions couple, and the resultant strains generate structures with triclinic symmetry.\nIn order to connect birnessite crystal chemistry with reactivity, we examined dissolved Pb uptake into synthetic triclinic Na- and hexagonal H-birnessite at pH 3 and pH 5 using ~6 hr time-resolved XRD and 112-day batch experiments.  We found that Pb sorbs onto the surface of birnessite and into the interlayer, with uptake occurring in the interlayer even after 14 days.  In hexagonal H-birnessite the ratio of the (1 0 0) to (1 0 -1) peaks increased as Pb exchanged into the interlayer, as expected from our diffraction simulations.  Triclinic Na-birnessite transformed into a turbostratically disordered hexagonal H-birnessite during uptake at pH 3 and pH 5 due to the relative instability of triclinic birnessite at pH < 8.2.  As a consequence of this transformation, both triclinic Na-birnessite and hexagonal H-birnessite sequestered similar amounts of Pb after 112 days.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12904], "author_name_tesi": "Ling, Florence T", "last_name_ssi": "Ling", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Florence", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J.

Hafnium and rhenium are both alloying elements in the nickel-based superalloys which are extensively used in the aerospace industry due to high creep and oxidation resistance.    Nickel-based superalloys typically contain many alloying materials in addition to Hf and Re; therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the complex phase equilibria of this multi-component system becomes necessary.  However, an empirical approach is both time consuming and costly.  A more efficient approach is the CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams) method where a complete thermodynamic database is predicted through the summation of the thermodynamic properties of individual phases.  In the absence of experimental data, first-principles calculations can be used to predict thermochemical data.\nThe Hf-Re binary system has three intermetallic compounds, two of which show solubility ranges.  SQS (Special Quasirandom Structure) calculations are performed on the bcc and hcp solid solution phases to predict the enthalpies of mixing.  SQS calculations are also performed on the Hf-Zr and Re-Zr binary systems, the latter of which strongly resembles the Hf-Re system.

To promote its own propagation, RSV has evolved mechanisms to evade cell antiviral responses.  The interferon (IFN) system plays an important role in inducing cell antiviral responses and limiting virus spread at early infection.  The nonstructural proteins of RSV NS1 and NS2 have been shown to inhibit both IFN production and IFN signaling.  However, the mechanism is unknown.  In our study, we defined the IFN induction pathway that NS1 and NS2 inhibit.  Moreover, we provided evidence to show the mechanism of NS2 IFN antagonism.  We found that NS1 and NS2 inhibit both retinoic acid inducible gene - I (RIG-I) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) mediated IFN induction, but in a different manner.  NS1 blocked RIG-I and TLR3 mediated IFN production at the level of IFN regulatory factor -3 (IRF-3) kinases, Tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I&#954;B kinase &#949; (IKK&#949;) or downstream. NS2 inhibited TLR3 mediated IFN production at the level of TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-&#946; (TRIF) or downstream, while it inhibited the RIG-I pathway at the level of RIG-I.  In addition, we found that NS2 interacted with RIG-I at the N-terminus of RIG-I (N-RIG).  We also found that NS2 disrupted the interaction between N-RIG and downstream mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), suggesting that NS2 inhibits RIG-I mediated IFN production by binding to RIG-I and blocking the RIG-I-MAVS interaction.\nWhile we were studying the IFN antagonism of NS2, we found that NS2 induced transcriptional factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-&#954;B) activation.  This phenomenon is consistent with published studies in which Akt (also known as protein kinase B, PKB) and NF-&#954;B were shown to be activated by RSV infection and the activation was reduced when NS2 was knocked down by siRNA.  Therefore, we investigated the role of Akt in NS2-induced NF-&#954;B activation.  We found that blockade of Akt with inhibitor or dominant negative form of Akt reduced NS2-induced NF-&#954;B activation, suggesting that NS2 activates NF-&#954;B through Akt.  Subsequent analysis showed that NS2 led to the phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308.  Akt is activated mostly in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) dependent manner.  We observed that PI3K inhibitor treatment had no effect on NS2-induced NF-&#954;B activation, indicating that NS2 activates NF-&#954;B independent of PI3K.  Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiment indicated that NS2 interacted with Akt, suggesting that Akt plays an important role for NS2-mediated NF-&#954;B acitivation.  Finally, we identified two amino acid residues in NS2 that are required for NF-&#954;B induction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6974], "author_name_tesi": "Ling, Zhenhua ", "last_name_ssi": "Ling", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhenhua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Teng", "Michael N Teng", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Avery August", "Biao He", "Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Richard John Frisque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Teng, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael N Teng, Committee Chair", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Biao He, Committee Member", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["RSV", "NS1", "NS2", "interferon"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Temperature-Aware Computing\n", "id": "7038", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2078", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the future, the peak temperature of a chip will be a primary design constraint. Higher temperatures can accelerate various chip failure mechanisms, reducing the lifetime of the system. These high temperatures also place additional burden on cooling systems, which must prevent thermal runaways due to increased standby power consumption. Consequently, temperature must be considered in the earliest phases of the design process. Many existing thermal management techniques focus on reducing the overall power consumption of the chip by throttling performance, eventually resulting in an overall reduction in chip temperature. These techniques, while effective, often do not address location-specific temperature problems referred to as hotspots. Recent research into hotspots has shown that different functional units in general purpose processors can have significantly different temperature profiles, and that moving workloads between units can reduce the creation of hotspots on the die. \n\n\nUsing a newly developed thermal analysis tool, HS3d, this work explores the thermal profile of modern processor architectures, and discusses the types and characteristics of hotspots in future technologies, as process variation, multi-core design, and multi-wafer stacking techniques become prevalent. Means of mitigating these hotspots are presented, including workload migration for homogenous architectures, and means of reducing hotspots near the integer ALU. One proposed method, integer offloading to floating-point, redirects integer operations to the floating-point hardware, slightly increasing latency and power consumption, but distributing heat more evenly across the die. . Finally, a model of the impact of temperature on circuit timing is presented, and the impact of temperature gradients on multi-core processors is explored, showing that by the 45nm technology node, thermally-induced timing variations of 5% per 10 degrees C  are possible. Traditional worst-case design techniques, which assume a single high temperature for the entire device, can therefore not take full advantage of the much more common typical-case conditions. This thesis discusses how thermal-aware design can be incorporated into the automated design flow, allowing variable frequency systems to achieve maximal performance across a wide operating range.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2060], "author_name_tesi": "Link, Greg ", "last_name_ssi": "Link", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Greg", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Chitaranjan Das", "Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Member", "Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["design automation", "architecture", "thermal", "Temperature", "hotspot", "hot spot"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "AESTHETICS IN AN EXPANDED FIELD:\nTOWARDS A PERFORMATIVE MODEL OF ART, EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE", "id": "6055", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2523", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-03-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Professor Yvonne M.

This is achieved by recasting the aesthetic as a second order performative phenomenon \u2013 that which is illocutionary in any sensory experience, social interaction or utterance (Austin,1962, Deleuze and Guattari,1987). With the aesthetic understood as such, art becomes a way of knowing and doing which may function analogically relative to all other facets of human experience and endeavor. The aesthetic \u2013 the illocutionary \u2013 may be understood as the motive force infusing all socio-cultural relations and productions.\n\nChapter two defines the performative in the context of photography; a visual medium which may be analogically compared to the arts in general. Chapters three and four extend the performative conception to classroom teaching specifically and education generally. We do not merely teach young people what it means to be members of our society, we engage in an endless performative process \u2013 an aesthetic process \u2013  of defining that society and identifying the consequences of citizenship. The classroom is therefore a societas (Oakeshott 1975) in miniature, in which students are engaged in research; the aesthetically fueled relations which form our socio-cultural conventions and knowledge (Goodman, 1976, 1978, Ingram, 1995, Kuhn, 1970, Laclau and Mouffe, 1985, Rorty, 1989). Chapter three draws its analogy between art production and scientific research and extends that analogy to the studio art classroom.\n\nChapter four imagines an educational apparatus which has shifted its theoretical base from the currently dominant \u201cforms of knowledge\u201d paradigm (Hirst, 1974) to a poststructural, relational, performative model. Existing art education paradigms \u2013 DBAE (Clark, Day and Greer, 1987) for example \u2013 are as rooted in the forms of knowledge theory as any other academic discipline and would be altered as fundamentally as any other discipline under such a paradigm shift.

The safety practices of interest included safety communication, hazard control, and safety training.  Each of these variables was measured in terms of their impact on the employee, either in terms of perception or awareness levels.  A secondary purpose of this study was to determine the impact of these same practices upon both the incidence of safety-related events and employee job satisfaction. \n\nThis study used secondary data that was originally collected using a survey administered to employees of a surface mining company.  Several regression models were constructed by alternating each safety practice as an independent variable and either risk tolerance or safety-related events as the dependent variable.  Control variables in the form of demographic data and employee job perceptions were held constant within each regression.  It was hypothesized that each independent variable would be significantly related to both risk tolerance and safety-related events.  These hypotheses were formed partially based upon the concept of social exchange theory, wherein employees have been shown to respond positively if they feel the employer is concerned with their needs and interests.  A separate regression was completed in order to examine the relationship between employer safety practices and employee job satisfaction.\n\nThe results of this study detected a significant relationship between employee perceptions of safety communication and individual risk tolerance.  Safety communication was found to account for 9.7% of the variance in risk tolerance.  Employee perceptions of hazard control and employee safety awareness were not found to be significantly related to risk tolerance.  In addition, no significant relationships were detected between any of the three independent variables and safety-related events.  Lastly, a significant relationship was found between employee perceptions of safety communication, employee perceptions of hazard control, and employee job satisfaction.

Although surgical resection can be curative, 80-85% of PDAC patients are not candidates for surgical resection. Chemotherapy with gemcitabine or 5-FU, although largely ineffective and hampered by dose-limiting toxicities, is the only treatment option for most patients.\nNanoparticle-encapsulation of chemotherapeutic agents has been shown to improve drug delivery and reduce off-target effects. Our research team has designed, synthesized, and tested a novel drug nanocarrier, calcium phosphosilicate nanoparticles (CPSNPs). CPSNPs were loaded with FdUMP, the active, phosphorylated metabolite of 5-fluorouracil, or gemcitabine monophosphate, a bioactive analogue of gemcitabine. Drug-loaded CPSNPs were surface-decorated with DNA aptamers which bind to the CCKB receptor. Aptamer-targeted CPSNPs showed enhanced delivery of FdUMP payloads to mice bearing orthotopic pancreatic tumors, as evidenced by a significant reduction in thymidylate synthase, the FdUMP target enzyme. This work demonstrated that aptamer-targeted CPSNPs can selectively deliver active drug to tumors in vivo. Targeted drug delivery has the potential to enhance efficacy of chemotherapeutics and simultaneously reduce toxicity.\nThe PDAC tumor microenvironment (TME) is comprised of multiple cell types, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Tumor cells, TAMs, and other TME cell types are in constant communication. One way in which cells communicate is through exosomes, the body\u2019s endogenous nanoparticles. Although much is known about exosomal proteins and nucleic acids, including mRNA and miRNA, relatively few studies have addressed the lipid component of exosomes.\nWe compared the lipid composition of exosomes from various PDAC cell lines and from normal pancreatic ductal cells (HPDE).

This dissertation sheds light on factors related to locational attainment and the health consequences of locational attainment during the transition to adulthood with three studies. The first and second studies examine how combinations of key life transitions coincide with the locational attainments of young women and men as they enter young adulthood. The third study investigates how moving into, out of, or remaining in (non)poor neighborhoods is associated with persistent and onset obesity between adolescence and young adulthood. I draw upon data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, or Add Health. Results of the first study show that young women who bypass college and enter adulthood via family-oriented transitions are the most likely to consistently live in poor neighborhood and move from nonpoor to poor neighborhoods, while women whose transition sets feature delayed family formation and involvement with postsecondary education or employment are the most likely to never live in poor neighborhoods. Findings from the second study show that young men whose transitions to adulthood involve higher education and delayed employment and family formation are at the greatest risk for moving from nonpoor to poor neighborhoods in young adulthood, but those who rapidly enter full-time employment, marriage, and parenthood face a strong chance of consistently living in\niv\npoor neighborhoods. Finally, results from the third study show that young women, but not men, who consistently live in poor neighborhoods are more likely to be consistently obese between adolescence and young adulthood and to become obese by young adulthood than women who never lived in poor neighborhoods.

Typically artists have been motivated to participate in the paragone during crises, such as changes to the hierarchy of the arts, shifting aesthetic theories, cultural and social changes to the artist's status, personal doubt, or political activism and patriotic endeavours. This dissertation addresses the lack of scholarship addressing the paragone's survival in the nineteenth century.\nRapid changes to the nineteenth-century art world contributed to the paragone's significance in this century especially. The shifting aesthetic theories and ideologies of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, the Acad\u00e9mie des beaux-arts, and the \u00c9cole des beaux-arts resulted in the great instability of artistic genres, and waning respect for traditional artistic institutions, such as the Salon, thereby affecting both professional and public opinion regarding art's value. Moreover, the intensification and rise of art criticism made visual artists vulnerable to writers in increasingly threatening ways. As well, the writings of aesthetic theorists represented a trend that affected the paragone's survival in the nineteenth century; there was an increasing movement in aesthetic theory, beginning in late eighteenth century, to impose either ideological or practical limits on the arts. This movement escalated rebelliousness amongst certain artists, who sought to prove their clever genius and the superiority of their art forms, by breaking their supposed limits.\nThrough my analysis of hegemonic artistic practice, my research has led to the discovery of motifs or subjects that are often evidence of the paragone manifested in a particular piece. My dissertation will begin with an examination of the proliferation of the beau id\u00e9al, or mastery of the human figure's ideal representation in painting or sculpture, which was, (since the Renaissance), indicative of artistic skill, and remained a signifier of artistic supremacy in early to mid-nineteenth-century art. Since antiquity, the mythological account of Narcissus, (the young man who falls in love with his own image, because of his astounding beauty), has represented the power of masculine beauty to entrance its viewers. This tradition, which paralleled the cult of male beauty propagated in Greek art, was inherited by nineteenth-century artists in the form of the beau id\u00e9al.\niii\nEven though portrayals of the beau id\u00e9al recurred throughout the nineteenth century, the early preference for male figures was matched, by the mid-nineteenth century, to greater interest in the female nude. In particular, the Pygmalion myth became emblematic of the ultimate mastery of the nude figure in art; Ovid's account of Pygmalion in his Metamorphoses epitomised the crux of the paragone debate at this time. In this myth the sculptor Pygmalion, symbolic of the archetypal artist, creates a figure of a woman that in turn represents the ultimate artistic creation; she is so beautiful that he entreats Venus to bring her to life. This myth speaks to the image's power over the viewer, and therefore to the power of the visual arts. The final subject explores the legacy of Gustave Moreau's versions of Salom\u00e9, which engendered a host of competitive responses to his portrayal of this subject, such that Salom\u00e9 became a signifier of artistic rivalry, as much as she was of the femme fatale. I will also explore a new interpretation of Salom\u00e9 that emerged in the nineteenth century that heightened her visual and iconic impact on viewers. The narrative features of the Salom\u00e9 subject made it an ideal source for paragonising artists. As a symbol of sensual and material beauty, she mirrored the material and decorative nature of the Aesthetic and decadent movements in the arts at this time.\nMy research offers an interpretational tool that may be used by other scholars with respect to the examination of individual artists or writers, while providing a basis for further studies in this framework. Demonstrating the topic's ultimate potential is one of the most important scholars in the field: W.J.T. Mitchell. In his Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology, Mitchell addresses the paragone's importance to scholarship, and shows how its fundamental concerns continue to be played out by successive generations of artists, even in technological media, which is an indication of its relevance to a broad range of study in the humanities, including not only art history but theory and criticism, western literature, film studies, and the fine arts. My dissertation, however, focuses on the actual implementation of a paragonising artistic theory in artworks throughout the nineteenth century. In so doing it strengthens scholarly understanding of the themes, artists, and works addressed, while demonstrating the importance of acknowledging artistic competition.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5614], "author_name_tesi": "Lippert, Sarah Jordan", "last_name_ssi": "Lippert", "middle_name_ssi": "Jordan", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brian A Curran", "Brian A Curran", "Elizabeth Walters", "Jeanne Chenault Porter", "Sylvia E Neely"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brian A Curran, Dissertation Advisor", "Brian A Curran, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth Walters, Committee Member", "Jeanne Chenault Porter, Committee Member", "Sylvia E Neely, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["paragone", "artistic rivalry", "Narcissus", "Pygmalion", "Galatea", "Medusa", "Salome", "Gustave Moreau", "Edward Burne-Jones", "Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson", "Jean-Leon Gerome", "Aubrey Beardsley"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "parental Monitoring and Early Adolescent Risky Behavior: A Person-oriented Approach\n", "id": "15141", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7452", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation uses person-oriented methods to explore the relationships between specific patterns of parental monitoring-related behaviors and youth risky behavior.  Most studies, to date, have used variable-oriented methods to isolate the effects of one specific monitoring behavior on youth outcomes.

Therefore, person-oriented strategies that identify specific combinations of behavior and integrate multiple reporters may more closely resemble the monitoring process as it occurs in natural family settings.\n\nThe first cross-sectional study, uses a sample of 796 6th graders in rural communities and small towns to identify latent classes using mother and youth reports of maternal knowledge, active parent monitoring efforts, youth disclosure, supervision, and the amount of parent-youth communication.  Five latent classes were identified:  High-Monitors, Maternal Over-Estimators, Low-Monitors, Communication-Focused, and Supervision-Focused when youth were in the sixth grade.  Problem behavior and strained parent-youth relationships were associated with increased odds of membership in the Low Monitors, Maternal Over-Estimators, and Supervision-Focused class, relative to the High Monitors. The discussion focuses on the value of using a person-oriented approach with multiple reporters to study patterns of monitoring behaviors in early adolescence.\n\nIn Study #2, these analyses are extended longitudinally over the middle school period using Latent Transition Analysis to 1.)  identify latent patterns of parental monitoring-related behaviors occurring in mother-youth dyads during middle school and 2.) investigate how changes in monitoring patterns are associated with youth substance use in Grade 6 and substance use initiation from Grade 6 to 8.  Using a sample of 536 rural dyads (the longitudinal cases from Study #1), , mother and youth reports of parental knowledge, active parent monitoring efforts, youth disclosure, supervision, and parent-youth communication were used to identify six latent patterns of monitoring across grade 6-8: High-Monitors, Low Monitors, Communication-Focused, Supervision-Focused, Maternal Over-Estimators, and Youth Over-Estimators. The initiation of alcohol, smoking, and marijuana was significantly associated with transitions between patterns of monitoring.   Initiation of alcohol and smoking was associated with increased odds of transition into the Low Monitors from the Communication-Focused, Supervision-Focused, and Maternal Over-Estimators, relative to remaining in the same status. The discussion focuses on the contributions of a person-oriented approach to study changes in monitoring-related behaviors over the middle school period. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7398], "author_name_tesi": "Lippold, Melissa Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Lippold", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark T Greenberg", "Susan Mc Hale", "Linda Marie Collins", "J Douglas Coatsworth", "Elizabeth Farmer", "Steven Howard Zarit", "Mark T Greenberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark T Greenberg, Committee Chair", "Susan Mc Hale, Committee Member", "Linda Marie Collins, Committee Member", "J Douglas Coatsworth, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Farmer, Committee Member", "Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Member", "Mark T Greenberg, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["parental monitoring", "parenting", "problem behavior"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "\"Critical Desire\" and the Feminist Other of Critical Theory", "id": "5891", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4091", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-08-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\nThis dissertation explores how desire poses an inescapable, if often under articulated, challenge for all critical political projects that not only seek to interpret the world, but also \u201cto change it.\u201d  The effort to shape this future political space, however, carries the social theorist towards dangerous terrain.  In a century that has witnessed the noble futures promised by Hitler, Stalin, and Pol Pot collapse into totalitarian horror, this link between critical social theory and its utopian aspirations cannot be ignored.  Thus, the critical theorist can no longer avoid thinking through and against the authoritarian necessity borne by the desire for an alternative to the current socio-political order.  By extension, one is enjoined to theorize about the desire for identity, whether individually, collectively, or meta-politically, in ways that already call that desire into question. \nMy dissertation explores this general tension within critical theory \u2013 between the longing for identity and its dangers \u2013 by taking up a specific instance of its application: the possibilities and limits encountered by a male heterosexual writing about women and feminism.  That relationship is a complex one: any male who addresses women, regardless of his sympathy for their interests, runs the risk of reinscribing the paternalist oversight that feminism has sought to escape.  For the heterosexual, this threat is doubled by the control implicit in his seemingly natural desire and love for women.  The general problem of how the critical theorist might enact his or her necessary desire is given an exemplary specification: how might men who sympathize with the goals of feminism comport themselves towards women?  \nThis dissertation explores this question through what might be called a philosophical case study: I trace the force of desire in Nietzsche\u2019s life and work.  Reading Nietzsche in the context of the different desires (biographical, physiological, philosophical, etc.) that traverse, inflect, and expand beyond his texts, Nietzsche suggests how we might rethink desire as a confluence of forces that precedes and disrupts the fiction of the ego.  His comparison of \u201cwoman\u201d to the \u201ctruth\u201d that always remains beyond our grasp allows us to conceptualize desire as a difference that always remains \u201cother\u201d to our experience.  Nietzsche\u2019s thought thus breaks up the monological obsessions of critical theory, opening up a space in its thought that militates against any final, and thus potentially authoritarian, set of political conclusions.  Ironically, given his famous misogyny, Nietzsche\u2019s thought has thus proven exemplary for feminist efforts to theorize a post-identitarian notion of feminist solidarity.  These Nietzschean inflected feminisms, in turn, serve as powerful disruptions of the notions of consensus that underwrite some of our most powerful descriptions of a normatively admirable liberal politics.  Without such interruptions, such consensus always runs the risk of excluding concrete, embodied others from the public forms of political participation at which these forms of liberalism putatively aim. \n \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4069], "author_name_tesi": "Lipscomb, Michael E.", "last_name_ssi": "Lipscomb", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Stephen K White", "Dr Nancy S Love", "Eric Plutzer", "Robert Emmett O'connor", "Charles Edward Scott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Stephen K White, Special Member", "Dr Nancy S Love, Committee Chair", "Eric Plutzer, Committee Member", "Robert Emmett O'connor, Committee Member", "Charles Edward Scott, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Other", "Nietzsche", "feminism", "desire"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Themes of Reform: State Government Reengineering Efforts through Fiscal Crisis and Agenda Setting \u2013 2007 to 2012", "id": "17385", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8403", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The economic recession from 2007 to 2009, also known as the Great Recession, and its post-recessionary period of tepid economic recovery through 2012, helped jump-start a national conversation in state capitals throughout the country on reforming state government. The fiscal challenges presented to state lawmakers to balance budgets in the wake of historic declines in revenue while equally historic demand of benefits offered by social safety net programs provided the focusing event and window of opportunity by which state governments sought to reengineer, redesign, reorganize, and reform the size, scope, services, systems, programs and processes of state government. \nThis study maps a typology of governance reform undertaken at the state level during and in the immediate aftermath of the economic recession of 2007. It applies multiple streams as a heuristic device for explaining the context and focus of state reform commissions. The study examines the individual reform efforts by states to articulate and synthesize the broader government reform themes against the backdrop of new budget realities and fiscal pressures.\nApplying a qualitative research design methodology that utilizes content analysis, the research presents a descriptive model for state government reform commissions between 2007 and 2012. Reform proposals by state government commissions chartered to study government programs, systems, workforce costs, structures, policies, and political arrangements clustered around three broad typological groupings: People, Relationships, and Processes. A fourth grouping, Public Values, was integrated as a common thread found throughout each of the other three groupings, used by state taskforces and committees with dual informational and influencing roles as a mechanism to explain, and in turn, champion support for governmental reform proposals.\nTitled the People, Relationships, Processes\u2013Values (PRP-V) model, it identifies the thematic accretion of state government reform initiatives proposed to deal with the fiscal constraints following the national recession from 2007 to 2009 and in its wake through 2012.

It is the goal of the Mala&#373;i government to preserve and conserve this resource, but effective fishery management plans cannot be developed because species descriptions are still lacking.  Part of my research focused on fish identified as Tramitichromis (an important food fish) in the southeast arm of Lake Mala&#373;i.  Based upon suggestive evidence in a collection of works (see bibliography in this thesis) by Konings, Turner, numerous publications by Stauffer along with various other authors, and personal communications of Konings and Stauffer, I hypothesized that there were at least three undescribed species.\nCollections of fish from the Pennsylvania State University and the Museum of Natural History, London were examined.  I examined each collection in the laboratory and reexamined the identity of the fish based on the keys in Tramitichromis.  A subset of fish was chosen out of each collection and lower pharyngeal bones dissected, and then used to verify the species.  Fishes that could not be identified were grouped together based on some phenotypic character(s).  Twenty-four morphometric and fourteen meristic data points were collected per fish.  Differences in body shape were analyzed using sheared principal components analysis (SPCA) of the morphometric data.  Differences among species were illustrated by plotting the sheared components of the morphometric data against the principal components of the meristic data in order to maximize the amount of separation.  If the mean multivariate scores of the clusters formed by the plots were significantly different along one axis, independent of the other axis, a Duncan\u2019s multiple range test (p<0.05) was used to determine which clusters differed from each other.  If not, then a MANOVA, in conjunction with a Hotelling-Lawley trace, was used (p<0.05).\nCollections in the 1920s and 1930s allowed Trewavas to describe many new species of Lethrinops and place Haplochromis brevis into the Lethrinops based on buccal dentition.  In 1935, Trewavas added one new species, Lethrinops intermedia.  In 1989 Eccles and Trewavas placed all Lethrinops that possessed a keel into Tramitichromis.  Tramitichromis is rediagnosed by the presence of a solid diagonal band that runs from the nape to the caudal peduncle, a significantly different body shape (e.g. a shorter caudal peduncle, longer vertical eye diameter, longer lower jaw, and fewer gill rakers on the outer ceratobranchial), and the use of a rock in cone shaped bowers constructed by breeding males.  Tramitichromis brevis is retained in the genus.  The remaining species currently in Tramitichromis are moved to a new genus.  Six previously undescribed species that have variations in their lower pharyngeal bone, body pattern, and/or shape are described.\nBower building is the manifestation of a behavioral trait and is being used to diagnose species.  Another research objective was to determine if it was possible to test bower-building behavior in a laboratory setting, and give comments and suggestions for future research.  I had also hoped to provide some anecdotal evidence of the heritability of bower building.  Comparisons to an analysis of a previous bower building study showing overlap between genetic and bower (behavioral) data were made as well.  A new study for three of the new species was conducted which showed a different bower shape for each of the three species.  This is significant because it supports the use of the bower building behavior as a taxonomic tool and shows correlation between morphological data and bower building (behavioral) data.  Comments on the feasibility of laboratory studies of bower building are made where it was determined that an extremely large pool was needed with a high stocking density and a ratio of 7 males to 2 females.\n \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4307], "author_name_tesi": "Lisy, Matthew R.", "last_name_ssi": "Lisy", "middle_name_ssi": "R.", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr.", "C Paola Ferreri", "Ke Chung Kim", "Ganapati P Patil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr., Committee Chair", "C Paola Ferreri, Committee Member", "Ke Chung Kim, Committee Member", "Ganapati P Patil, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tramitichromis", "Lake Malawi", "cichlid", "bower"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Sentential codeswitching and cognate triggering: A neurocognitive study", "id": "19849", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9450", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A unique feature of bilingual speech is that bilinguals often produce utterances that switch between languages, such as \u201cI ate huevos para el desayuno [eggs for breakfast]\u201d. While this switching occurs frequently in bilingual conversations, most neurocognitive research on language switching has actually focused on the switching of isolated, unrelated items. These studies have found that switching incurs a processing cost that is greater when switching into the dominant language, due to inhibition of the dominant language while processing the weaker language and the subsequent release of inhibition upon encountering a dominant language item. However, true codeswitching is language switching embedded in a larger, meaningful linguistic context, which may affect the processing of the switch. The few previous studies of sentential codeswitching also indicate a processing cost, but remain less clear on the possible asymmetry of this effect. The present study examined the comprehension of sentential codeswitching behaviorally using a self-paced reading paradigm (Experiment 1) and neurocognitively using event-related potentials (ERPs; Experiment 2) in Spanish-English bilinguals who codeswitch frequently in their daily life. The bilinguals read sentences that either contained a codeswitch or not, in both language switching directions. Reading times were longer for codeswitched, as compared to non-switched, sentences but this effect only appeared when switching from the dominant to weaker language. No effect was found for the reverse language switch, from the weaker to the dominant language. ERP results mirrored this pattern, with switches into the weaker language incurring a larger late positivity than non-switched sentences, and no differences when switching into the dominant language. These results indicate that meaningful sentential codeswitches do not rely on inhibition of the dominant language, but require sentence-level integration mechanisms related to the activation of the weaker language.\nThese two studies explored the mechanisms underlying the processing of sentential codeswitches. Experiment 3 focused on testing a linguistic theory, the triggering theory, which proposed a possible mechanism for why codeswitches occur. The triggering theory states that codeswitches are more likely to occur when in proximity to trigger words. Trigger words are words that activate both languages, such as cognates (words that share both form and meaning across languages, e.g., piano/piano in English and Spanish). Given the large psycholinguistic literature showing that cognates are often responded to faster than noncognates, we predicted that the presence of a cognate trigger would reduce the processing costs associated with codeswitching. In a self-paced reading task, Spanish-English bilinguals read codeswitched sentences that either contained a cognate trigger or a noncognate control word. A cognate facilitation effect was found in the weaker language, but there was no modulation at the point of the codeswitch in either language switching direction. Thus, cognate triggering does appear not influence the processing of sentential codeswitching in this paradigm.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9242], "author_name_tesi": "Litcofsky, Kaitlyn Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Litcofsky", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Kaitlyn", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adriana Van Hell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adriana Van Hell, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["codeswitching", "bilingualism", "psycholinguistics", "ERPs"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Effect of Discourse Context on Sentence Comprehension and Production Using Cross-Modality Structural Priming: Evidence from Monologue and Dialogue with Native- and Foreign-Accented Speakers", "id": "14685kal378", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14685", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Everyday language use consists of communication through dialogue. In one turn of a dialogue, one individual uses speech to convey their thoughts and the other individual listens to that speech signal to understand its meaning. On the next dialogue turn, the order of events is reversed. Thus, every speaker is also a listener, and every listener a speaker. Despite the prevalence of conversation in daily life, most psycholinguistic models and research only focus on language processing in monologue situations, and target production and comprehension separately. When dialogue is addressed, the speaker and listener are often assumed to be separate individuals. However, recent theories have postulated that the production and comprehension actually share underlying processing mechanisms and representations and are linked across individuals (Dell & Chang, 2014; MacDonald, 2013; Pickering & Garrod, 2004; 2013a). Chapter 2 will extend this hypothesis to test whether production and comprehension are also linked within an individual. Participants engaged in speaking and listening by describing pictures and listening to sentences in two cross-modality structural priming tasks of active and passive sentences. Comprehension-to- Production priming was measured in three ways: syntactic choice (proportion of passive descriptions), response time, and average syllable duration. Production-to-Comprehension priming was measured using event-related potentials (ERPs). Priming was found in both tasks: in production, priming was found in terms of syntactic choice, where a higher proportion of passives were produced following passive, than active primes, and in comprehension, priming was found in terms of a reduced N400 to primed, as compared to unprimed, passive target sentences. Thus, Chapter 2 developed a novel cross-modality priming paradigm involving EEG and supports the ideas that production and comprehension are linked within an individual and share aspects of processing, as predicted by recent theories (Dell & Chang, 2014; MacDonald, 2013; Pickering & Garrod, 2004; 2013a).\nChapter 3 extended the paradigm of Chapter 2 to investigate speaking and listening in a\ndialogue context to determine whether alignment between interlocutors resonates to alignment between production and comprehension within an individual. In addition, to capture some of the variation in natural conversation, Chapter 3 investigated how social factors, here accent, impact the relationship between production and comprehension within an individual. Adding the confederate-scripted technique to the cross-modality structural priming paradigm used in Chapter 2, the relationship between production and comprehension was examined in two dialogue contexts: with a native speaker (Experiment 1) and with a foreign-accented speaker (Experiment 2). Participants completed the same two cross-modality priming tasks as in Chapter 2, but this time interacted with a native-speaking or foreign-accented confederate. Comprehension to production priming, in terms of syntactic choice, was found in both experiments, though it decreased over time in dialogue with a foreign-accented speaker. Production to comprehension priming was found in dialogue with a native-accented speaker in terms of a reduced N400 that was most prominent in the second half of the experiment, but no evidence of priming into comprehension was found in dialogue with a foreign-accented speaker. These results suggest that the influence of between-individual alignment on within-individual alignment only emerges once the interlocutors get to know each other and that structural alignment depends on the accent of the interlocutor. All together, these studies present a novel methodology to study language processing in a more ecologically valid way while maintaining tight experimental control and suggest that individuals\u2019 language processing varies based on dialogue context and social factors such as accent.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15770], "author_name_tesi": "Litcofsky, Kaitlyn Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Litcofsky", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Kaitlyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janet G Van Hell", "Janet G Van Hell", "Judith F Kroll", "Koraly Perez-Edgar", "Carrie N Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janet G Van Hell, Dissertation Advisor", "Janet G Van Hell, Committee Chair", "Judith F Kroll, Committee Member", "Koraly Perez-Edgar, Committee Member", "Carrie N Jackson, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dialogue", "Comprehension and Production", "Foreign-Accented Speech", "Cross-Modal Structural Priming", "Psycholinguistics", "Cognitive Psychology"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF DAMPING CHARACTERISTICS OF POLYMERIC COMPOSITES CONTAINING CARBON NANOTUBES\n\n", "id": "10144", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "582", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in exploring the damping characteristics of carbon nanotube (CNT) based materials, such as densely packed CNT thin films and polymeric composites with dispersed CNT fillers.  The unique features that make carbon nanotubes ideal fillers for high performance damping composites are their large surface area, large aspect ratio, high stiffness, low density, and high thermal conductivity characteristics.  Some theoretical study on the damping characteristics of CNT-based composites has been initiated but not yet explored in depth.  This thesis aims to advance the state-of-art of the damping characteristics of polymeric composites containing well dispersed, aligned or randomly oriented carbon nanotubes.\nFirst, a micromechanical damping model is proposed to address the damping properties of composites containing dilute, aligned or randomly oriented nanotubes.  The composite is modeled as a three-phase system composed of a resin, a resin sheath, and MWNTs or SWNT ropes.  The resin is described as a viscoelastic material using the three-element standard solid model.  The concept of stick-slip motion caused by interfacial friction is applied to the interfaces of the nanotubes and the resin as well as between nanotubes.  The overall loss factor, which combines the stick-slip motion and the contribution of viscoelastic material, is calculated through cycles of harmonic loading.  Numerical analysis on composites with aligned nanoropes shows that the damping ability of the composites increases with a small addition of nanotubes.  If the magnitude of the applied stress is large enough to cause complete sliding at the interface, compared to the viscoelastic material, the stick-slip friction is the main contribution for the total loss factor of the CNT-based composites.  The loss factor from stick-slip motion and the total loss factor are both stress-dependent.  The inter-tube and SWNT/sheath shear strengths play an important role on the onset and completion of the debonding at the interface.  The volume fraction of the CNT ropes and the aspect ratio of the CNT have significant effects on the maximum loss factor over the entire stress range and the applied stress magnitude when the maximum value is achieved.\nTo advance the state of the art and derive an effective tool that can be used to synthesize any polymeric damping material with carbon nanotubes, a multiscale approach is proposed.  It can characterize the CNT interfacial strength at the molecular/atomic level, the stick-slip phenomena at the microscopic level and the material damping feature for macroscopic applications.  In this sequential multiscale model, the interfacial shear strengths between the nanotube ropes and between the nanotube and the resin are first calculated from a pull-out test with molecular dynamics simulation.  The calculated shear strength values are then applied to the micromechanical model to predict the damping ability of the composites.  Both soft polyethylene matrix and hard epoxy resin are investigated.  It is observed that with only van der Waals force, the interaction between the nanotube and the resin in both matrices is weaker than that between nanotube ropes.  \nThe effect of carbon nanotube functionalization on the interfacial shear strength as well as the damping feature of the composites is also explored.  Analysis results indicate significant increase of the interfacial shear strength by only adding functional groups to less than 1% carbon atoms in the CNT.  The optimal damping properties of the composites vary with different combinations of the interfacial shear strength and operational stress range.\nSome guidelines for design optimal polymeric damping material with carbon nanotubes are provided with this study.  The choice of the polymer matrix, type of CNT (functionalized or non-functionalized), aspect ratio and volume fraction of the CNT are suggested.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [579], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Ailin ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ailin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kon Well Wang", "Kon Well Wang", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Charles E Bakis", "Md Amanul Haque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kon Well Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Kon Well Wang, Committee Chair", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Chair", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member", "Md Amanul Haque, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multiscale model", "interfacial friction", "carbon nanotube", "polymeric composite", "damping"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Induction And Regulation Of Fungal Defense Related Compounds In Sorghum Bicolor", "id": "28923", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12117", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is an important member of the Poaceae family. It is a highly resilient crop that is drought and cold tolerant, and capable of surviving in the areas that would otherwise not support other cereal crops like maize. One of the major challenges in sorghum production is anthracnose leaf blight caused by Colletotrichum sublineolum. Understanding the mechanisms by which sorghum combat anthracnose is key to breeding for resistant cultivars. \nPlants combat disease infection through several ways: Passive defense mechanisms are thickening of cell wall, growth of waxy layers, epidermal outgrowth etc. Active defense mechanisms leading to hypersensitive response, which appears as localized cell death, synthesis of phytoalexins and antibiotic compounds. Sorghum is unique in the Poaceae family in its ability to synthesize 3-deoxyanthocyanidins (3-DAs), a sub-class of flavonoids. These compounds have been shown to act as phytoalexins that accumulate as brick red pigments at the primary site of attempted penetration by the fungus. Because of their anti-fungal properties, 3-DA phytoalexins can limit fungal progression. Sorghum phytoalexins include luteolinidin, apigeninidin and their methoxylated derivatives. We are interested in investigating detailed biosynthetic pathways of 3-DAs in sorghum as well as signal transduction events that lead to the resistance responses imparted via the 3-DAs. \n\nFollowing are my thesis objectives:\n\n1. Interaction of sorghum Y1 transcription factor with maize flavonoid structural genes during pathogen defense response.\nBased on the structural similarities of 3-DAs and flavan-4-ols (see Figure 1 in Chapter 1), it has been hypothesized that 3-DAs are also synthesized via the flavonoid pathway branch which leads to the production of phlobaphenes in sorghum.  An R2R3 MYB transcription factor encoded by yellow seed1 (y1) has been shown to be required for the biosynthesis of flavan-4-ols and phlobaphenes in the pericarp and leaf tissues. Using a transposon insertion mutant in y1, our lab has shown that the y1 gene is also required for the accumulation of 3-DAs in Colletotrichum sublineolum challenged sorghum leaves. Further, transformation of sorghum y1 gene into maize showed induced disease resistance response to Colletotrichum graminicola, establishing that the y1 gene can induce maize structural genes to accumulate 3-DAs in maize. In addition, that study indicated the y1 promoter contains cis- regulatory elements that are possibly involved in regulation of y1 during fungal challenges. Despite the above-mentioned results, we do not exactly know the flavonoid branch and the structural genes that are required for the biosynthesis of 3-DAs. It is also possible that 3-DAs either originate from a separate branch from naringenin, or these are simply derived from flavan-4-ols as a precursor.\n To identify the flavonoid branch leading to 3-DAs, we first transferred sorghum y1 to maize and then used maize mutants of flavonoid structural genes because of the non-availability of such mutants in sorghum. Our results showed that y1 transgene can regulate the expression of all the maize flavonoid genes tested. We also found that this induced expression was correlated with the observed disease resistance phenotype. This study indicates that the anthocyanidin synthase encoded by a2 in maize also have novel influence on flavan-4-ols and 3-DAs accumulation. Furthermore, through the accumulation of total phenolics, we have found that the y1-driven flavonoid pathway as a whole promoted the total phenolic accumulation.\n\n2. Expression of phytohormones salicylic acid and jasmonic acid genes during the 3-DA biosynthesis in sorghum and maize.\nCurrently, the upstream regulation of y1 remains relatively unclear. We attempted to understand signal transduction events upstream of y1 by measuring phytohormones that may have a role in early signaling events. Two phytohormones particularly important in plant defense are jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA). Previous studies focusing on the effect of exogenous phytohormones on 3-DA pathway have yielded conflicting results. In this work, sorghum mesocotyls and transgenic y1 maize lines were inoculated to study the internal interactions between the transcription of key genes in the SA and JA phytohormonal pathways and the accumulation of 3-DAs. Our results indicate a dual mode of 3-DAs regulation: JA is involved in disease triggered 3-DAs accumulation, and SA is involved in wounding triggered 3-DAs accumulation.\n\n3. Cell wall component profiling for biomass improvement in sorghum using Fourier-Transform Near-infrared Spectroscopy.\nCell wall composition plays a major role in the plant immune system, both as a source of primary, and secondary defenses. It is also the basis for lignocellulose biomass. This objective of my thesis was to explore biomass diversity cell wall composition in sorghum. My goal is to correlate this information with anthracnose resistance in sorghum. Currently, we have a collection of over 800 sorghum lines, representing a wide variety of grain, forage, bioenergy, and sweet sorghum in diversity. To fully exploit these lines and to understand the genetic variation contributing to sorghum lignocellulosic biomass accumulation, we developed and tested a high throughput method. In collaboration with Dr. Seong Kim\u2019s Laboratory, Fourier-transform Near Infrared (FT-NIR) Spectroscopy was used to characterize the cell wall composition in sorghum. Cell wall content assayed by FT-NIR showed high fidelity compared to that produced by wet chemistry laboratory while reducing both analysis time and sample size needed by order of magnitudes. Our results show FT-NIR is a useful method to fully exploit the large number of germplasm lines available in our collection. \n\nIn conclusion, by understanding the regulatory role of y1 transcription factor in phytoalexins biosynthesis, and the role of phytohormones synthesized during 3-DAs accumulation, we will gain a clearer picture of the active defense responses in sorghum. By quantifying cell wall component in a vast library of available germplasm, we can gain a better understanding of passive defense mechanisms. Breeding for increased defense against plant pathogens should be a holistic approach that combines both passive and active defense mechanisms.\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11528], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Bin ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Surinder Chopra", "Lavanya Reddivari", "Majid R Foolad"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Surinder Chopra, Thesis Advisor", "Lavanya Reddivari, Thesis Advisor", "Majid R Foolad, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sorghum bicolor", "3-deoxyanthocyanidin", "HPLC", "phytohormones", "salicylic acid", "jasmonic acid", "yellow seed1", "ft-nir"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "DESIGNING AND SECURING DISCOVERY SERVICES FOR EPCGLOBAL NETWORK IN SUPPLY CHAINS", "id": "26362", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11397", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging, global scale, Internet-based information service architecture enabled by the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and sensors technologies for information sharing and corresponding service discoveries. The EPCglobal network is considered as a sub-project under the IoT umbrella, which was created to develop a universal identification system and an open architecture to provide interoperability in a complex multi-vendor scenario. This universal identification system is based on the allocation of a unique ID\u2014Electronic Product Code (EPC)\u2014to every item. The EPC key is a globally unique identifier that is carried by the RFID tag. As a result, the EPCglobal network is an architecture proposed for enabling the sharing of information about the individually identifiable objects among organizations. As such, the life history of each individual object is shared and linked to an object through the unique EPC key. Since a huge volume of data is involved, a suitable service oriented architecture (SOA), which is called EPCglobal Discovery Service (EPCDS), is needed for locating both the key and additional information associated with it. Although several EPCDS models have been introduced by existing studies, most of them are in the very early development stages and cannot fulfill the design requirements, especially in advanced services, network performance, and security aspects. \nThis dissertation introduces an advanced EPCDS model, which centers around three main tasks. First, we discuss the architecture of EPCglobal network and the needs for advanced discovery services. We examine the detailed EPCDS design requirements that are classified into three categories, functionality and service, network performance, and security and privacy. We select several typical EPCDS models that are proposed in other studies for detailed discussion, and then summarize and analyze current EPCDS models against the design requirements. The conclusion points out how to take advantage of current EPCDS designs to eliminate the gaps for further exploration. \nNext, according to the design requirements and the assessment, we propose an advanced EPCDS design. The enhanced EPCDS network is based on a peer-to-peer infrastructure and a consistent hashing method, adopted for the EPC key assignment function. It enhances the functionalities and services of the system, especially core functions such as publishing and lookup services. Our model can fulfill all the design requirements. In particular, compared to other models, the design is a highly distributed network, which is able to provide both basic and advanced services, as well as superior networking capability, such as reliability, scalability, extensibility, etc. It could mitigate some of the aforementioned shortcomings without completely abandoning the established standard.\nFinally, we investigate security threats and vulnerabilities for the RFID-enabled EPCglobal network in detail. We categorize the security issues into several categories, and discuss how to resolve them. To address the challenges posed by complex and dynamic EPC objects and events, we propose a relationship-based federated access control model for EPC Discovery Service, which can be tightly integrated with the proposed EPCDS infrastructure, to fulfill all the security and privacy design requirements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that identifies and examines in detail the causes and impacts of key publishing security threats and interdependent security issues in an EPCDS context.

The topic has been studied since the early 1970s. In recent years, an application model, which uses the financial option theory in revenue management for single-fare single-leg problem in airline industry, has been designed. \n     The purpose of this thesis is to advance the model to make it more reasonable to apply. An airline may be considered as the holder of both call option tickets for customers and put option tickets for travel agents. Based on different demand situations, the airline could offer two levels of tickets to its customers at any period for a single leg. Also, at the last minute before departure, the overbooked passengers may choose to travel in a different class or not to travel, rather than waiting for the next flight. The potential revenue loss caused by customer dissatisfaction, which results from denied boarding, is also taken into consideration.  These factors determine the optimal booking limits for call and put option tickets, and the optimal prices for the two options. A general description of the whole booking process is presented. At last, a numerical example is given to illustrate the application of the model.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8477], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Chang ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chang", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["M Jeya Chandra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["M Jeya Chandra, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Airline Industry", "Revenue Management", "Financial Option Theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Use of Cooperative Learning in China's Elementary Classrooms: Perceptions by Teachers", "id": "25073", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9999", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Education in China is criticized for its examination-oriented education and \"silent classrooms\".

The present study aimed to examine individual differences in the trajectories of anger in a sample of 361 adopted children followed from infancy (9 months) to age 7. A second aim was to clarify the developmental outcome of trajectory group membership with a focus on externalizing and internalizing problems in children at age 8. Group-based trajectory analysis identified six groups: low/stable, average/stable, average/decreasing, average/increasing, high/decreasing and high/stable. Most children (65%) were in low to average or moderate but decreasing anger trajectory groups (the low/stable, the average/stable, the average/decreasing, and the high decreasing groups) with levels of anger at average or below average at age 7. However, about 35% of the children showed moderate to high levels of anger between ages 4.5 to 7 years (the average/increasing and the high/stable groups), and were one standard deviation above average for anger at age 7. Children in the average/increasing and the high/stable groups showed significantly higher levels of externalizing problems at age 8 compared to the other four groups. Furthermore, children in the high/stable group showed significantly higher levels of internalizing problems at age 8 than the other groups except for children in the average/increasing group. Children in the high/stable group were not different from children in the average/increasing group in both externalizing and internalizing problems.

However, most of the sensor networks\nnowadays only target for a single mission, and may not be cost effective from the resource management point of view. Therefore, in this dissertation, we focus on the design of multi-mission sensor network which is envisioned to support multiple applications of diverse requirements with a single network.\n\nTo support multiple missions, several challenges naturally arise. The first challenge comes from the fact that the missions or the mission requirements may change over time. Therefore, the network needs to be enriched with the adaptation capability to explicitly handle the mission switch. Second, since sensor network has limited\nresources, e.g., energy, sensing, bandwidth, etc, these resources have to be shared by the multiple missions. An efficient resource allocation scheme, therefore, should maximize the total profit by taking account into all the mission requirements. Third, since mission-driven sensor network is usually deployed in the harsh, unattended, dynamic environment, it is important to monitor the sensor status, based on which decisions about the mission switch can be made. While more challenges can be listed here, in this\ndissertation, we primarily focus on these three aspects, namely, mission switch, resource allocation, and network monitoring. Each of the aspects is examined under different contexts within an integrated framework, and briefly summarized in the following.\n\nFirst, we study the mission switch in a surveillance application. As mission switches, e.g., the network is commanded to last for a\nlonger time, some sensors may have to sleep longer during each duty cycle. Then the original sensor deployment may not be able to satisfy the coverage and lifetime requirements at the same time, and the coverage may need to be traded for network lifetime. To deal with this tradeoff, we propose the concept of spatial-temporal coverage, in contrast to the traditional area coverage. Our goal is to schedule the sensor activity to maximize the total spatial-temporal coverage during a specified network lifetime. Both\ncentralized and distributed heuristics are proposed, with the approximation factor of the centralized algorithm proved to be $frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSecond, we explore the resource allocation in the landmine networks and investigate how to accomplish multiple missions with the minimum\nresources usage. Specifically, we have studied a multi-target defense scenario, where our mission is to destroy the multiple intruding targets using the minimum cost pre-deployed landmines. Due\nto the NP Complexity of the problem, we have proposed a greedy algorithm and a layering algorithm, whose approximation ratios are\nderived.\n\nThird, we have proposed the multi-poller based monitoring architecture for mission driven sensor networks. Compared with the single poller scheme, the multi-poller scheme significantly reduces\nthe false alarm rate, while keeping the similar bandwidth consumption. To construct the monitoring architecture, we formulate a many-to-many poller-pollee assignment problem and present three distributed algorithms (i.e., random, deterministic, and hybrid). We have also explored the hop-by-hop aggregation opportunity between the poller and pollee, and formulate the optimal aggregation path problem. We solve this NP-hard problem by designing an opportunistic\ngreedy algorithm, which achieves an approximation ratio of $frac{5}{4}$. As far as we know, this is the first proved constant approximation ratio applied to the aggregation path selection schemes over the wireless sensor networks.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1242], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Changlei ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Changlei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Guohong Cao", "Thomas F Laporta", "Sencun Zhu", "Runze Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Dissertation Advisor", "Guohong Cao, Committee Chair", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sensor network", "multi-mission", "wireless", "approximation algorithm", "coverage", "landmine", "monitoring"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "EXPLOITING MULTI-THREADED APPLICATION CHARACTERISTICS TO OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE AND POWER OF CHIP-MULTIPROCESSORS", "id": "6761", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1249", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chip multiprocessors (CMPs) are becoming a popular way of exploiting the ever-increasing\nnumber of on-chip transistors. Multi-threaded applications aim to more ef\u0002ciently utilize the raw\npower that CMPs provide than is currently possible. However, current multi-threaded applications\nexhibit load imbalances at various levels. The increasing capacity for on-chip storage and\nincreasing costs of wire delays make the location of data on the chip very vital. Thus, it is important\nto place the data in the right location at the right time in the on-chip cache hierarchy. For\nthe purposes of this study, we characterize the load imbalance at the barrier, imbalance amongst\ncache requests from different cores, and the demands on different blocks of the cache. Using the\ninsights obtained from our characterization study, we then propose techniques that exploit such\nload imbalances to improve power and performance.\nFor the load imbalance problem at the barrier, we observe that the imbalances are quite\npredictable. Using an integrated hardware-software mechanism, we propose a novel technique\nfor optimizing the power consumption of CMPs. By using a high-level synchronization construct\ncalled barrier, our technique tracks the idle times spent by a processor waiting for other\nprocessors to arrive at the same point in the program. Using this knowledge, the frequency of\nthe processors can be modulated to reduce/eliminate idle time, thus providing power savings\nwithout compromising performance.\nFor the load imbalance problems imposed on the L2 cache by the different cores, we\nnotice that the possible imbalance between the L2 demands across the cores favors a shared\nL2 organization, while the interference due to these demands favors a private L2 organization.\nWe propose a new architecture, called Shared Processor-Based Split L2. The new architecture\ncaptures the bene\u0002ts of both types of organizations while avoiding many of their drawbacks.\nWe also study the demands on different blocks of the L2 cache, namely actively shared\nblocks and mostly privately accessed blocks. We show that, while there are a considerable number\nof L2 accesses to shared data, the actual volume of data is relatively low. Consequently,\nit is important to keep the shared data fairly close to all processor cores for both performance\nand power reasons. Motivated by this observation, we propose a small center cell cache residing\nin the middle of the processor cores which provides fast access to the cores' contents. We\ndemonstrate that this cache organization can considerably lower the number of block migrations\nbetween the L2 portions that are closer to each core, thus providing better performance. Combined\nwith sequential tag-data access, the power consumption of such a shared cache can be\nreduced further.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1238], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Chun ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anand Sivasubramaniam", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Natarajan Gautam"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anand Sivasubramaniam, Committee Chair", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Natarajan Gautam, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multi-threaded characteristics performance power c"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "CHINA'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS: ACCOMPLISHMENTS, PROBLEMS \nAND THE SHAPE OF THE FUTURE TO COME\n\n\n\n", "id": "7111", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1295", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "There is little doubt that China\u2019s telecommunication service is now fairly affordable, very fashionable, and highly dynamic.

In each sector, theoretically, there are at least two carriers competing with each other. With regard to the regulatory regime, despite its complicated, if not mystic, policy-making process, telecommunication regulation is probably the most open policy issue in China. A regulatory agency has been set up after several government restructurings. Relevant laws and regulations are in place and are kept updated. Overall, China\u2019s success has made it the envy of many developing countries.\nChina\u2019s telecommunications are unique. China\u2019s achievement in telecommunications should be partly attributed to the old socialist economic system. The Chinese government designed the roadmap of the great reform and carefully implemented the plan of restructuring the industry and the regulatory regime, hoping to bring healthy competition into the market. Although it is open to debate whether this kind of managed reform is efficient or not, there is no doubt that, without the Chinese government\u2019s strong and continuous support, China\u2019s telecommunications could not possibly have achieved today\u2019s success.\nAt issue is whether China\u2019s telecommunications development is sustainable in the future. The primary purpose of this study is to find out what regulatory approach the Chinese government should take to further advance China\u2019s telecommunications service industry in the coming decade. More importantly, the regulatory model proposed in this study aims to retain the sustainability of China\u2019s telecommunications industry.

The consistent support from the government has helped China\u2019s telecommunications industry successfully leapfrog to a relatively modern stage and potentially take the lead in some areas in the future.

The high rate of mortality, recurrence and the limited efficacy of current therapies highlight the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. HCC is known to express tumor-specific antigens which are potential targets for immunotherapy. However, tumor-induced immunotolerance thwarts the effective immune responses and challenges the development of immune-based therapies. The underlying mechanisms of HCC-induced immunotolerance have been difficult to study in the absence of realistic animal models.  Recently, we established a unique HCC murine model in our laboratory, in which hepatocytes reproducibly develop into discrete foci of HCC concomitantly with progressive hepatic fibrosis in immunocompetent mice. This model approximates the process that commonly occurs in human, resulting in tumors that are histologically similar to human HCC.  Our unique murine model provides an ideal platform to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms of tumor antigen-specific immunotolerance associated with HCC. Using this model, we investigate the use of the FDA-approved chemotherapeutic agent, sunitinib, in modulation of tumor antigen-specific immunotolerance as well as to determine its efficacy in combination with T-cell based immunotherapy for established HCC. In this study, we will test our central hypothesis that sunitinib treatment inhibits tumor-induced immunotolerance in HCC tumor-bearing mice by modulating regulatory T cells, which allows the activation of effector CD8 T cells. Targeting these mechanisms will improve the design of novel therapies for advanced HCC. \nIn aim 1, we attempt to determine the tumor induced tolerance of antigen-specific CD8 T cells in HCC. We approach this question by investigating how tumors escape from the attention of the immune system during tumor initiation and development as well as the involvement of immune regulatory populations during tumor progression. In aim 2, we define the role of sunitinib in preventing tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cell tolerance by comparing the phenotype, function and interaction of immune cells in tumor-bearing mice with and without sunitinib treatment. We especially focus on the changes within the regulatory T cells and tumor microenvironment where limited data are available for HCC. In addition, we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of combination strategies including antigen specific T cells transfer and immunization. We will further examine the molecular pathways involved in sunitinib-mediated immunomodulation. In this thesis study, we made the critical observation that sunitinib combined with adoptive transfer of CD8 T cells lead to durable long-term regression of established HCC tumors. The successful therapeutic effect is associated with changes in TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 as well as a reduction of regulatory T cells and activation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells. Our findings indicate that sunitinib prevents the development of an immunosuppressive state within the liver, allowing effective T cell-based immunotherapy.\nThis study improves our knowledge regarding mechanisms of sunitinib-enhanced immunity to cancer.

Given that knowledge has become a fundamental resource for organizations and can provide organizations with competitive advantages, it is imperative that any new knowledge generated from change management is captured and disseminated.\nThe aim of this research is to investigate the feasibility of an integrated approach to managing change and knowledge in energy efficient retrofit projects. In order to understand theoretical perspective and similar work in change and knowledge management, a detailed review of literature was conducted. The review was based on the most important aspects of knowledge management, change and dependency management, and their applications in construction. Two case studies were undertaken using individual interviews, focus group interviews and questionnaires to investigate challenges and current practices of managing changes, dependencies and knowledge in the AEC Industry.\nAn Integrated Change and Knowledge Management (ICKM) approach was developed to address the challenges of change and knowledge management, and provide an effective mechanism for simultaneously managing changes and knowledge in energy efficient retrofit projects. The integrated approach established a systematic way to facilitate change and dependency management, capture lessons learned during change management processes, and support information exchange between different disciplines in change and knowledge management activities. To demonstrate the feasibility and potential benefits, the ICKM approach was implemented in the overall construction workflows and Building Information Modeling (BIM), and two case studies were conducted to investigate current challenges and the need for an integrated approach, and validate the feasibility of the ICKM approach.\nBased on the ICKM approach, a prototype system - the Integrated Change and Knowledge Management System (ICKMS) was developed to automate the ICKM process. System requirements, use cases, components and techniques were identified in the research. The prototype was developed as a Web-based system for easy access and maintenance, which is composed of two sub-systems: a change management system (CMS) to support CM processes and a knowledge management system (KMS) to support KM processes. Capri.net was adopted as the KMS in the prototype. The use of the integrated system in energy efficient retrofit projects is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of simultaneously managing changes and knowledge.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11328], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Fangxiao ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fangxiao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba", "John Messner", "James Freihaut", "Gul Kremer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chinemelu Jidenka Anumba, Dissertation Advisor", "John Messner, Committee Member", "James Freihaut, Committee Member", "Gul Kremer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Change and Dependency Management", "Knowledge Management", "Building Information Modeling", "Integrated System", "Energy Efficient", "Retrofit"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "VIRULENCE GENE AND CRISPR MULTILOCUS SEQUENCE TYPING \nSCHEME FOR SUBTYPING THE MAJOR SEROVARS \nOF SALMONELLA ENTERICA SUBSPECIES ENTERIC\n\n", "id": "11367", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1977", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica is the leading cause of bacterial foodborne disease in the United States.

It also identified an environment-specific sequence type.    \nIn conclusion, the novel MLST scheme described in the present study accurately differentiated outbreak clones of the most common serovars of Salmonella, and therefore maybe an excellent tool for subtyping this important foodborne pathogen during outbreak investigations.

These requirements translate to fundamental properties of high methanol oxidation and oxygen reduction kinetics, as well as low methanol and water crossover. In this thesis a novel membrane electrode assembly (MEA) for direct methanol fuel cells has been developed, aiming to improve these fundamental properties. \nFirstly, methanol oxidation kinetics has been enhanced and methanol crossover has been minimized by proper control of ionomer crystallinity and its swelling in the anode catalyst layer through heat-treatment. Heat-treatment has a major impact on anode characteristics. The short-cured anode has low ionomer crystallinity, and thus swells easily when in contact with methanol solution to create a much denser anode structure, giving rise to higher methanol transport resistance than the long-cured anode. Variations in interfacial properties in the anode catalyst layer (CL) during cell conditioning were also characterized, and enhanced kinetics of methanol oxidation and severe limiting current phenomenon were found to be caused by a combination of interfacial property variations and swelling of ionomer over time. \nSecondly, much effort has been expended to develop a cathode CL suitable for operation under low air stoichiometry. The effects of fabrication procedure, ionomer content, and porosity distribution on the microstructure and cathode performance under low air stoichiometry are investigated using electrochemical and surface morphology characterizations to reveal the correlation between microstructure and electrochemical behavior. At the same time, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of DMFC cathodes have been developed to theoretically interpret the experimental results, to investigate two-phase transport, and to elucidate mechanism of cathode mixed potential due to methanol crossover.\nThirdly, a MEA with low water crossover has been developed by employing a highly-hydrophobic microporous layer (MPL) to build up hydraulic pressure at the cathode, promoting product water permeation from the cathode to anode to offset water dragged by electro-osmosis. Water crossover through the MEA is further reduced by an anode hydrophobic MPL through facilitating water back diffusion. Under different current densities, the MEA with hydrophobic MPL has consistently low a, several times smaller than those with hydrophilic or without MPL. A simulation study of anode water transport by a two-phase model shows that anode MPL wettability strongly determines liquid saturation in the anode, and thus is identified as playing a crucial role in promoting water back diffusion.\nFinally, direct feed of highly-concentrated methanol using the optimized MEA has been successfully demonstrated by a face-feed anode plate, which minimizes methanol crossover by controlling the fuel delivery rate. Using 10 M methanol, a steady-state power density of ~67mW/cm2 is reached at 60oC and 175mA/cm2, which is almost identical to that with 2M methanol.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1992], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Fuqiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fuqiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang", "Stefan Thynell", "Howard W Pickering", "Qing Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Stefan Thynell, Committee Member", "Howard W Pickering, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["catalyst layer", "membrane electrode assembly", "Direct methanol fuel cell", "optimization", "portable power"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "RESONANT ULTRASOUND SPECTROSCOPY AND\nSOLID HELIUM RESEARCH\n", "id": "12085", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2157", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent experiments have indicated some interesting phenomena in solid helium. We have been adapting resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS), which can be used to measure all of a solid's elastic moduli, for use with solid helium. In the RUS technique, a cell with known geometry is attached with ultrasound drive and receive transducers so that a number (10-30) of the cell's natural frequencies may be measured; by analyzing the natural frequencies, valuable information about elastic moduli of the cell\u2019s content (solid helium) can be gained. For RUS to work, it is essential that the normal modes of the cell be well understood. We developed a cell which will maintain robust normal modes when the cell is cycled in temperature and pressure. Normal modes of the vibration of the can fall into two distinct classes: In one class, nearly all energy is in the steel can, and the modes and natural frequencies of this group are almost the same as the empty can. However, helium inside does move with the can and slightly shifts the natural frequency. The second class only show up when there is helium inside the cell and they depend mostly on the helium properties. It was anticipated that the transducers, being outside of the can, would not be sensitive to the second class of normal modes. The plan was to determine elastic properties of helium by analyzing the small frequency shifts of the first class of normal modes. It turns out that transducers are able to determine the natural frequencies of some of the second class modes, which are much more sensitive to helium properties. A finite element method is used to track how resonance frequencies change as 4He (elastic) properties change. This is achieved by comparing the similarity of the resonance modes. We find that resonance frequencies that are sensitive to solid 4He increase by ~2% from 1 K to 2 K in our experiment. According to our calculation, this corresponds to a ~4% increase in solid 4He shear modulus. This shear modulus change could be explained using dislocation theory with appropriate parameters.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2137], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Guoxing ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Guoxing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Julian Decatur Maynard Jr.", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr.", "Moses Hung Wai Chan", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo", "Victor Ward Sparrow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Julian Decatur Maynard Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr., Committee Chair", "Moses Hung Wai Chan, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["resonant ultrasound spectroscopy", "Helium"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Exploiting user-generated data for knowledge discovery and recommendation", "id": "22586", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10136", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Internet and Web 2.0 have achieved a rapid growth and became ubiquitous in recent years. The advance in information technologies has also enabled users to generate data, implicitly or explicitly, on an unprecedented scale. Consequently,the need to discover and exploit new and useful knowledge from such data has also increased considerably. In this thesis, in this regard, we investigate user-generated data to discover interesting knowledge and enable better recommendation services.\n\nFirst, we tackle the problem of the location type classification using individual Twitter messages. We extend probabilistic text classification models to incorporate temporal features and user history information as probabilistic priors, and show that the proposed models can boost the classification accuracy effectively.\n\nSecond, we study the problem of quantifying the notion of political legitimacy using collective Twitter messages for specific populaces. We design a framework that aggregates a large number of tweets into the final legitimacy score of a populace by leveraging probabilistic topic modeling and sentiment analysis technique. Our empirical evaluation on eight sample countries using related public tweets demonstrates that our proposed framework shows a strong correlation to results reported in political science literature. We also apply this framework to a traditional news media data set, and compare the results with Twitter data. Several interesting differences are discovered between these two medias for this quantification task of political legitimacy.\n\nThird, we study the problem of mining implicit user feedback in recommendation systems. In particular, we tackle the cold-start problem of video recommendation using users' co-view information. We propose a classification framework to incorporate co-view information based on previously seen video pairs, and learn the weights of video attributes for ranking candidate videos to recommend, yielding encouraging recommendation results.\n\nFinally, as a way to exploit social network for recommendation, we study the problem of recommending the best team for a given set of roles or skillset considering both individual and team characteristics. To quantitatively capture the team level features, we take various social networks among people into consideration from project history and many other online activities.  Moreover, we learn the feature weights from the training dataset based on the correlation between features and project outcomes, and apply a combinatorial optimization algorithm to search the approximate best team. We validate our approach experimentally in a real business scenario and also compare our approach with other state-of-the-art methods using public DBLP dataset.

The formulations of these problems are all featured with nonsmoothness and potential nonconvexity in the objective and/or constraint functions.\n\nWe first study a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) that stems from equilibrium network design problems in traffic systems, such as the optimal path-based congestion tolling and the designing of tradable credits.  An MPEC is known to be computationally challenging due to the presence of a semi-infinite constraint, which renders the program both nonconvex and nonsmooth in general. This dissertation considers an even less desirable application scenario where the equilibrium constraint entails a non-closed-form operator. To address this computational issue, we propose a finite sampling approximation with a tunable bound on the approximation error. Under some regularity conditions, the approximation allows the MPEC to be solvable with any gradient-based local schemes to achieve an approximate first-order KKT solution with bounded infeasiblity. Such an approach is applied to the MPEC formulation of a congestion toll pricing problem and is shown to outperform other counterpart algorithms.\n\nThe second problem concerns system optimal real-time signal control for a traffic network where the incoming traffic flow is uncertain and the available knowledge on the underlying distribution is limited. Such a problem is formulated as a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model, which determines an optimal decision rule for traffic signal timing that is effective even when the underlying distribution is the most adversarial to the designer. Such a decision rule can be implemented as a signal strategy responsive to real-time traffic information. The DRO model is intrinsically nonsmooth.  To facilitate computation, we employ a sampling-based approximation to reduce the DRO model, which originally involves binary variables, into a mixed integer linear program. The efficacy of the approximation is theoretically guaranteed and numerically verified. We further test the proposed signal control procedure in the simulation of a realistic traffic network in Glasgow, and demonstrate its potential in on-line operation on realistic networks.\n\nFor the third problem, we focus on folded concave penalized sparse linear regression (FCSLR), an important regression model aimed for high-dimensional learning problems. Due to the presence of a folded concave penalty, the problem formulation involves both nonsmoothness and nonconvexity.  Therefore, computing a global solution is challenging.  In this dissertation, we show that for the regression problems with random design matrices, some easily computable local solutions satisfying a second order necessary condition (SONC) entail good estimation accuracy with a probability guarantee when the sample size is sufficient. To compute SONC solutions with different levels of accuracy, we discuss two different techniques:  (1) a novel potential reduction method (PR); and (2) a new mixed integer linear programming-based global optimization (MIPGO) scheme. Numerical comparison indicates an improved solution quality by PR and MIPGO in comparison with the state-of-the-art benchmark algorithm, the local linear approximation.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10903], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Hongcheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hongcheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tao Yao", "Terry Lee Friesz", "Necdet S Aybat", "Runze Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tao Yao, Committee Chair", "Terry Lee Friesz, Committee Chair", "Necdet S Aybat, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nonsmooth optimization", "machine learning", "network design", "folded concave penalty", "sparse recovery"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "How do Affirmative Action Bans Affect Student Racial and Socio-economic Composition?", "id": "14339hxl39", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14339", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigates the consequences of state-wide affirmative action bans on students\u2019 college enrollment outcomes. In particular, I examine four states that have banned the consideration of race in college admissions in public colleges and universities in the past decade, Michigan, Nebraska, Arizona, and New Hampshire. The enactment of these bans provides quasi-experimental variation in affirmative-action policies. The bans come from a mix of sources, ranging from voter initiatives to executive orders and court rulings. The variation in time and location of these bans provides useful variation in identifying the effect of banning affirmative-action policies on college enrollment outcomes. \n\tThis dissertation consists of two parts in which I utilize data from two different sources, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) and the Current Population Survey (CPS) between 1999 and 2014 to examine the effects of these bans. In the first part, I examine these relationships using the IPEDS which contains institutional level data. Findings suggest that although overall the bans do not significantly decrease racial minorities enrollment at 4-year public colleges and universities, a ban is associated with a significant reduction of racial minorities enrollment in Michigan and New Hampshire at public 4-years. Beyond the impact on racial minority students, the bans also change the socioeconomic composition of the freshman classes. In particular, the bans increase low-income students\u2019 college enrollment in Michigan, Arizona, and New Hampshire. \n\tMoreover, this study utilizes a quantitative case study method - the synthetic control method to conduct a close-up examination of the four public flagship universities. Findings demonstrate that for a competitive public flagship, as is the case for the University of Michigan, a ban decreases the racial diversity of its freshman class. For non-competitive public flagships (i.e. the University of Nebraska, the University of Arizona, and the University of New Hampshire), the ban changes the socioeconomic composition of the student body - low-income students\u2019 representation at these campuses increases in years following the bans. \n\tThe rest part of the dissertation uses the CPS data and examines the effects of the bans across racial and income groups. Findings suggest that the bans affect low-income students differently than their effects on high-income students across racial groups. In particular, the bans decrease low-income racial minorities\u2019 chances of college enrollment more than they do for high-income ones. Yet, for white students, the bans increase low-income students\u2019 chances of college enrollment more than they do for high-income ones.

In particular, the supply voltage scaling has slowed down in the past few technology generations due to the 60 mV/decade fundamental limit for on-off switching, which prevents the reduction of the energy per operation in today\u2019s circuits and systems.  To mitigate this challenge, tunneling-field-effect-transistor (TFET), as a viable alternative, has been proposed to achieve steep on-off switching at low supply voltages. Driven by the on-going progress of TFET prototype device development and its device characteristics applicable for different applications, co-design of TFET device-to-circuit is not only critical to transform the technology advantages into various application domains, but also important to evaluate its potential challenges.  This dissertation has been dedicated to developing the simulation frameworks to model the III-V semiconductor material based TFETs from devices to circuits and system architectures. Based on the layers of abstractions, the impact of the steep sub-threshold slope, the asymmetrical source/drain, the uni-directional conduction as well as the digital and analog/RF metrics are explored for III-V TFETs. These unique device characteristics of TFETs are essential to enable the circuit design innovations and expand energy efficient application landscapes such as ultra-low power energy scavenging systems and body sensor nodes. Moreover, due to their low-voltage operation and the difference in the material systems and device designs, the reliability issues such as radiation induced single-event upsets, process variations as well as the parasitic effects of TFETs need to be evaluated from practical application perspectives, which are also addressed in this work.

The framework builds\non three main tools, namely, (i) battery model reformulation and (ii) pseudo-\nspectral optimization for (iii) differential flatness. All of these tools already exist\nin the literature. However, their application to electrochemical battery estimation\nand control, both separately and in an integrated manner, represents a significant\naddition to the literature. The dissertation shows that these tools, together, provide\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency for both online moving horizon\nbattery state estimation and online health-conscious model predictive battery con-\ntrol. These benefits are demonstrated both in simulation and using an experimental\ncase study.\nTwo key facts motivate this dissertation. First, lithium-ion batteries are widely\nused for different applications due to their low self-discharge rates, lack of memory\neffects, and high power/energy densities compared to traditional lead-acid and nickel-\nmetal hydride batteries. Second, lithium-ion batteries are also vulnerable to aging\nand degradation mechanisms, such as lithium plating, some of which can lead to\nsafety issues. Conventional battery management systems (BMS) typically use model-\nfree control strategies and therefore do not explicitly optimize the performance, life\nspan, and cost of lithium-ion battery packs. They typically avoid internal damage\nby constraining externally-measured variables, such as battery voltage, current,\nand temperature. When pushed to charge a battery quickly without inducing\nexcessive damage, these systems often follow simple and potentially sub-optimal\ncharge/discharge trajectories, e.g., the constant-current/constant-voltage (CCCV)\ncharging strategy. While the CCCV charging strategy is simple to implement,\nit suffers from its poor ability to explicitly control the internal variables causing\nbattery aging, such as side reaction overpotentials. Another disadvantage is the\ninability of this strategy to adapt to changes in battery dynamics caused by aging.\nModel-based control has the potential to alleviate many of the above limitations\nof classical battery management systems. A model-based control system can estimate the internal state of a lithium-ion battery and use the estimated state\nto adjust battery charging/discharging in a manner that avoids damaging side\nreactions. By doing so, model-based control can (i) prolong battery life, (ii) improve\nbattery safety, (iii) increase battery energy storage capacity, (iv) decrease internal\ndamage/degradation, and (v) adapt to changes in battery dynamics resulting from\naging. These potential benefits are well-documented in the literature. However,\none major challenge remains, namely, the computational complexity associated\nwith online model-based battery state estimation and control. The goal of this\ndissertation is to address this challenge by making five contributions to the literature.\nSpecifically:\n\u2022 Chapter 2 exploits the differential flatness of solid-phase lithium-ion battery\ndiffusion dynamics, together with pseudo-spectral optimization and diffusion\nmodel reformulation, to decrease the computational load associated with\nhealth-conscious battery trajectory optimization significantly. This contribu-\ntion forms a foundation for much of the subsequent work in this dissertation,\nbut is limited to isothernal single-particle battery models with significant\ntime scale separation between anode- and cathode-side solid-phase diffusion\ndynamics.\u2022 Chapter 3 extends the results of Chapter 2 in two ways. First , it exploits\nthe law of conservation of charge to enable flatness-based, health-conscious\nbattery trajectory optimization for single particle battery models even in the\nabsence of time scale separation between the negative and positive electrodes.\nSecond, it performs this optimization for a combined thermo-electrochemical\nbattery model, thereby relaxing the above assumption of isothermal battery\nbehavior and highlighting the benefits of flatness-based optimization for a\nnonlinear battery model.\n\u2022 Chapter 4 presents a framework for flatness-based pseudo-spectral combined\nstate and parameter estimation in lumped-parameter nonlinear systems.\nThis framework enables computationally-efficient total least squares (TLS)\nestimation for lumped-parameter nonlinear systems. This is quite relevant to\npractical lithium-ion battery systems, where both battery input and output\nmeasurements can be quite noisy.\n\u2022 Chapter 5 utilizes the above flatness-based TLS estimation algorithm for\nmoving horizon state estimation using a coupled thermo-electrochemical\nequivalent circuit model of lithium-ion battery dynamics.\n\u2022 Chapter 6 extends the battery estimation framework from Chapter 5 to enable\nmoving horizon, flatness-based TLS state estimation in thermo-electrochemical single-particle lithium-ion battery models, and demonstrates this framework\nusing laboratory experiments.\nThe overall outcome of this dissertation is an integrated set of tools, all of them\nexploiting model reformulation, differential flatness, and pseudo-spectral methods,\nfor computationally efficient online state estimation and health-conscious control\nin lithium-ion batteries.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14183], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Ji ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hosam K.

Mutations in the Arabidopsis COPINE1 (CPN1, also BONZAI 1/BON1) gene cause a humidity- and temperature-dependent lesion-mimic phenotype and dramatically increased resistance to a bacterial and an oomycetous pathogen. Previous studies suggest that CPN1 functions as a negative regulator of defense responses.  The current study was aimed to further analyze CPN1 function through genetic, molecular and cell biological approaches. Fluorescence-tagged CPN1 protein was localized to the plasma membrane (PM) and quickly accumulated at cell junctions and lobes after pathogen attack. Structural-functional studies showed that transgenic expression of the CPN1 VWA domain caused a lesion-mimic phenotype that partially phenocopied cpn1. This result suggests that the transgenic VWA domain fragments may interfere with the function of the full-length endogenous CPN1 protein by causing a dominant-negative effect. CPN1 was found to interact with HrBP1 (Harpin Binding Protein 1) in a yeast two hybrid analysis (Judy Sinn, personal communication). CPN1 also pulled down HrBP1 fusion protein from total protein extracts. Fluorescence-tagged HrBP1 was mainly localized to chloroplasts; however, trace amounts of HrBP1 fusion protein were observed along the PM, especially after pathogen inoculation. This result suggests that CPN1 and HrBP1 might interact with each other after pathogen infection. Epistasis analysis suggested that the disease resistant phenotype of cpn1-1 was largely independent of salicylic acid. Taken together, our data suggest that CPN1 accumulates at cell junctions and lobes after pathogen attack, interacts with its functional associates through its VWA domain, and functions at an early step in plant defense.

An increase in the number of potential bidders or a\nchange of potential bidders\u2019 value distribution can explain this phenomenon. This paper\nfirst tests whether the information disclosure influences bidders\u2019 value distribution by\nproposing a likelihood ratio test in an eBay auction model with an application to eBay\nMotor auctions. The test result shows that the bidders\u2019 value distribution is not affected\nby different information disclosure levels measured by the number of photos provided\nby sellers in the application to eBay Motor auctions. By exploiting the bidders\u2019 value\ndistribution estimates, I also calculate the consumer surplus, the mean of consumer\nsurplus is 48% of the selling price which shows how much the online auction market\ncan benefit consumers.\n\nChapter 2: \u201cConsumer Search in the Online Movie DVD Market\u201d\nIn this paper, I study the consumers\u2019 online search behavior that has been documented\nthoroughly in the industrial organization literature. Using unique features of Comscore\nconsumer search behavior data and transaction data, I focus on the online movie DVD\nretail industry. I find several features of consumer search behavior in this specific\nmarket. Particularly, consumer makes her purchase decision on both price and other\nretailer\u2019s specific features or its quality.\nI estimate search costs in a nonsequential search model describing the web browsing and\npurchasing behavior. Consumer knows the price distribution and she can ascertain the\nexact price of each retailer by searching on the firm website. Following the canonical\nsearch model, a consumer has two decision steps in each period. First, each consumer\nmakes a choice set decision on how many retailers\u2019 websites to visit. After gaining\ninformation on the exact price of each retailer in the choice set, consumer maximizes her utility over the retailers in her choice set. The estimation result shows the average\nsearch costs are around $2.73 for an individual to search a firm\u2019s website before each\ntransaction.\n\nChapter 3: \u201cA Structural Model of Search with Learning: Application to the\nOnline Movie DVD Retail Market\u201d\nMuch of the demand literature uses search costs to explain consumer behavior and\nfirms\u2019 pricing strategy in the online retail industry. However, some dynamic features\nof consumer search behavior are not captured. For example, novel web behavioral\ndata indicates that the consumers\u2019 search sets or \u201cconsideration sets\" change over time.\nSuch evidence of behavior change of consumers is consistent with a consumer learning\nmodel. Consumers are usually not certain about the firm\u2019s quality, for example the\navailable service, before their visit to the firm\u2019s website. Therefore, the consumer\u2019s\nsearch decision is a trade-off between higher expected maximum utility from a larger\nsearch set and higher search cost. The decision depends on consumer\u2019s information\nabout the quality of the firms.\nIn this paper I develop a dynamic discrete choice model where consumers choose their\nsearch sets and then make the purchase decision from the firms in their search sets in\neach period. Each consumer\u2019s search decision is a dynamic process which depends on\nher endogenous belief evolution on quality.\nI estimate the dynamic model using the ComScore consumer level search and purchase\nbehavior data for the movie DVD retail market. The estimation results suggest that\nsearch cost is sizable and there exists consumer heterogeneity in firms\u2019 quality belief.\nConsumers are learning about the firms quality very slowly which plays an important\nrole in explaining the frequent search behavior change of consumers.\nCounterfactual experiments suggest that search costs and consumer learning have a\nhuge impact on the market shares of firms. The industry leader Amazon would have\n12% less share absent search cost. In addition, I compare the effects of different pricing\nstrategies of firms. The market share of Amazon shrinks by 2% if Amazon matches\nthe price of ColumbiaHouse which has the second largest market share.

Semiconductor QDs of various sizes and compositions can be used as the emissive media in the light emitting diodes, and can also be used as a novel type of phosphor in white light emitting diodes.\n\nNitride based LED technology have also attracted much attention since the early 1990s. Due to their high power, high efficiency, and long lifetime properties, gallium nitride (GaN) LEDs are becoming promising candidates for next-generation solid state lighting.\n\nThis dissertation attempts to advance the LED technology in three respects. Firstly, in order to improve the technology using colloidal QDs as the emissive media, the degradation mechanism of the colloidal QD LEDs was studied. The results reveal that the degradation of QD LEDs is associated with the reduction in the QD quantum efficiency. Two mechanisms were identified to account for the observed decrease of quantum yield: i.e., high temperature induced degradation during LED operation; and the diffusion of the carrier transport molecules into the QD emissive layer. To this end, the inorganic material of indium-gallium-zinc-oxide (IGZO) was introduced to replace tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) as the electron transport medium, making it possible to obtain air-stable QD LEDs. \n\nSecondly, to make the QD phosphors more efficient for color conversion in white LEDs, the nonradiative energy transfer between colloidal quantum dot-phosphors and nanopillar nitride LEDs was studied. In this approach, QD phosphors were brought to close proximity of blue-emitting quantum wells (QWs) by nanopillar LED design. This is accompanied with a novel design of low-resistance p-type contact selectively deposited on the top of the nanopillars. Strong non-radiative energy transfer was observed from the indium gallium nitride (InGaN) QWs to the colloidal QD phosphors, leading to a significant enhancement in effective internal quantum efficiency. Furthermore, the nonradiative energy transfer between colloidal quantum dot-phosphors and indirect bandgap silicon carbide was also studied. Nonradiative energy transfer has been demonstrated as an effective path to achieve color tunable emission from indirect semiconductors diodes.\n\nFinally, to drive the GaN LEDs under alternating current (AC) condition without external driver circuitry, a monolithic integration of LED arrays with on-chip Schottky diode Wheatstone bridge was demonstrated, for the first, to run the LEDs directly on the line voltage.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9151], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Jie ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jian Xu", "Suzanne E Mohney", "S Ashok", "Stephen Fonash", "Osama O Awadelkarim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jian Xu, Dissertation Advisor", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "S Ashok, Committee Member", "Stephen Fonash, Committee Member", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["light emitting diodes", "LED", "quantum dots", "gallium nitride", "alternating current LED", "AC LED", "optoelectronics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "COMPLIANT MECHANISMS USING SUPERELASTIC NITINOL", "id": "16139", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8090", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tNiTiNOL which is a nickel and titanium alloy exhibits the superelastic effect at desired temperature so that it can provide large strain up to 10% under loading. The superelastic property of NiTiNOL could benefit compliant mechanisms which relays on elastic deformation of the material to transfer motion, force or energy. The goal of this research is to explore compliant mechanisms using superelastic NiTiNOL in new or current applications and evaluate the performance of new designed compliant mechanisms with superelastic NiTiNOL. Two applications are investigated in this thesis. \n\tFirst, a device that can provide articulation to surgical tool tips is needed in natural orifice transluminal endoscopy surgery (NOTES). We propose a compliant articulation structure that uses superelastic NiTiNOL to achieve a large deflection angle and force in a compact size. Six geometric parameters are used to define this structure, and constraints based on the fabrication process are imposed. Using finite element analysis, a family of designs is evaluated in terms of the free deflection angle and blocked force. The same family of designs is evaluated for both NiTiNOL and stainless steel. It can be seen that significant benefits are observed when using NiTiNOL compared to 316 stainless steel; a maximum free deflection angle of 64.8o and maximum blocked force of 24.7 N are predicted. The designs are refined to avoid stress concentrations, and design guidelines are recommended. The meso-scale articulation structure is fabricated using both a Coherent Avia Q-switched, 355 nm laser and a Myachi Unitek 200 W single mode pulsed fiber laser with active water cooling. Select fabricated structures are then tested to validate the finite element models.\n       Second, a contact-aided compliant mechanism, or compliant spine, that was previously developed in our Engineering Design and Optimization Lab at the Pennsylvania State University is redesigned and modeled using superelastic NiTiNOL. The new one-joint compliant spine using superelastic NiTiNOL can reduce 50% of the size compared to Delrin design while not exceeds the weight of Delrin design. The tip deflection and length ratio of NiTiNOL design is about 150% of Delrin design, which means that NiTiNOL could make the compliant spine much smaller thus possibly lighter while still provide large deformation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8032], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Jiening ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiening", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker", "Jason Zachary Moore"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary I Frecker, Thesis Advisor", "Jason Zachary Moore, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["compliant mechanism", "nitinol", "superelastic modelling", "NOTES", "flapping wing"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Characterization of Porous Material Used for Thermoacoustic Devices", "id": "6833", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3255", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Three new compact experimental apparatuses were developed and calibrated to quickly and accurately characterize heat transfer and fluid drag in bulk porous media that may be useful candidates for standing-wave (stack-based) and traveling-wave (regenerator-based) thermoacoustic machines.

For the first time, the complex Nusselt number is related to the thermoviscous f-function allowing the heat transfer coefficient for oscillating flow to be determined without measuring temperatures and without requiring the use of heat exchangers. In the limit appropriate to heat exchangers, the new technique produced results that agreed with several other theoretical and experimental determinations of the heat transfer coefficient for oscillatory flow through heat exchangers. In the second apparatus, the pressure gradient for the oscillating flow through several samples was measured by a phase sensitive technique to resolve the pressure drop into two parts: the viscous drag and the oscillating inertia (Kelvin drag). Unlike the measurements of previous investigators, who did not separate the viscous and\ninertial effects, these measurements of viscous drag agreed with the published drag coefficients made by steady flow techniques in the appropriate limit. An additional dimensionless variable was created that allowed pressure drop measurements to be correlated through the transition from the low-frequency Poiseuille flow (parabolic) to high-frequency plug flow (boundary layer) regimes. The third apparatus was designed specifically to separate thermal and viscous losses in porous ceramic materials (automotive catalytic converter\nsubstrates) used in standing-wave thermoacoustic machines. By sealing the walls of the ceramic using an in situ polymerization technique, it was shown that wall porosity had no effect on thermal-relaxation dissipation at low frequencies.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3242], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Jin ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Lurie Garrett", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "James Gordon Brasseur"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Lurie Garrett, Committee Chair", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member", "James Gordon Brasseur, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thermoacoustics", "porous material", "regenerator", "stack"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "STUDIES ON THE PROTEINS INVOLVED IN THE VID VESICLE TO VACUOLE TRAFFICKING EVENT ", "id": "6951", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2952", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-12-29T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "                                       Abstract\n\nA unique protein degradation pathway has been studied using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. The gluconeogenic enzymes fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), malate dehydrogenase, isocitrate lyase, and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase are induced when cells are grown in medium containing low glucose. However, they are rapidly degraded when cells are shifted to medium containing fresh glucose. Several VID (vacuole import and degradation) genes were identified in genetic screens and are required for the degradation of these cargo proteins. FBPase has been used as a marker in my study. FBPase is initially imported into a novel type of vesicle called Vid vesicles, which then deliver FBPase to the vacuole for degradation. Although the origin of the Vid vesicle is not known, ubiquitin conjugation is necessary for Vid vesicle formation. Many proteins such as the heat shock protein Ssa2p, and the immunophillin family member Cpr1p, regulate the FBPase import into Vid vesicles. The molecules that regulate Vid vesicle and vacuole fusion were largely unknown. A Vid vesicle-specific molecule, Vid24p, has been reported to be required for this process.  However, the mechanism of Vid24p in the regulation of Vid vesicle and vacuole fusion was poorly understood. \n\nMembrane fusion is a thermodynamically unfavorable process. Fusion requires multiple steps including the targeting of donor vesicles to acceptor membranes, the tethering, and subsequent fusion of vesicles with the target membranes. Homotypic vacuole fusion is the most studied membrane fusion event in vivo and in vitro. Two vacuoles isolated from various genetic backgrounds can fuse in vitro with purified components. Homotypic vacuole fusion utilizes proteins that are also shared by other trafficking pathways, such as the cytosol to vacuole transport (CVT) pathway and the vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) pathway. As the Vid pathway requires Vid vesicle fusion with vacuoles to deliver of FBPase into the vacuole, it is possible that the fusion of Vid vesicles with vacuoles also utilizes these common vacuole fusion proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms of these fusion proteins in the Vid vesicle fusion may be different from those in homotypic vacuole fusion. In addition, this fusion may use molecules that are unique to the Vid pathway, and distinct signaling pathways may regulate these different fusions.  The goal of my project is to characterize the fusion molecules and signaling pathways that regulate the Vid vesicle to vacuole fusion event. The work described in this dissertation provides a glimpse of the fusion molecules involved in the Vid vesicle to vacuole trafficking and fusion.  The data described here implicate a role for the commonly used fusion molecules as well as unique molecules for the Vid vesicle to vacuole trafficking event.\n\nTo ask whether the Vid vesicle to vacuole trafficking step requires the molecules essential for other vesicles fusion with vacuole, I studied the common fusion proteins such as SNARE and GTPase. To test this hypothesis, the GTPase Ypt7p, the HOPS complex and v- and t-SNAREs were examined for their roles in FBPase degradation. They were all essential for FBPase degradation and they functioned in the Vid vesicle trafficking to vacuole step. Furthermore, Ypt7p was identified as Vid-vesicle-essential components. Likewise, a number of v-SNAREs (Ykt6p, Nyv1p and Vti1p) and the HOPS (homotypic fusion vacuole protein sorting complex) family members Vps39p and Vps41p, were also required for the proper function of Vid vesicles. By contrast, the t-SNARE Vam3p was only necessary for vacuole, while another t-SNARE, Vam7p, functions at both vacuole and vesicles. The study of these fusion molecules suggested that Vid vesicle-vacuole trafficking exhibits characteristics similar to heterotypic membrane fusion events. \n\nIt was also hypothesized that the Vid vesicle to vacuole trafficking event requires unique molecules in addition to the above-mentioned common fusion molecules. To identify novel proteins that regulate Vid vesicle trafficking, FBPase degradation mutants were screened by a colony blotting procedure using a yeast genomic gene deletion library. Via this approach, subunits of the vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) were identified.  The V-ATPase has established roles in endocytosis, VPS sorting and homotypic vacuole fusion.  However, V-ATPase subunits have distinct functions in homotypic vacuole fusion. For example, V0 domain subunits are required for homotypic vacuole fusion, but the V1 domain subunits are not. In my studies, most V1 subunits and all the V0 subunits (including the a-subunit Stv1p or Vph1p) were needed for FBPase degradation. They were required for both Vid vesicle and vacuole functions, as determined by an in vitro fusion assay.  However, STV1 was only required for the proper function of Vid vesicles. Moreover, STV1 and VPH1 have distinct function in the FBPase pathway. FBPase was sensitive to proteinase K digestion in the absence of STV1, while FBPase was resistant to proteinase K digestion in the absence of VPH1. The assembly of V0 and V1 domains was increased when cells were shifted from low glucose to high glucose. However, the assembly of V0 and V1 domains was independent of RAV genes. The distribution of V1 proteins is independent of V0 genes. The V1 subunits Vma2p and Vma5p were still detected on Vid vesicles and vacuoles in cells lacking V0 genes.  However, missing one V0 gene usually caused other V0 subunits to be absent in the Vid vesicles and vacuoles fractions.  Furthermore, the assembly of the V0 complex in the ER is necessary for FBPase trafficking, since mutants that block the assembly and transport of V0 out of the ER were defective in FBPase degradation. \n\nFBPase can be degraded in the proteasome or the vacuole depending on the length of glucose starvation. For short-termed starved cells, FBPase is degraded in the proteasome. By contrast, when long-termed starved cells are shifted to glucose, FBPase is degraded in the vacuole. How does FBPase know which pathway to go to? My hypothesis is that FBPase degradation pathway is subjected to distinct cell signaling regulation depending on the growth conditions. To test this hypothesis, the roles of glucose signaling pathways and the cAMP pathway were investigated. I found that the cAMP signaling pathway and hexokinases were needed for the vacuolar-dependent degradation of FBPase.  Hexokinases was also required for FBPase degradation in the proteasome-dependent pathway.  By contrast, the cAMP-dependent signaling pathway was only involved in the vacuolar FBPase degradation. Further investigation indicated that the cAMP pathway regulates the Vid vesicle to vacuole trafficking/fusion step and plays an important role on both Vid vesicles and vacuoles. \n\nIn summary, these studies indicated that the FBPase Vid trafficking pathway ustilizes common fusion molecules. However, protein molecules unique to the Vid trafficking pathway, such as Stv1p, are also needed for this step of the targeting pathway. Distinct signaling pathways regulate FBPase degradation in the proteasome or the vacuole. Although the signaling pathway leading to the degradation of FBPase in the proteasome is currently unknown, the cAMP pathway is necessary for the vacuolar pathway and it plays important role in the Vid vesicles and vacuole fusion event.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2945], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Jingjing ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jingjing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hui Ling Chiang", "David A Antonetti", "C Randell Brown", "Christopher J Lynch", "John Warren Wills"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hui Ling Chiang, Committee Chair", "David A Antonetti, Committee Member", "C Randell Brown, Committee Member", "Christopher J Lynch, Committee Member", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FBPase", "Protein degradation", "V-ATPase", "membrane fusion", "intracellular trafficking", "Vid vesicles"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Identification and characterization of DUF288 (Domain of Unknown Function 288) proteins required for cell wall synthesis", "id": "14275jul316", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14275", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The plant cell wall is mainly composed of polysaccharides that can be further divided\ninto cellulose and non-cellulosic polysaccharides.

The morphogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh), one of the Hh family of secreted proteins, plays a key role in patterning the mammalian spinal cord along its dorsoventral (D/V) axis through the activation of Glioma-associated oncogene (Gli) family of transcription factors. Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), a Gli-interacting protein, modulates the D/V patterning of the spinal cord by antagonizing Hh signaling. The molecular mechanisms underlying the function of Sufu in Hh pathway activation and spinal cord D/V patterning remains controversial, particularly in light of recent findings that Sufu protects the Gli2 and Gli3 proteins from proteasomal degradation. In this thesis, I show that Hh pathway activation and dorsal expansion of ventral spinal cord cell types in the absence of Sufu depends on the activator activities of all three Gli family proteins. I also show that Sufu plays a positive role in the maximal activation of Hh signaling that defines the ventral-most cell fate in the mammalian spinal cord, likely through protecting Gli2 and Gli3 proteins from degradation. Finally, by altering the level of Gli3 repressor on a background of reduced Gli activator activities, I reveal an important contribution of Gli3 repressor activity to the Hh pathway activation and the D/V patterning of the spinal cord. \nThe primary cilium, a hair-like structure projecting from the cell surface, is involved in Hh signaling in vertebrates. Gli2, the primary effector of Hh signaling, localizes to the tip of the primary cilium, but the importance of its ciliary localization remains unclear. Here, I address the roles of Gli2 ciliary localization by replacing endogenous Gli2 with Gli2\u2206CLR, a Gli2 variant not localizing to the cilium. The resulting Gli2\u2206CLRKI and Gli2\u2206CLRKI;Gli3 double mutants resemble Gli2null and Gli2null;Gli3 double mutants, respectively, suggesting the lack of Gli2\u2206CLR activation in development. Significantly, Gli2\u2206CLR cannot be activated by either pharmacochemical activation of Smo in vitro or loss of Ptch1 in vivo.  Finally, Gli2\u2206CLR exhibits strong transcriptional activator activity in the absence of Sufu, suggesting that the lack of its activation in vivo results from a specific failure in relieving the inhibitory function of Sufu. My results provide strong evidence that the ciliary localization of Gli2 is critical for cilium-dependent activation of Hh signaling.\nThrough this work, I established a better understanding on the genetic interactions between Gli and Sufu proteins as well as the role of cilia in Gli activation and Hh signal transduction.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10310], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Jinling ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jinling", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aimin Liu", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Douglas Cavener", "Robert Paulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aimin Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Zhi Chun Lai, Committee Chair", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["hedgehog", "spinal cord patterning", "Gli", "Sufu", "cilia"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Compiler Optimizations for SIMD/GPU/Multicore Architectures", "id": "18798", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8964", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In modern computer architectures, both SIMD (single-instruction multiple-data) instruction set extensions and GPUs can be used to accelerate the general purpose applications. In addition, the multicore machines can potentially provide more computation power for high performance computing with increasing number of cores and deeper cache hierarchies. However, writing high-performance codes manually for these architectures is still tedious and difficult. In particular, the unique characteristics of these architectures may not be fully exploited.\n\nSpecifically, SIMD instruction set extensions enable the exploitation of a specific type of data parallelism called SLP (Superword Level Parallelism). While prior research shows that significant performance savings are possible when SLP is exploited, placing SIMD instructions in an application code manually can be very difficult and error prone. We propose a novel automated compiler framework for improving superword level parallelism exploitation. The key part of our framework consists of two stages: superword statement generation and data layout optimization. The first stage is our main contribution and has two phases, statement grouping and statement scheduling. of which the primary goals are to increase SIMD parallelism and, more importantly, capture more superword reuses among the superword statements through global data access and reuse pattern analysis. Further, as a complementary optimization, our data layout optimization organizes data in memory space such that the price of memory operations for SLP is minimized. The results from our compiler implementation and tests on two systems indicate performance improvements as high as 15.2% over a state-of-the-art SLP optimization algorithm.\n\nOn the other hand, GPUs are also being increasingly used in accelerating general-purpose applications, leading to the emergence of GPGPU architectures. New programming models, e.g., Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), have been proposed to facilitate programming general-purpose computations in GPGPUs. However, writing high-performance CUDA codes manually is still tedious and difficult. In particular, the organization of the data in the memory space can greatly affect the performance due to the unique features of a custom GPGPU memory hierarchy. In this work, we propose an automatic data layout transformation framework to solve the key issues associated with a GPGPU memory hierarchy (i.e., channel skewing, data coalescing, and bank conflicts). Our approach employs a widely applicable strategy based on a novel concept called data localization. Specifically, we try to optimize the layout of the arrays accessed in kernels mapped to GPGPUs, for both the device memory and shared memory, at both coarse grain and fine grain parallelization levels. \n\nIn addition, iteration space tiling is an important technique for optimizing loops that constitute a large fraction of execution times in computation kernels of both scientific codes and embedded applications. While tiling has been studied extensively in the context of both uniprocessor and multiprocessor platforms, prior research has paid less attention to tile scheduling, especially when targeting multicore machines with deep on-chip cache hierarchies. We propose a cache hierarchy-aware tile scheduling algorithm for multicore machines, with the purpose of maximizing both horizontal and vertical data reuses in on-chip caches, and balancing the workloads across different cores. This scheduling algorithm is one of the key components in a source-to-source translation tool that we developed for automatic loop parallelization and multithreaded code generation from sequential codes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort that develops a fully-automated tile scheduling strategy customized for on-chip cache topologies of multicore machines.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8801], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Jun ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Padma Raghavan", "Qian Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Compiler Optimization", "SIMD", "GPGPU", "Multicore", "Scheduling", "Data Layout Transformation", "Tiling"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Large-Eddy Simulation of in-cylinder flows\nin motored reciprocating-piston internal combustion engines", "id": "15825", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7116", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two key bottlenecks prevent engines from reaching their performance,\nefficiency, and emissions potential.

However, the active ingredients responsible for the lipid-lowering effect of garlic are poorly understood and the underlying mechanisms of garlic action are not fully known. Therefore, the present studies were conducted to identify the active compounds of garlic on cholesterol, fatty acid, and triglyceride syntheses and to elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying the inhibition of lipid synthesis by the compounds of garlic in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes.\n\n\tThe first objective of the thesis was to establish the inhibitory potency of organosulfur compounds of garlic on cholesterol biosynthesis. Cultured rat hepatocytes were treated with [14C]acetate as substrate for cholesterol synthesis in the presence or absence of test compounds at 0.05 to 4.0 mmol/L. Eleven water-soluble and six lipid-soluble compounds of garlic were tested. Among water-soluble compounds, three S-alk(en)yl cysteines, i.e., S-allyl-cysteine (SAC), S-ethyl cysteine (SEC), and S-propyl cysteine (SPC), inhibited [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol in a concentration-dependent manner achieving 42% to 55% maximal inhibition. Three g-glutamyl S-alk(en)yl cysteines, i.e., g-Glutamyl-S-allyl cysteine (GSAC), g-glutamyl-S-methyl cysteine (GSMC), and g-glutamyl-S-propyl cysteine (GSPC) were less potent, exerting only 16% to 29% maximal inhibition. S-allyl mercaptocysteine (SAMC), a disulfur-containing compound, inhibited the [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol by 7% to 17% at 0.05 and 0.5 mmol/L, but diminished the incorporation into cholesterol at 2.0 and 4.0 mmol/L. Alliin, S-allyl-N-acetyl cysteine (SANC), S-allylsulfonyl alanine (SASA), and S-methyl cysteine (SMC) had no effect on cholesterol synthesis. Of the lipid-soluble compounds, diallyl disulfide (DADS), diallyl trisulfide (DATS), and dipropyl disulfide (DPDS) depressed cholesterol synthesis by 10% to 25% at low concentrations (\u00a3 0.5 mmol/L), and abolished the synthesis at high concentrations (\u00b3 1.0 mmol/L). Diallyl sulfide, dipropyl sulfide, and methyl allyl sulfide slightly inhibited  [14C]acetate incorporation into cholesterol only at high concentrations. The complete inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by DADS, DATS, and DPDS was associated with extensive cytotoxicity as indicated by marked increase in cellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. There was no apparent increase in LDH release by water-soluble compounds except SAMC, which also abolished cholesterol synthesis. A comparison of cytotoxicity, maximal inhibition, and IC50 (concentration required for 50% of maximal inhibition) of various compounds suggests that water-soluble compounds of garlic may hold greater potential than lipid-soluble compounds in inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, which in turn may reduce plasma concentration of cholesterol. SAC, SEC, and SPC are the most potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis.\n\nThe second objective of the thesis was to determine the effects of water-soluble organosulfur compounds on triglyceride synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, and the activities of important lipogenic enzymes including fatty acid synthase (FAS) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH). When incubated with cultured hepatocytes, SAC and SPC decreased [14C]acetate incorporation into triglyceride in a concentration-dependent fashion (from 0.05 to 4.0 mmol/L), achieving maximal inhibitions of 43% and 51% at 4.0 mmol/L, respectively. The rate of [14C]acetate incorporation into phospholipids was depressed to a similar extent by SAC and SPC. SPC, SAC, SEC, and GSMC decreased [14C]acetate incorporation into fatty acid synthesis by 81%, 59%, 35%, and 40%, respectively, at 2.0-4.0 mmol/L concentrations. Alliin, GSAC, GSPC, SANC, SASA, and SMC had no effect on fatty acid synthesis. The activities of lipogenic enzymes, i.e., FAS and G6PDH were measured in cultured hepatocytes treated with the inhibitors. The activity of FAS in cells treated with SAC and SPC at the concentration of 4.0 mmol/L was 32% and 27 % lower than that of non-treated cells, respectively. Neither SAC nor SPC affected G6PDH activity. The results indicate that SAC, SEC, and SPC inhibit triglyceride biosynthesis in cultured rat hepatocytes. More important, the study suggest that these S-alk(en)yl cysteines of garlic reduce triglyceride synthesis by decreasing de novo fatty acid synthesis resulting from the inhibition on FAS. \n\nThe third objective of the thesis was to examine the regulatory mechanisms underlying the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by S-alk(en)yl cysteines. The treatment of cultured rat hepatocytes with S-alk(en)yl cysteines (i.e., SAC, SEC, and SPC), inhibited cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetate but not from [14C]mevalonate, suggesting that the point of regulation is at 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Consistent with this notion, the activity of HMG-CoA reductase in the cells treated with SAC, SEC, and SPC was 30% to 40% lower than that of non-treatment group. Abundance of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA and the amount of the enzyme protein were not altered by the sulfur compounds. The expressed (E) and total (T) activities of HMG-CoA reductase were determined and the ratios of E/T were used to estimate the phosphorylation state of the enzyme. SAC, SEC, and SPC reduced the ratios of E/T by 18% to 29% resulting primarily from decreased expressed activity. The results suggest that organosulfur compounds of garlic decrease the activity of HMG-CoA reductase by phosphorylation but not by alteration in gene expression of the enzyme. In addition, the activity of HMG-CoA reductase was measured at a lower dithiothreitol concentration and preincubation of microsomes with phosphatase to test the involvement of thiol redox status. Among three S-alk(en)yl cysteines, SAC was the only compound found to suppress the activity of the enzyme. Thus, SAC appears to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity by not only phosphorylating the enzyme, but also increasing sulfhydryl oxidation of the enzyme. The results strongly indicate that S-alk(en)yl cysteines modify the activity of HMG-CoA reductase at the posttranslational level.\n\nIn summary, the results of the present studies indicate that water-soluble organosulfur compounds are the most important compounds in inhibiting hepatocyte cholesterol synthesis. Lipid-soluble sulfur compounds, on the other hand, may not be the major compounds in the reduction of cholesterol synthesis because of their cytotoxicity. Among the organosulfur compounds, water-soluble compounds SAC, SEC, and SPC are the most potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis. The inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by S-alk(en)yl cysteines results from the decreased activity of HMG-CoA reductase. The suppressed activity of HMG-CoA reductase by S-alk(en)yl cysteines is attributed to the inactivation of the enzyme by phosphorylation but not gene expression of the enzyme. SAC may also increase sulfhydryl oxidation of the enzyme. In addition, S-alk(en)yl cysteines inhibit triglyceride synthesis due in part to reduced de novo fatty acid synthesis. These results have added to our understanding of the active constituents of garlic responsible for the lipid-lowering effects and the underlying mechanisms.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3753], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Lijuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lijuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Madhu Reddy", "Yu Yan Yeh", "Mary Frances Picciano", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Michael Henry Green"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Madhu Reddy, Committee Member", "Yu Yan Yeh, Committee Chair", "Mary Frances Picciano, Committee Member", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "Michael Henry Green, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fatty acid", "HMG-CoA reductase", "triglyceride", "cholesterol", "organosulfur compounds", "garlic"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "engineering optical materials with metal nanostructures", "id": "28692", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12292", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Thanks to the development in nanotechnology, artificially engineered nanostructures have been exploited to manipulate the behavior of light. These nanostructures have critical dimensions on the same order of or smaller than the wavelength of interest and have unique properties other than naturally occurring materials. This research investigates novel approaches of applying metallic nanostructures for advanced optical materials. Both plasmonic quasiparticles and optical metamaterials were utilized to achieve exotic properties and exciting functionalities. The structures used in this research were carefully designed and fabricated and the physics for the observed optical response of the experimental devices were thoroughly discussed. First, a one-dimensional photonic crystal (1D PC) was coated on top of a two-dimensional metal grating to facilitate excitation of multiple surface-plasmon-polariton (SPP) waves and waveguide modes. The structures were found to be able to couple light into the guided-wave modes over a broad wavelength range in the visible spectrum regime over a broad incidence direction for both \u00acs- and \u00acp-polarization states. The individual excitations of the guided-wave modes were also theoretically predicted using the Floquet theory, surface-multiplasmonics theory, and the transfer-matrix approach with results well-matched to the experimental trends of the measured absorbance of the PC-metal structure. Second, the ability of the PC-metal structure to collect light efficiently and transport it over macroscopic distance were applied to realize a planar solar concentrator. The plasmonic concentrator was built as arrays of 1D PC coated 1D silver gratings, and micro-solar cells were attached to them to test their performance. The solar cells attached to the plasmonic concentrators had efficiencies three times higher than those not attached, validating the effectiveness of the plasmonic concentrators. In addition, the fabricated plasmonic concentrators showed optical transfer efficiency as high as 24% over the wavelength range of 450nm to 800nm and a concentration factor around 2X. Although these performance numbers were modest comparing to the state-of-art solar harvesting devices, the results open up new engineering opportunities to exploit the well-developed plasmonics theory for broadband, high-efficiency solar concentration devices. Moreover, the performance of the plasmonic concentrators was found to be insensitive to the angle of incidence of light, which makes them potentially applicable to stationary tracker-free roof-top solar harvesting devices. Finally, a self-sufficient reconfigurable hybrid optical metamaterial integrated with vanadium dioxide was demonstrated. The reflection spectrum of the hybrid metamaterial can be tuned electrically and the modulation contrast at the resonance frequencies can be as large as ~7500% and 500% at 3.05 and 3.85\u03bcm, respectively. Advanced functional meta-devices were demonstrated based on the drastic change in the optical response of the hybrid metamaterial. An electro-optical modulator was first demonstrated, with on-resonance reflectance controlled by sub-second electrical pulse-train input. The device was also shown to function as an electrically erasable and programmable read-only memory (EEPROM) with \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d reflectance contrast of ~10%.

Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) is a bio-based polymer with excellent film-forming and coating properties, but exhibits brittleness, insufficient gas barrier properties, and poor thermal stability. Recently, reinforcement of such biopolymer matrices with nanoparticles was proven a promising option for improving their properties. Furthermore, modifying the nanoparticles with specific organic compounds may increase the compatibility between the bio-based polymer and nanoparticles resulting in better polymer/film properties. Antimicrobial agents (AM) incorporated into packaging materials could be used to prevent the growth of microorganisms on food surfaces and thus lead to a shelf life extension and better safety of foods. However, some properties of the AM packaging, such as mechanical, or barrier properties, may be sacrificed, because of the incorporation of antimicrobial agents and the migration and the release of AM cannot be easily predicted or controlled. The overall goal of the project was to develop the polyhydroxyalkanoate-based bio-nanocomposite films modified by antimicrobial agents with improved mechanical and gas barrier properties, along with a controlled release rate of antimicrobial agents for the inhibition of foodborne pathogens and fungi in food. The specific objectives were: a) to develop layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoparticles modified and functionalized by antimicrobial agents (sodium benzoate, sodium gallate and potassium sorbate); b) to develop effective PHA-based LDH composite films with enhanced mechanical and barrier properties; c) to analyze and model the diffusion of antimicrobial agents through the PHA/LDH nanocomposites.\n\n         The ability for antimicrobial agents to intercalate into layered double hydroxides depended on the nature of the antimicrobial agents, such as size, spatial structure, and polarity, etc. Benzoate and gallate anions were successfully intercalated into LDH in the present study and different amounts of benzoate anion were loaded into LDH under different reaction conditions.\n         Incorporation of nanoparticles showed no significant effect on mechanical properties of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) films, however, significantly increased the tensile strength and elongation at break of polyhydroxybutyrate-co-valerate (PHBV) films. The effects of type and concentration of LDH nanoparticles (unmodified LDH and LDH modified by sodium benzoate and sodium gallate) on structure and properties of PHBV films were then studied. The arrangement of LDH in the bio-nanocomposite matrices ranged from exfoliated to phase-separated depending on the type and concentration of LDH nanoparticles. Intercalated or partially exfoliated structures were obtained using modified LDH, however, only phase-separated structures were formed using unmodified LDH. The mechanical (tensile strength and elongation at break) and thermo-mechanical (storage modulus) properties were significantly improved with low concentrations of nanoparticles incorporated into the polymer. The incorporation of LDH modified by sodium benzoate further improved the mechanical properties in comparison with unmodified LDH, which may be due to the increased compatibility between PHBV and nanoparticles and the larger basal distance between nanolayers after modification.  The concentration of benzoate anions in LDH nanoparticles was another factor which affected the properties of PHBV composite films. The PHBV film with 2% modified LDH with 20.9 % w/w of benzoate anions in LDH had the best mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties. Apparent glass transition temperature increased with the addition of modified LDH but did not change with the addition of unmodified LDH. Moreover, the effect of nanoparticles on thermal properties as well as crystallization of PHBV composites was dependent on the type of nanoparticles. Unmodified LDH and LDH modified by sodium gallate had limited influence on thermal properties. However, LDH nanoparticles modified by sodium benzoate increased the crystallization temperature and enhanced recrystallization during melting, which may due to the nucleation effect by nanoparticles. The temperature at 10 % weight loss was decreased with the addition of nanoparticles, which indicated the reduction of thermal stability, but the residue left from the polymer at 300 \u00b0C was increased and the mass loss rate was decreased. Water vapor permeability was reduced with the increase of unmodified LDH due to the barrier effect of nanolayers providing a torturous pathway for small molecules to diffuse out of the film. Due to the hydrophilic nature of the modifiers, the water vapor permeability was increased with the addition of modified LDH.\n\n         A comparison of mechanical properties and release kinetics of antimicrobial agents directly dispersed in PHBV and modified in LDH and then dispersed in PHBV was made. The results indicated that mechanical properties increased and release rate decreased in the latter case. The release of benzoate and gallate into DI water from PHBV composite films with LDH modified by benzoate and gallate followed pseudo-Fickian behavior fitted with a power law model. The release of benzoate from PHBV composite films with LDH modified by benzoate was also fitted with a Weibull model indicating Fickian behavior in fractal substrate morphologically similar to the percolation cluster. The concentration of modified LDH and the loading of benzoate in modified LDH showed a significant effect on the release kinetics of benzoate. The diffusivities of benzoate at 21 \u00b0C ranged from 3.41 to14.97 \u00d7 10-16 m2/s. The slowest release rate was achieved by the PHBV film containing 5 % w/w of modified LDH with medium loading of benzoate (21 % w/w of benzoate) in nanoparticles. The release of gallate from PHBV was much faster than that of benzoate. The effective diffusivity of benzoate increased with increase of temperature and the activation energy Ea for benzoate diffusion was calculated as 66.4 kJ/mol. It will be thus possible to design biodegradable polymeric nanocomposites with a tunable release of active molecules for various applications. \n\n         All in all, the results obtained in this work showed that mechanical and barrier properties of PHBV were increased with very low concentration (2%) of unmodified LDH and LDH modified by antimicrobial agents, which may extend the application of this bio-based polymer. Moreover, these PHBV/modified-LDH nanocomposite films containing antimicrobial agents can release different amounts of antimicrobial agents at different release rates when parameters such as incorporation methods, the nature of the interaction between the intercalated antimicrobial agents and the LDH layers, the amount of the filler in the polymer, and the amount of antimicrobial agents in the LDH are taken into consideration.

Our SEI systems discern radio emitters of interest through the estimation of transmitter nonlinearities caused by design and fabrication variations. These nonlinearity features provide unique signal sig- natures for each emitter, and we extract those characteristics through the estimation of transmitter nonlinearity coefficients. We first present a nonlinearity estimator which es- timates the power series coefficients of nonlinear devices in the radio frequency (RF) front end by observing the spectral regrowth in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Then another robust algorithm is also provided by using alternative degrees of nonlinearities associated with symbol amplitudes for initial estimation, and then iter- atively estimating the channel coefficients and distorted transmit symbols to overcome the inter-symbol interference (ISI) effect. The convergence and unbiasedness of the it- erative estimator are demonstrated semi-analytically. Based on this analysis, we also trade error performance for complexity reduction using the regularity of the estimation process. The algorithm is applicable to a wide range of multi-amplitude modulation schemes, and we present an SEI system designed for an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system over an empirical indoor channel model with associated numerical results.

Chapter 1 studies the rationalization and identification of discrete games where players have correlated private types. Our approach is fully nonparametric. First, under monotone pure strategy Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, we characterize all the restrictions if any on  the distribution of players' choices imposed by the game-theoretic model as well as restrictions associated with three assumptions that have been frequently used in the empirical analysis of discrete games. Namely, we consider additive separability of the private information in the payoffs, exogeneity of the payoff shifters relative to the private information, and mutual independence of the private information conditional on the payoff shifters.  Second, we study the nonparametric identification of the payoff functions and types distribution under exclusion restrictions and rank conditions. In particular, we show that our structural model is identified up to a location-scale normalization in the separable case. Third, without imposing exclusion restrictions, we characterize the sharp identification region for the payoff functions and types' distribution. Lastly, we discuss possible estimation and testing procedures. Chapter 2 studies the semiparametric identification and estimation of binary games with arbitrary finite number of players under incomplete information. Our approach allows private types to be correlated across players. By focusing on the monotone pure strategy Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE), we show that, in our semiparametric model with linear payoffs, the equilibrium strategies can be represented as a single-agent binary response model.  Under weak restrictions, we identify the joint distribution of private types nonparametrically, and the payoff functions in a linear-index setup. Following Klein and Spady (1993), we propose a three-stage procedure for estimating the payoff coefficients and show that our estimator is root-N-consistent, asymptotically normally distributed. A Monte Carlo experiment shows that our estimator has good properties in moderately sized samples. Chapter 3 develops nonparametric tests of monotonicity of bidding strategy in first price auctions. The monotonicity testing problem is shown to be equivalent to a convexity testing problem, and a root-N consistent test statistic, which measures a distance of integral of inverse bidding strategy from convexity, is proposed. We obtain two types of critical values: one of them is given by the asymptotic distribution, and the other one is given through bootstrap approach.

It has thus become important to specifically determine the role of autophagy in the initiation and development of AML. Here, we employ a mouse model of AML expressing the fusion oncogene MLL-AF9 and explore the effects of Atg5 deletion, a key autophagy protein, on the malignant transformation and progression of AML. The in vivo deletion of Atg5 in MLL-AF9-transduced bone marrow cells during primary transplantation prolonged the survival of recipient mice, suggesting that autophagy plays a role in MLL-AF9-driven leukemia initiation. In contrast, deletion of Atg5 in malignant AML cells during secondary transplantation did not influence the survival or chemotherapeutic response of leukemic mice. Thus, Atg5-dependent autophagy may contribute to the development but not chemotherapy sensitivity of murine AML induced by MLL-AF9.\nDeregulated apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer. The anti-apoptotic group of Bcl-2 family proteins is frequently found to be over-expressed in numerous cancers, causing both evasion of apoptosis and resistance to treatment. Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that has long been hypothesized as a promising therapeutic target. To this end, we characterized a series of small molecules based on maritoclax, a novel small molecule antagonist of Mcl-1, in the context of AML. We determined that maritoclax caused the selective proteasome-dependent down-regulation on Mcl-1 and subsequent cytotoxicity in AML cells with elevated Mcl-1. We further performed structure-activity relationship analysis and uncovered a number of pyoluteorin derivatives that demonstrated superior potency towards Mcl-1-dependent cancers as well possessing in vivo efficacy. In order to expand the strategies by which to antagonize Mcl-1-dependent cancers, we designed and validated a robust high-throughput approach to uncover small molecules which post-transcriptionally modulate Mcl-1 stability. We uncovered a number of hits which down-regulate Mcl-1, among which is niclosamide with a hitherto unknown mechanism of action. We similarly performed structure-activity relationship studies on niclosamide and uncover a number of salicylamide derivatives based on niclosamide that potently and selectively induce proteasome-dependent Mcl-1 down-regulation. Overall, we present a novel high-throughput approach to discover novel post-transcriptional modulators of Mcl-1 and were able to describe the pharmacophore of salicylamide derivatives which selectively antagonize Mcl-1. Thus, we were able to characterize a series of small molecule Mcl-1 antagonists with the potential to be developed for the treatment of AML.\nTaken together, these studies have dissected the role of autophagy and the pharmacologic inhibition of Mcl-1 in the context of AML. While autophagy did not play a significant role in the progression or chemotherapeutic response in a mouse model of AML, the selective inhibition of Mcl-1 by inducing its proteasomal degradation might be a promising therapeutic strategy. We believe that this knowledge will significantly contribute to the understanding of AML pathogenesis and treatment, will serve as a platform for additional drug discovery efforts to elucidate novel compounds for the treatment of AML.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13382], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Qiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong-Gang Wang", "Hong-Gang Wang", "Jennifer Xavier", "Shantu Amin", "Qing Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong-Gang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Hong-Gang Wang, Committee Chair", "Jennifer Xavier, Committee Member", "Shantu Amin, Committee Member", "Qing Yang, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bcl-2", "Mcl-1", "leukemia", "autophagy", "apoptosis", "acute myeloid leukemia", "small molecule inhibitors"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Testing the complementarity requirements of plant microRNA-target interactions", "id": "22456", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10369", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Small RNAs are a group of regulatory RNAs of 20-30 nucleotides (nt) that are involved in diverse cellular processes across multiple eukaryotic kingdoms, including animals, plants and fungi. In complex with Argonaute (AGO) effector proteins, they recognize target RNA transcripts (coding and non-coding) based on sequence complementarity, and function as negative regulators at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.\nIt is widely accepted that plant microRNA-target interactions usually require a high degree of complementarity to trigger target cleavage. However, the sequence requirements for target repression at protein level through slicing independent mechanisms have never been systematically studied.\nUtilzing a self-designed dual-luciferase reporter system, I systematically examined the complementarity requirements for microRNA function through Nicotiana benhtamiana transient assay. I found that changes of the mRNA accumulation accounts for almost all observed regulatory effects. Comparison among those naturally occurring targets indicated that mismatches located near the miRNA 5\u2019ends were more disruptive to miRNA function than those occurred near miRNA 3\u2019ends. Actually, certain naturally occurring targets with unpaired bases only present at the miRNA 3\u2019ends can even carry stronger regulatory efficiency than perfectly paired sites when position in 3\u2019-untranslated region (UTR), but not open reading frame (ORF). I found that this was largely due to different behavior of perfectly paired sites, when placed in different contexts (ORF vs. 3\u2019-UTR). While up to 3 mismatches could be tolerated at the 3'end without affecting the target efficacy, base pairing patterns that are typical of the known configuration of animal microRNA-target duplex did not trigger any detectable level of target down-regulation.\nThrough collaboration we identified a non-canonical plant miRNA-target pairing pattern, where a 6-nt bulge on the target in between nucleotide 6 and 7 relative to the miRNA was tolerated. I demonstrated that this is very unique in terms of both the miRNA involved and the position of the bulge.\nDe novo annotation and quantification of small RNA producing loci were also carried out in N. benthamiana. A total of 43652 small RNA producing loci, including 177 MIRNA, 4573 hairpin_RNA (hpRNA), and 38902 siRNA loci were identified. 95 MIRNA loci belonging to 37 plant known microRNA families were found. Comparing to the novel MIRNAs, these known MIRNA genes are processed with higher accuracy, and expressed more abundantly. Although small RNA clusters mainly producing 23 to 24 nt siRNA dominated hpRNA and siRNA loci, and 24-nt small RNAs are the most abundant small RNA species, 20 to 21 nt siRNAs are more robustly generated from certain highly active loci. Loci that give rise to longer small RNAs (23-24 nts) are generally less repetitive than those producing short small RNAs (20-22 nts). This is true for all types of annotated loci (MIRNA, hpRNA, and siRNA). MIRNA loci are enriched in genic regions and depleted in repeat regions, whereas siRNA loci, especially 23-24 nt groups, tend to occupy regions enriched for repetitive elements.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10038], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Qikun ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qikun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Axtell", "Sarah Mary Assmann", "Ying Gu", "Surinder Chopra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Axtell, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Member", "Ying Gu, Committee Member", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plant", "microRNA", "target", "complementarity", "afro-infiltration", "Nicotiana benthamina", "arabidopsis", "small RNA annotation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The impact of message framing on consumer attitude and behavioral intention toward HACCP implementation in foodservice businesses", "id": "16151", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8050", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis investigated the impact of message framing on consumer attitude and behavioral intention toward the implementation of Hazard Analysis & Critical Control Points (HACCP) in foodservice businesses.

While pain appeals and pleasure appeals are widely used by hospitality firms, research examining the effectiveness of these hedonic appeals is lacking. To address this gap, the current dissertation investigates consumers\u2019 affective and cognitive reactions to hedonic appeals in a series of three experimental studies. Drawing on regulatory focus theory, I argue that the pain frame\u2015signaling risk involved in a service experience\u2015is more congruent with a promotion focus that motivates risk taking. In contrast, the pleasure frame better matches a prevention focus as it relates to risk aversion. In the advertising context, persuasion will be enhanced when there is a correspondence between hedonic frame and regulatory focus. Consistent with my predictions, the results of this dissertation suggest that the pain frame generates more favorable brand evaluations among individuals with a chronic promotion focus, whereas the pleasure frame is more effective among individuals with a chronic prevention focus (Study 1). In addition, brand evaluations are enhanced when pairing the pain frame with promotion-focused information or when pairing the pleasure frame with prevention-focused information. The underlying reason is that compatible (incompatible) messages reduce (increase) consumers\u2019 felt discomfort (Study 2). Moreover, I demonstrate that when the pain frame is employed, offering service guarantees will boost brand evaluations among prevention-focused individuals but backfire among their promotion-focused counterparts (Study 3). Results from mediation analyses in the three studies provide convergent evidence that negative affect and positive affect underlie the observed interaction effects on brand evaluation.

Each section contains items that are closely interrelated, serving one or more themes. Even with a modest number of sections, the resulting dataset may have a large number of variables, which poses special analytic challenges for dealing with missing values. Current procedures for multiple imputation may fail because the underlying models do not take into account the thematic nature of the questionnaire and are over-parameterized. Attempts to simplify the model--for example, by assuming that the items within a theme are conditionally independent given a small number of latent factors--may fail to capture special features of the data if the specified model does not fit. In this dissertation, I develop new multiple-imputation procedures for multi-themed questionnaire data based on a fexible class of confirmatory factor models. I present PX-EM algorithms for maximum-likelihood estimation in exploratory and cofirmatory factor analysis with incomplete data. The factor model is then relaxed by adding an additional random component which allows the covariance structure to deviate from the assumed model. I present an MCMC algorithm for generating Bayesian multiple imputations under this extended model.

Compared with legacy cameras, portable mobile devices require us only to press the \u201cshutter\u201d button when we are ready to take a photo, no matter when or where we are. As a result, a growing number of people like to record everything in their daily lives and then share these mementos with their friends online. However, these gathered digital images may violate the consent of the photographed persons, which may lead to concerns about privacy. Unfortunately, the current methods cannot perfectly solve these concerns. Thus, in this thesis, we propose our solution for a privacy-respecting system for mobile phones.\n    In order to meet the requirements of efficiency and usability, on the one hand, we choose Bluetooth wireless communication, which has been widely deployed in most electronic devices, as the main approach to transmit privacy preferences of users. In addition, we try to improve the compatible of our system with the mainstream devices. Therefore, we have designed two different methods to transmit privacy policies: classical Bluetooth communication and BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) broadcast.\n    On the other hand, we use a simple feature extract algorithm, perceptual hash algorithm, which only uses 8 bytes to represent face of a specific person. This algorithm can largely reduce the data size of the face feature vector and further reduce the computation overhead so that it can be deployed in most of mobile phones.\n    We have implemented a prototype based on Android platform, and also made some evaluations based on three main facets: usability, security and performance.
