Employing survey experiments, this research also finds that respondents are more likely to reject male immigrants as members of their society when they are informed about the economic consequences of immigration; respondents are more likely to reject female immigrants when they are informed the cultural consequences of immigration. Lastly, using in-depth interviews with marriage migrants in Taiwan, this research shows that the degrees to which Taiwanese citizenship is desired and actively pursued differ depending on migrants\u2019 intersectional identities. This research raises implications for how states may react to immigration through the media\u2019s gendered projections of immigration as various issues. It also raises implications for the impact of the media on how citizens differ in negotiating the presence of migrant men and women.

Electroactive polymers (EAP) with large strain, high elastic energy density, easy processing, and tailored properties hold the promise to meet these challenges. The ionic polymer conductor network composite (IPCNC) actuators which are operated at very low operation voltage (<5 V) offer additional benefits in micro- and macro-scale applications because they can be directly integrated with advanced microelectronics. Compared with other ionic EAPs which can also be operated with low operation voltage, IPCNC actuators which provide broader improvement space with their flexible structure and material selectivity are chosen in this dissertation study.\nThis dissertation discusses the limiting factors in IPCNC actuators and develops solutions to overcome the barriers of low actuation speed and electromechanical efficiency. Two important components, conductor network composites (CNCs) and electrolytes, which determine performance of IPCNCs are investigated and analyzed for developing improvement solutions. \nCNCs where the insertion of ions generates actuation strain, have been found to play a key role on IPCNC performance. This is the first time to clarify the importance of CNC thickness in determining the IPCNC actuator speed. In IPCNC actuators, thin CNC layers will lead to fast actuation speed. The possibility of realizing fast speed in IPCNC actuators with thick CNCs is also investigated by controlling CNC microstructure morphology. In IPCNC actuators, it is CNC layers that control actuator speed. Ion transport in traditional porous composite electrodes is slow because of long transport paths caused by both large thickness and random morphology. CNCs with thickness more than 20 &#956;m are usually fabricated due to the limitation brought by the fabrication methods. To solve the problem, layer-by-layer (LbL) self assembly with fine thickness control ability is used to fabricate CNC layers, with ultrathin thickness (sub-micrometer). Increases in actuator speed (response time &#8776; 0.18 s) is demonstrated with LbL CNCs. An additional improvement is also shown where strain has been increased to 6.8%, compared with traditional IPCNC or ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) (maximum strain &#8776; 3.3%). Also, thin CNCs have led to both high electrical and electromechanical efficiency. The importance of CNC morphology is demonstrated in IPCNC actuators, for the very first time thanks to recent advances in fabricating controlled-morphology vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VA-CNTs) with ultrahigh volume fraction. Compared with traditional CNCs with random distributed nanoparticles, VA-CNTs offer three advantages: creating continuous paths through inter-VA-CNT channels for fast ion conduction, minimizing electrical conduction resistance due to the continuous CNTs, and by tailoring modulus anisotropically to enhance actuation strain. A large strain level of 8.2% is achieved in IPCNC actuators with VA-CNT/Nafion CNCs. Faster actuation combined with higher ionic conductivity has also been demonstrated. \nElectrolytes providing for and transporting mobile ions are another component in IPCNC actuators. Traditional electrolytes, i.e. water and organic solvents have several issues including solvent evaporation and short lifetime. Ionic liquids with several unique features including nonvolatility, nonflammability, large electrochemical window, and high ionic conductivity, are introduced into IPCNCs, bring lots of opportunities for optimizing performance. The effect of ion size on actuator speed and efficiency has been investigated in IPCNCs with four imidazolium ionic liquids with different ion sizes. Besides single ions with different ion volume, the effect of ion clusters is identified in this dissertation by both experimental and theoretical approaches using ab initio method. The results could be utilized as guide in future IPCNC performance improvement. \nTraditionally, only bending actuators are fabricated for IPMCs, however, linear actuators which can make full use of the large strain generation of the IPCNCs are highly desirable. The possibility of linear IPMC has been realized by approaches demonstrated in this study. By examining the strain response in linear IPCNCs, additional information of individual ion transport of cation and anion is supplied.\nAnother class of EAP, the electrostrictive polymers (poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorofluoroethylene) P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)) are more mature for commercialized actuators and they are also studied in this dissertation. P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)) have large elastic energy density (1 J\u2022cm-3) and are usually quite thin (thickness ~ 1 \u00b5m) for operation voltage reduction. In this study several approaches for further improving their characteristics are discussed and demonstrated. The polymer blend approach is adopted to increase modulus by blending P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) with P(VDF-CTFE) (CTFE: chlorotrifluoroethylene). This approach results in alleviating of electrode clamping effect, i.e. strain reduction caused by electrodes. Electrical breakdown under high electrical field reduces device lifetime. Conductive polymers with a breakdown self-healing feature are employed as electrodes. The traditional deposition methods including in-situ polymerization and screen printing have several problems, such as taking a long time and damaging the thin polymer films. A mist spray method is developed for depositing conducting polymers with much increase deposition speed, improved coverage, less damage, and better thickness control (\u00b1 0.1 &#956;m). The low modulus of the conductive polymer further reduces the electrode clamping effect. An actuator with compact size (2mm diameter and 30mm length) and high performance (large displacement (1mm) and force output (1.5 N)) has been developed for refreshable full page Braille display and graphic display. These devices provide the capability for fulfilling so many dreams of the blind and visually-impaired.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6073], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Sheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Craig Grimes", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Ralph H Colby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Craig Grimes, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electroactive polymers", "actuators", "electromechanical", "ionic polymer", "electrostrictive polymers"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "liquid crystal waveguide-based non-mechanical beam steering", "id": "12486sul269", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12486", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Beam steering technique is widely used in the fields of laser communication, optical storage, target tracing, etc. Generally, the beam steering technique depends on mechanical systems for changing the direction of optical axis in order to control the propagating direction of the laser beam, resulting in complicated structures, substantial masses, high cost, and high energy consumption. In this work, I present, for the first time, a novel technique of the electro-optic liquid crystal waveguide-based mechanical laser beam steerer on the fused silica substrate, which provides unprecedented advantages such as large angular deflection, rapid response, and small size. This original device is based on the liquid crystal, which is the material of the largest electro-optic response.

The concept of paring the steel plate shear wall frame (SPSW) with floor isolation system (FIS) is that SPSW might effectively limit drift, protect drift sensitive components, whereas the floor isolation system reduces acceleration demands on targeted acceleration sensitive components. This study investigates the performance and sensitivity of floor isolation systems in steel plate shear wall frames under design basis (DBE) and maximum considered earthquake (MCE). The floor isolation systems were first designed and modeled for the level 1, 2 and level 3, 5 and 8 for 3-story and 9-story steel plate shear walls in OpenSees, respectively; followed with  a performance study using nonlinear response history analysis to investigate the performance of floor isolation systems in steel plate shear walls. Finally a sensitivity study was performed to investigate the effect that variations in the web plate strength and stiffness have on the performance of the FISs in SPSWs. \n\nThe results show that: (i) the floor isolation system is effective in limiting acceleration demand on equipment in SPSW frame under DBE; and (ii) isolator displacement demands are large and need to be reduced; (iii) the floor isolation system performs better on the lower level in the steel plate shear wall frames. Moreover, from the sensitivity study, the results show that: (iv) the equipment absolute acceleration ratio is insensitive to the variations in the structure and do not need to be considered; (v) the maximum displacement response of the isolators is sensitive to the variations in strength and stiffness and need to be considered when designing the capacity of isolators; (vi) the floor absolute acceleration is sensitive to variations in web plate strength and stiffness which suggests that significant damage to rigidly attached equipment in SPSWs might be expected under DBE and MCE events.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6076], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Shi ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gordon Patrick Warn", "Gordon Patrick Warn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gordon Patrick Warn, Thesis Advisor", "Gordon Patrick Warn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["earthquake", "steel plate shear wall", "sensitivity", "floor isolation system", "performance"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Redox Reactivity of N-heterocycle Carbene Complexes of Chalcogens and Related Explorations of P-block-promoted Cross Coupling", "id": "15989", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7522", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The redox reactivity of d-block elements has been widely exploited in transition-metal catalysis. A typical example is transition-metal-catalyzed cross coupling (TMCC), in which oxidative addition and reductive elimination interconvert oxidation states of the metal center. In contrast to the significant progress in transition metal redox chemistry, the study of p-block redox reactivity lags. In an emerging research theme, the capacity for main group compounds to display redox behavior in analogy to the transition metals has begun to be recognized. For instance, oxidative addition of electrophiles to main group compounds is also well-known. Complementarily, certain hypervalent p-block compounds are able to undergo a \u201cligand coupling\u201d event that reduces both the oxidation state and coordination number of the central main group element by two with concomitant ligand-ligand bond formation. The similarity of these two elementary reactions to those observed in TMCC indicates that redox catalysis may not be the sole province of transition metal compounds. Instead, a much broader blueprint for p-block redox catalysis may be expected.\n\nWith the broad goal of exploring novel redox reactivities of p-block compounds and their application in catalysis, we initiated an investigation of the reactivity of a series of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of chalcogens (i.e. sulfur, selenium). These target compounds were selected on the basis of the established stoichiometric redox reactivity of the chalcogens and by the fact that NHCs can serve as powerful supporting ligands in transition-metal catalysis. Carbon-based oxidants, specifically aryl alkynyliodonium and diazonium salts, were chosen to examine the feasibility of oxidative addition to the NHC-supported chalcogens. Highly efficient alkynyl transfer from the alkynyliodonium reagent was observed for both thiones and selones. By contrast, aryl transfer from aryl diazonium reagents is limited to the more nucleophilic selones.\n\nSystematic study of the reactivity of the chalcogenide oxidation products thus formed with various nucleophiles was also carried out. Reaction of the various sulfonium salts with aryl lithium or magnesium reagents results in sulfenyl transfer, providing a convenient synthesis of aryl alkynylthioethers. Moreover, the reaction between selenonium salts and DBU exhibits a serendipitous C-N coupling, for which a benzyne mechanism is postulated. Elaboration of this stoichiometric reaction to a three-component catalytic process is unsuccessful due to the direct reaction of aryl diazonium salts with DBU.\n\nIn general, the above results highlight two potential challenges in the quest to achieve p-block redox catalysis: 1.) the design of catalysts with both low and high valent states of sufficient stability to permit redox cycling, and 2.) the identification of reagent and catalyst combinations devoid of strong, competitive background reactivity.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7460], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Shi ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexander Thomas Radosevich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexander Thomas Radosevich, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Redox Reactivity", "NHC Complexes of Chalcogens", "p-block-promoted cross coupling"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Shape-Selective Syntheses of Gold and Copper Nanostructures: Insights from Density-Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics", "id": "14385sxl409", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14385", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-09-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Density-functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) were used to resolve\nthe origins of shape-selective syntheses of {111}-faceted Au nanostructures mediated by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as well as {100}-faceted Cu nanostructures mediated by hexadecylamine(HDA) seen in experiment. For the work in PVP on Au surfaces, the hexagonal reconstruction of Au(100) was considered. DFT results indicate that the Au(111) surface covered by the PVP segment, 2-pyrrolidone (2P), has a lower surface energy than the 2P-covered (5 \u00d7 1) Au(100)-hex surface, and that PVP may exhibit a binding affinity for Au(111) comparable to or greater than (5 \u00d7 1) Au(100)-hex. With MD, it is shown that the PVP-covered Au(111) surface has a lower surface energy than the PVP-covered (5 \u00d7 1) Au(100)-hex surface, and that the atactic PVP isosamer chains have a binding affinity for Au(111) comparable to (5 \u00d7 1) Au(100)-hex. Also, the (5 \u00d7 1) Au(100)-hex surface may have a higher flux of Au atoms than the Au(111) surface.

Multilevel modeling was conducted to examine whether husband and wife coregulate in their cortisol awaking responses (CAR) and diurnal cortisol slopes (DCS). Results showed synchrony (concurrent covariation) in DCS between spouses. For CAR, the strength of synchrony was stronger in couples characterized by higher levels of spousal strain and disagreement. In addition, cross-lagged models revealed that an individual\u2019s diurnal cortisol pattern on a particular day depended on his/her own, but not his/her spouse\u2019s, cortisol pattern on a previous day. Stability in CAR was stronger in couples reporting higher levels of spousal support. The discussion highlights the family systems perspective and the methodological advantages of the analytic technique.\nStudy 2 and 3 were based on a project examining dynamic interactions in physiological arousal between children with Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) and their therapists, as indicated by electrodermal activity (EDA). Study 2 compared three approaches for handling missing data in multivariate time series, which is common in studies of physiological interactions. A recursive prediction routine developed by the author was found to outperform listwise deletion and data imputation using sample means and variances in recovering the parameters of the time series models. Study 3 introduced an advanced signal processing technique - time-frequency analysis (TFA) - to study interpersonal dynamic interactions. A program called SAM-MOW (Spectral Analysis for Multivariate data using a MOving Window) was developed by the author to carry out TFA automatically. The method was used to analyze EDA data from one child-therapist dyad during therapy. The analysis revealed a unidirectional influence from the therapist to the child (i.e., the child\u2019s EDA was predicted by the therapist\u2019s EDA). In addition, the magnitude of influence appeared to be contingent on guided activities during the therapy. The discussion focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of this novel methodological approach.\nIn sum, this dissertation focuses on the application and development of statistical methods to study interpersonal physiological interactions from a dynamic systems perspective. It contributes both to our knowledge of physiological processes underlying dyadic interactions, and to methodological development in this area.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7523], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Siwei ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Siwei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael J Rovine", "Michael J Rovine", "Peter Cm Molenaar", "Susan Mc Hale", "Runze Li", "Matthew Goodwin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael J Rovine, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Chair", "Peter Cm Molenaar, Committee Chair", "Susan Mc Hale, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member", "Matthew Goodwin, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dyadic analysis", "psychophysiology", "cortisol", "time series", "electrodermal activity"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SHEAR-COAXIAL INJECTION AND MIXING OF CRYOGENIC FLUIDS UNDER SUPERCRITICAL CONDITIONS", "id": "7963", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6290", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "      The present research focuses on the modeling and simulation of shear-coaxial cryogenic fluid injection and mixing processes under supercritical conditions.  The objectives are as follows: 1) to establish a unified theoretical framework that accommodates full conservation laws, turbulence closure, real-fluid thermodynamics, and transport phenomena; 2) to implement a high-fidelity modeling technique to systematically investigate underlying physiochemical mechanisms and essential physics at supercritical conditions, and 3) to construct a parametric study identifying dominant design parameters and flow variables that affect the injector dynamics.\n\n      Several computational and modeling challenges must be overcome in order to perform numerical simulations on high-pressure cryogenic fluid dynamics. A comprehensive theoretical framework capable of treating turbulence, high-pressure property variations, and a general fluid model is developed.  A modified Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equation of state is selected in the present study because of its reasonable accuracy over the high-pressure and low-temperature regime and its ease of implementation. Thermodynamic properties including enthalpy, internal energy and heat capacity are directly calculated by means of fundamental thermodynamic theories.  Transport properties including viscosity and thermal conductivity are estimated by means of the corresponding state principles along with the use of the 32-term Benedict-Webb-Rubin (BWR) equation of state, which are implemented using high-precision curve fits.  Large-eddy-simulation (LES) technique is employed for the present analysis, in which large-scale turbulent motions are explicitly computed and small scales are modeled by using appropriate turbulence models.  A static Smagorinsky model and dynamic subgrid scale (SGS) model are used to treat small-scale motions.  The theoretical formulation outlined above was solved by means of a density-based, finite volume methodology. Temporal discretization was obtained using a four-step fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme which has been commonly and successfully used in turbulence simulation. Further numerical efficiency is achieved by utilizing a parallel computation scheme that involves the message-passing interface (MPI) library and multi-block treatment.\n\n      Validation and verification have been performed against data from experiments and direct numerical simulations on decaying isotropic turbulence, theoretical relations regarding oblique shock wave and experimental shadowgraphs of rapid expansion of supercritical solutions. Reasonably good agreement was obtained, and the effects of SGS models and artificial dissipations were well investigated.\n \n      Efforts were also applied to examine the flow dynamics of a shear-coaxial injector.  As a specific case, the injection of liquid nitrogen through the inner tube at a lower velocity and gaseous nitrogen through the outer annulus at a higher velocity was explored. The near-field flow evolution is characterized by the three mixing layers originating from the rims of the two concentric tubes.   Emphasis was placed on the effects of chamber pressure, velocity ratio, momentum flux ratio, and external imposed acoustic excitation on the near-field flow evolution.  The characteristic frequency of the recirculating wake flow downstream of the inner tube is smaller than the dominant vortex shedding frequency in the shear layers.  A larger velocity ratio of the outer-to-inner jets enhances entrainment of the outer stream into the inner region and, consequently, results in a shorter inner potential core and a larger spreading angle of the outer shear layer.  A higher chamber pressure results in a shorter inner potential core and a smaller spreading angle.  The phenomena can be attributed to the momentum flux ratio and density ratio effects.  The effect of acoustic excitation on the jet flow evolution is apparent even at small amplitude of acoustic pressure oscillation at 0.3% of the mean chamber pressure.  The jet exhibits sinuous-like structures in the slices perpendicular to the acoustic velocity direction.\n\n      Finally, efforts were first applied to investigate the spatial and temporal instabilities of real-fluid mixing layers with strong density stratification, to better understand the nature of cryogenic fluid injection and mixing. A local inviscid instability model based on a modified Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state was derived and discussed in detail. The density and velocity distribution effects on mixing layer instabilities have been investigated extensively.  Results indicate that velocity variation coupled with density stratification will influence the flow stability dramatically.  Detailed density distributions, especially large density dilation when mixing layers pass through inflection point, have obvious effects on flow instability.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6290], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Tao ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vigor Yang", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Richard A Yetter", "Robert John Santoro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vigor Yang, Committee Chair", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["LES", "supercritical", "jet", "turbulence"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "RF MAGNETIC FIELD, SPECIFIC ENERGY ABSORPTION RATE, AND SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO IN MRI: EXPERIMENTS AND NUMERICAL CALCULATIONS WITH FINITE DIFFERENCE TIME DOMAIN METHOD\n", "id": "6483", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6592", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When MRI moves towards higher fields for higher signal to noise ratio (SNR), one of the problems is that the complicated interaction between the radiofrequency (RF) field and the biological tissues degrades the performance of the system.

Specifically multiple characterization techniques have been used to develop a more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms that control transient change during electrical degradation. We utilize techniques such as impedance spectroscopy (IS), thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC), and modern analytical transmission electron microscopy methods including electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). \nIn this work, a detailed investigation of electrical degradation has been performed on a model perovskite dielectric, Fe-doped SrTiO3 in both single and polycrystalline forms. In the single crystals, three different types of relaxation process were identified by TSDC, namely dipolar orientation of   complexes, trap charges of  , and ionic space charge with the mobile  . The energetics and concentrations of these are monitored as a function of the degradation process. Furthermore, IS is used to model the mechanisms that are spatially redistributed owning to the migration of   towards the cathodic region of the crystal. Through modeling all the complex impedance Z*, modulus M*, admittance Y* and capacitance C*, an equivalent circuit model can be developed and key contributors to the IS can be identified.  \nFrom this it is considered that the cathodic region changes to a conduction mechanism that is both band electron and polaron controlled. The major change during the degradation is to the polaron conduction pathways. Due to the nature of low polaron hopping mobility in this model system, the conductivity from both conductions become comparable providing that the calculated polaron concentration is around 5 order greater than that of band electron. The spatial dimension of the distributed conduction mechanisms is also modeled through the I.S. analysis. Excellent agreement is obtained between the IS data and the EELS data, where &#8776;30 &#956;m of conducting region is developed at the cathode, and a corresponding high oxygen vacancy concentration on the order of 1019/cm3 is obtained after degradation. \nOther than those relaxation mechanisms identified in the Fe-doped SrTiO3 single crystal system, an extra relaxation mechanism was found in the polycrystalline systems and was attributed to the relaxation of oxygen vacancies across grain boundaries. Using the initial rise method of TSDC, the activation energies estimated for the relaxation of defect dipoles, the in-grain oxygen vacancies pile up at grain boundaries, and relaxation of oxygen vacancies across grain boundaries are 0.73\u00b10.03, 0.86\u00b10.07, and 1.1\u00b10.09 eV, respectively. \nAn ionic demixing model is applied to account for the evolution of TSDC spectra and to explain changes to the leakage behavior of the degraded samples. In the case of the polycrystalline system, it is suggested that a strong degradation to the insulation resistance occurs when oxygen vacancies migrate across grain boundaries and start to pile up at the cathode region of metallic electrodes. Prior to that point, the vacancies accumulate at partial blocking grain boundaries in each of the crystallites.  \nAfter gaining a comprehensive understanding of TSDC on Fe-doped SrTiO3 systems, the thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) spectra conducted on real capacitive systems which include multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), COG capacitors and electrolytic capacitors are discussed based on the theoretical background that was developed from the Fe doped SrTiO3 single and polycrystalline model systems. \nFor the TSDC studies in Ni-BaTiO3 MLCCs, besides two pyroelectric peaks released from the ferroelectric core and shell phase regions, an additional two peaks above the core Curie temperature were ascribed to the relaxation of two types of oxygen vacancy motions, in grain and across grain boundary oxygen vacancy transportation. Activation energies calculated for in grain and across grain boundary oxygen vacancy peaks are 1.06\u00b10.05 and 1.24\u00b10.08 eV, respectively.\nAnother important multi-layer capacitive device is the so-called COG capacitor. In designing COG capacitors, high field break down properties are required at elevated temperatures above 85 oC. A source of the electrical breakdown could be the depopulation of trapped charge. Therefore the trapped charge energies and concentrations in COG capacitors were investigated. The capacitor\u2019s MnO content was found to strongly influence the trapped charge concentration as measured by TSDC. \nTSDC to electrolytic capacitors was also demonstrated. It is shown that TSDC technique can be a powerful tool to understand underlying defect properties which are not manifested in traditional electrical measurements such as I-V measurement.  Electrolytic capacitors based on tantalum oxide are often limited in their performance at high fields and high temperatures due to trapped charges. It is known that leakage is often controlled by Poole-Frankel conduction mechanisms in Ta2O5 electrolytic capacitors. It is determined through I-V measurements that the leakage current indeed follows the Poole-Frenkel conduction characteristic under high field. A parallel TSDC study also confirms at high field and high temperature trapped charge phenomenon. Through the use of TSDC, a new high voltage Poole\u2013Frenkel mechanism at highest field range, >64V, in this study was discovered.       \nIt is concluded that TSDC is one of best techniques for capacitor characterization, and recommended other TSDC methods that could be extended to enhance our understanding of structure-property-processing relations in capacitor characterization.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6605], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Wei-En ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei-En", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Clive A Randall", "Clive A Randall", "Leslie Eric Cross", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof Clive A Randall, Dissertation Advisor", "Clive A Randall, Committee Chair", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thermally stimulated depolarization current", "Impedence", "defect chemistry", "electrical degradation"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Characterization of pathogen effectors and host endogenous peptide elicitors in the rice-magnaporthe oryzae interaction", "id": "18839", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8865", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The arms race is going on forever between plants and pathogens. Along their ever-lasting co-evolutionary path, plants have developed multilayered surveillance systems and defense lines, whereas pathogens have acquired vast capabilities of evading perception and breaking defense lines. In the interaction of Magnaporthe oryzae and rice, M. oryzae delivers a phalanx of effectors that could enter rice cells and subvert rice defenses, and rice cells deploy an array of surveillance receptors that could sense pathogen attack and initiate defense responses against M. oryzae. This study aims to shed some new light on the rice-M. oryzae interaction from both the pathogen and the host perspectives. \n\nA family of one-finger zinc finger proteins was identified as pathogen effectors from the secretome of M. oryzae isolate 70-15. Rice leaf sheath live-cell imaging showed that zinc finger effectors were first accumulated in the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) and then translocated into rice cells during M. oryzae infection. The underlying mechanism for translocation was likely associated with two host-targeting motifs L/IPXP and L/IXAR, as demonstrated by the analysis of the localizations of BAX- and GFP-tagged fusion proteins. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a blast-induced rice cDNA library revealed that the rice nucleus-localized protein HIRA was one of the interactors of this family of zinc finger effectors. The interaction between zinc finger effectors and HIRA was in the nucleus of the rice cell, as shown by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC). In addition, this interaction was also confirmed by a GST pull-down assay. Zinc finger effectors are in nature DNA-binding proteins, as unveiled by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). Moreover, zinc finger effectors inhibited BAX-induced programmed cell death (PCD) when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. And rice transgenic lines overexpressing zinc finger effectors exhibited lowered defense gene expression and increased susceptibility to M. oryzae. A plausible model has been proposed to elucidate how zinc-finger effectors suppress rice immunity by recruiting HIRA for chromatin remodeling. \n\nRice, like Arabidopsis, harbors a family of defense-related genes encoding plant elicitor peptides (Peps). On one hand, M. oryzae induced the expression of the OsPep1-encoding precursor gene OsPROPEP1 via the ethylene (ET) and jasmonate (JA) pathways. On the other hand, synthetic OsPep1 elicited defense response in rice and thereby enhanced resistance against M. oryzae. Furthermore, rice transgenic lines overexpressing OsPROPEP1 showed constant defense gene expression and increased resistance to M. oryzae. All these findings indicate that Pep signaling as an amplifier of plant defense is an integral part of rice innate immunity against M. oryzae.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8710], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Wenhua ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenhua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yinong Yang", "Yinong Yang", "Teh Hui Kao", "Timothy W Mcnellis", "Dawn S Luthe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yinong Yang, Dissertation Advisor", "Yinong Yang, Committee Chair", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rice blast pathogen", "Zinc finger effector", "DNA-binding factor", "HIRA", "endogenous peptide elicitor"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Designing Ion-containing polymers for facile ion transport", "id": "22833", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6620", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The development of polymer electrolytes with sufficient ionic conductivity will enable the design of flexible, efficient Li ion batteries and is also of primary interest for actuators, alternative battery membranes, and within the membrane-electrode assembly of fuel cells.

High performance of a portable DMFC is determined by the methanol, water and heat transport processes, as well as their complex interactions under a wide variety of operating conditions and design regimes.  The present thesis aims to developing a theoretical understanding of these transport phenomena and hence their effects on electrochemical performance of the DMFC.  Based on the latest experimental observations, two-phase mathematical models have been developed.\nA one-dimensional (1D) model for the membrane-electrode-backing layer assembly in a DMFC is developed for the first time to predict not only polarization curves and methanol crossover but also water crossover and transient discharge behavior coupled with the temperature evolution in a portable DMFC.  The model results show good agreement with experimental data of overall cell performance, methanol and water crossover rates through the membrane, as well as reveal a positive interactive feedback mechanism between the transient temperature and methanol crossover profiles, coupled by transient cell voltage and cell energy efficiency profiles, under varied operating conditions.\nNext, a multi-dimensional (multi-D) model, making use of a multi-phase mixture (M2) formulation, is developed to encompass all components in the DMFC in a single computational domain.  A commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software package, Fluent\u00ae, is employed to solve species transport and electrochemical equations simultaneously.  The model results discover an interesting interplay between the local current density and methanol crossover rate distributions for the first time, indicating that the anode flow field design and methanol feeding concentration are two key parameters for the optimal cell performance.  When considering electron transport and interfacial liquid coverage on the cathode backing surface, the predicted results provide further insight into the geometrical effect on current density distribution and water transport through the membrane.  With an accurate interfacial coverage correlation, water balance between the anode and cathode can be potentially tailored to accommodate the use of high concentration of methanol as fuel, without sacrificing cell performance.\nThe future work of numerical modeling should involve more complete solutions including both steady state and transient state, and more efficient solutions using improved numerical algorithms.

The concept of using operational parameter data, collected by monitoring the work cycle of a roof bolting unit drilling into roof and ribs, to predict geological features of interest has been proposed in the past and studied in the last few decades. Some smart drilling systems have been developed to implement this concept, but despite their limited success on joint detection and/or rock classification, they fail to identify hairline joints, (aperture less than 3.175 mm) and discriminate between rocks with similar strengths. \nThis research aimed to advance the existing smart roof bolting systems to enhance their capabilities to sense geological features of interest along boreholes. To achieve this objective, full-scale laboratory tests were conducted involving a set of concrete blocks with various strength properties and small joints to simulate drilling from rocks of various strength properties into another.  Some pattern recognition algorithms were developed to detect pre-designed joints. To improve capabilities of the existing algorithms, several composite parameters were introduced to provide collaborative decisions for locating the joints. Moreover, wavelet analysis was also employed to improve pattern recognition algorithms and therefore to enhance their capabilities for joint detection.\nA set of additional holes were also drilled into a block that included joints at four different angles (15o, 30o, 45, and 60o) relative to the direction of drilling.  The area between the joints were filled with grout having various strength. Also, a sample composed of blocks of various rocks were cast in grout to represent variation of rock strata while drilling. The rocks used in this composite block included soft shale, sandstone, limestone and shale with strength ranging from 3 to 130 MPa. These tests allowed examination of the capabilities to identify angled joints, while generating data for the programs for estimating rock strength.\nThe result of the analysis of the drilling parameters proved that joints with smaller aperture (less than `3 mm, 1/8th inch) could be successfully detected at high rates, reaching 94% by using feed pressure.  The algorithms have also resulted in generating various amounts of false alarms, but the improved algorithms have been able to reduce the false alarms down to 14 in a set of 156 drill holes tested.  The use of composite parameter RP/FP/PR and the same algorithms could increase the detection rate to 97%, with false alarms reduced to 9.  Use of wavelet and other noise filtering systems could also improve the detection rates and reduce false alarms compared to the straight use of single drilling parameters but could not substantially increase the detection rates.  Therefore, it was concluded that the use of composite parameters was sufficient for the data set that is currently available. The same was true for detection of angled joints, but the available data in this setting was only on a few drill holes.\nAs for the estimation of rock strengths by monitoring drilling parameters, data from drilling into the composite sample showed very good correlation between Field Penetration Index (FPI), which is calculated from feed pressure and drilling rate, and rock strength values.  This is especially true when a Wear Index (WI), based drilling distance on a given bit, was used to adjust the calculated values of FPI and account for the wear on the drill bit. Correlation coefficient for statistical analysis of rock strength data from drilling parameters in the limited full-scale drilling tests were around R2 = 92%.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16142], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Wenpeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "first_name_ssi": "Wenpeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mining Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Derek Elsworth", "Shimin Liu", "Jeremy M.

The chemistry and applications of phosphazenes is also outlined.\nChapter 2 deals with the synthesis of a series of densely grafted star- and comb- shaped molecular brushes composed of polystyrene, poly(tert-butyl acrylate) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) prepared by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) using either cyclotriphosphazenes or polyphosphazenes as initiators. The grafting conditions were optimized for various monomers. The kinetics of the reaction were first-order with respect to the monomer concentration in both the cyclotriphosphazene and polyphosphazene systems. The lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) brush polymers was measured by both dynamic light scattering (DLS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), showed a sharp phase transition at 33 \u00b0C. Furthermore, star- and comb-block copolymers with a hard polystyrene core and a soft poly(tert-butyl acrylate) shell were also synthesized.\nChapter 3 outlines the preparation of densely grafted star- and comb-shaped molecular brushes composed of poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] produced via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), species that were quaternized with iodomethane, iodobutane, iodoheptane, iododecane and iodododecane. Electrospinning of the quaternized brushes gave rise to microfibers with diameters in the range of 700 nm to 1.1 \u03bcm. The antibacterial activity of the quaternized brush species in both aqueous solution and as fibrous solids against Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been evaluated. In aqueous solution, star-shaped brushes quaternized with iodoheptane showed the best antibacterial effect, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) as low as 250 \u03bcg mL-1. In the fibrous solid state, more than 99% of E. coli were killed within 2 hr after contacting 100 mg of microfibers electrospun from the star-shaped brush polymers quaternized with either iododecane or iodododecane.\nChapter 4 covers the synthesis and characterization of UV-cleavable star polymers composed of amphiphilic block copolymer arms and a UV-cleavable core. The inner lipophilic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and the outer hydrophilic poly[poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate] (PPEGMA) were grafted by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The effects of various factors, such as molecular weight, solution concentration, solvent and monomer on the photodegradation rate of the star polymers were studied in details. Significant aggregation of the polymer micelles in aqueous solution was detected by DLS with hydrodynamic radii of 86 and 111 nm for the two star-PMMA-PPEGMA micelles. The critical aggregation concentration (CAC) of star-PMMA179-PPEGMA89-2 was 0.0026 g/L and 0.022 g/L before and after UV-irradiation, indicating the reduced stability of the polymer micellar structures after UV-irradiation. As a result, spontaneous dissociation of cleaved micelles can be induced by the dilution effect in the human body for stimulus-controlled drug release.\nChapter 5 deals with substituent exchange reactions of sodium 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxide with trimeric and tetrameric aryloxycyclophosphazenes. The ease of displacement of OAr in cyclic trimeric and tetrameric molecules by CF3CH2O- increased significantly with the presence of electron-withdrawing substituents in the polyphosphazene in the order, phenoxy << 4-formylphenoxy < 4-cyanophenoxy \u2248 4-nitrophenoxy. Fully substituted 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxyphosphazene trimer and tetramer were formed by side group exchange, but these reactions were followed by an attack by the nucleophile on the \u03b1-carbon of the 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy groups linked to phosphorus to give a species in which one trifluoroethoxy group had been replaced by an ONa unit, and  bis(trifluoroethyl) ether was formed as a side product.\nChapter 6 describes the study of side group exchange reactions for short chain linear oligomeric phosphazenes, (RO)4P[N=P(OR2)]nOR (n = 6, 10, 20, and 40) as models for the corresponding linear high polymers (n ~ 15,000).  Specifically, the exchange behavior of oligomers where OR = OCH2CF3, OC6H5, OC6H4CHO-p, OC6H4CN-p, and OC6H4NO2-p with sodium trifluoroethoxide was examined.  The ease of aryloxy group replacement by trifluoroethoxy increased with the electron-withdrawing character in the order OR = OC6H5 << OC6H4CHO-p < OC6H4CN-p < OC6H4NO2-p, but the reaction was efficient only if the phosphazene contained no more than 20 repeating units.  However, attempts to force the slower reactions by the use of excess sodium trifluoroethoxide induced secondary reactions at the trifluoroethoxy units already introduced to produce CF3CH2OCH2CF3 and insert -O- Na+ units in their place.  The longest chain model underwent side group exchange reactions preferentially at the end units.\nChapter 7 discusses similar side group exchange reactions for linear high polymeric organophosphazenes, [N=P(OR2)]n (n ~ 15,000). Specifically, the exchange behavior of polymers where OR = OCH2CF3, OCH2CF2CF2CF2CF2H, OCH2Cl3, OC6H4CHO-p, OC6H4CN-p, and OC6H4NO2-p with sodium trifluoroethoxide was examined. No aryloxy group replacement by trifluoroethoxy was detected, due to the well-protected backbone of polyphosphazenes by aryloxy side groups. For the exchange behavior of [N=P(OCH2CF3)2]n and [N=P(OCH2CF2CF2CF2CF2H)2]n with NaOCH2CF2CF2CF2CF2H and NaOCH2CF3, partial substituent exchange could be achieved for both reactions. Furthermore, these side group exchange reactions are followed by reactions that introduce \u2013O-Na+ groups attached to phosphorus in place of organic substituents, and this is a mechanism for subsequent hydrolysis and molecular weight decline. Substituent exchange reactions do appear to be an alternative synthetic approach in the synthesis of many polyphosphazenes, including the recently discovered trichloroethoxy/trifluoroethoxy containing polyphosphazenes.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8192], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Xiao ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock", "Harry R Allcock", "John V Badding", "Benjamin James Lear", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harry R Allcock, Dissertation Advisor", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Chair", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polyphosphazene", "exchange reaction", "brush polymer", "antibacterial", "drug release"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "HEAVY CHAIN FERRITIN SIRNA DELIVERED BY CATIONIC LIPOSOMES ENHANCES RADIATION AND CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC EFFICACY FOR TREATMENT OF GLIOMA \n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "11247", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6674", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Approximately fifty percent of gliomas especially glioblastoma multiforme(GBM)are resistant to radiation and chemotherapy.  Therefore, efforts to develop new mechanisms to enhance the efficacy of current treatment strategies are clearly warranted. Glioma cells, similar to many other malignant tumor cells, have a robust appetite for iron to support their rapid growth and high metabolic rate. With elevated levels of iron uptake, a mechanism to protect cells from augmented iron induced oxidative damage is needed. This protection is likely provided by the intracellular iron storage protein ferritin. Ferritin has been detected in the cytosol, mitochondria and nucleus of almost all malignant tumor cells. Overexpression of H-ferritin in nuclei of glioma cells appear to protect DNA from iron induced oxidative damage and promote transcription. Overexpression of H-ferritin in nuclei of breast cancer cells and cervical cancer cells was also found to be associated with drug resistance. These findings lead to the central hypothesis of my thesis, silencing of H-ferritin by siRNA enhances the radiation and chemotherapeutic efficacy for treatment of glioma. It is anticipated that silencing of H-ferritin using gene therapy will decrease resistance to chemo/radiation therapy. To deliver a therapeutic dose of siRNA, I had to first develop a delivery system and chose cationic liposomes.  Thus, there were three specific aims for my thesis: Aim1: development and characterization of cationic liposomes described in chapter 2. Aim2: investigation of whether silencing of heavy chain ferritin using gene therapy enhances radiation and chemotherapeutic efficacy for the treatment of glioma (illustrated in chapter 3.I). Aim 2 was further expanded to investigate the treatment of breast cancer, as well as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors. Aim3: examination of the potential roles of H-ferritin in the progression of malignant cancers (illustrated in chapter 3.II). A number of cell lines; human glioma U251 and U87 cells, neurofibrama #215 sNF96.2 cells, and breast cancer MCF-7 cells were selected for our in vitro models, and athymic nude mice were selected as our in vivo model.  Cationic liposomes (C-liposomes) were prepared and characterized for use as a gene delivery vehicle. The cytotoxicity of C-liposomes was tested in vitro and in vivo. SiRNA was incorporated into C-liposomes to form C-liposomes:siRNA complexes. The uptake of C-liposomes:siRNA into glioma cells was confirmed, and the mechanism of uptake was identified.  Radiation and chemotherapeutic efficacy were assessed after H-ferritin was down regulated. The potential role of H-ferritin in biological pathways was investigated by evaluating the effects on DNA conformation, the DNA repair related protein MGMT, DNA synthesis (by evaluating incorporation of BrdU and 3H-thymidine), and apoptotic activities. \nThe C-liposomes exhibited safe, applicable, and stable traits, and its uptake into glioma cells depended on the endosomal pathway.  Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that siRNA delivered in this manner, decreased H-ferritin protein expression by 90% in U251 cells, and 70% in MCF-7 cells within 48 hours.  This decrease in H-ferritin expression was associated with a decrease in the LD50 for, nitrosoureas carmustine (BCNU), from concentrations greater than 100 \u00b5M to 40 \u00ecM in the U251 cells, 30 \u00b5M in MCF-7 cells, and 18 \u00b5M in MPNST cells.  In addition, knockdown of H-ferritin was associated with a 50% increase in cell death of U251 cells using 20 Gy of radiation in vitro. The in vivo efficacy of siRNA delivered by C-liposomes was tested in an athymic nude mouse subcutaneous glioma tumor model. Intratumoral injections of C-liposomes containing H-ferritin siRNA reduced the required effective dose of BCNU for tumor suppression by more than 50%. Moreover, intratumoral injections of C-liposomes containing H-ferritin siRNA with 4Gy radiation suppressed tumor progression by more than 90% compared with C-liposomes containing non-specific siRNA. \n The interaction of H-ferritin with DNA in the presence of BCNU was investigated in vitro by supercoil relaxation assays. These assays demonstrated that H-ferritin maintained DNA in a relaxed form, which would promote DNA transcription even in the presence of radiation and chemotoxins. In addition to the protective function on H-ferritin on DNA, the anti tumor effect of H-ferritin siRNA was associated with activation of the apoptotic caspase-3 pathway. However, H-ferritin did not appear to facilitate DNA repair through the MGMT pathway.  \n\t In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the vulnerability of cancer cells to radiation and chemotherapy can be increased by reducing H-ferritin expression. The importance of ferritin in cancer cell biology suggests that efficient delivery of siRNA could be a viable therapeutic option. As importantly, we have demonstrated that siRNA can be delivered effectively by C-liposomes in an in vivo tumor model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6671], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Xiaoli ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaoli", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Robert Connor", "James Robert Connor", "Ira Joseph Ropson", "Kathryn F Lanoue", "Achuthamangalam B Madhankumar", "Alistair J Barber"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Robert Connor, Dissertation Advisor", "James Robert Connor, Committee Chair", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member", "Kathryn F Lanoue, Committee Member", "Achuthamangalam B Madhankumar, Committee Member", "Alistair J Barber, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["siRNA", "liposomes", "ferritin"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCE ON OSTEOBLASTIC CELL GROWTH IN VITRO: FROM PHENOTYPE TO GENOTYPE\n", "id": "7114", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6646", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "  Extended human life span and higher activity levels at later age have greatly increased the need for orthopedic healthcare. Improved hard-tissue repair, augmentation, or replacement has thus become a significant challenge for orthopedic biomaterials and orthopedic surgery, as well as a need that is driving orthopedic tissue engineering. The design and development of a new generation of orthopedic biomaterials largely depends on establishing relationships (so-called structure-property relationships) between material characteristics and the nature of the interactions with hard-tissue cells (osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts, and chondrocytes). However, the complex cellular and molecular events that occur on the cell-material interface are still poorly understood.\n  \n  Toward quantifying structure-property relationships for a model osteoblast cell line - hFOB 1.19 (conditionally immortalized human osteoblast; ATCC, CRL-11372), this was examined for short- (0 < t < 72 hr) and medium-term (0 < t < 6 d) interactions with materials of varying surface chemistry/energy. Results revealed a strong correlation of cell attachment and proliferation with substratum surface energy in a manner paralleling that previously observed with soft-tissue cells. The hFOB cells exhibited a clear and reproducible attachment and proliferation preference for hydrophilic surfaces over hydrophobic counterparts. Furthermore, hFOB attachment and proliferation to fully-water-wettable glass were reproducibly less than those to tissue-culture-grade polystyrene (TCPS) whereas attachment and proliferation to fully-water-wettable quartz was significantly higher than TCPS. Alkaline phosphatase activity was evaluated as a marker of hFOB differentiation and did not strongly correlate with surface energy. Morphological analysis indicates that hFOB discrimination against hydrophobic surfaces at early stages of cell-substratum contact was substantially mitigated over time. However, &#945;v integrin downregulation and osteopontin upregulation persisted for up to 6 days in culture on hydrophobic surfaces. Thus, gene regulation leading to clear preference of hFOB for hydrophilic surfaces over hydrophobic counterparts is particularly incisive at early stages (< 3 d) of cell-surface interactions but can persist for longer periods for cells attached on very poorly cytocompatible surfaces. This research incorporating with physiochemical and cellular/molecular approaches systematically investigated cell-material interactions in order to establish structure-property relationships.\n\n  Two model osteoblastic cell lines, hFOB 1.19 and MC3T3-E1 (ATCC, CRL-2593) cells were cultured in an advanced bioreactor to examine long-term (up to 30 days) microenvironmental influences on cell growth and development. Cells formed 4~6 interconnecting multilayers in the bioreactor with 2~3 times lower level of apoptosis, stable extracellular matrix production, high differentiation (~ 30% increase for hFOB and ~ 1.6 times increase for MC3T3) and matrix mineralization levels (~ 60% increase for hFOB and ~ 30% increase for MC3T3), relative to control polystyrene. The results suggest that this cell-culture technique can sustain osteoblast cultures up to a period of 30 days with superior performance relative to the conventional tissue cultureware. Therefore, this in vitro culture technique that permits unattended long-term (\u00a3 30 days) culture within a stabilized and oxygenated culture environment shows promise to be a valuable tool for the study of long-term cell/protein-mediated bone remodeling, as well as cell-material/scaffold interactions. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6643], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Xiaomei ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaomei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Erwin A Vogler", "Paul Wencil Brown", "Henry Joseph Donahue", "Carol V Gay", "Michael J Eppihimer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Erwin A Vogler, Committee Chair", "Paul Wencil Brown, Committee Member", "Henry Joseph Donahue, Committee Member", "Carol V Gay, Committee Member", "Michael J Eppihimer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["osteoblast", "cell growth", "phenotype", "genotype"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "BORON DOPING OF SINGLE WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES", "id": "9933", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6647", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis addresses the improvement of electrical properties of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), grown by different techniques, by a stable substitutional boron doping.

The p-type doping is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. The Raman D-band results and the line shape of EELS spectra show that boron is fitted into the sp2 lattice of the tube wall. B-doping was found to downshift the positions of the optical absorption bands associated with van Hove singularities (E11s E22s and E11m ) by ~40 meV relative to their positions in the acid treated and annealed SWNTs.

Subjects (n=101: 51 women, 50 men) were fed an isocaloric heart healthy diet containing one of the five treatment oils incorporated in a smoothie for 4 weeks followed by a 4 weeks break between experimental diets. The five vegetable oils were: Canola oil (62.8% MUFA, 29.3% PUFA: 19.5% LA, 10% ALA), CanolaOleic oil (72% MUFA, 17% PUFA: 15% LA, 2% ALA), CanolaDHA (63.8% MUFA, 13% LA, 6% DHA), corn/safflower oil (69.3% LA, 17.6% MUFA) and flax/safflower oil (69.4% PUFA: 37.5% LA, 32% ALA, 17.9% MUFA). \nThe first study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of five vegetable oils (low in saturated fatty acid (SFA) with varying unsaturated fatty acid profiles) on abdominal fat mass in subjects with or at risk for MetS. After four weeks, reductions in abdominal fat mass were observed when the Canola (-54.59 g, p=0.0264) and CanolaOleic oil diets (-66.09 g, p=0.0245) were compared with the Flax/Saff oil diet. The reduction of android fat mass from baseline in response to the Canola (p=0.042) and CanolaOleic (p=0.007) were both significant. There was no difference in changes of abdominal fat mass from baseline for the CanolaDHA, Corn/Saff and Flax/Saff oil diets. The android to gynoid fat mass ratio was decreased in males after the CanolaOleic oil diet compared with the Flax/Saff oil diet (0.71 versus 0.73, p=0.0067). Attenuation of central obesity was associated with a reduction in blood pressure in response to the Canola (SBP r = 0.26, p=0.062; DBP r=0.38, p=0.0049) and CanolaOleic oil diets (SBP r = 0.39 p=0.004; DBP r=0.45, p=0.0006). Moreover, the decrease in central obesity was associated with a reduction in TG on the CanolaOleic oil diet (r = 0.42, p=0.0017). \n The second study was designed to investigate the effects of five vegetable oils on HDL function measured via cholesterol efflux capacity. The Canola, CanolaOleic, CanolaDHA, Corn/Saff and Flax/Saff oil diets increased serum mediated CEx capacity from THP-1 macrophages by 39.1%, 33.6%, 55.3%, 49.2% and 50.7% respectively, compared to baseline (p<0.05 for all). Weight status was an independent predictor of the serum mediated CEx capacity. Participants with a normal BMI had a greater increase in CEx capacity compared with overweight and obese participants. Waist circumference and abdominal adiposity were negatively correlated with serum mediated CEx capacity (r = -0.25, p = 0.012, r = -0.33, p = 0.017, respectively).\n\tThe third study was designed to explore the relationship among VAT, SAT and anthropometric measurements in a subgroup of study participants (n=14).

Computation for the proposed likelihood-based approach in the joint modeling framework is particularly challenging since the estimation procedure involves numerical integration over multi-dimensional space for the random effects. Existing numerical integration methods become ineffective or infeasible for JM. We introduce a numerical integration method based on computer experimental design for JM. We conduct Monte Carlo simulations to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed procedure and compare the new numerical integration method with the existing ones. We further illustrate the proposed procedure via an empirical study of smoking cessation data.\n\nSecondly, we propose a general nonparametric JM to incorporate both the time-varying survival coefficients and the longitudinal process with an irregular trajectory. Such a model is more flexible than the existing parametric joint models, and requires more powerful computational capability. We employ B-splines to approximate the functional parameters and use a maximum joint likelihood  approach for parameter estimation. The estimates are calculated by the newly introduced computing algorithm, the EM-DoIt algorithm, and simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed estimation and computing procedures. The proposed model is applied to a smoking cessation study to explore the dynamic structure of the longitudinal process and the possible time-varying relationships between the negative affect and time to lapse. \n\nFinally, we propose a JM with discrete longitudinal covariates, which can also be fitted using the maximum joint likelihood approach, and implemented via the EM-DoIt algorithm. We conduct a few numerical studies to test the capability of the proposed approach in handling some specific types of longitudinal covariates, such as binary, count, and zero inflated discrete covariates. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10230], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Xiaoyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaoyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Runze Li", "Runze Li", "David Russell Hunter", "Zhibiao Zhao", "Stephanie Trea Lanza"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Runze Li, Dissertation Advisor", "Runze Li, Committee Chair", "David Russell Hunter, Committee Member", "Zhibiao Zhao, Committee Member", "Stephanie Trea Lanza, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Joint modeling", "Longitudinal Study", "Survival Analysis", "EM-algorithm", "Nonparametric"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Control Setpoints, Economizers and Energy Recovery Systems on Building Energy Use", "id": "19829", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8983", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This paper presents one possible method of applying simulation to examine the impact of building HVAC system setpoints such as air/water temperature, flow rate and outdoor air fraction on represented building operation for a typical system design and operation.

The objective is to determine the range of energy usage and the potential for reducing or minimizing building energy requirements by dynamically adjusting setpoints.  The analysis focuses on the energy consumption condition in four different climate zones.

On the one hand, with huge amount of comprehensive social network data and various types of user-generated contents made available for analysis, we are able to conduct in-depth studies on the scale we never had before. The data will help us better understand people's opinions and activities, capture trends in our society and improve social services. On the other hand, however, such data require novel techniques for modeling, extraction and processing to reveal its real value, because many existing solutions cannot handle new issues such as heterogeneous data type, scalability and efficiency requirement, etc. \n\nIn this thesis, we introduce the concept of social-enriched data, which is defined as the social connection graphs as well as user-created contents distributed on the graphs, to represent the data collected in the aforementioned online social services. We identified several issues in handling the social-enriched data and proposed a set of novel solutions to tackle these issues. \n\nFirst, as people tend to interact with others both through the online services and in their offline lives, capturing the properties of heterogeneous social networks with both online and offline components becomes critical. Hence, we investigated a new type of social network as Event-based Social Networks(EBSNs) as a typical example for the heterogeneous graph. The EBSNs contain both online social interactions as in other conventional online social networks, as well as offline social interactions captured in offline activities. Based on real data collected from Meetup, a social event organizing service, we analyzed EBSN properties and discovered many unique and interesting characteristics, such as heavy-tailed degree distributions and strong locality of social interactions. In addition, we subsequently studied the heterogeneous nature (co-existence of both online and offline social interactions) of EBSNs on two challenging problems: community detection and information flow. We found that communities detected in EBSNs are more cohesive than those in other types of social networks (e.g. location-based social networks). In the context of information flow, we studied the event recommendation problem and significantly improved the recommendation with a community-based diffusion model which infuses both online and offline interactions.\n\nSecond, as user-created contents consist of one essential ingredient of many online social services, we chose to study it in a widely applied practice, i.e., recommendations. In particular, we focused on the problem of recommending contents for a group of users by utilizing the social context. To extract the group user preference information from the social-enriched data, we analyzed the decision making process in user groups, and proposed a personal impact topic (PIT) model as a type of probabilistic generative model. The PIT model effectively identifies the group preference profile for a given group by mining the individual preferences and personal impacts of group members from group recommendation history. Further, we integrate the friends connection information to obtain an extended personal impact topic (E-PIT) model. Through comprehensive data analysis and evaluations conducted on three real datasets, we demonstrate that the social based PIT and E-PIT approachs achieved good performance.\n\nFinally, to support efficient data analysis and combat the scalability issues, we proposed two data analyzing tools for social-enriched data, namely, distributed graph summary and uncertain skyline query. The distributed graph summary algorithms summarize a large scale graph into an abstract graph, where the topologies of the original graph is preserved. As online social networks can become extremely large and complex, graph summarization is crucial in uncovering useful insights about the patterns hidden in the underlying graphs. In our study, we introduce three distributed algorithms enable parallel processing of graph summarization, which produce good quality summaries and scales well with increasing data sizes. The uncertain skyline operator is a data filtering operator to identify a set of data items that are not dominated by any other items, where each item is represented as a multidimensional data tuple with probabilistic attribute values. The operator is particularly useful for multi-criteria data analysis and filtering for user created contents. Specifically, the U-Skyline query searches for a set of tuples that has the highest probability (aggregated from all possible scenarios) as the skyline answer. In order to answer U-Skyline queries efficiently, we propose a series of optimization techniques for query processing. Our performance evaluation shows that our algorithm is 10-100 times faster than the state-of-art solutions.\n\nSocial-enriched data analysis gains more and more research interests today. This thesis presents pioneer works in several challenging topics in this area, and we believe that our solutions will provide real value to the utilization of social-enriched data in practice.

However, antiviral strategies against RNA virus infections are very limited. For example, there are no FDA approved (Food and Drug Administration) antiviral compounds for the treatment of picornavirus infection. Only three vaccines are available to prevent the transmission of picornaviruses. The severity of public health issues associated with these viruses and the scarcity of treatment options make the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines high priorities. One very promising antiviral target is the virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The RdRp is the most conserved protein among RNA viruses. One antiviral strategy is to modulate the RdRp\u2019s error rate of nucleotide incorporation. The working principle of this antiviral strategy derives from the \u2018quasispecies\u2019 nature of RNA viruses. RNA viruses utilize the error-prone RdRp to replicate a genetically diverse population where viral genomes do not contain a unique sequence but a pool of genetically variable sequences. It has been shown that mere two-fold changes in the RdRp error rate (either higher or lower error) lead to viral attenuation. Increasing the viral mutation rate through the action of nucleoside analogs leads to lethal mutagenesis due to the accumulation of an excess amount of mutations and loss of viable genetic information. Decreasing the viral mutation rate is also detrimental to the virus due to a constrained viral ability to adapt to the host environment. Understanding the nucleotide selection mechanisms of RdRps would therefore opens up new treatment strategies including the development of live, attenuated vaccines and/or antiviral drugs. \n\tPoliovirus (PV) RdRp is a great model system to study the nucleotide selection mechanism. This dissertation mainly focuses on investigations into the fidelity mechanism of PV RdRp via a combination of kinetic and NMR experiments. Among all the DNA and RNA polymerases, the prechemistry conformational change is a critical fidelity checkpoint. In RdRps and other polymerases, it has been proposed that this step involves the rearrangement of the triphosphate group and nucleobase of the incoming nucleotide into productive conformation, and the repositioning of a general acid to help catalyze phosphodiester bond formation. In PV RdRp, conserved structural motif D is responsible for the repositioning of the general acid via an \u201copen\u201d to a \u201cclosed\u201d state transition during the prechemistry conformational change. In this dissertation, I show that the T362I substitution, which originates from the Sabin 1 vaccine strain, lowers enzyme fidelity by shifting the motif D equilibrium more to the \u201cclosed\u201d state. PV encoding this low fidelity variant is more sensitive to ribavirin and is moderately attenuated in a mouse model. Other Sabin substitutions in the RdRp also change catalysis and fidelity. I show that the Sabin RdRp, which has all four substitutions (i.e. D53N, Y73H, K250E and T362I), discriminates against nucleotides with noncognate nucleobase to the same extent as wild-type (WT) enzyme, but more efficiently catalyzes incorporation of 2\u2019-deoxy nucleotides. My studies suggest that there is more selective pressure to maintain nucleobase discrimination than sugar discrimination in the Sabin vaccine strain. \n\tBesides motif D, motif F is another structure that we propose is involved in nucleotide selection. I propose that substitutions on motif F lead to changes in RdRp fidelity by perturbing triphosphate conformations necessary for efficient nucleotide addition. My studies on the nucleotide selection mechanism of PV RdRp likely extend to RdRps of other viruses due to the strong structural and functional similarities among the RdRps. As such, my studies open up new possibilities for engineering attenuated vaccine candidates through modifications of motifs D and F in these RNA viruses. Such developments will be critical in the treatment of current and future virus outbreaks. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11469], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Xinran ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xinran", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David D Boehr", "Craig Eugene Cameron", "Scott A Showalter", "John H Golbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David D Boehr, Dissertation Advisor", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Committee Member", "Scott A Showalter, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Poliovirus", "nucleotide", "selection", "fidelity", "polymerase"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A MUTILPLE VIEW: A STUDY OF BILINGUAL EDUCATION ON XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION", "id": "18880", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8615", "abstract_tesi": "The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is located in the northwestern China.

Due to the large design space in composition and temperature for many new superalloys and coatings, trial-and-error methodologies of the past prove ineffective and costly. All mechanical or corrosion properties for superalloys depend heavily on the processing and the resulting phases. Multi-component alloys often contain a gamut of phases, many of which are actually detrimental to the alloy. This problem is exacerbated with the addition of refractory transition metals such as Nb, Re, and W to improve mechanical properties. However, computational phase diagram studies for the constituent systems have proven successful for the prediction of detrimental phases in superalloys. Unfortunately, some of the constituent systems have not been examined in detail, one of which is the Nb-Re binary system.\nFirst, a thermodynamic description of the Nb\u2013Re binary system is developed by means of the CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) method supplemented by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and experimental data in the literature. In addition to terminal solution phases in the Nb-Re system, there are two intermetallic phases, sigma (\u03c3) and chi (\u03c7), all modeled with sublattice models. Special quasi-random structures (SQS) are employed to mimic the random mixing of the bcc, hcp, and fcc solid solution phases from first-principles. Finite temperature thermodynamic properties of end-members and dilute mixing in each sublattice of the complex \u03c3 and \u03c7 phases are predicted from first-principles calculations and the Debye-Gr\u00fcneisen model. The calculated phase diagram agrees well with selected experimental phase equilibrium data in the literature.\nThe utility of the Debye-Gr\u00fcneisen model is then investigated with respect to its fitting parameter known as the scaling factor, and it is found that the prediction of finite-temperature properties can be improved by modification of this factor. This scaling factor is studied using bcc, fcc, hcp systems and the Mg-Zn binary system due to the abundance of thermodynamic data. Predicted Debye temperatures (\u0398_D), using a calculated scaling factor, show good agreement with experiments and improvements over the scaling factor derived by Moruzzi et al. Finite-temperature thermodynamic properties of intermetallics are investigated to show the efficiency and improved accuracy of the calculated scaling factor. However, for the intermetallic Mg2Zn11, the Debye-Gr\u00fcneisen model cannot account for anomalous lattice dynamics at low temperatures. The calculated scaling factor is then used throughout the present work for finite-temperature predictions.\nAnother missing piece of the literature includes the thermodynamics of Al-Co-Cr-Ni bond coat system used in the protection of superalloys. First, it is found that there is an incomplete description of the crucial ternary Al-Co-Cr subsystem. As a result, the phase relations and thermodynamic properties of this system are investigated using first-principles calculations based on DFT and phase-equilibria experiments that led to X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe micro-analysis (EPMA) measurements. A thermodynamic description is developed by means of the CALPHAD method using experimental and computational data from the present work and the literature. Emphasis is placed on modeling the bcc-A2, B2, fcc-\u03b3, and \u03c3 phases in the temperature range of 1173 to 1623 K. Liquid, bcc-A2 and fcc-\u03b3 phases are modeled using substitutional solution descriptions. First-principles SQS calculations predict a large bcc-A2 (disordered)/B2 (ordered) miscibility gap, in agreement with experiments. A partitioning model is then used for the A2/B2 phase to effectively describe the order-disorder transitions. The critically assessed thermodynamic description describes all phase equilibria data well. A2/B2 transitions are also shown to agree well with previous experimental findings.\nIn order to build a correct quaternary description of the Al-Co-Cr-Ni system, additional ternaries must also be modeled to combine with the Al-Co-Cr system. The phase relations and thermodynamic properties of the Al-Co-Ni and Co-Cr-Ni ternary alloys are investigated using first-principles calculations based on DFT. Thermodynamic descriptions are developed by means of the CALPHAD method using experimental and computational data from the present work and the literature. In addition to the phases found in the Al-Co-Cr system, the ordered fcc-\u03b3 phase, L12-\u03b3\u2019, is taken into account. A partitioning model is used again for the A2/B2 phase to effectively describe the order-disorder transitions when coupled with the Al-Co-Cr system. The thermodynamic description describes all phase equilibria data well. The Al-Co-Cr, Al-Co-Ni, and Co-Cr-Ni systems are combined with the Al-Cr-Ni system from Dupin et al. [1] to produce a complete Al-Co-Cr-Ni thermodynamic model. Predictions are shown to agree well with experimental alloys from collaborators. It is shown that by critically assessing each of the ternary subsystems, a full quaternary description can be developed successfully with minimal use of excess thermodynamic parameters.\nThis thesis also studies the stability of interfaces that form in Ni-base superalloys during microstructure evolution processes. Understanding the coarsening of superalloy microstructures during processing or service requires the knowledge of the stabilities of solid-solid interfaces. As a result, the technologically important {100} coherent \u03b3/\u03b3\u2019 interface is investigated using first-principles calculations. The change in the interfacial energy of the Ni-Al \u03b3/\u03b3\u2019 coherent interface when a ternary element is segregated near the interface is studied. Binary calculations are performed to validate previous results; it is predicted that the Ni-Al \u03b3/\u03b3\u2019 interfacial energy is 19 mJ/m2 at 0 K which is in agreement with the literature. When a ternary element is added into the system and partitions to the \u03b3 phase, the interfacial energy can vary between 4-28 mJ/m2. It is found that the additions of the Mo, Re, and W elements can decrease the interfacial energy significantly to 4-5 mJ/m2 while the additions of the Ru and Pt elements can increase it to 25-28 mJ/m2. When elements reside in \u03b3, magnetic ordering contributions at the interface are shown to have the greatest effect on the change in the interfacial energy. Ferromagnetic elements Co and Fe are shown to have little effect on the interfacial energy as they do not disrupt magnetic spin across the interface. All ternary additions to \u03b3\u2019 are shown to increase the interfacial energy except for Pt, which decreases it to 16 mJ/m2. Otherwise, ternary additions in \u03b3\u2019 can vary the interfacial energies between 20-37 mJ/m2.\nOverall, a fundamental understanding of the thermodynamics relevant to Ni-base superalloys and coatings is developed using first-principles and CALPHAD approaches.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10626], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Xuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu", "Zi Kui Liu", "Long Qing Chen", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "William George Noid", "Brian Gleeson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Zi Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "William George Noid, Committee Member", "Brian Gleeson, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Superalloy", "MCrAlY", "CALPHAD", "Nb-Re", "First-Principles"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Dissolution of Clay Minerals and Redox Reactions between Clay Minerals and Uranium under High Pressure Co2 Conditions", "id": "17595", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8195", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Geological carbon sequestration is a promising technology to mitigate global warming. However, there are concerns that the acidic nature of the injected supercritical CO2 may dissolve minerals in the injection well seals or in other regions of the storage reservoir. Mineral dissolution could create pathways for CO2 to migrate to other geologic units. If mineral dissolution also mobilized contaminants (e.g., U, Pb, As), leakage of CO2 could pose risks to overlying drinking water reservoirs. In this study we examined the dissolution of specimen clay minerals in synthetic brine solutions under high pressure CO2 conditions (PT = 9.66 bar, PCO2 \u2265 8.66 bar CO2). Specimen clay minerals included nontronite NAu-2, montmorillonite SWy-2, and chlroite CCa-2. Unaltered and partially reduced NAu-2 (R-NAu-2) were used to measure the effect of clay-Fe(III) reduction on acid-promoted dissolution. Synthetic brines included 1.0 M NaCl, 0.33 M CaCl2, and 0.33 M Na2SO4. Uranium was used as a redox-active inorganic contaminant and was added either as soluble uranyl(VI) or sparingly soluble biogenic uraninite(IV). High pressure CO2 conditions were established by adding a measured mass of dry ice to a pressure tube containing clay mineral, brine, and U. Reaction kinetics were measured over a 15 day period by sacrificing pressure tubes, analyzing the supernatant for dissolved mineral components and U, and analyzing the speciation of Fe(II/III) in solution and in the clay mineral pellet. H3PO4-H2SO4 (1.40 M-0.50 M) was used to measure acid-promoted clay mineral dissolution in a stronger acid. Control reactors were maintained under ambient pressure conditions (PT = 1.0 bar, N2:H2 = 95:5%). \nFor three types of unaltered clay minerals in three different brines, very little dissolution occurred, showing these clay minerals are stable under high pressure CO2 conditions. In 1.40 M H3PO4-0.50 M H2SO4 solution, increased acidity enhanced dissolution of unaltered NAu-2 and partially reduced NAu-2. R-NAu-2 was easier to be dissolved than unaltered NAu-2 under high pressure CO2 conditions and in 1.40 M H3PO4-0.50 M H2SO4. Fe(II) was less stable in clay mineral and acid dissolved Fe had higher Fe(II)/Fe ratios than clay mineral itself. No redox reactions between unaltered or partially reduced NAu-2 with U(VI) was observed. UO2 was oxidized by unaltered NAu-2, and reaction had a faster rate and greater extent under high pressure CO2 conditions than under ambient pressure conditions ((PT = 1.0 bar, N2:H2 = 95:5%)). Also, the redox reaction enhanced dissolution of unaltered NAu-2.

These i-EAP actuators hold promises for applications including artificial muscles, robots, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS), and energy harvesting. On the other hand, one critical issue in utilizing i-EAPs for those applications is how to significantly improve the electromechanical performance, including the actuation speed, actuation strain level and efficiency. Particularly, extremely low efficiency is the major drawback of current i-EAP actuators. \nThis dissertation discusses the physics in ionic polymer composite actuators and develops solutions to improve the actuation strain, speed, and efficiency. One general approach through the entire dissertation is to electrically and electromechanically analyze ionic polymer composite actuators to identify the limiting factors, and design a strategy to guide material selection or device fabrication for better performance.   \nTwo types of ionic polymer actuators will be discussed: (i) ionic polymer conductive network composite (IPCNC) actuators that consist of an ionic liquid (IL) containing polymer membrane and large surface area composite electrodes, referred to as the \u201cIPCNC actuator\u201d; and (ii) IL containing ionic polymer membranes with planar Au electrodes, referred to as the \u201cionic polymer membrane actuator\u201d. While the composite electrodes in the IPCNCs provide large specific capacitance for ion storage which enhances the bending actuation, the ionic polymer membrane actuators offer a simple structure for device modeling and material analysis.\nIPCNC actuators are fabricated and discussed first. IPCNCs with disordered CNC nanomorphology (nanoscale morphology), mostly made with conducting nanoparticles, are discussed in Chapter 3, while IPCNCs with ordered CNC nanomorphology, in which vertically aligned carbon nanotubes (VA-CNTs) are implemented, are discussed in Chapter 4. In these chapters, electrical and electromechanical models are established to analyze the performance of IPCNC actuators.\nFirstly, electronic equivalent circuits are developed to model the complex frequency-dependent impedance and explain the initial response (t<10s) of ionic polymer composite actuators. It is found that the low frequency responses of these actuators indicate Warburg diffusion (semi-finite diffusion). When there is no CNC or when CNC is very thin (tens of nm), a simple equivalent circuit, which only consists of Warburg impedance AW, bulk resistance R, and electric double layer capacitance Cdl can be used, where Cdl and AW dominate the fast and slow responses of the actuator, respectively. When the CNC is thick (several \u00b5m), the aforementioned equivalent circuit is no longer adequate; therefore, the de Levi transmission line is introduced to model the CNC layer, which shows that the device transport time constant increases with CNC thickness. Secondly, by combining the time domain electric and electromechanical responses, a two-carrier model is established to explain the long time actuation response (t>10s), and also provide quantitative information on transport behavior of the two mobile ions (i.e., cation and anion) in IPCNCs. By employing this model, the total excess ions stored and strains generated by the cations and anions, and their transport times in the nanocomposites can be determined, which all depend critically on the morphologies of the conductor network nanocomposites. The model further reveals that, for EMI-Tf or EMI-BF4, anions have a larger effective ion size than cations, and thus dominate the long time response (t>10s) of the ionic polymer actuators, while cations account for the initial response (t<10s) of the actuators. Finally, IPCNCs with high volume fraction VA-CNTs are fabricated to improve the electromechanical performance of IPCNC actuators. The results demonstrate that the VA-CNTs create non-isotropic elastic modulus in the composite electrodes which markedly enhance the actuation strain (8.2%) compared to that of IPCNCs with RuO2 nanoparticles (2.1%), and provide inter-VA-CNT ion channels that enable faster actuation (\u03c4=0.82 s) than that of IPCNCs with RuO2 nanoparticles (\u03c4=3 s). \n\tBesides studies on IPCNC actuators, two other studies are performed on ionic polymer membrane actuators to understand the physics of ions transport in ionic liquid electrolytes and ion-polymer interaction, which are difficult to be tackled by directly studying the complex IPCNC actuators. \nElectrically, the ion distribution of the electrical double layer and the diffuse layer, which has been extensively analyzed with equivalent circuits, is of great interest. Hence, direct observations of the ion distribution in ionic polymer membrane actuator with 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride (BMMI-Cl) electrolyte are performed by employing Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). The results reveal that Cl- and BMMI+ accumulate near both cathode and anode due to a strong Coulomb force between the ions and the ion size difference (17 times) causes the BMMI+ space charge layers (~6 \u00b5m) to be much thicker than those of Cl- (~0.5 \u00b5m). These findings emphasize the importance of engineering the electrolyte for IPCNC actuators, as well as show the dominance of large ions on the long time actuation response. \nAt last, progress in addressing the electromechanical coupling between the ions and the electroactive polymers, is made by applying P(VDF-CTFE), crosslinked P(VDF-CTFE)/PMMA, and crosslinked P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) for ionic polymer membrane actuators. Compared to the conventional ionic polymers, such as Nafion and Aquivion ionomers that were popularly utilized in previous IPCNC actuator studies, these PVDF based polymers remarkably enhance the stress generation and significantly depress the charge consumption of the ionic polymer membrane actuators, both of which leads to higher energy conversion efficiency.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7370], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Yang ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Shizhuo Yin", "Ralph H Colby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ionic Electroactive Polymer", "Ionic Liquids", "Actuator"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Characterization of Global And Localized Material Degradation in Plates and Cylinders Via Nonlinear Interaction of Ultrasonic Guided Waves", "id": "22432", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9745", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Among all the applications for nondestructive evaluation (NDE) and structural health monitoring (SHM), failures occur at geometrical or compositional discontinuities. The material microstructural evolution that precedes macroscale damage exhibits a localized behavior due to high stress concentrations. Therefore, the capability to characterize these \u201clocalized hot spots\u201d is of significance to ensure the structure integrity. The cumulative second or third harmonics of guided waves resulting from a primary mode self interaction measures the average nonlinearity over the distance between transmitter and receiver, which are shown to be sensitive to \u201cglobalized\u201d material degradation, e.g. fatigue generated dislocation and persistent slip band substructures, creep induced precipitate-dislocation interactions, etc. This thesis provides a systematic analysis on the characteristics of higher order harmonic generation due to guided wave mode interactions which provide advantages to characterize global and localized material degradation.\n\tThis thesis starts with linear guided wave solutions in plates and pipes in terms of normal modes. A plate ray interpretation of the elastic waves propagation in pipes is proposed based on geometric acoustic concepts and a plate approximation. A helical inter-digital transducer is designed to excite pure flexural waves. The linear wave theories provide fundamentals to analyze higher order harmonic generation in waveguides. A generalized mathematical framework is formulated to investigate the nonlinear generations due to the interaction of two guided wave modes in an isotropic, homogeneous, weakly nonlinear waveguide. A total number of (N+1)(N+2)/2-3 nonlinear boundary problems are formulated due to the Nth order mode interactions in a waveguide with Kth order nonlinearity (N\u2264K). The analysis of a specific order of nonlinear problem can be conducted by adopting the corresponding order of the strain energy function. The quadractic and cubic nonlinear forcing terms that cause the generation of second and third order harmonic genation are derived within general curvilinear coordinates. \n\tThe characteristics of the internally resonant higher order harmonic generation in plates are explored thoroughly by considering waves with either shear horizontal (SH) or Rayleigh Lamb (RL) types. It is found that waves with either SH or RL type can be generated as internally resonant second or third order harmonics with specific patterns of primary mode interaction. Similiarly, an analysis is performed to identify the generation of internally resonant higher order harmonics in weakly nonlinear circular cylinders due to mode interactions based on the nonlinear forcing terms in curvilinear coordinates. The criteria are formulated by a synchronism condition, the circumferential orders of the primary modes, as well as the nature of the primary and the secondary wave fields, i.e., torsional or longitudinal. A generalized analysis that provides insight into the cumulative nature of the Nth order harmonics by Nth order interaction of two collimated waves is conducted by considering a cylinder with strain energy function written as Murnaghan\u2019s power series. The nature of the cumulative Nth order harmonics can be determined by the parity of the number of times the primary waves interact, and their circumferential orders. Nonlinear finite element simulations have been conducted which confirmed the generation of internally resonant higher order harmonics.\n\tThe theoretical guidelines enable us to characterize the global and localized material degradations using the nonlinear interaction of guided waves. A full length scanning of the material nonlinear generation has been conducted with two guided waves mode interaction in plates, which successfully identified the localized material degradation. Furthermore, a tomo-scanning algorithm has been proposed that characterizes multiple material degradation zones with nonlinear interactions of flexural waves in a pipe. Laboratory experiments are conducted that demonstrate that the nonlinear generation of guided waves are sensitive to material degradation such as plastic deformation zones and fatigue damage accumulation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9497], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Yang ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Victor Ward Sparrow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Dissertation Advisor", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Chair", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Localized material degradation", "nonlinear acoustic guided waves", "mode interaction", "material characterization."]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Approaches to reduce and integrate data in structured and high-dimensional regression problems in Genomics", "id": "26693", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11852", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Analysis of high-dimensional data has become increasingly important in several fields of the sciences and engineering. This is particularly true for Genomics with its expanding repertoire of high-throughput technologies. For many regression-like analyses, dimension reduction in the predictor space can be very effective. The most commonly used approaches assume that predictors and samples are similar in nature and can simultaneously participate in the reduction. However, recent high-throughput genomic data is often heterogeneous and structured; for instance, both samples and predictors may be labeled based on their origin and/or information available on their nature or function. Exploiting known structure in samples and predictors when performing dimension reduction can be an avenue for integrating data collected through multiple studies and diverse high-throughput platforms.\n\nTo address this challenge, we propose a novel Sufficient Dimension Reduction (SDR) approach that we call structured SDR, and one methodology to pursuit it, structured Ordinary Least Squares (sOLS), that is effective and parsimonious also when, as is the case in many Genomics applications, the number of available samples is relatively small compared to the number of predictors. sOLS combines ideas from existing SDR literature to merge reductions performed within groups of samples and/or predictors. Importantly, it utilizes a novel a version of OLS for grouped predictors that requires far less computation than other recently proposed groupwise SDR procedures, and provides an informal yet effective variable selection tool in these settings. We demonstrate the performance of sOLS by simulation and present a first application to genomic data. In addition, we extend our approach and methodology to be able to tackle regressions with binary or multivariate responses, as well as regressions with correlated observations. These extensions expand the application scope of structured SDR \u2013 e.g. to classification problems and the analysis of spatial data. They, too, are demonstrated through simulations and applications in Genomics and Health Care.\n\nThis dissertation holds the promise of providing the Genomics community with an effective data reduction and integration approach, and may also have broad applicability to complex data from other scientific fields.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11305], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Yang ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Francesca Chiaromonte", "Francesca Chiaromonte", "Bing Li", "Runze Li", "Yu Zhang", "Mary Poss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Francesca Chiaromonte, Dissertation Advisor", "Francesca Chiaromonte, Committee Chair", "Bing Li, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member", "Yu Zhang, Committee Member", "Mary Poss, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Data integration", "Genomics", "Ordinary least squares", "Structured data", "Sufficient dimension reduction", "Variable selection"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Variables Associated with Attachment Security and Indiscriminate Friendliness in Chinese Adopted Children in the U.S.", "id": "25946", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11471", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The study investigated relationships between important variables and attachment security and indiscriminate friendliness presented by children adopted from China.

However, recent studies have documented a negative correlation between firms' domestic and export sales growth, which suggests that firms are capacity constrained in the short run and face increasing marginal production cost. This paper goes beyond the current literature by developing and estimating a dynamic model of export behavior with capacity constraints and endogenous investment. The model has implications that differ from earlier models that assume constant marginal costs in several respects: (1) in the short run, exporters face trade-off between domestic and export sales. Firms' export sales growth led by positive foreign demand shocks causes a rise in output price and induces welfare losses for domestic consumers. (2): the long-run responses differ from the short-run responses, as firms can adjust their production capacity through capital investment over time. \n\n\nUsing a simulated method of moments approach, I fit the model to a panel of plant-level data for Colombian manufacturing industries. The estimated model is used to simulate how the economy transitions in response to an exchange-rate devaluation. The results show that incorporating capital adjustment costs is empirically important. First, it takes more than five years for firms to fully adjust to a permanent change of the exchange-rate process that depreciates the steady state value of the peso by 20\\%. Second, the long-run and short-run export responses differ: the long-run exchange rate elasticity of exports is 30\\% higher than that in the short run. Finally, firms' expectation on the duration of the policy changes also matters. The failure to accurately anticipate the duration of the devaluation results in reduction in firms' profits due to over- or under- investment in capital.\n\n\nCHAPTER 2: Standard dynamic exporting models with sunk export entry cost (Baldwin and Krugman, 1989; Das et al, 2007) explain firms' foreign market entry and exit decisions, but not their patterns of export growth. In particular, they do not explain why new exporters gradually increase their export sales as they mature in the export market. This paper explores the possibility that new exporters' age-dependent export growth is an optimal response to input adjustment costs. In the presence of input adjustment costs, firms respond more slowly to market shocks. As a result, new exporters increase their export sales gradually.\n\nI construct a model of dynamic exporting where firms face both input adjustment costs and sunk export entry cost. Using Colombian data at the plant level from 1981-1991, I estimate the parameters of the model using the simulated method of moments. I find that a model with adjustment costs can replicate new exporters' pattern of gradual growth. Without adjustment costs, the estimate of sunk export market entry cost is more than 10 times larger.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8962], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Yanping ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yanping", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan W Eaton", "James R.

These compounds have been associated with several health benefits in humans including antioxidant activity, improvement of cardiovascular health and reduction of cholesterol levels. They also play important roles in pest and disease defense throughout the plant. This research focuses on molecularly dissecting the proanthocyanidin biosynthetic pathway of Theobroma cacao. To this end, I first isolated candidate genes from T.cacao (Tc) encoding key structural enzymes of this pathway which include, anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX, also called anthocyanidin synthase, ANS) and leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR). I performed gene expression profiling of candidate TcANR, TcANS and TcLAR in various tissues through different developmental stages and also evaluated PA accumulation levels in those tissues. My results suggested that all PA candidate genes are co-regulated and positively correlated with PA synthesis. To functionally analyze the candidate genes, I used the model plants Arabidopsis and tobacco as expression platforms. Results from Arabidopsis mutant complementation tests and transgenic tobacco plants constitutively overexpressing cacao genes demonstrate that the candidate structural genes isolated from cacao are true ANS, ANR and LAR genes and all actively involved in PA synthesis in cacao. To further explore the transcriptional regulation of the PA synthesis pathway, I then isolated and characterized an R2R3 type MYB transcription factor TcMYBPA from cacao. I examined the spatial and temporal gene expression patterns of TcMYBPA in cacao and found it to be developmentally expressed in a manner consistent with its involvement in PAs as well as anthocyanin synthesis. Complementation test of TcMYBPA in Arabidopsis tt2 mutant suggested that TcMYBPA could functionally substitute Arabidopsis TT2 gene. Interestingly, except PA accumulation in seeds, I also observed an obvious increase of anthocyanidin accumulation in hypocotyls of transgenic Arabidopsis plants. This is consistent with gene expression analysis which showed that the entire PA pathway could be induced by overexpression of TcMYBPA gene, including DFR, LDOX (ANS) and BAN (ANR). Therefore I concluded that the isolated TcMYBPA gene encodes an R2R3 type MYB transcription factor and is involved in the regulation of both anthocyanin and PA synthesis in cacao. This research will not only offer us the knowledge of secondary metabolites production in cacao, but also provides molecular tools for breeding of cacao varieties with improved disease resistance and enhanced flavonoid profiles for nutritional and pharmaceutical applications. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6920], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Guiltinan", "Mark Guiltinan", "Daniel J Cosgrove", "Ming Tien", "Devin Peterson", "Siela Maximova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Guiltinan, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Guiltinan, Committee Chair", "Daniel J Cosgrove, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Devin Peterson, Committee Member", "Siela Maximova, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["proanthocyanidin", "molecular analysis", "cacao"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Vibrational Sum Frequency \u000bspectroscopy of Osmolytes and Ions \u000bat Aqueous Interface", "id": "23535", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10557", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Surfaces/interfaces are omnipresent in nature, ranging from physics and chemistry to biology and material sciences. To characterize the interfacial structures and understand the surface phenomena, many useful tools have been developed. Vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful second-order non-linear optical technique for this purpose and is gaining more and more attention nowadays. With VSFG, two pulsed laser beams, one at infrared frequency and one at visible frequency, are incident on the surface and generate a new beam with a frequency equal to the sum of the IR and visible frequencies. When the IR frequency matches a surface vibrational mode frequency, this process would be resonantly enhanced. In this dissertation, this surface-sensitive technique was adopted to investigate several interfaces with special relevance to biology. \nThe first topic of interest is the unusual orientation of a strong protein stabilizer, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), at two aqueous/hydrophobic interfaces (air/water interface and OTS/water interface). By interpretation of the relative phase of VSFG spectra coupled with a numerical algorithm, the maximum entropy method (MEM) anaylysis of the molecular orientation, it is found that the methyl groups of TMAO prefer to point into the aqueous medium, while the oxide moieties (N+-O-) orient towards the hydrophobic air or OTS. This unusual orientation may be attributed to the more hydrophilic nature of methyl groups that is attached to a strong electron withdrawing atom such as a quaternary nitrogen. These results could help elucidate the stabilizing effect of TMAO on proteins the increased need to keep the methyl group hydrated would cause them to be excluded from protein interface and thereby lead to protein stabilization.\nThe other major issue focused in this dissertation is based on the ion specific interactions at a charged interface, which plays a decisive role in various physico-chemical and biological processes. Binding affinity of different cations to monolayers of amphiphilic molecules (e.g. fatty acids, phospholipids) at the air/aqueous surfactant interfaces, may provide molecular level clues on various functions of cell membranes that are resembled by these amphiphilic molecules. Specifically, the binding events of several alkali cations to the hydrophilic carboxylate headgroups of long chain fatty acid, inferred from interfacial water structures, are thoroughly investigated by VSFG measurement. Results show that Li+ binds strongest to the negatively charged carboxylate groups, followed by Na+, then K+ although the difference is slight. The ranking of the alkali metal cations\u2019 binding abilities differs from the sequence predicted by the law of match water affinities (LMWA) and also varies with different headgroups in the model system, which may suggest the distinct solvation behaviors of these ions.

The role of contact barriers and carrier traps on these devices are unclear. In this work we have self-consistently connected simulations of the effect of contact barrier and traps to experimental results.\nFor this work, we fabricated zinc oxide thin film transistors (TFTs) on glass substrates. We used Al2O3 and ZnO deposited by weak reactant plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) at 200\u25e6C with process details reported earlier [25]. After device fabrication we measured the device drain current versus gate bias and drain current versus drain bias for several values of gate bias, from room temperature to 200 \uf0b0C. We also measured gated transmission line characteristics and quasi-static capacitance voltage (QSCV) characteristics for large geometry TFTs.\nThe QSCV characteristics show a large capacitance overshoot near the channel accumulation voltage. Capacitance overshoot is expected in TFTs due to the transmission line structure of the channel resistance \u2013 gate capacitance combination [26]. However, the overshoot is observed in these devices even for sweep speeds as low as 10-2 V/S, much slower (several orders of magnitudes) than would be expected for a device with no contact barrier. Two-dimensional device simulation using Synopsis TCAD Sentaurus Device also predicts a capacitance overshoot only for a much faster gate voltage sweep (> 102 V/S). This suggests the presence of a contact barrier or trap.\nTransmission line characteristics are also strongly influenced by contact barriers. However, simulations of gated transmission lines even with large contact barriers do not reproduce the experimentally observed slow turn-on of the total channel resistance. To reproduce this characteristic we found we must add a significant deep level trap and some tailing near the conduction band edge. This distribution explains the exponential dependence of the transfer length method (TLM), the variable temperature IDVG measurements, the thickness dependence, and the transient current overshoot.\nThe self heating of TFT on glass substrates is a well known effect. The threshold voltage of our device is already changing with temperature, and it is likely to be enhanced due to self-heating. Hence, pulse measurements were performed to remove contamination of self-heating. The data can be fit with four different small traps.\nWith the experience of characterization of PEALD ZnO TFTs, a systematic characterization approach was used to find the trap density of state of devices with several different processes. Those includes: tri-layer processed PEALD ZnO TFTs and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) pulsed laser deposited (PLD) zinc oxide TFTs. The trap DOS of tri-layer processed devices is similar to PEALD baseline devices.

The longest and most costly phase is the post occupancy phase, during which the facility is used by building owners or occupants, and operated and maintained by facility management staff. During the post occupancy phase, the operability and usability are two important factors that impact the cost of building operation and occupants\u2019 productivity. The best time to improve operability and usability of a building facility is during the design phase when the cost of change is low. One important method to incorporate operability and usability requirements into the design is through collaborative design review meetings that involve the end users and facility maintenance staff so the tacit knowledge of post occupancy requirements can be transferred to the design team. However, communication of design information via traditional 2D drawings are do not allow reviewers to fully understand the building design. Previous research has demonstrated that Virtual Reality (VR) aids external project stakeholders in understanding the design. Although intuitively VR appears to be a great media to communicate the design to external stakeholders, many project teams are not sure if they should adopt VR in their design review process. One of the key reasons is the relatively high initial investment required to adopt VR into their workflow. VR devices and facilities are still expensive. Expertise is also needed to create a model that is suitable for display in virtual reality. In addition, the value of the VR based post occupancy design review has not been rigorously studied in previous research. In short, the project managers need to better understand the value of VR based post occupancy design review in order to make informed decisions on whether VR is worth the investment for their project.\n\nThis research explored the value of a VR based post occupancy focused design review for improving the usability, maintainability, and operability of facilities. The researcher observed 21 design review meetings to form a deep understanding of the current post occupancy design review process in both traditional paper-based and VR based settings. Following a grounded theory methodology, the researcher analyzed 13 design review meeting recordings with a total length of 21 hours. A process model was developed to describe the dynamics and interactions of the design review process. An evaluation framework was developed to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the design review meetings. The evaluation framework was validated and used to analyze the 13 design review meetings. The analysis results were not able to find review meetings with VR better than those with traditional media. Instead, the results show that the use of both VR and traditional media in a design review correlates to better meeting performance. The research also found that reviewers who known the design well prior to a design review tend to improve the overall meeting performance. The research also outlines observations on the advantages and disadvantages of VR models in visualizing a facility design, and recommends several criteria to determine whether VR can be an effective media for a design review. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14230], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Yifan ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yifan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Messner", "John Messner", "Robert Michael Leicht", "Chimay J.

Converting mechanical energy to electrical energy using piezoelectric and electrostrictive materials has been the choice for many energy harvesting applications. The energy harvesting circuit is the interface between a piezoelectric/electrostrictive device and electrical load. A conventional view of energy harvesting circuitry is based on power conditioning concepts, which often involve AC to DC conversion and voltage regulation. In fact, an energy harvesting circuit also applies electrical boundary conditions to the device during energy conversion which are crucial for optimizing the harvested energy. This thesis presents a study of a relatively new type of energy harvesting approach: active energy harvesting. \nIn this thesis, energy harvesting using both piezoelectric and electrostrictive materials is investigated. For each type of material, a theoretical model of energy conversion process is established, based on the electro-mechanical boundary conditions applied to the device by different energy harvesting circuits. This modeling technique has certain advantages over a harmonic analysis approach. First, it gives a more intuitive picture in terms of understanding the energy harvesting process than the harmonic analysis approach. Second, it is more general in its conclusions, that is the input mechanical excitation and electrical boundary conditions are not constrained to sinusoidal form but instead represented by several critical states of the electro-mechanical boundary conditions. Finally, for nonlinear materials, such as electrostrictive polymer, a linear harmonic analysis is no longer applicable, while the presented technique does not have this limitation.\nAs a result of better understanding the importance of electromechanical boundary conditions in the energy conversion process, questions were raised: what is the best electrical boundary condition for a given mechanical excitation?  And how to achieve the maximum power conversion? This thesis answers these questions by presenting the relatively new concept of active energy harvesting, which uses switch-mode power electronics to control the voltage and/or current of the piezoelectric/electrostrictive devices. Two control strategies, voltage control and charge control mode of operation are presented.\nPractically, power electronic circuits are not 100 percent power efficient, which greatly influences the performance of active energy harvesting system. We also address this issue by taking into account the loss due to reactive power flow between the piezoelectric/electrostrictive device and the energy storage unit.\nExperimental results of active energy harvesting are also presented for both piezoelectric and electrostrictive polymers. The model is validated by comparing theoretical prediction with experimental data. The experimental results also demonstrated superior energy harvesting performance over conventional diode rectifier circuits.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6847], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Yiming ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yiming", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Heath Hofmann", "Qiming Zhang", "George A Lesieutre", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Heath Hofmann, Committee Chair", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Energy Harvesting", "Piezoelectric", "Electrostrictive"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Aging,caregiving,health and Well-being\n", "id": "28652", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12308", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Providing care for an older relative with dementia has been found to be highly stressful, and the caregiving experience may erode caregivers\u2019 psychological well-being as well as physical health (Aneshensel, Pearlin, Mullan, Zarit, & Whitlatch, 1995).  In this dissertation, I propose to explore the consequences of family caregiving as pertain to caregiver health and well-being at both the within and between-person levels.\n  \nThe dissertation compiles three studies that utilize data from the Daily Stress and Health (DaSH) Study.  DaSH has a within-person single-group design using daily diary methods with 184 caregivers.  At baseline, there was an in-person at-home interview, followed by 8 dairy days.  Caregivers filled out daily dairies on these 8 consecutive days; they were also interviewed by phone in each of the 8 evenings to report their daily experiences.  On some of the dairy days, the individual with dementia (IWD) was attending day care; and on the rest of them, the caregiver was actively caring for the IWD.  Saliva samples were collected 5 times on each diary day; these samples were used to test for levels of 3 hormones related to the stress process: the cortisol, DHEA-s, and alpha-amylase.  Each hormone was hypothesized to have unique implications for caregiver health.  Patients\u2019 behavior stressors were also reported each day for 4 time periods, which corresponded to the timing of Adult Day Services (ADS) use.  There were two longitudinal follow-up interviews by telephone: at 6 month and 12 month that assessed the caregivers\u2019 continuing ADS use, health, and well-being.  DaSH provides a unique opportunity to look at the complex associations between daily experiences, caregiving, ADS use, and biological functioning from a daily diary, within-person approach. \n \nThe three studies examine the effects of stress on affect, health, and biomarkers in a sample with high levels of daily stressors; they also examine how an intervention, ADS use, that changes daily stressor exposures influences caregivers\u2019 daily health and well-being.  Study 1 examines three spline growth models fit to daily cortisol levels, and the effect of ADS use on diurnal cortisol regulations in the daily caregiving context.  Study 2 examines the typical diurnal trajectory of salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) using a piecewise linear spline model.  It also examines the effect of ADS use on diurnal sAA regulation in the context of daily experiences.  Last, study 3 uses growth curve models to explore the association between caregivers\u2019 daily stress biomarker responses and their long-term health.  This study incorporates data collected using different time scales, and uses multiple health indicators and biomarkers.  It explores the moderating effects of ADS use and caregiving transitions on the biomarker-health associations.  \n\nOverall, the findings suggest the subtleties of health disparity among caregivers of IWDs.  Further, ADS use is effective in containing the chronic stress and physiological toll of caregiving on a daily basis and over time.

Authors often report a summary of their most important findings using tabular structure in documents. For example, scientists widely use tables to present the latest experimental results or statistical data in a condensed fashion. Along with the explosive development of the digital library and internet, tables have become a valuable information source for information seeking and data analysis.\n\nInterest in and use of table data necessitates table indexing and search. However, current search engines do not support table search. The difficulty of automatically extracting tables from un-tagged documents, the lack of a universal table metadata specification, and the limitation of the existing ranking schemes make the table search problem challenging. Effectively and efficiently searching table data becomes an urgent\ndemand.\n\nIn this dissertation, we present an automatic table extraction and search engine, TableSeer. TableSeer crawls the web and digital libraries, detects tables from documents using heuristic-based and machine-learning based methods, represents tables using an extensive set of medium-independent table metadata that other people can reuse, indexes table metadata files, ranks tables, and provides a user-friendly search interface. To improve the performance of the table boundary detection, a novel page-box-cutting\nmethod and a sparse-line detection method are proposed. Given a keyword-based table search query, TableSeer ranks the matched tables and returns the most relevant tables with a novel table ranking algorithm -- TableRank. TableRank tailors the classic vector space model and adopts an innovative term weighting scheme by ggregating multiple features from three levels: the term, table and document levels.\n\nAlthough tables are widely used, there is no standard on the table structure designing. Many issues that go into the design of tables and will impair the table data readability, accessibility, and re-usability are ignored. In order to have a deep understanding on the table characterization and to improve the table extraction and search performance, we also implement the first large-scale table quantitative study on table natures in digital libraries. We demonstrate the value of TableSeer with empirical studies on scientific documents. The experimental results show that our table search engine outperforms existing search engines on table search. Overall, TableSeer eliminates the burden of manually\nextracting table data from digital libraries and enables users to automatically examine tables. TableSeer is successfully deployed and in current use in several scientific digital libraries, for example CiteSeerx.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6921], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prasenjit Mitra", "C.

Adding to this classic view, recent studies have found that autophagy also directly impacts energetics by degrading lipids. This process, referred to as lipophagy, serves to prevent excessive fat accumulation in multiple tissues such as the liver and skeletal muscle, and modulates the hormone production in hypothalamus to affect food intake. The molecular mechanisms of lipophagy, particularly those related to the biogenesis of autophagosome to sequester the substrates, are unclear due to poor understanding of the responsible molecular interactions. Moreover, in the largest lipid storage organ - adipose tissue \u2013 it is unknown whether autophagy plays a role in fat degradation. It has been established that autophagy is essential for early development including embryonic adipogenesis, but it is not known if impairment of this catabolic process in an individual with mature adipose tissue leads to obesity.\nBif-1 is a previously identified positive regulator of autophagy that interacts with UVRAG, and modulates Atg9 trafficking to promote the formation of autophagosomes.  The current study identified Bif-1 as a novel regulator in lipid catabolism that will prevent the development of obesity and insulin resistance upon aging or dietary challenge. My data show that Bif-1 deficiency promotes the expansion of adipose tissue mass without altering food intake or physical activities. Although Bif-1 is dispensable for adipose tissue development, its deficiency reduces the rate of adipose tissue lipolysis, lowers the degradation of autophagy adaptor and substrate p62, and results in adipocyte hypertrophy upon aging. This function of Bif-1 in lipid turnover is not limited to adipose tissue since lipid droplet clearance is also attenuated by Bif-1 loss in the liver of mice that were starved and re-fed. Interestingly, obesity induced by a high fat-diet or Bif-1 deficiency down-regulates the protein levels of Atg9 and a lysosomal protein Lamp1 in the adipose tissue. Together, my research discovered a new role for Bif-1 in regulating lipid metabolism likely via lipophagy. Many questions remain, for example, does Bif-1-mediated lipid degradation depend on Atg9, and what other potential interactors of the Atg9-Bif-1 complex promote the biogenesis of autophagosomes? In order to address this question, we performed an Atg9 interactome profiling using inducible protein crosslinking coupled with affinity purification and proteomics. This identified VCP/p97 as a novel interactor with Atg9. Moreover, genetic knockdown of VCP in cells appears to disrupt autophagosome maturation. Although further studies are needed to precisely dissect the function of VCP in the autophagy machinery, I propose a potential role for VCP in the retrieval of autophagy proteins from the autophagosome.\nIn summary, my research has increased our understanding in the molecular mechanisms of autophagy and lipophagy. I identified Bif-1 as a novel player in lipid homeostasis and obesity, and I hypothesize that targeting lipophagy may provide new avenues for the treatment of obesity and its related metabolic complications. My findings also broaden our knowledge of the Atg9 interaction network through the identification of VCP as an Atg9 interactor. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13707], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong-Gang Wang", "Hong-Gang Wang", "Richard Bernard Mailman", "Thomas E Spratt", "Yoshinori Takahashi", "Yuguang (Roger) Shi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong-Gang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Hong-Gang Wang, Committee Chair", "Richard Bernard Mailman, Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member", "Yoshinori Takahashi, Outside Member", "Yuguang (Roger) Shi, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bif-1", "Atg9", "obesity", "autophagy", "lipid metabolism", "lipophagy"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF AN ADVANCE ORGANIZER AND TWO TYPES OF FEEDBACK ON PRE-SERVICE TEACHERS\u2019 KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION IN A BLENDED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT\n", "id": "7416", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6849", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-04-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examined structural supports (advance organizers and feedback) as a means of ensuring the greater effectiveness of the case method in instruction.

In particular, the two-dimensional electron systems investigated were silver-induced surface superstructure, Si(111)(sqrt3 \times sqrt3)-Ag, and an epitaxially grown graphene layer on SiC(0001).\n\nA two-dimensional sheet of charge was produced by precisely depositing a thin layer of silver onto Si(111)(7 \times 7) to form Si(111)(sqrt3 \times sqrt3)-Ag superstructure and characterized by HREELS. Measurements for low silver coverage confirmed a two-dimensional adatom gas phase previously discovered by other experimental techniques and also determined the critical coverage to sustain this phase. A further deposition of silver adatoms destroyed the two-dimensional adatom gas phase, and silver grew in Stranski-Krastanov mode, forming silver micro-crystal after completion of the first silver layer. At this stage, the dispersion of sheet plasmons deviated from theoretical prediction, which features an opening of a gap where the momentum transfer vanishes. A calculation based on the theory of surface plasmons agreed with this observation, which implied this was a transition from a 2D-type plasmon to a 3D-type plasmon. This was a surprising result due to the unique electronic structure of Si(111)-(sqrt3 \times sqrt3)-Ag which maintained electron density roughly the same due to a depletion layer underneath the silicon surface. Eventually, the conventional surface plasmon was observed at the deposition of about 20 monolayers (ML) of silver, indicative of fully screening from the substrate.\n\nHREELS studies of the sheet plasmon on a single graphene layer disclosed its two dimensional character and agreed with theoretical calculation of dispersion, but showed no damping where it was predicted. Also, we observed that the decay rate was roughly equal to the Fermi velocity.\n\nThe sheet-plasmon dispersion of few-layer graphene were characterized by HREELS. The 2-ML graphene had a similar behavior, whereas a peak splitting was observed around Fermi wavevector, due to the splitting of pi and pi^* band at the corner (K point) of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. In measurements of 3- and 5-ML graphene layers, the opening gap between pi and pi^* band induced a gap of dispersion behavior which indicated the failure of the free-electron-gas picture due to the reformed band structure.

The first approach uses the theoretical solution of the short time reference model prediction error and normalizes the error with aspect to the fast state. This method shows that there exists an affine map between the error vector space and the slow subsystem space and we are able to give\nreal-time estimation of the current slow variable state and identify the governing slow evolution model. Sensitivity and accuracy are shown to be controlled by the short prediction time. The second approach assembles a  multivariate tracking matrix and applies a multivariate analysis technique on this matrix to obtain the variances of slow subsystem. This multivariate tracking matrix version of the procedure, based on principal component analysis,\nis applied to the study of vector tracking with scalar observation of the short time reference model prediction error. The basic theory is presented, and the issues associated with its\nimplementation in a practical algorithm are discussed. Firstly, a numerical experiment of a spring-mass system was studied with the first tracker to illustrate the concepts which can be hardly explained in physical experiment. Then these two methods were applied to the study of an Euler-Bernoulli beam-string oscillator\nexperiment in which nonstationarity was provided by battery powered electromagnetic restoring force. The complete discharge of the battery models the \"damage\" propagation to complete failure in the experimental system. The physics-based mathematical model of the experimental system is developed and used to explicitly show\nhow the trackers are related to the slow hidden variable evolution in this case, the battery voltage responsible for drift in the fast subsystem parameters.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6848], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Yuqing ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuqing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Paul Cusumano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["dynamics", "time series", "damage track"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "DETECTION AND DYNAMICS OF CYBERBULLYING IN ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORKS", "id": "26410", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11173", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cyberbullying, defined as bullying perpetrated through the use of information technology, is a serious problem among children, adolescents and young adults. In this thesis, we study the detection of cyberbullies and the dynamics of cyberbullying in online social networks. In order to detect cyberbullies, we use learning models based on content features, user features and social network features. Understanding cyberbullying dynamics means predicting the effect of bullying comments on users with history of non-bullying. In the course of this study, we explore the spread of cyberbullying influence through the pairwise interactions between users. Using a dataset from MySpace, we first build a model for identifying bullies and non-bullies. We build a second model formulating the relationship between the influencer and the influenced user, predicting the dynamics by which a user with history of non-bullying turns into a bully.\n\nBased on our experimental results, we find that content features are significant in detecting cyberbullies as well as cyberbullying dynamics. We find user features to be significant in detecting cyberbullies but not significant in detecting cyberbullying dynamics.

Compared with the traditional information seeking methods (e.g. search engines, online databases, etc.) and community question answering services (e.g. Yahoo! Answers, Quora, Answers.com, StackOverflow, etc.), social Q&A is considered to provide more trustworthy, contextualized, and interactive responses. Although there is an extensive amount of research and literature available on the topic of information seeking via the Internet, due to the distinct nature of social Q&A, still relatively little is known about how users behave in the process of information seeking and sharing under social context. To fill in this gap, in this study I examine three aspects of social Q&A. \nFirst, in order to better understand the information needs of the questioners in a microblogging environment, I develop a taxonomy of question types in social Q&A, called ASK. This taxonomy allows us to differentiate questions according to their underlying intents, and then direct them to the most appropriate respondents for help. To apply the taxonomy to practical problems, I also present the implementation of an automatic classification method to categorize the social Q&A questions according to the ASK taxonomy.\nSecond, noticing the low response rate in social Q&A, I examine a set of factors that would affect the response probability of a question. Specifically, I limit the scope to extrinsic factors only, given the existence of literature focusing on factors from both social and cognitive perspectives in knowledge sharing. For the analysis, I collect over 20 thousand real-world questions posted on Weibo, which is the largest microblogging site in China.\nThird, to validate the effectiveness of question routing systems in social Q&A, as well as to characterize the voluntary knowledge sharing behavior among individuals under social context, I analyze a collection of questions and answers posted during a 10-month period on Weiwen, a Chinese question routing services based on microblogging sites. I explore the patterns demonstrated by the knowledge contributors from three different perspectives: user behavior, user interest, and user connectedness. I also propose a predictive model on active contributors in social Q&A environment based on a number of non-Q&A features.\nI believe this thesis is of interest as it very well addresses the research gaps concerning the understanding of information needs in social Q&A, and the effectiveness of SNS in handling question-answering. Findings from this research would be of practical value as well, as it could fulfill the need for technologies capable of performing question routing tasks to help people find what they need.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10888], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Zhe ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhe", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernard James Jansen", "Bernard James Jansen", "John Yen", "Heng Xu", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernard James Jansen, Dissertation Advisor", "Bernard James Jansen, Committee Chair", "John Yen, Committee Member", "Heng Xu, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["social question and answering", "social search", "information seeking", "social networks", "Twitter", "Weibo"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Ecophysiology and Metabolism of Green Bacteria Inferred from -omics Studies", "id": "13115", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7075", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Green bacteria are a subset of chlorophototrophic bacteria that use a specialized light-harvesting structure, the chlorosome, which enables them to grow under low-light conditions. Green bacteria, which consist of members of three phyla, Chlorobi, Chloroflexi, and Acidobacteria, are widely spread and ecologically important. Green bacteria are physiologically diverse as a group, but their members from the phylum Chlorobi, known as green sulfur bacteria (GSB), are strikingly uniform in their physiology\u2014nearly all are anaerobic photoautotrophs that oxidize sulfide. This work takes advantage of DNA sequencing technologies that have experienced dramatic advances recently to investigate different aspects of physiology and metabolism, on multiple levels from genes to single organisms and beyond to bacterial communities. Genome data for fifteen GSB strains revealed the genomic basis of the physiological congruence among them. Comparisons among genomes of different strains also provided information on the phylogeny, genome structure, and genes specific to each lineage. Sequence data suggested dramatically different physiologies for two members of the Chlorobi, Ignavibacterium album (I. album) and \u201cCandidatus Thermochlorobacter aerophilum\u201d (\u201cCa. T. aerophilum\u201d). The complete genome sequence of I. album indicated that it is a versatile, facultative anaerobic organoheterotroph. A combination of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies suggested that the uncultured \u201cCa. T. aerophilum\u201d is an aerobic photoheterotroph that cannot oxidize sulfide. These data suggested that there is much more physiological diversity within the phylum Chlorobi than generally assumed. Comparisons of these two organisms with GSB implied that ancestors of the phylum Chlorobi might be very different from extant GSB. \n\nMetatranscriptomic analyses of the photosynthetic microbial community that harbors \u201cCa. T. aerophilum\u201d showed that the community included seven populations of chlorophototrophs with very different life styles, which exhibit patterns of expression of their photosynthesis genes. Complete genome sequences of the two partners of the phototrophic consortium \u201cChlorochromatium aggregatum,\u201d one of which is a GSB, provided insights into the physiological and metabolic basis for the symbiotic relationship between the two. These data suggested that the two organisms have specialized roles in the consortium: the GSB partner is the primary producer and provider of nutrients while the betaproteobacterial partner is responsible for sensing the environment and motility of the consortium. Schemes for potential interspecies electron transfer were proposed. Last but not least, one of the many hypotheses generated from sequence analyses was tested and verified by experimental studies. A gene involved in the biosynthesis of bacteriochlorphylls c, d, and e, which are main components of the chlorosome, was identified by comparative genomics and characterized by genetic and biochemical approaches. Results showed that the gene is essential for the first committed step in the biosynthetic pathway leading from chlorophyllide a to the three bacteriochlorophylls. Overall, this work offered answers to several high-interest research questions concerning green bacteria and provided invaluable resources for future research. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7068], "author_name_tesi": "Liu, Zhenfeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Liu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhenfeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Bryant", "Sarah Ellen Ades", "Stephan Schuster", "Christopher Howard House"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Bryant, Dissertation Advisor", "Sarah Ellen Ades, Committee Member", "Stephan Schuster, Committee Member", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Green Bacteria", "Chlorobi", "Genomics", "Metagenomics", "Metatranscriptomics", "Bacteriochlorophyll"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Places as Products: The Town Center as Retail Development", "id": "13853eql5069", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13853", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Enclosed shopping malls are in decline in the United States, with 15% of malls on the verge of closure as of 2014.

Yet the United States has also long been characterized as the most mobile society in the West. Few Americans are as mobile as active duty military personnel and their families, who engage in long-distance moves an average of once every three years. Youth raised in these circumstances (\u201cmilitary youth\u201d) experience childhoods marked by constant uprooting and resettling.

This state-sanctioned mobility sets them apart from other highly mobile groups such as transnational migrants, refugees, homeless youth, and Travelers.\n\nThis dissertation examines the experiences of military youth with regard to home, mobility, identity, and militarization. Using semi-structured in-depth interviews with 43 youth (ages 18 to 25) from active duty military families, survey data, mapping exercises, and primary documents, I analyze the ways that military youth construct home in light of their mobility, the strategies they use to settle into new places, and the ways that mobility and militarization impact their identities and prompt new formulations of place and home in the process.

Upon high-pass filtering of the radar power profile and electron concentration data, the COFIs are seen unambiguously and ubiquitously in Arecibo results from 22-23 March 2004, 5-6 June, 21-25 September, and 17-20 November 2005, as well as in Millstone Hill results from 4 October to 4 November 2002. The COFIs are strong throughout the F-region, often spanning altitudes of 160 km to above 500 km, and are detected day and night in the F2-layer (above ~ 200 km). In fact, the COFIs are seen at every time and altitude that there is sufficient plasma to produce a radar echo. The COFIs also are observed at Poker Flat, although the poor signal-to-noise ratio over segments of the data makes it difficult to determine whether or not they are always present.  The consistent detection of the COFIs, along with the longitudinal alignment and large latitudinal spread of the observation sites suggests that these waves always are present over at least a major portion of the northern hemisphere.  \nThis phenomenon appears to have been reported in Total Electron Concentration (TEC) maps of the ionosphere over much of North America as well as in airglow images from Arecibo and many other mid-latitude sites around the world.

Consistent fluctuations with periods of about an hour have been observed in magnetic field measurements taken at geosynchronous altitudes by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES)-10 and -12 satellites that may be linked to the COFIs. Concurrent solar wind data from ACE are presented in an attempt to find a more primary source of the COFIs.

Though a seemingly well-studied event, details about what exactly occurred during the PETM are still lacking due to differential local effects, absence of precise time resolution, and considerable dissolution of deep sea carbonates at the onset of the event. Here we present high-resolution planktonic foraminiferal assemblage data from cores from Maryland and New Jersey that show significant changes in surface ocean habitats immediately before and during the onset of the event. Assemblages immediately below the PETM show evidence for environmental stress including oligotrophy, while marked changes in assemblages at the onset of the event reflect an increase in stratification. An anomalously high abundance of the stress indicating triserial/biserial planktonic foraminifera in the late Paleocene support the increase in environmental stress directly prior to the event on the coastal plain.  We observe Acarinina sibaiyaensis, a species previously thought to have originated during the PETM, below the event at both sites. The appearance of A. sibaiyaensis prior to the PETM in the Atlantic Coastal Plain suggests that it evolved on the shelf in response to oligotrophy and tracked these conditions to the open ocean during the event. \n\tPlanktonic foraminifera diversified on the shelf during the PETM likely due to a combination of sea level rise, warming of the coastal waters, and consequent increased stratification, which provided new habitats.

The Zombie is a character that popular culture has been fascinated with in the current, as well as historical, media landscape. Making its film debut with White Zombie (1932), this \u201cmonster\u201d derived from non-Gothic Afro-Caribbean roots was difficult at first for Western society to understand. There was an attempt in early Zombie depictions to control or Westernize this creature into a Gothic mold readily understood by audiences of the day. Other media monsters, like Dracula or Frankenstein, were understood and controlled more easily because of their Gothic and literary bases. Conversely, the Zombie\u2019s base was unknown due to the lack of correct knowledge of Haitian culture and religion. These mysterious origins, as well as the highly controlled nature in which the Zombie was introduced, set up a universal malleable semiotic signifier that even today has the ability to shift and change to fit whatever genre or societal issue that becomes prevalent at a given time. Acting as a form of \u201cHistorical Allegory,\u201d the Zombie can be read in many different ways at various times in oppositional and counter-hegemonic ways. Many of the Zombie signifying traits that these allegories depend upon were solidified in the Romero films. This is not to say that universally the Zombie is ideologically confrontational. Eras like the \u201cZombie spoof cycle\u201d in the 1980\u2019s certainly resisted against this counter-hegemonic type of depiction, opting instead for a more controlled and commodified version. However the importance of this postmodern spoof Zombie was that it emptied the undead signifier of meaning and eventually enabled the Zombie sign to spread out to many divergent cultural areas. Across the long and eclectic time that the Zombie has been a staple of media, this creature has proven able to be applied to any situation and any cultural text, making the Zombie signifier uniquely capable of ideologically addressing historically contingent societal issues.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5136], "author_name_tesi": "Lizardi, Ryan ", "last_name_ssi": "Lizardi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Media Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew Frank Jordan", "Matthew Frank Jordan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew Frank Jordan, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew Frank Jordan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Zombie", "sign", "allegory", "media"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Playlist Pasts: New Media, Constructed Nostalgic Subjectivity and the Disappearance of Shared History", "id": "13784", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7072", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Contemporary convergent media has proven to be nothing short of obsessed with nostalgic mediated pasts. Examples of this trend include the current rash of remakes in film, the video game industry's reliance on vintage game downloads, and television's nostalgic flow carried through programming and advertising. Just being preoccupied with the past is not inherently problematic, as any history can teach us about the present and future. However, this is not the specific type of nostalgic subjectivity engendered by contemporary media. Instead of encouraging an engagement with the past that functions as an adaptive mirror with which we can compare and contrast our contemporary situation, the past is presented as an individualized version that transfixes us as uncritical citizens of our own culture. Melancholic attachments to beloved lost media objects are encouraged; ones that refuse to properly mourn and release the object of their attention. This contemporary phenomenon is explored from a cross-media perspective, examining divergent but interrelated topics. These include the creation of a collector's mentality and playlist past through the increased availability of a digital-archive apparatus, the behavioral repetition of nostalgia in explicitly and implicitly nostalgic video games, the epistemology of the film remake in the age of the re-imagined \"classic,\" and the commodity flow of nostalgia through all areas of televisual content.\n\nThe cultural implications of a cross-media eternal return to nostalgia is an arresting of individuals in an uncritical mindset that has increasingly defined who we are as people and societies by what media we consumed as children.

The purpose of the present study is to propose and test a new model for conceptualizing emotional sequelae in GAD, which is defined as the Contrast Avoidance Model of Worry.  The model states that individuals with GAD are more sensitive to unexpected negative events, and that worry (the key pathological feature of GAD) functions to prolong and maintain a negative emotional state, thereby avoiding an unexpected, sharp shift (or contrast) in negative emotions.  To test this model, the present study examined the effect of worry on physiological and subjective negative emotionality, both during worry inductions and in response to negative and positive emotional stimuli.  Participants with GAD and nonanxious controls were randomly assigned to engage in worry, relaxation, or neutral inductions prior to sequential exposure to each of three emotion-inducing film clips designed to elicit fear, sadness, and happiness. Self reported emotionality was assessed at baseline and following each induction and exposure, and physiological arousal (both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity) was measured throughout. Results demonstrate that worry led to an increase in negative emotionality that was sustained across negative exposures. Also, participants with GAD described this experience as more helpful in emotional coping than did controls, providing partial support for the Contrast Avoidance model.

Through their governance and control of leading bureaucratic organizations and clubs, the British established and maintained a position of leadership both on and off the field. Britain\u2019s early sporting dominance, coupled with the use of sport as medium for shaping the abilities, values and character of a British governing class, cultivated a belief that sport played a crucial role in the acquisition and consolidation of British hegemonic power. After an initial period of unrivalled dominance, Britain\u2019s monopolistic position as leader of modern sport eventually came under serious assault. Britain\u2019s historical sporting supremacy\u2014similar to her imperial and economic power in general\u2014was relative, not absolute; a position predicated more on the weaknesses of her opponents rather than her own strengths. Like the example of industrialization, a \u201ccatch-up\u201d phenomenon quickly occurred. As foreign nations gained experience and established sporting institutions and customs of their own, free from the restraints of Victorian notions of \u201ctrue\u201d amateurism and often with direct governmental assistance, British prowess diminished at an alarming rate.\nPerceiving an unwelcome deterioration in their country\u2019s relative position as a military, economic, imperial, and sporting power, the predominantly elite and politically conservative members of the British Olympic Association (BOA) naturally embraced the Olympic Games as a platform for promoting British interests. Throughout the two decades following the establishment of the BOA in 1905, Britain\u2019s Olympic leaders pursued an administrative policy designed to stem the tide of British decline, both perceived and real. Within the framework of the Olympic movement, BOA chiefs fought bitterly to maintain a sporting union with Ireland, endeavored to foster a greater sense of imperial identity with her white dominions, and even undertook an ambitious policy of athletic specialization designed to reverse the nation\u2019s waning fortunes in international sport. The BOA\u2019s nation-building efforts faced strong opposition in the face of political squabbling between the constituent parts of the British Isle, the rising political independence of the dominions, and unwavering British public and governmental aversion to the Olympic Games.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4290], "author_name_tesi": "Llewellyn, Matthew Philip", "last_name_ssi": "Llewellyn", "middle_name_ssi": "Philip", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Dyreson", "Mark Dyreson", "Robert Scott Kretchmar", "Garry Chick", "Arlene Thompson", "Martin Polley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Dyreson, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Dyreson, Committee Chair", "Robert Scott Kretchmar, Committee Member", "Garry Chick, Committee Member", "Arlene Thompson, Committee Member", "Martin Polley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Olympic Games", "Amateurism", "Nationalism", "Politics", "National Identity"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "UPPER MANTLE STRUCTURE BENEATH THE GAMBURTSEV SUBGLACIAL MOUNTAINS AND EAST ANTARCTICA FROM BODY-WAVE TOMOGRAPHY\n", "id": "12390", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "168", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The geology and tectonic structure of East Antarctica is unknown due to the 2-3 km thick East Antarctic ice sheet that obscures all but a handful of outcrops along the coastal regions and in the Transantarctic Mountains.  Geophysical methods (i.e., seismic, gravity, magnetic) and geochemical inferences suggest East Antarctica represents a Precambrian shield devoid of any major tectonic events since ~480 Ma, making the origin of the high and rugged topography of the East Antarctic highlands enigmatic.  The highest feature within the East Antarctic highlands is the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains (GSM), located near the center of East Antarctica, beneath Dome Argus.  This mountain range reaches elevations of ~3,000 m and exhibits rugged relief on the order of 1-2 km.  The geophysical mechanism responsible for the uplift of the GSM is poorly understood and many uplift models for the region have been invoked, such as the existence of a hotspot or a series of Proterozoic/early Paleozoic orogenic events.  Using seismic data from the GAMSEIS deployment and a subset of stations from the TAMSEIS deployment, I investigate the upper mantle structure beneath the GSM and East Antarctica at unprecedented lateral resolutions via body wave tomography using P and S travel time residuals from teleseismic events that have been corrected for ice and crustal thickness.  P and S wave velocity models exhibit strong spatial correlation of very small anomalies on the order of a few tenths of a percent relative to the mean of the model that are hundreds of kilometers wide.  Resolution tests indicate that these anomalies are well resolved and can be interpreted as distinct lithospheric blocks within East Antarctica, correlating well with the inland projection of major terrane boundaries.  In particular, a slow to fast velocity pattern is observed orthogonal to the strike of the GSM and may represent a suture zone, possibly of Pan-African age, corresponding to the Australian Pinjarra Orogeny.  Such findings suggest an ancient origin for the GSM and reveal a portion of the tectonic framework within the interior of the East Antarctic shield.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [167], "author_name_tesi": "Lloyd, Andrew Jason", "last_name_ssi": "Lloyd", "middle_name_ssi": "Jason", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Arnold Nyblade, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Antarctica", "Tomography", "Seismology"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Veto Players and Militarized Interstate Conflict", "id": "22569", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10274", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation seeks to clarify the relationship between domestic institutions and interstate conflict by examining the link between veto players and interstate conflict initiation, duration, and outcome.

In the present study we examined the role of Cx43 in the skeletal response to mechanical unloading (i.e., lack of weight bearing). Mechanical unloading induces significant bone loss and muscle atrophy. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying these deleterious effects is required in order to identify novel targets for therapeutic countermeasures.\n\nFirst, we collected tissue from mice following 0, 7, 14, and 21 days of hindlimb suspension (HLS) or normal loading. We found that muscle atrophy (due to decreased protein synthesis and increased protein degradation) precedes bone loss during mechanical unloading. Reduced mechanical force due to muscle atrophy may compound bone loss associated with a lack of weight bearing. Furthermore, age-related trabecular bone loss in mice, similar to that which occurs in mature astronauts, is superimposed on unloading. Preservation of muscle mass, cortical bone structure, and overall bone strength with age in normally loaded control mice suggests that muscle has a greater effect on cortical versus trabecular bone.\n\nNext, we sought to determine the role of Cx43 in unloading-induced bone loss by subjecting mice with a bone-specific deletion of Cx43 (cKO) to HLS. Following three weeks of HLS, wild-type (WT) mice experienced substantial bone loss; however, these deleterious effects were attenuated in cKO mice. Unloading also suppressed bone formation in WT mice, while there was no change from baseline for cKO-Suspended. mRNA levels of the gene encoding sclerostin, an osteocyte-derived inhibitor of bone formation, were greater in WT-Suspended, whereas cKO-Suspended was unchanged. The proportion of sclerostin-positive osteocytes was significantly lower in cKO-Control versus WT-Control, a difference accounted for by the presence of numerous empty lacunae and apoptotic osteocytes. There was no change in trabecular osteocyte viability. Osteoclast indices were lower in Suspended cKO versus WT-Suspended. Osteocyte apoptosis induced by Cx43 deficiency appears to preserve bone structure by preventing both suppression of bone formation and increased bone resorption during mechanical unloading. Attenuated trabecular bone loss, despite an apparent lack of affect on osteocyte viability in this compartment, suggests that an additional mechanism, independent of osteocyte apoptosis, may also be important.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8591], "author_name_tesi": "Lloyd, Shane ", "last_name_ssi": "Lloyd", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shane", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Donahue", "Henry Joseph Donahue", "Charles H Lang", "Neil Sharkey", "James Robert Connor", "Alicia Ellen Bateman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Henry Joseph Donahue, Dissertation Advisor", "Henry Joseph Donahue, Committee Chair", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Member", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Alicia Ellen Bateman, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["connexin43", "unloading", "bone loss", "sclerostin", "osteocyte", "apoptosis", "RANKL", "muscle", "spaceflight", "atrophy", "osteopenia"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Kalman filter models for ecological momentary assessment designs", "id": "22379", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10377", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) designs attempt to assess individuals in real-time within real-world settings in order to provide a stronger sense of ecological validity.

In order to address this issue, the concept of Microgrid is introduced as a strategy to integrate renewable energy resource from various locations with the existing power system. Microgrids could be characterized as a group of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources (DER) with clearly defined electrical boundaries that acts as a single controllable entity with respect to the grid and can connect and disconnect from the grid to enable it to operate in both grid connected or island mode.\nThe coordinated operation and control of DER sources together with storage devices, such as batteries, and controllable loads are central to the concept of microgrids. From the grid\u2019s point of view, a microgrid can be regarded as a controlled entity within the power system that can be operated as a single aggregated load and from a customer\u2019s point of view, microgrids are similar to traditional LV distribution networks that provide their electricity needs, but in addition, enhance local reliability, reduce emissions, improve power quality by supporting voltage and reducing voltage dips, and potentially lower costs of energy supply.\nThis research focuses on the hardware implementation of a laboratory scale microgrid test bed. The microgrid test bed is based on the specifications of IEEE 1547, which is a standard for incorporating distributed resources with the electric power system.

Documentary art and media dominated American mass culture between the Depression and World War 2, and poets seized upon the cultural authority and semblance of objectivity that documentary provided for their work.  Recent scholars have recognized the importance of documentary to American modernist art and literature, yet the productive relationship between documentary and American modernist poetry has been overlooked.\n\nThis thesis will show that documentary poetics is essentially an interdisciplinary practice, borrowing and adapting developments from film and photography in order to shape a variety of source materials.  American documentary poets also experimented with a myriad of primary resources, ranging from presidential letters, legal reports, government hearings, historical and political texts, and eyewitness accounts, while simultaneously experimenting with poetic form and arrangement.  This study ultimately seeks to establish the importance of documentary poetry and its engagement with the politics and culture of the 1930s and 40s.  In doing so, it makes the following threefold argument: that documentary poetry is an important aspect of the history and development of American literary modernism; that documentary poetry is a prominent documentary art alongside photography, film, and other visual arts; and finally that documentary poetry serves as a significant barometer of social change, demonstrating how poetic practices articulated and responded to various political movements throughout the decades under consideration.\n\nIn particular, this thesis examines the work of five poets writing between the Depression and World War 2:  Joseph Kalar, Ezra Pound, Louis Zukofsky, Muriel Rukeyser, and John Beecher.  In chapter one, on Joseph Kalar and his proletarian sketch poetry written for New Masses, I discuss how his poetic sketches reveal the diversity of cultural and political attitudes found in the American working class of the late 1920s, and how his documentary work feeds into the larger worker-correspondent system that was being developed for the magazine.  In chapter two, on Ezra Pound and Louis Zukofsky\u2019s competing documentary histories of the United States, I show how their respective fascist and socialist political ideologies frame the wide range of historical texts that they weave into their poetic documentaries.  In chapter three, on Muriel Rukeyser\u2019s documentary project on the Gauley Bridge mining disaster, I examine her projected adaptation of her poem \u201cThe Book of the Dead\u201d as a documentary film, \u201cGauley Bridge.\u201d  In chapter four, on John Beecher\u2019s New Deal documentary poems, I investigate how he incorporated his field reports as an administrator for the FSA and FEPC into his poetry.

Results indicated that greater dosages of parental monitoring and behavior management program content, positive family relationship program content, self-regulation and stress management program content, and peer resistance skills program content had the most potent and robust effects on reduction of risk for heavy drinking, cigarette use, and marijuana use initiation.

Alopecia, neuropathy, nail loss, and invasive surgical procedures, can arguably make a more detrimental experience than having the disease at early stages. On the other hand, patients cannot benefit from the best treatment outcome when symptoms surface later, so early detection is the key to maximize chances of survival. However, patients are often present at a certain stage of cancer when tumors are detectable by current imaging capabilities. This is the case for those with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Being the fourth most lethal type of all cancers with a \u226410% 5-year survival, there is no treatment to effectively manage the condition. \n\nThe motive of this dissertation emphasizes the possibilities and importance of enhancing the efficacy of existing medicine for pancreatic cancer. The common antimetabolite, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), is amongst the most effective drug agents when first discovered in 1957 and is still part of the modern treatment regimen. Because 5-FU disrupts DNA and RNA replication, there are many toxic side effects from drug metabolism, so the ability to target cancer is a pivotal characteristic that 5-FU and other first generation chemotherapeutics lack. Advances in nanotechnology has opened a new era in this area by offering meticulous ways to engineer nanoparticles to encapsulate and deliver drugs to specific sites. Given the known mechanisms of 5-FU in cells from years of basic research and clinical trials, drug reformulation is a valuable alternative to the conventional route of drug discovery.\n\nCalcium phosphosilicate nanoparticles (CPSNPs) offer an effective drug delivery platform that is bioresorbable with a narrow particle size distribution to enable penetration of dense fibrotic tumors such as PDAC. Developed by the Adair, Kester, and Matters teams, both gastrin (T. Morgan, 2009 and E. Altinoglu, 2010 dissertations) and aptamer-modified (X. Tang, 2016 dissertation) CPSNPs doped with indocyanine green (ICG) dye have demonstrated accumulation and specific targeting at the pancreas of orthotopically transplanted BxPC-3 and PANC-1 athymic mice cancer models. The reports herein are a continuation of these investigations that focus on the therapeutic capabilities of CPSNPs. This involves the significance of active phosphorylated agents on drug load optimization in CPSNPs through adsorption-mediated encapsulation. These active metabolites include fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) for 5-FU and gemcitabine monophosphate (GemMP; dFdCMP) for gemcitabine (Gem; dFdC). Conversion from the prodrugs (biologically inactive 5-FU and gemcitabine) to the active forms is an enzyme-catalyzed event in cells. Without targeting abilities, majority of 5-FU and gemcitabine become catabolized before the agents can carry out mechanisms of action. \n\nConcepts behind adsorption-mediated encapsulation based on zeta potential evaluations and the role of potential-determining ions (hydroxyls, protons, and phosphates) from solution to the surface of calcium phosphate were examined. The relationship between adsorption and speciation diagrams of the different ions was also interpreted. These experiments were conducted to show that compounds with phosphate and other charged groups can adsorb to calcium phosphate, which was indicated by shifts in surface polarity. Brushite was synthesized and subjected to various concentrations of potassium hydroxide (KOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), sodium citrate (Cit), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 5-FU, and FdUMP, to analyze trends in the zeta potential curve vs. pH. The isoelectric point (IEP) of brushite in water at room temperature was pH ~7 and the addition of OH\u2212 and H+ ions influenced the solubility products of calcium phosphate at the solid-solution interface. At pH >7, the zeta potential was negative due to the net anionic species produced. The opposite effect was observed at pH <7. Both Cit and ATP were found to robustly adsorb to calcium phosphate and shifted the zeta potential to increasingly negative values at increasing concentrations.  The effects of adsorption by FdUMP were not as profound as Cit and ATP even though FdUMP was expected to make the zeta potential more negative. The presence of FdUMP shifted the isoelectric point of the calcium phosphate and the event was not present with 5-FU. Results on ATP and FdUMP raised implications that a higher uptake of phosphorylated compounds can be achieved with CPSNPs by taking advantage of the affinity between calcium ions on calcium phosphate and the phosphate group on the compound. \n\nThe non-phosphorylated drug analogs were not well encapsulated into CPSNPs, suggesting the phosphate modification is essential for effective encapsulation.  In vitro proliferation assays, cell cycle analyses and/or thymidylate synthase inhibition assays verified that CPSNP-encapsulated phospho-drugs retained biological activity.  Analysis of orthotopic tumors from mice treated systemically with tumor-targeted FdUMP-CPSNPs confirmed the in vivo up take of these particles by PDAC tumor cells and release of active drug cargos intracellularly.  \n\nIn Chapter 5, a novel synthesis of gold nanoparticles using sodium thiophosphate (TP) was introduced in the development of gold-calcium phosphosilicate (Au-CPS) core-shell nanoparticles for theranostic applications (combined imaging and therapeutic capabilities). Thiophosphates were the highlight of this work to induce gold core encapsulation through calcium ion immobilization at the gold surface to seed CPS growth. The kinetics of the Au-TP reduction was studied with the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) model and analyzed alongside with the gold particle number concentration as reactions progressed for 60 min. The reaction was conducted at various molar ratios of chloroauric acid to TP at room temperature. The values for the Avrami reaction rate constant, k, implied that TP was significant for inducing the supersaturation of gold-thiophosphate monomers into nuclei. The Avrami parameter, n, suggested a diffusion controlled mechanism. With additional excess thiophosphate, both k and particle concentration increased during the nucleation period (within 10 min). Overall particle sizes were smaller as TP concentration increased and the nanoparticles absorb within 500-600 nm in the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band region. While the JMAK model has limitations such that the constants can only be interpreted within the Avrami definitions, the study offered insights into possible mechanisms and ways to control colloidal stability and size by comparing the reaction at different reactant ratios. The first example of Au-CPS gold cores was also presented with suggestions for future refinement work.\n\nLastly, this entire work is described within the context of translational science in Chapter 6. To reach an understanding of the drug discovery cycle and the challenges is important for those conducting research to impact global healthcare. In STEM research, the need to generate data on the fundamental sciences can often overshadow the purpose to provide applicable solutions to improve patient outcome. Here, encountered experimental scenarios for nanoparticles were presented and discussed to identify components that are critical for advancing these benchtop findings into clinical trials.

The first method involves estimating a finite impulse response (FIR) filter which converts a sonic boom measurement made at altitude into an estimate of the same sonic boom when measured on the ground, after it has propagated through a portion of the atmosphere. The filter functions model the linear propagation between the measurement points in space and time. The filters can be applied as post processing functions to sonic boom waveforms based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) predictions to simulate realistic turbulent propagation. Three experimental data sets are used to estimate turbulent filter functions.\n\nThe second method for developing filter functions employs  a numerical algorithm  to propagate an \nw . The propagation algorithm used is the nonlinear progressive wave equation, or NPE. The NPE was modified to include a statistical representation of turbulence based on the method of Fourier mode summation, using a modified von Karman spectrum. The results from the numeric propagation can be used to estimate filter functions in the same way that the experimental data sets were used.\n\nThe filters are then applied to various shaped sonic boom waveforms. The shaped sonic booms are the result of CFD calculations for aircraft specifically designed to produce low level sonic booms, or low-booms. When the various filters are applied to the low-booms results are presented in terms of Steven's Mk VII Perceived Level (PL) of noise, which is a metric which describes the perceived loudness of a sonic boom. It is shown that the PL values are usually decreased by turbulence, but the PL values sometimes increase.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3773], "author_name_tesi": "Locey, Lance Lester", "last_name_ssi": "Locey", "middle_name_ssi": "Lester", "first_name_ssi": "Lance", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor Ward Sparrow", "Karl Martin Reichard", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Anthony A Atchley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Chair", "Karl Martin Reichard, Committee Member", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Anthony A Atchley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sonic Boom propagation", "turbulence"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Predicting Support for Capital Punishment: The Role of Causal Attributes, Fear of Crime, and Demographics", "id": "17425", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8692", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Favorable opinions of capital punishment are the lowest they have been in forty years.

The Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) Gag polyprotein is synthesized in the cytoplasm.  During the early steps of assembly, Gag undergoes transient nuclear trafficking mediated by nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in the matrix (MA) and nucleocapsid (NC) domains, and a nuclear export signal (NES) present within the p10 domain.  Gag nuclear trafficking has been linked to efficient packaging of viral genomic RNA.  However, whether Gag undergoes intranuclear trafficking and what host factors Gag may interact with in the nucleus remains poorly understood.  The ability to mutate the NES and inhibit nuclear export makes RSV a useful model to study the roles of Gag within the nucleus and how Gag interacts with nuclear factors during retrovirus infection.\nExperiments aimed at identifying Gag-Gag interactions within the nucleus revealed that Gag proteins accumulated within punctate nuclear foci.  These subnuclear foci were not virus-like particles forming within the nucleus.  The formation of Gag-containing foci was dependent upon the presence of NC, which is an RNA binding domain.  Further studies revealed that Gag nuclear puncta were anchored within the nucleoplasm at discrete locations, but individual Gag molecules move between the subnuclear structures and the nucleoplasm.  These results suggest that the Gag proteins are retained at a particular subnuclear structure, perhaps being anchored there by an interaction with a cellular protein or RNA molecule.\nIn addition to nucleoplasmic foci, Gag also accumulated within nucleoli in an NC-dependent manner.  Similar to the nuclear puncta, Gag proteins moved in and out of nucleoli.  Using site-directed mutagenesis, the amino acids involved in nucleolar localization of NC were identified.  Furthermore, mutations that eliminated nucleolar localization of NC also prevented Gag from accumulating within nucleoli.  These results indicate that NC plays a key role in the nucleolar localization and subnuclear trafficking of the Gag protein.  However, whether these nuclear accumulations of Gag serve a purpose during viral replication is unknown.\nTo determine whether nucleolar localization was involved in retroviral replication, proviral vectors were used to examine how mutations to the basic residues within NC affected virus particle release, gRNA packaging, and infectivity.  In general, mutations that reduced NC nucleolar localization did not affect particle release, but gRNA packaging and infectivity were impaired in some viral mutants.  The presence of a minimal number of positively charged residues within NC is not linked to gRNA packaging, although the location of the basic residues was important.  Elimination of NC nucleolar localization reduced the ability of the virus to spread in infectivity assays.  Together, these results suggest that NC nucleolar localization is important for infectivity, but not gRNA packaging or virus particle release.\nTo further examine the role of nucleoli in retroviral infection, a gain-of-function approach was used.   A heterologous nucleolar localization signal (NoLS), from either the HIV-1 Rev protein or the HSV ICP27 protein, was inserted into an NC mutant deficient in nucleolar localization.  In addition to being NoLSs, both the Rev and ICP27 sequences were also RNA-binding domains (RBDs).  Both sequences were able to restore NC nucleolar localization, and the presence of these heterologous sequences caused nucleolar accumulation of Gag without a nuclear export mutation.  Surprisingly, although the nucleolar localization signal from ICP27 did not hinder viral assembly, the NoLS from Rev greatly decreased viral budding.  Both NoLSs/RBD restored incorporation of gRNA into virus particles.  However, a virus containing either NoLS was noninfectious.  These data demonstrate that insertion of a heterologous NoLS/RBD binding domain is sufficient to restore incorporation of gRNA to a packaging deficient virus.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6214], "author_name_tesi": "Lochmann, Timothy Lewis", "last_name_ssi": "Lochmann", "middle_name_ssi": "Lewis", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leslie Joan Parent", "Leslie Joan Parent", "David Joseph Spector", "Jianming Hu", "Sergei A Grigoryev", "Christopher Herzog"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leslie Joan Parent, Dissertation Advisor", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Chair", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member", "Sergei A Grigoryev, Committee Member", "Christopher Herzog, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["packaging", "retrovirus", "assembly", "trafficking", "nucleoli", "RSV"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Helping Those Who Help Themselves: Does Counseling Enhance Retention?

The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between counseling, academic distress as measured by the CCAPS, and retention.

Two different high speed diagnostic techniques have been applied successfully to study the combustion and mixing characteristics of single-element shear-coaxial injector flowfield in a rocket combustor. Tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) is applied to make in situ measurements with combusting gas-gas propellants, and high speed imaging incorporating backlighting is applied to combusting and non-combusting liquid-gas and gas-gas propellants. \nTunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy has been used to make path-integrated temperature and H2O mole fraction measurements in a gaseous oxygen / gaseous hydrogen uni element rocket chamber with hot background flow. Four mixture conditions were studied at a nominal chamber pressure of 115 psia. Near infrared diode lasers were utilized to target rovibrational transitions of water vapor, which is created through the combustion processes. Both direct absorption spectroscopy and wavelength modulation spectroscopy with second harmonic normalized by first harmonic (1f normalized WMS-2f) techniques were applied, with the harmonic detection technique found to yield the best results. Centerline measurements were made at two axial locations, in the near-injector region and far-field region further downstream. Time-resolved measurements of temperature and H2O mole fraction in the rocket chamber are presented. \nThe TDLAS measurements shows clear differences between the near-injector and downstream measurement locations. Mean path-integrated temperatures and H2O mole fractions in the near-injector region are lower than the downstream measurement location. Fluctuations in path-integrated temperature and H2O mole fraction in the downstream location are significantly greater than the near-injector region. This suggests increased turbulence and larger-scale mixing processes are occurring in the downstream location. The time-averaged results are consistent with previous spatially-resolved Raman spectroscopy measurements made in a similar rocket combustor under similar flow conditions.\nThe primary atomization and combustion characteristics of a liquid oxygen (LOX) / gaseous hydrogen (GH2) shear coaxial injector element were also experimentally investigated. High speed movies using a shadowgraph imaging technique to visualize the LOX core were recorded for both hot-fire (LOX/GH2) and cold-flow (LOX/gaseous oxygen (GO2)) conditions with the same injector and chamber. Flow conditions were set to approximate realistic rocket conditions. For the hot-fire tests (LOX/GH2), chamber pressures were 600, 730, and 920 psia, with momentum flux ratios (annulus flow/post flow) of 2.7, 2.0 and 1.6 respectively. The rocket assembly utilized a preburner to provide a background flow (M&#8776;0.1) of hot gaseous nitrogen (GN2)/GH2/water (H2O) gas with 25% volumetric concentration of hydrogen. For the cold-flow tests (LOX/GO2 with GO2 background flow), chamber pressures were 650 and 830 psia, thus above and below the critical pressure of oxygen (731.6 psia), with momentum flux ratios (annulus flow/post flow) of 2.2 and 1.8 respectively. The high speed visualizations under hot-fire conditions show a long sinuous LOX core region that breaks into large dense-oxygen structures, which are then quickly consumed. These results do not agree with the classical phenomenological breakup model that suggests a liquid core that is rapidly sheared into a drop cloud. Rather, a large-scale fragmentation model may be better suited to describe the primary atomization behavior in combusting flow from a LOX/GH2 shear coaxial injector element at realistic rocket conditions. Unlike the hot-fire case, cold-flow LOX visualization movies show a clear difference between the two chamber pressures, with the higher pressure (supercritical) case resembling behavior indicative of gaseous mixing compared to the typically two phase mixing appearance of the lower pressure (subcritical) case. Time-resolved measurements of the intact-core length are presented, along with size and frequency distributions of separating large dense-oxygen structures under hot-fire conditions. &#8195;\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2867], "author_name_tesi": "Locke, Justin M", "last_name_ssi": "Locke", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Justin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert John Santoro", "Robert John Santoro", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Thomas Litzinger", "Stephen R Turns"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert John Santoro, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Chair", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Member", "Thomas Litzinger, Committee Member", "Stephen R Turns, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["liquid propulsion", "TDLAS", "absorption spectroscopy", "rocket engine testing", "hydrogen oxygen combustion", "high pressure systems"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Classification of polyphosphate-accumulating bacteria in benthic biofilms", "id": "26532", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11559", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) are microorganisms known to store excess phosphorus (P) as polyphosphate (poly-P) in environments subject to alternating aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

This study utilizes dual-polarization WSR-88D radar data to analyze nonsupercell tornadic storms over a three-and-a-half-year period focused on the mid-Atlantic and southeastern United States. The analysis reveals three repeatable signatures: the separation of specific differential phase (KDP) and differential reflectivity (ZDR) enhancement regions owing to size sorting, the descent of high KDP values preceding intensification of the low-level rotation, and rearward movement of the KDP enhancement region prior to tornadogenesis. This study employs a new method to define the ``separation vector,\" comprising the distance separating the enhancement regions and the direction from the KDP enhancement region to the ZDR enhancement region, measured relative to storm motion. The median separation distance between the enhancement regions is found to be around 4 km and tends to maximize around the time of tornadogenesis. A preferred quadrant for separation direction is found to be between parallel to and 90 degrees to the right of storm motion. Furthermore, it is shown that, for a given separation distance, the storm-relative helicity increases as the separation direction increases from 0 degrees toward 90 degrees.

During that time, a substantial amount of dry matter is lost as carbon dioxide, ammonia, methane, and other volatiles to the environment.  Anaerobic zones formed in the compost during phase I composting may result in emissions of malodorous gases such as hydrogen sulfide and various other sulfur-containing compounds.  These compounds have a low threshold of detection, so they may become a nuisance to neighborhoods adjacent to mushroom growing regions.  In addition to these negative aspects, water runoff from composting may also contaminate surface and groundwater supplies.\nShortening or eliminating phase I composting may help reduce some of the environmental problems associated with mushroom composting.  In an effort to alleviate some of the drawbacks of composting, we sought to develop a mushroom substrate that would not require phase I composting.  We evaluated milled corn stover (MCS), with and without supplements at various phases of the production cycle, for its use as a minimally-composted mushroom substrate.  Specific objectives of the study were to: 1) develop a phase II-only composting protocol for MCS, 2) determine suitable particle size of MCS for maximizing mushroom yields and biological efficiencies (BE), 3) evaluate several nutrient supplements added at fill, at spawning and at casing for their effect on mushroom yields, BE and average mushroom size, 4) evaluate use of spent mushroom substrate (SMS) added as an ingredient to MCS at fill and 5) evaluate millet-type and synthetic-type spawn and rate of spawn on mushroom yield, BE and average mushroom size.  \nMCS was subjected to a modified phase II-only composting process in \u201cminibunkers.\u201d  Several treatments resulted in a substrate that was selective for A . bisporus growth and mushroom production.  \nThree particle sizes were evaluated for their effect on mushroom yield, BE and mushroom size.  Substrate with the smallest particle sizes (89.2% <3 mm) resulted in higher yields (12.28 kg/m2) and BE (59.8%) compared to medium (9.22 kg/m2, 44.9%) and larger (4.95 kg/m2, 24.1%) particle size substrates.  \nSupplements (cottonseed meal, ground soybean, distiller\u2019s grain), added at fill, increased yields and BE compared to MCS alone.  Cottonseed meal addition (5% d/w) at fill resulted in higher yields (20.1 kg/m2) and BE (92.9%) than distiller\u2019s grain (5% d/w) and MCS alone.  SMS also was evaluated as an ingredient added to MCS at fill into minibunkers.  Addition of 48% SMS added at fill to MCS had no effect on yield and BE compared to MCS alone. \nDelayed-release nutrient supplements, added at spawning and/or casing, were evaluated for their effect on productivity.  Substrates supplemented with Lambert T6\u00ae at 6% d/w at spawning compared to Remo\u2019s All Season\u00ae at 6% d/w and T6\u00ae at 12% d/w produced higher yields.  Treatments supplemented with Lambert T6\u00ae (4% d/w) at casing, resulted in higher yields and BE compared to Lambert T7\u00ae and Remo\u2019s All Season\u00ae supplement used at casing.\nUse of synthetic-type spawn (Sylvan Matrix\u00ae) resulted in higher yields (15.8 kg/m2) and BE (73.0%) than millet-based spawn (13.0 kg/m2, 60.0%).  Two spawn rates (0.75% and 1.5% w/w) were evaluated for their effect on mushroom yield and BE.  The higher spawn rate resulted in higher yields (13.6 kg/m2) compared to the lower spawn rate (12.7 kg/m2), but BE was not affected.\nMCS, when subjected to phase II-only composting, may have potential for use as a mushroom substrate, especially with smaller-scale growers.  MCS is relatively inexpensive to prepare and dry matter losses are less, relative to traditional compost. In addition, incorporation of SMS into fresh MCS compost may provide a beneficial use for SMS and help reduce environmental impacts of mushroom substrate preparation.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5686], "author_name_tesi": "Loehr, Stephanie Michelle", "last_name_ssi": "Loehr", "middle_name_ssi": "Michelle", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel J Royse", "Daniel J Royse"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel J Royse, Thesis Advisor", "Daniel J Royse, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["mushroom", "Agaricus bisporus", "substrate", "spawn", "corn stover"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "OPTIMIZATION OF HYBRID POWER SOURCES FOR MOBILE ROBOTICS THROUGH THE USE OF ALLOMETRIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING\n", "id": "10817", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1398", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work presents design rules and methods used to optimize mobile ground robots early in the design process. The focus ranges from general geometric considerations for the overall size of a robot, to optimization of size and control of three sources of hybrid power for specific ground robots. The geometric analysis includes study of the platform\u2019s performance requirements for climbing, traversal and speed, and this work demonstrates that one can accurately calculate the necessary bulk properties of the robot including physical size, mass and power. \n\nOnce the bulk properties are calculated, a system-level model is designed for the robot platform using user-specified performance criteria. This system-level view decomposes the robot as a whole into its subsystems and the powertrain components used for locomotion. Such decomposition is used to accurately predict the necessary power, performance and allometry (size dependence) of each component. Once components are correctly sized, the overall system-level performance is calculated including operational time and cruising distance. Comparisons to experiments on existing robot platforms show the fidelity of this approach. Comparisons between conceptual robot models at both system and subsystem-levels allow the user to examine tradeoffs between different performance requirements. \n\nIn many cases, a specific sequence of tasks is needed for a robot to complete a given mission. This mission, for a given sized robot, translates into a power profile representing the power draw required to complete the task sequence. Dynamic Programming is used to optimize the control strategy and size of each component within the hybrid power source (battery, ultracapacitor and generator) for a number of missions. This work shows that, based on a given mission, the optimal power topology of a robot varies with the characteristics of its mission.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1387], "author_name_tesi": "Logan, Drew G.", "last_name_ssi": "Logan", "middle_name_ssi": "G.", "first_name_ssi": "Drew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sean N Brennan", "Sean N Brennan", "Timothy William Simpson", "Karl Martin Reichard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sean N Brennan, Thesis Advisor", "Sean N Brennan, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor", "Karl Martin Reichard, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["system modeling", "optimal design", "hybrid systems", "dynamic programming", "allometric design", "mobile robots", "robot performance"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "\u201cAt Risk\u201d Cardiovascular Health Profiles: Metabolic Dysregulation through Acculturative Processes for Hispanic Men and Women in the United States", "id": "23262", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10818", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research uses three waves of NHANES data (1999-2004) to investigate the impact of acculturation (using the length of time spent in the U.S., generational designation, citizenship status, and a linguistic acculturation scale) on the metabolic health (using blood sugar levels, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, and total serum triglycerides) of adult Hispanics living in the United States.

It engages three vital dimensions of consumer modernity: the role of the state, the role of society, and the role of space. The study questions the notion of a postwar hegemony of the American model of mass consumption and investigates the interplay of economic, political, social and cultural factors to fully understand the persistence of differences between both countries. While private disposable incomes were paramount in postwar America, public consumption and regulation in various forms plays a greater role in West Germany\u2019s consumer society. Whereas credit-financed patterns of material consumption promised wide-spread access to a middle-class standard of living in the United States, many middle-class West-Germans shied away from consumer credit and retained a b\u00fcrgerlich / genteel ethos of consumption that reinforced traditional class differences in household consumption. Traditional patterns of urban consumption in shopping, housing and transportation were upheld by both public intervention and more conservative consumer attitudes in 1950s and \u201860s West Germany. American consumer society, by contrast, suburbanized after the war with significant consequences for the supply of consumers with public goods and for America\u2019s landscape of retailing. While West Germans shopped in inner-city pedestrian malls, their American counterparts began to frequent suburban shopping centers. \nIn a first section I engage questions about the impact of public policy in shaping modern consumption patterns. I argue against the notion that the postwar boom in consumption was largely determined by the free play of the market. In both countries politics shaped mass consumption, albeit in different ways. Since the New Deal era, fostering mass demand had become an integral part of economic growth policies in the United States. But the extent of overt public consumption and economic redistribution was consciously limited. Instead, the 1950s saw the growth of what has been called a \u201chidden welfare state\u201d of tax exemptions, loan guarantees, and subsidies that helped promote a pattern of private suburban middle class consumption. In Germany, by contrast, public consumption was to play a much bigger role. Both conservative and social-democratic considerations led to state intervention in several areas. Expanded social-security and assistance programs indexed for a rising standard of living enabled access to mass consumption. Public spending on housing, health-care and transportation altered incentives for private consumer spending. State regulation of retailing helped preserve more traditional patterns of urban and class-based consumption. Thus consumer politics remained much more state-oriented than its American counterpart with negative as well as positive implications for consumers.\nThe second section turns to the consumers and the different social contexts in which they consume. As can be expected, household consumption patterns in both countries differ significantly immediately after the war, with German consumers spending a much larger portion of their income on food. As disposable income levels begin to converge, however, important differences remain. American consumer spending is much more focused on the automobile, the suburban home and the appliances that fill it \u2013 a middle class model of consumption. German household spending and consumer expectations, by contrast, continued to show significant differences by class. Much less than their American counterparts did Germans link the possibility of upward social mobility with the adoption of particular patterns of material consumption. This is illustrated by differences in the use of consumer credit. Whereas consumer credit skyrocketed in the United States after World War II, widely hailed as a democratic means to access the American standard of living, Germans remain largely reluctant to embrace this form of financing consumption. The striking difference in consumer debt still by 1970 points to different cultural attitudes towards consumption, but also brings us back to the impact of public policy. While Americans were reluctant to dip into their savings for the purchase of consumer durables, saving for consumption became common practice for German consumers backed by a more expansive social welfare state.     \nIntimately linked to public policy and social practice, the space of consumption accounts for a third area of significant divergence between both consumer societies. Germans \u201cconsumed\u201d space differently from Americans. Public housing programs and urban development (e.g. public transportation) contributed to the continuity of an urban pattern of consumption in Germany. A nation of renters, working class as well as middle class Germans were more likely to live in urban apartments than in suburban houses. Infrastructure programs for automobile traffic and subsidized mortgages, on the other hand, enticed Americans to move to the suburbs. The landscape of retailing changed accordingly. Tax exemptions and permissive zoning fueled the rise of suburban shopping centers and large supermarkets. City planners and state regulation in Germany, by contrast, helped preserve a retail structure in Germany centered on smaller stores in urban neighborhoods and city centers. Consumption in Germany was still decidedly more integrated in specific social milieus as well as in the urban public sphere. The rise of inner-city pedestrian malls in downtowns all over Germany since the 1950s illustrates the continued commitment to an urban model of consumption. \nPublic policy, consumer choices (informed by both cultural attitudes and economic restraints), and differences in geographic lay-out and use of space account for the emergence of two different paths to consumer modernity during the postwar decades. In the American case, these choices favored suburban housing and consumption patterns that centered on durable goods and the private home. West Germans did not fully embrace this model of mass consumption. Private prosperity was for many Germans more intimately tied to public spending. Despite modernization, familiar urban forms of consumption were retained and class and milieu differences continued to play a significant role. While some of these differences have somewhat subsided since the 1970s, the choices made in both societies during the formative postwar decades still inform mass consumption practices and the relationship between public and private consumption in Germany and the United States today.    \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2786], "author_name_tesi": "Logemann, Jan Ludwig", "last_name_ssi": "Logemann", "middle_name_ssi": "Ludwig", "first_name_ssi": "Jan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Scott Cross", "Greg Eghigian", "Adam Rome", "John Philip Christman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Scott Cross, Committee Chair", "Greg Eghigian, Committee Member", "Adam Rome, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["urban developement", "consumer society", "comparative", "postwar", "West Germany", "United States", "consumer credit", "public consumtion"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Familial Paternalism in the Federal System: Do The Types of Family Arrangements Matter?\n", "id": "6114", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3968", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Extensive research exists on gender and race/ethnic disparities in sentencing.  However, most of this research has either ignored or placed limited emphasis on the influence of offender\u2019s family circumstances on these types of sentencing disparities.  In addition, most of this research has focused on municipal court data, or pre-guidelines sentencing patterns.  The present study addresses this limitation by using a survey of Black, White, and Hispanic federal offenders of both sexes convicted of fraud or drug trafficking under the federal sentencing guidelines post-Mistretta to test the familial paternalism perspective on sentencing developed by Daly (1987).  The results show that the type of family arrangements fails to explain gender differences in sentencing, although they do exert significant effects on sentence length.  The results also indicate that the effects differ by type of offense.  Regardless of offenders\u2019 type of family arrangements, fraud offenders receive lenient treatment, while drug traffickers receive punitive treatment. I argue that the findings reflect the need for further research on the influence of familial paternalism on gender and race/ethnic disparities in the federal system.

To maximize the public benefits from protecting farmland through ACEs, preservation programs should consider the amenities generated by farmland in their ranking process. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3996], "author_name_tesi": "Loiacono, Matthew ", "last_name_ssi": "Loiacono", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard C Ready", "Stephan J Goetz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard C Ready, Thesis Advisor", "Stephan J Goetz, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Property Values", "Easements", "Agriculture", "Hedonic Pricing"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Sequences in comK prophage junction fragments cluster isolates of Listeria monocytogenes into subclones that are unique to individual meat and poultry processing plants: A possible model for rapid niche-specific adaptation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "10945", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4514", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Listeria monocytogenes is a foodborne pathogen that can cause listeriosis, a potentially fatal disease.

Based on sequences in both upstream and downstream comK prophage junction fragments, most ECII and ECIII isolates and the Canada outbreak strains were grouped into plant-specific subclones.

The current anti-retroviral regimen that requires treating a patient indefinitely with multiple medications suffers from several disadvantages including emergence of revertant viruses that negate the effectiveness of drugs and adverse effects of the medications. Hence, there is a critical need to develop novel drugs to add to the anti-retroviral arsenal. The capsid maturation step in the retroviral life cycle is being explored as a potentially novel therapeutic target. However, to design safe and effective drugs, it is important to understand the molecular details of this process. \n\nRetroviruses bud as non-infectious immature virus that must undergo an essential process of maturation to become infectious. During this process, the immature shell formed by the Gag structural polyprotein is cleaved by the viral protease and the mature shell is reassembled by the newly released capsid (CA) protein. The retroviral capsids are predicted to assemble based on fullerene principles, primarily composed of hexameric arrays of the CA protein with twelve CA pentamers interspersed. The &#945;1, &#945;2 and &#945;3 helices of N-terminal domain (NTD) of the CA protein associate to form a hexameric or a pentameric ring of CA protein that is connected to the adjacent hexameric ring via the dimerization of the second helix (dimer helix) in the C-terminal domain (CTD). Additionally, heterotypic NTD-CTD interactions also exist. An evolutionarily conserved region in the beginning of the CTD, known as the major homology region (MHR), plays multiple roles during virus life cycle including immature and mature virus assembly. However, based on the current models of mature retroviral capsids, the MHR motif does not appear to contribute directly and significantly to any of the CA-CA interfaces. To understand the function of the MHR during capsid maturation and to identify other regions of the protein involved in this process, we used a gain-of-function approach. \n\nWe have isolated two substitutions in the dimerization helix of Rous sarcoma virus CA protein that have the ability to suppress lethal defects in capsid maturation imposed by mutations in the MHR motif just upstream. Together with two previously published suppressors, these define an extended region of the dimerization helix that is unlikely to contribute directly to CA\u2013CA contacts but whose assembly-competence may be strongly affected by conformation. The broad-spectrum suppression and temperature-sensitivity exhibited by some mutants argues that they act through modulation of protein conformation. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of a temperature-sensitive mutant produced at permissive and non-permissive temperatures provides morphological evidence of the role of MHR in capsid assembly. These findings provide important biological evidence in support of a significant conformational change involving the dimerization helix and the MHR during maturation.\n\nWhile the structural details of the presumptive CA-CA interactions occurring during mature capsid assembly are now becoming clearer, the mechanism by which this capsid assembly process is regulated remains unknown. Based on the ability to trigger in vitro assembly of HIV-1 and RSV CA using sodium chloride and sodium phosphate respectively, and the identification of a putative cluster of positively charged residues at the tripartite interface of RSV capsid, we hypothesized that electrostatic shielding of these charged residues is necessary to trigger capsid assembly. We describe spontaneous isolation of two charge-change mutations at the tripartite interface that rescue the infectivity of a previously characterized crippled MHR mutant that is assembly-incompetent. Several targeted mutations that reduce the positive charge at the tripartite interface rescue infectivity of the assembly-incompetent MHR mutant. Certain CA proteins with mutations that reduce the positive charge at the tripartite capsid interface exhibit enhanced assembly kinetics and reduced phosphate dependency as measured by the in vitro assembly assay. Together, our data provide genetic as well as biochemical evidence for a biological role of charge-shielding at the tripartite interface during capsid assembly, presumably during nucleation. \n\nThe viral and cellular factors that may play such a role in situ during capsid assembly are discussed. We propose a model of capsid maturation wherein the conformational changes of CA protein and the screening of electrostatic forces at CA-CA interfaces play critical roles in control of capsid assembly.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4910], "author_name_tesi": "Lokhandwala, Parvez Mubasshir", "last_name_ssi": "Lokhandwala", "middle_name_ssi": "Mubasshir", "first_name_ssi": "Parvez", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rebecca C Craven", "Rebecca C Craven", "John Warren Wills", "Leslie Joan Parent", "Ralph Lauren Keil", "Jianming Hu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rebecca C Craven, Dissertation Advisor", "Rebecca C Craven, Committee Chair", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MHR", "maturation", "capsid", "CA", "Retrovirus", "Rous sarcoma virus"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Improving Unbound Aggregate Roads through a Comparison of the Performance of Materials", "id": "16184", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1492", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Unbound aggregate roads, or unpaved roads, generally do not hold up to the expectations of the general public. This forces agencies to often pave roads unnecessarily. Wearing course materials used for unpaved roads and the subgrade they are placed on need to be improved in order to see an improvement in these roads. Research was conducted to prove if there is a benefit to using Driving Surface Aggregate (DSA), a material developed specifically for use as a wearing course, over another commonly used aggregate gradation, PennDOT 2A, designed for use as a base course. The performance of DSA and PennDOT 2A under scaled loading with the one-third Model Mobile Load Simulator (MMLS3) was compared in terms of rutting. The materials were evaluated in the laboratory at a lightweight traffic setting (simulating passenger vehicles, pick-up trucks and SUVS) and at a heavy traffic setting (simulating tri-axial and semi-trailers). The MMLS3 was also used in the field on the lightweight traffic setting to evaluate the materials in an as-placed setting. DSA consistently performed better than PennDOT 2A with lower average rut depths, although the predictability of the rut depth formation should be studied in more detail. In considering subgrade weakness, a rehabilitation practice called full-depth reclamation (FDR) has been used to increase roadbed stiffness in paved roads. The impact of using this method for unpaved roads has been evaluated. In situ stiffness testing using the lightweight deflectometer (LWD) and condition assessments of four roads in Erie County, Pennsylvania were compared to evaluate the potential of FDR as a practice to improve the subgrade for unpaved roads. A road consisting of FDR with a tar and chip surface treatment had the highest overall stiffness when compared to a FDR road without a surface treatment, an aggregate-surfaced road and an unsurfaced road. Both FDR roads showed higher stiffness over the spring-thaw period proving potential benefit to adopting this method as an unpaved road practice; however, future research is needed to evaluate the performance of a FDR road with an aggregate surface.

Separated flow produced by these devices is known to be a major contributor to these phenomena.  In order to better characterize these effects, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study is performed.  First, an in vitro flow loop consisting of a backward-facing step is used to generate an experimentally formed thrombus.  Its geometry is captured using magnetic resonance imaging, and CFD simulations are then performed with a reconstructed, computer rendering of the thrombus.  Two-dimensional studies at an average Reynolds number of 525 and a sinusoidal velocity-inlet waveform are performed on the in vitro model\u2019s geometry.  Three-dimensional simulations using a physiologic velocity-inlet waveform taken from a human iliac artery are performed at an average Reynolds number of 1000, with and without the reconstructed thrombus, to observe the flow and surfaces stresses.  The frequency of the velocity-inlet waveform is varied from 50 to 100 bpm to observe the effects of Strouhal number.  From these simulations, wall shear stress magnitudes are shown to increase with Strouhal number, with the 100 bpm case producing values up to 53% higher than the 50 bpm case, approaching 35 dynes/cm2.  Flow instabilities are more pronounced in the 100 bpm case compared to the lower frequency cases, with Taylor cells visible during periods of flow deceleration.  From these results, predictions into the likelihood of thrombosis and embolization are made, with larger thrombi being more likely in the 50 bpm case than the higher frequency cases, due to the larger recirculation regions observed past the step and the reduced wall washing.  While significant embolization is not likely to occur at the current flow conditions, at higher Reynolds numbers, the 100 bpm case is predicted to be more susceptible, due to an increase in wall shear stress along the clot\u2019s surface, with shear stresses of 50 dyne/cm2 observed for a Reynolds number of 1000.

However, it is extremely challenging to directly measure pore fluid pressures in \nlow-permeability mudstones. We developed a new pressure penetrometer, the Temperature-Two-Pressure (T2P) probe, which allows the pore fluid pressure to be accurately inferred from partial dissipation records. We used the strain path method to simulate pore pressure generation and dissipation due to penetration of penetrometers with various geometries. Our theoretical analyses suggest that one of the key controls on soil behavior is the undrained rigidity index. The step geometry of the T2P enables that the pore fluid pressure and hydraulic diffusivity of the penetrated sediment to be estimated independently within a very short monitoring time by comparing the dissipated pressures at the tip and shaft pressure ports. The measured data suggested the proposed approach can provide reliable and rapid estimates of pore fluid pressure from partial dissipation records. However, this approach requires high quality dissipation data and accurate soil model. Modeling results show that the tip pressure dissipation of a tapered probe initially follows that of its needle probe, starts to depart from its needle probe when the pressure front coming from its overlying shaft reaches the tip pressure port, and converges to the pressure dissipation of its overlying shaft when the narrow pressure pulse caused by its needle probe decays away. During the transition, it forms a \u201cbench\u201d on the tip pressure dissipation curve. We related the excess pore pressure ratio on the \u201cbench\u201d to a single parameter, the undrained rigidity index. This allows the in situ pressure to be estimated from partial dissipation data without knowing detailed soil properties. In addition, we proposed a new extrapolation approach, inverse square root of time extrapolation, based on the model results. It can provide pore fluid pressure with desirable accuracy for soft marine sediments with low undrained rigidity index. On the other hand, we conducted extensive uniaxial consolidation tests on whole core samples to obtain the consolidation properties of the sediments, and use them to predict pore fluid pressure from porosity profiles. The results suggest that the compression index linearly decreases with in situ void ratio. This implies that a local virgin compression curve cannot validly be extrapolated over a large range in effective stress. This effect is particularly important at shallow depth where void ratio decreases rapidly. The relationship of compressibility index versus void ratio can be obtained from a single consolidation test by compressing the soil over a large range in effective stress. A virgin compression curve can then be constructed based on this relationship to predict pore fluid pressure. In the Ursa Basin, this new approach successfully predicted pressures interpreted from the penetrometer measurements within the non-deformed sediments. The mass transport deposits appear to be more compacted than the non-deformed sediments. The virgin compression curve based on the assumption of uniaxial strain underpredicts the in situ pressure in the mass transport deposits.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2263], "author_name_tesi": "Long, Hui ", "last_name_ssi": "Long", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter B Flemings", "Derek Elsworth", "Abraham S Grader", "Chris J Marone", "Demian Saffer", "John T Germaine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter B Flemings, Committee Chair", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Chair", "Abraham S Grader, Committee Member", "Chris J Marone, Committee Member", "Demian Saffer, Committee Member", "John T Germaine, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Overpressure", "mudstones", "penetrometer", "IODP", "consolidation", "permeability", "compression index", "URSA"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "SALIENT: Stochastic, Adaptive Latency Improvement for Event Notification Trees", "id": "16046", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7817", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A challenge in massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) is the need for game event information to be quickly disseminated to all participants.

Effective SHM can assure the safety and reliability of aircraft, while reducing costly maintenance time associated with traditional visual inspections. \n\nIn this thesis a nonlinear spectroscopy-based detection and localization approach was developed on a stiffened aluminum plate test bed, representative of typical skin-stiffener joints on airframe structures. Damage conditions were induced to represent working rivets and loss of torque in fasteners, common precursors to fatigue crack propagation. Active vibration sources were used to excite the structure, and strain sensor rosettes were used to measure the nonlinear vibration responses from the damage. Estimates of the damage location were obtained by using a Principal Strain based Localization (PSL) approach, to estimate the direction of wave propagation associated with the nonlinear signature from the damage location. An emphasis was placed on the use of minimal sensors and actuators, for a lightweight and practical implementation on aircraft.\n\nA systematic approach was developed for evaluating the PSL estimates using acquired strain time records. Strain amplitudes were processed at the nonlinear frequency components, and potential automation methods were developed. Optimal drive frequency selections were made by a direct comparison of damaged structure nonlinear responses with a healthy baseline. The drive condition corresponding to the highest increase in nonlinear response was studied, at various active drive levels, to determine effective forcing required for accurate localization using the PSL technique. \n\nThe undamped stiffened plate configuration was used for development of both single tone and modulated wave nonlinear damage detection methods. Single tone transient methods were explored, but the technique was hampered by low signal-to-noise at the nonlinear components. A steady-state single tone excitation resulted in higher signal-to-noise estimates, but results were degraded by reverberation effects from the plate boundaries. Using the modulated wave approach with a constant exercising wave (low drive) frequency of 750 Hz, high sensitivity detection (up to 15 dB) was achieved in both 3 rows loose and 1 row loose damage conditions, with probing wave (high drive) frequencies of 6000 Hz and 5000 Hz, respectively. Accurate localization results were obtained with the use of low force levels, on the order of 1 N in amplitude. PSL angle estimates showed a weak dependence on reverberation radius estimates for the plate, but showed a strong dependence on forcing amplitude. Angle estimates were most accurate at low drive levels, where the strain response showed discrete sideband amplitudes. At higher force amplitudes, angle estimates were degraded, due to apparent nonlinear damping effects, and the development of a broadband chaotic response.\n\nIn the edge-damped plate configuration, localization results were enhanced in the steady-state single tone approach, due to increased absorption at the plate boundaries. However, the broadband chaotic response degraded estimates at higher force levels. The modulated wave approach showed 10-20 dB detection sensitivity in the tested damage conditions. In addition, a low nonlinear response was shown in the healthy condition. This was due to the decrease in nonlinearity from the plate boundaries, a result of the added edge damping treatment. Compared to the undamped plate configuration, adjustments in probing wave drive frequency and forcing were necessary to induce sufficient nonlinear response. Many of the optimal drive frequencies were observed to be near the critical frequency of the plate (4800 Hz), where acoustic radiation damping losses are largest. However, required force levels were considered low enough for the use of low power, lightweight actuators in both damped and undamped plate test beds (<10 N of force amplitude across all test cases). \n\nThe modulated wave PSL method was successfully transitioned for use in airframe structures. An excitation corresponding to the blade passage of the UH-60 was used as a low frequency source on the stiffened plate, an approach that would reduce the weight and power requirements in an embedded application. An active drive approach was used on a laboratory UH-60 upper cabin test bed with simulated damage, showing up to 20 dB in detection sensitivity. The developed experimental approaches represent a key step in the use of nonlinear vibration based methods, in particular wave modulation, for embedded airframe SHM applications.

Initial studies have demonstrated the feasibility of this process, with the individual modules operated below the critical flux to insure stable filtration without fouling.\n\tThe overall objective of this thesis was to develop a more comprehensive and fundamental understanding of the hydrodynamic behavior of concentrated resin slurry particles in hollow fiber membranes.  The critical flux was evaluated for a variety of resin particles, ranging in size from 10 to 45 \u00b5m, over a range of cross flow velocities, particle concentrations, and in different buffer solutions.\n\tExperimental data indicate that the critical flux (J_CRIT) varies linearly with the wall shear stress (\u03c4_w) over a wide range of conditions.  The ratio of J_CRIT/\u03c4_w was thus used as a fundamental parameter to describe the critical flux for a given particle and feed concentration. J_CRIT decreased with increasing feed particle volume fraction and was essentially independent of the buffer condition and particle size.  \nThe critical flux data were analyzed using the Brownian diffusion, shear-induced diffusion, and inertial lift models.  The linear dependence on the wall shear stress is in agreement with the form predicted by the shear-induced diffusion model, but this model was unable to explain the observed dependence on particle size and concentration.  Instead, it appears that the critical flux is determined by a critical (maximum) value of outlet particle concentration, which was equal to about 40% of the dense packed concentration.   These results provide important insights into the hydrodynamic conditions needed for stable operation of the hollow fiber membrane modules employed in countercurrent tangential chromatography systems.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7814], "author_name_tesi": "Long, Matthew Ray", "last_name_ssi": "Long", "middle_name_ssi": "Ray", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["critical flux", "resin", "slurry", "chromatography"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE NEURAL SUBSTRATES OF HUMAN SOCIALITY IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: AN FMRI INVESTIGATION", "id": "9757", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3985", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sociality is indissociable from human life and experience.   Humans are constantly engaged in social interaction, whether it be in actuality or imagined, and are particularly sensitive to social stimuli.  This high degree of social interaction and sensitivity is a byproduct of human biology and culture and contributes to healthy growth, maturation, and the majority of the joy experienced throughout one\u2019s life.  Unfortunately, it also accounts for much of an individual\u2019s pain and suffering.  Due to the importance and pervasiveness of sociality to human life, it is certainly worthy of research.  Although behavioral studies comprise the majority of the studies on sociality to date, only recently has research been devoted to the underlying neural substrates supporting social phenomena.  Even more scarce are studies investigating these substrates in children and adolescents.  In the current research, substrates underlying sociality were investigated in children and adolescents using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In particular, three components of sociality were investigated:  Agency, Moral Judgments, and Social Emotions. Agency involves the way we come to understand ourselves as causes of actions and consequences and is the precursor to more complex human social constructs. A moral judgment is defined as the capacity to make decisions and judgments based on internal principles and to act in accordance with such judgments. Social emotions, or more precisely moral emotions, are defined as differing from basic emotions in that they are intrinsically linked to the interests or welfare either of society as a whole or of persons other than the agent.  Based on behavioral, imaging, electrophysiology, and lesion studies, these components and their underlying neural circuitry play vital roles in social information processing and behavior and when abnormal, result in severe social deficits.  Written vignettes endowed with social moral and/or social moral emotional content were utilized in the current research to investigate these typically developing neural networks in children and adolescents.  In the Agency and Moral Judgment task, the participants were required to respond to these vignettes as to whether the social interaction was morally \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong.\u201d Participants were required to only passively read the vignettes in the Social Emotion task. A shared network was identified between the Agency, Moral Judgment, and Social Emotions conditions including medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), medial parietal, and lateral temporal regions.  Although similarities were marked, clearly identifiable differences were noted between social constructs.  Select frontal and limbic/subcortical neural activations were observed to be influenced by age.  Meanwhile, the shared network between constructs remained steadily recruited across the developmental sample.  In conclusion, the results revealed the complex interplay of cognitive and affective processing, both statically and developmentally, subserving the core components of social moral behavior.  These findings will be most helpful in the early detection, intervention, and prevention of social disorders, such as autism, adolescent-onset schizophrenia, sociopathy, and others.
