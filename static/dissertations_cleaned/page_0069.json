Edward Coulson)\n\n    This chapter analyzes homeownership externailities in a neighborhood setting.  We use the clustered neighborhoods in the American Housing Survey to measure that benefit in the form of higher housing prices in neighborhoods with higher ownership rates (and lower vacancies). We attempt to account for unobservable neighborhood and house attributes that may be correlated with occupancy and ownership through instrumental variables, switching regressions and panel methods.  The subsidization of homeownership, e.g. the mortgage interest deduction is justified on efficiency grounds only to the extent that it provides benefits to people other than the homeowner.  Estimates indicate that a housing transition from renting to owning creates approximately $1000 in measured benefits, which is more than the deadweight loss arising from the mortgage interest deduction.\n\n    CHAPTER 2:\n\nAnalyzing Home Improvement Behavior in a Dynamic Setting \n    \n    This chapter concentrates on the determinants of home improvement behavior in a dynamic setting both with and without neighborhood effects. In the evolution of the body of home improvement literature, there have been two basic ways of approaching home improvement behavior. The first method looks at moving behavior in that a homeowner can \"change\" housing capital simply by moving. The other method, which becomes my focus, is the physical improvement of a homeowner's own unit. Early studies first analyzed improvement behavior using a static framework, and until recently, only very basic dynamic analyses of home improvement behavior. This is an extension of the current body of literature concerning home improvement behavior with an emphasis on dynamic and neighborhood aspects. While using data publicly available from the American Housing Survey (AHS), I conduct analyses that examine the home improvmement behavior in various dynamic settings including one with neighborhood effects.  According to the US Census Bureau, $135 billion was spent on home improvement activities in 2007 alone, so the analysis is not only looks at a vital part of the economy, but also a vital part of homeownership.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2180], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Herman ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Herman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["N Edward Coulson", "N Edward Coulson", "Mark John Roberts", "Sung Jae Jun", "Brent William Ambrose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["N Edward Coulson, Dissertation Advisor", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Chair", "Mark John Roberts, Committee Member", "Sung Jae Jun, Committee Member", "Brent William Ambrose, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Urban", "Housing", "Real Estate", "Economics", "Externalities"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EVALUATING LANGUAGE GROUP DIFFERENCES IN THE SUBSKILLS OF READING USING A COGNITIVE DIAGNOSTIC MODELING AND DIFFERENTIAL SKILL FUNCTIONING APPROACH \n\n", "id": "11781", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2292", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using a sequential mixed-methods design, this study examined the differences between two native language groups\u2014those with an East Asian language background and those with a Romance language background \u2014in regard to reading subskills as represented in the Michigan English Language Assessment Battery (MELAB) reading test, so as to provide diagnostic information for second-language reading instruction.

Further, given the same overall English reading ability and gender, it is more likely for East Asian ESL learners to have mastery of the skill of connecting and synthesizing information than Romance ESL learners. In addition, given the same overall English reading ability, female ESL learners are more likely to have mastery of the skill of syntax and the skill of connecting and synthesizing information than males.

Nine hours and seventeen minutes of video recordings of twenty reading circle activities from three college-level ESL classes constitute the data for the study. Using conversation analysis as an analytical framework, the study addresses two research foci: grammar-in-interaction and lexis-in-interaction. \n\tWhen perturbations or disfluencies occur as the first speaker is in the midst of producing her turn-construction unit (TCU), which is not uncommon in L2 talk, an opportunity space is available for the second speaker to make a mid-TCU entry. Five actions that can occur in such an opportunity space are described: collaborative completion, handover, turn-terminating yeah, takeover, and curtailment. In collaborative completion, the second speaker brings the first speaker\u2019s TCU to grammatical or pragmatic completion to achieve various interactional functions. Handover, turn-terminating yeah, takeover, and curtailment, on the other hand, are actions deployed to indicate that speaker transfer is relevant or is effected so that the first speaker can abandon a perturbation-filled TCU that she has much trouble in constructing. \n\tWhat emerges from such grammatical and turn-taking practices is an image of the participants as L2 learners who, with emerging interactional competence, and through collaborative efforts, are able to resolve grammatical difficulties in TCU construction on some occasions while on other occasions having to resort to circumvention strategies due to a lack of grammatical or linguistic resources. This study thus presents a more complete picture of L2 speakers\u2019 grammatical and interactional competences than previous CA studies. \n\tIn lexis-in-interaction, analytic attention is turned to how epistemics impacts lexis-focused interactions. Specifically, three practices are described: uncertainty-marking, letting-it-pass, and understanding check questions. Uncertainty-marking is deployed by the speaker to initiate repair on a lexical item, whose pronunciation, form, meaning, or use she is uncertain about, and to elicit other-repair. Letting-it-pass and understanding check questions are practices deployed by the discussion leader to conceal her unknowing status or to uphold a dissembled knowing status with regard to the definition of a particular lexical item. The analysis of these practices demonstrates that opportunities for vocabulary learning is intimately bound up with the participants\u2019 practical concerns of their epistemic status in relation to the target word and to each other as members or leaders of a discussion group. \n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9194], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Houxiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Houxiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Kelly Hall", "Celeste S Kinginger", "Athelstan Canagarajah", "Youb Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan Kelly Hall, Dissertation Advisor", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member", "Athelstan Canagarajah, Committee Member", "Youb Kim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["conversation analysis", "L2 interaction", "grammar", "lexis", "turn-taking", "epistemics", "learning opportunities", "uncertainty-marking"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS AND INTERACTIONS OF C60 ON Ag(111)AND Pb(111)\n", "id": "10509", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2355", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The geometry of adsorbed C60 influences its collective properties. We report the dynamical low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy studies to determine the geometry of a C60 monolayer, Ag(111)-(2&#8730;3 \u00d7 2&#8730;3)30 &#9702;-C60 and related density functional theory calculations. The stable monolayer has C60\nmolecules in vacancies that result from the displacement of surface atoms. C60 bonds with hexagons down, with their mirror planes parallel to that of the substrate.\nThe results indicate that vacancy structures are the rule rather than the exception for C60 monolayers on close-packed metal surfaces and closely related to the anneal.\nLow-energy electron diffraction (LEED) indicates that the monolayer structure of C60 on Pb(111) comprises two coexisting incommensurate structures with nonsymmetry epitaxial rotations near 20 &#9702; relative to the Pb(111) lattice. These structures are observed in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) as Moir\u00b4e superstructures having periods of about 46\u00b0Aand 34\u00b0A. The Moir\u00b4e images and LEED patterns are consistent with two higher-order commensurate (HOC) structures that were identified using the hexagonal number sequence method. These structures are close to predictions from the Novaco-McTague theory of epitaxial rotation, assuming a weakly corrugated substrate potential. As a consequence of the fullerenes within the Moir\u00b4e structures having different local environments, the energetic alignment of the molecular resonances is also modulated, with shifts measured by tunneling\nspectroscopy of up to 20 meV.\nLEED experiments and grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to study the adsorption of Xe on a substrate composed of a monolayer of C60 molecules on a Ag(111) surface. LEED adsorption isobars indicated that the adsorption occurs in steps, with the Xe initially adopting a structure having the same unit cell as the C60. Isosteric heats corresponding to the first two steps were measured to be 234 \u00b1 8 and 204 \u00b1 14 meV, respectively. For the simulations, the interaction potential of Xe with the composite substrate was modeled as the sum of\ntwo parts: the Xe-Ag part was computed using an ab initio van der Waals potential that varies as an inverse-distance cubed and the Xe-C60 part was computed using a spherically averaged C60 potential [E. S. Hernandez et al., J. Low Temp. Phys. 134, 309 (2004)]. The resulting adsorption potential is highly corrugated, with the most attractive sites located in the threefold hollows between the C60 molecules, forming a honeycomb array. The simulations (at temperatures ranging from 55 to 90K) show that these attractive sites are filled first, followed by adsorption in two types of secondary sites, where a competition exists due to steric hindrance. The thermodynamic properties of film growth obtained in the simulation are in good agreement with the experiment.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2340], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Hsin-I ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hsin-I", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Renee Denise Diehl", "Renee Denise Diehl", "Milton Walter Cole", "Roy F Willis", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Renee Denise Diehl, Dissertation Advisor", "Renee Denise Diehl, Committee Chair", "Milton Walter Cole, Committee Member", "Roy F Willis, Committee Member", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vacancy", "hoc", "lead", "silver", "fullerene"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "INFLUENCES ON LIFE SATISFACTION IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA", "id": "8712", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2286", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The present study aims to explore predictors of quality of life using the data collected by Chick et al.

However, our current knowledge of protein structures and functions are far from complete to achieve this goal. On the other hand, nature has successfully evolved an enormous number of proteins with novel functions for their hosts to fit the ever changing environments, and naturally occurring proteins present the most diverse and complicated information about protein structure-function relationships. Studying the evolutionary-related proteins with structural and functional homology will provide not only the detailed information about protein structure-function relationships, but also the insights to the strategies that nature had adopted for protein evolution.\n \nHere, we studied two pairs of enzymes with significant homology on their structures, reaction mechanisms, and the active site architectures. In our attempt to interconvert the enzymatic activities between two members in the same pair, rational methods, such as site-directed mutagenesis and rational domain swapping, were applied first on the basis of our current understanding of each protein. Further, the additional sequence spaces were explored using combinatorial methods, such as ITCHY, random mutagenesis, and DNA shuffling, to identify their potential roles in terms of protein structures and functions. \n\nThe first pair of enzymes we chose are Escherichia coli purT-encoded glycinamide ribonucleotide (GAR) transformylase (PurT) and Escherichia coli N5-carboxylaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (N5-CAIR) synthetase (PurK). While both enzymes are involved in the de novo purine biosynthesis, PurT catalyzes the third reaction of the purine biosynthetic pathway, the conversion of GAR, ATP and formate to formyl GAR, ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi); and PurK catalyzes the sixth reaction of the purine biosynthetic pathway, the conversion of 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide (AIR), ATP and bicarbonate to N5-CAIR, ADP and Pi. The effort to interconvert the enzymatic activities between PurT and PurK suggested that these two enzymes might evolve through domain swapping. Several crucial structural elements for catalysis were also identified in each protein, which provides value information for protein structure-function relationships.  \n\nThe second pair of enzymes are Escherichia coli N-acetylneuraminate lyase (NAL) and Escherichia coli dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), two (&#946;/&#945;)8  barrel proteins. NAL catalyzes the degradation of N-acetylneuminate (NANA) to N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and pyruvate. DHDPS catalyzes the branch-point reaction of the lysine biosynthetic pathway in plants and microbes: the condensation of L-aspartate-&#946;-semialdehyde and pyruvate to dihydrodipicolinate (DHDP). Both enzymes were observed to be able to catalyze each other\u2019s reaction, and this functional promiscuity between NAL and DHDPS is considered as a strong statement that they are evolutionary-related. A possible evolutionary scheme from NAL to DHDPS through divergent path was further approved by the attempt to interconvert the enzymatic activities between NAL and DHDPS. A conserved Arg residue in DHDPS was identified to be crucial for the DHDPS activity. Several DHDPS mutants with an enhanced NAL activity were also identified using combinatorial methods. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2332], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Hui ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen James Benkovic", "Costas D Maranas", "Squire J Booker", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen James Benkovic, Committee Chair", "Costas D Maranas, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["protein evolution", "protein engineering", "purine biosynthetic pathway", "domain swapping", "(&#946;/&#945;)8 barrel protein"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTION OF CHLOROSOME PROTEINS \nIN THE GREEN SULFUR BACTERIUM CHLOROBIUM TEPIDUM\n\n\n\n", "id": "6897", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2402", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-01-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chlorosomes are the light-harvesting antennae of the green sulfur bacteria, which usually live in extremely light-limited environments. In Chlorobium tepidum, ten kinds of proteins (CsmA, CsmB, CsmC, CsmD, CsmE, CsmF, CsmH, CsmI, CsmJ, and CsmX) are located on the chlorosome envelope membrane. Cross-linking experiments were performed to detect the relative locations and interactions among the chlorosome envelope proteins. CsmA forms homomultimers in the baseplate and interacts with the Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein. The pre-CsmA, CsmB and CsmF proteins interact with CsmA on the edge of the CsmA baseplate. CsmC forms homomultimers and it might be located on the opposite side from the baseplate facing the cytoplasm. Iron-sulfur chlorosome proteins CsmI and CsmJ form heterodimers, and both interact with CsmB. A model of the protein organization of the chlorosome membrane is proposed based on the cross-linking information. \nThe CsmI, CsmJ, and CsmX proteins have strong sequence similarity in the amino-terminal domains to [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins. The roles of the three iron-sulfur proteins were tested in single, double and triple knock-out mutants in all combinations. Fluorescence quenching and restoration experiments in chlorosomes and cells of the mutants suggest that CsmI and CsmJ are the most likely candidates for transferring electrons to and from the quencher within the chlorosome (most probably chlorobiumquinone) when the environmental oxygen concentration is changed. The other chlorosome proteins can be divided into three groups according to their sequence similarity: CsmA/CsmE, CsmB/CsmF and CsmC/CsmD. CsmH contains two structural domains related in sequence to CsmB/CsmF and CsmC/CsmD. The functions of the chlorosome proteins were tested in double and triple mutants lacking members of the CsmB/CsmF or CsmC/CsmD motif family. The mutants exhibited apparent growth defects under limiting light intensities and contained significantly reduced pigment amounts. Chlorosomes of the mutants exhibited significant differences in chlorosome size, shape, and absorption properties. These phenotypic effects suggest that chlorosome proteins play roles in pigment incorporation into the chlorosomes and chlorosome assembly.

This model assumes that both bidders submit their own sealed bids, and the transaction price is determined by a weighted average between the submitted bids when the buyer\u2019s offer is higher than the seller\u2019s ask. It captures the bargaining process between two parties. Working within this double auction model, we first establish the nonparametric identification of both the buyer\u2019s and the seller\u2019s private value distributions in two bid data scenarios; from the ideal situation in which all bids are available, to a more realistic setting in which only the transacted bids are available. Specifically, we can identify both private value distributions when all of the bids are observed. However, we can only partially identify the private value distributions on the support with positive (conditional) probability of trade when only the transacted bids are available in the data. Second, we estimate double auctions with bargaining using a two-step procedure that incorporates bias correction. We then show that our value density estimator achieves the same uniform convergence rate as Guerre, Perrigne, and Vuong (2000) for one-sided auctions. Monte Carlo experiments show that, in finite samples, our estimation procedure works well on the whole support and significantly reduces the large bias of the standard estimator without bias correction in both interior and boundary regions.\n\nChapter 2: Nonparametric Identification of k-Double Auctions Using Price Data\n\nThis chapter studies the model identification problem of k-double auctions between one buyer and one seller when the transaction price, rather than the traders\u2019 bids, can be observed. Given that only the price data is available, I explore an identification strategy that utilizes the double auctions with extreme pricing weight (k=1 or 0) and exclusive covariates that shift only one trader\u2019s value distribution to identify both the buyer\u2019s and the seller\u2019s value distributions nonparametrically. First, as each exclusive covariate can take at least two values, the buyer\u2019s and the seller\u2019s value distributions are partially identified from the price distribution for k=1 or k=0. The identified set is sharp and can be easily computed. I provide a set of sufficient conditions under which the traders\u2019 value distributions are point identified. Second, when the exclusive covariates are continuous, it is shown that the buyer\u2019s and the seller\u2019s value distributions will be uniquely determined by a partial differential equation that only depends on the price distribution, provided that the value distributions are known for at least one value of the exclusive covariates.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12050], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Huihui ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huihui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joris Pinkse", "Joris Pinkse", "Sung Jae Jun", "Peter Newberry", "Runze Li", "Sung Jae Jun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joris Pinkse, Dissertation Advisor", "Joris Pinkse, Committee Chair", "Sung Jae Jun, Committee Member", "Peter Newberry, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Outside Member", "Sung Jae Jun, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Double Auctions", "Bargaining", "Nonparametric Identification", "Kernel Estimation", "Boundary Correction"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Adapted Group Lifestyle Triple P: Results from a Randomized Pilot Intervention Trial", "id": "23447", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10669", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study evaluated the effectiveness of a lifestyle-specific parenting program for the treatment and prevention of childhood obesity.

This is a variable selection problem for high-dimensional data, with SNPs as the predictors and phenotypes as the responses in our statistical model.\n\nIn genome-wide association studies, phenotypical values are either collected at a single time point for each subject, or collected repeatedly over a period at subject-specific time points.

We approximate time-varying effects by Legendre polynomials, and present a Bayesian hierarchical model with group lasso penalties that encourage sparse solutions at the group level.\n\nIn both scenarios, our models obviate the choice of the tuning parameters by imposing diffuse hyperpriors on them and estimating them along with other parameters, and provide not only point estimates but also interval estimates of all parameters. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are developed to simulate the parameters from their posterior distributions. The proposed methods are illustrated with numerical examples and a real data set from the Framingham Heart Study.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3268], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Jiahan ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiahan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rongling Wu", "Rongling Wu", "Runze Li", "Bruce G Lindsay", "Tao Yao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rongling Wu, Dissertation Advisor", "Rongling Wu, Committee Chair", "Runze Li, Committee Chair", "Bruce G Lindsay, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lasso", "variable selection", "Bayesian approach", "high-dimensional data"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "IGNITION TRANSIENT IN AN ETHYLENE FUELED SCRAMJET ENGINE WITH AIR THROTTLING\n", "id": "9560", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3195", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research focuses on the modeling and simulation of ignition transient and subsequent combustion dynamics in an ethylene fueled supersonic combustion ramjet (scramjet) engine.  The primary objectives are: 1) to establish an efficient and accurate numerical framework for the treatment of unsteady flow and flame dynamics in scramjet propulsion systems; and 2) to investigate the effects of transverse air throttling on flow development and fuel-air mixing, and to identify its positive influence on ignition and flameholding in a scramjet combustor; and 3) to construct a detailed study investigating ignition transient to identify underlying essential mechanisms by means of air throttling implementation technique.\nA comprehensive numerical study of the combustion dynamics in a scramjet combustor is performed.  The analysis treats the conservation equations in three dimensions and takes into account finite-rate chemical reactions and variable thermophysical properties for a multi-component reacting flow.  Menter\u2019s k-&#969; SST two-equation turbulence model is implemented, as it performs well for shear-layer flows and wall turbulence effects.  The governing equations and the associated boundary conditions are solved using a density-based finite-volume approach and four-stage Runge-Kutta scheme to utilize explicit time marching. The code is parallelized using the domain decomposition technique and message passing interface (MPI).  The theoretical formulation and numerical scheme is first validated with two test cases including turbulent flow over a flat plat and a two-dimensional oblique shock wave, and then validated with engine test data.  \nThe analysis is first employed to a detailed investigation into the flow development and fuel-air mixing in the scramjet engine for non-reacting flow at Mach 5 flight condition.  As the air throttling is implemented to increase the combustor pressure, a series of subsequent oblique shock waves following the fuel injectors is generated to separate the wall boundary layer, and lead to a dramatic increase in the fuel/air mixing.  The detailed investigation reveals enhanced fuel-air mixing primarily results from elevated vorticity over combustor and cavity, as well as from increased residence time.  \nEffort is then expended to study the ignition and subsequent reacting flow in the modeled combustor.  The ignition transient and flame development are comprehensively studied to investigate the influence of air throttling implementation on ignition and flameholding.  The time history of combustion indicates that the engine model can hardly offer the ignition under the given flight condition in the absence of air throttling, as the ignition of ethylene fuel flow on the cowl surface fails to be initiated.  Calculation is then employed to demonstrate the significant flow accommodation induced by air throttling implementation, including subsequent decrease in flow velocity and increases in temperature and pressure in the combustor.  Autoignition occurs on the cowl surface due to extended residence time and higher initiate temperature, and results in an intense combustion zone with rapid flame spreading in combustor.  Results indicate that the pre-combustion shock train is generated as a result of the combustion-induced pressure rise begins just upstream of the combustor entrance.  The pre-combustion shock train at this condition forms a large region of low-momentum/separated flow near the combustor sidewalls.  This proved to be an additional source for flameholding with the recessed cavity as primary flameholding support.  The predicted combustor performance and flow distributions agree well with experimental measurements.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3183], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Jian ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Vigor Yang", "Vigor Yang", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "John Harlan Mahaffy", "Robert Francis Kunz", "Robert John Santoro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Vigor Yang, Dissertation Advisor", "Vigor Yang, Committee Chair", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "John Harlan Mahaffy, Committee Member", "Robert Francis Kunz, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["supersonic combustion", "Scramjet", "CFD", "air throttling"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Two Widespread DNA Binding Factors Mediate Differential Regulation of Promoter-proximal Pausing in Drosophila.

Since the DNA within paused Pol II is single-stranded and thus hyper-reactive to permanganate, we developed a permanganate ChIP-seq assay to map the Pol II transcription bubbles across the Drosophila genome. This method provides a near base-pair resolution and definitive assessment of transcriptionally engaged Pol II. With these powers, I have determined that the majority of promoter-associated Pol II on protein-coding genes is paused in a region from 20-60 bp downstream of the transcription start site. In contrast, Pol II associated with snRNA genes appears to be concentrated in an open complex at the transcription start. \nOur permanganate ChIP-seq data also suggest pausing is tightly linked to the occupancy of GAGA factor (GAF), a widespread DNA binding factor that has been previously implicated in chromatin remodeling and transcription initiation. I developed a biochemical system for promoter proximal pausing, and demonstrate that GAF exerts its control on pausing before transcription initiation, as well as afterward. I also collected genetic and biochemical evidence indicating that pausing is a kinetic consequence of competition between the rate of elongation and the rate at which NELF associates with the elongation complex.  Here, I show that GAF recruits the pausing factor NELF to the promoter and tips the kinetic competition in favor of pausing. \nA different mechanism is likely to contribute to the establishment of paused Pol II on GAF-less promoters. On these promoters, pausing relies on the coordinated actions of DNA binding factors that recruit Pol II and the first nucleosome (+1 nucleosome) downstream from the start site. An example of the factors that recruit Pol II on GAF-less promoters is a novel DNA binding protein I identified, which I call M1BP.  M1BP recognizes the previously identified core promoter element Motif 1, and associates with about 2000 promoters in Drosophila. Remarkably, M1BP is highly enriched at promoters that associate with Pol II but lack GAF. Transcriptome analyses and ChIP assays indicated M1BP functions in transcription activation and Pol II recruitment on its target genes. Evidence for the +1 nucleosome being involved in pausing on GAF-less genes comes from analyses of published nucleosome mapping data. I found distinct nucleosome distributions on GAF-associated and GAF-less promoters. Based on the location relationship of the +1 nucleosome and paused Pol II, I propose that pausing on GAF-less genes involves a collision between Pol II and the +1 nucleosome. \nAlthough both GAF and M1BP are highly enriched on promoters with paused Pol II, they regulate genes that are involved in distinct biological processes. M1BP-associated genes are involved in basic cellular processes and tend to be evenly expressed in various tissues and at different stages in development. GAF-associated genes are involved in developmental control, and exhibit considerable variation in expression in various tissues and at different developmental stages. Genomic analyses reveal that M1BP- and GAF-associated promoters are strikingly different in their Pol II distribution and their dependencies on gene-specific regulators.  In addition, M1BP associates with the insulator protein, CP190, which has been implicated in establishing the transcriptional independence of promoters. I conclude that M1BP and GAF orchestrate distinct mechanisms of transcriptional control and that M1BP functions as a master regulator of constitutively expressed genes while GAF potentiates dynamic patterns of expression.\nIn summary, my doctoral work provides a clear assessment of the status of Pol II at Drosophila promoters. It also indicates pausing is controlled by a kinetic competition between the elongation rate and the rate at which NELF associates with the elongation complex. This competition provides a mechanistic basis for how sequence specific transcription factors and chromatin structure affect the location and efficiency of promoter proximal pausing. This work also compares two widespread DNA binding factors GAF and M1BP that are highly enriched at paused promoters and demonstrates how these two factors differentially regulate transcription on their target genes. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7620], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Jian ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Gilmour", "David Scott Gilmour", "Joseph C.

However, this high-potential manufacturing technology hasn\u2019t been widely applied in industry due to several severe drawbacks, such as the poor accuracy of part geometry and inferior metallurgical properties, which can be addressed by utilizing feedback control system. This dissertation focuses on developing control-oriented model and model-based control system design for melt-pool height and temperature control.\n  In this dissertation, we first construct a reduced-order physics-based nonlinear model of the melt-pool height and temperature for 1-D case of directed energy deposition process, in which only single straight track is deposited on the substrate by LENS system. One main contribution of our proposed model compared with existing literature lies in a novel parameterization of the entire material transfer rate as a function of the major process parameter in manufacturing process. This novel parameterization is derived from the perspective of physics and can improve the accuracy of our model prediction of the steady-state melt-pool geometry. Then system identification are conducted to calibrate the unknown parameters in our 1-D model using experimental data and FEA prediction collected from deposition of Ti-6AL-4V and Inconel 718, followed by validation of 1-D model with calibrated parameters. A LQR controller and nonlinear MPC controller are designed based on this model to control the melt-pool height and temperature by regulating the laser power and scanning speed applied in the manufacturing process.\n  The dynamics of additive manufacturing process varies inter-bead or inter-layer, which motivates the modification of 1-D model to multi-dimensional one. The 1-D model can be extended to multi-dimensional case by incorporating the thermal history in the existing part, which can be characterized approximately by Rosenthal\u2019s solution. Our extended multi-dimensional model is then validated by experimental data obtained from three multi-dimensional examples: thin-wall structure, parallel patch build and L-shape structure. Next a feedback linearization controller is developed based on this multi-dimensional model to track the melt-pool height reference trajectory using laser power.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14942], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Jianyi ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "first_name_ssi": "Jianyi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qian Wang", "Qian Wang", "Panagiotis Michaleris", "Bo Cheng", "Ted Reutzel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qian Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qian Wang, Committee Chair", "Panagiotis Michaleris, Committee Member", "Bo Cheng, Committee Member", "Ted Reutzel, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Modeling", "Control", "Additive Manufacturing", "Directed Energy Deposition"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "MECHANISMS TO COORDINATE NEW AND USED\nPRODUCT SALES: AN EMPIRICAL AND ANALYTICAL\nINVESTIGATION", "id": "10681", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3277", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates the coordination between new and used product sales using both empirical and analytical approaches.\n\nThe first essay studies the potential for cannibalization of new product sales by remanufactured versions of the same product, which is a central issue in managing the secondary market. Practitioners have no fact-based information to guide practice at companies and academics have no studies available to use as the basis for assumptions in models. We address the cannibalization issue by using auctions to determine consumers' willingness-to-pay for both new and remanufactured products.  The auctions also allow us to determine the potential impact of offering new and remanufactured products at the same time, which provides us insights into the potential for new product cannibalization. Our results indicate that for the consumer and commercial products auctioned, there is a clear difference in willingness-to-pay for new and remanufactured goods.  For the consumer product, there is scant overlap in bidders of the new and the remanufactured product, leading us to conclude that the risk of cannibalization in this case is minimal. For the commercial product, however, there is evidence of overlap in bidding behavior, exposing the potential for cannibalization.\n\nTrade-in programs are designed to promote new product sales and give companies control over the secondary market. Motivated by a real problem facing a high-tech company, in the second essay, we develop methods to analyze data from Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) forms, which contain information such as product number, quantity, and date. To accurately forecast the returned quantity of a product in an RMA, we treat the booked quantity as a signal and adjust its noise by taking product characteristics and customer heterogeneity into account. For our data set, we find that the proposed forecasting strategy that captures both product and customer information outperforms the two benchmark strategies that represent the high-tech company's current practice and a widely-adopted method in the literature, respectively. In addition, our analysis can also serve as a tool for companies to uncover the root causes of RMA reporting errors, to provide valuable insights on effective design of trade-in policies, and to monitor and evaluate the performance of trade-in policies on a continuous basis. Our forecasting methods are currently under a trial implementation in the company and can potentially be applied to similar business settings to extract useful information from noisy, yet valuable signals.\n\nIn the third essay, we build an analytical model to study the trade-in strategy in the context of a monopolistic manufacturer offering a technology product to a heterogeneous consumer population. We consider an exogenous innovation process that governs the availability of new technology, and therefore a product is subject to two types of value decay: technological obsolescence (due to technology innovation) and functional depreciation (due to wear and tear). The manufacturer chooses the prices for the new products featuring a new and an existing technologies, respectively, and the trade-in credit for the used products featuring a previous-generation technology and an existing technology, respectively, to maximize her long-run average profit. Heterogeneous consumers make their consumption choice accordingly to maximize their utility.\n\nWe characterize the optimal stationary pricing strategy for the manufacturer and the corresponding optimal consumption strategies that consumers choose based on their willingness-to-pay. We find that manufacturers with different production cost and resell cost structures should leverage trade-in differently to take the full advantage of it. Low production cost and low resell cost manufacturers should offer trade-in programs regardless of innovation state in order to induce the highest-valuation consumers to purchase a new product in every period. However, when production cost and/or resell cost are higher, trade-in programs should be restrained accordingly. We also evaluate the impact of innovation frequency, technological obsolescence, functional depreciation, and production and resell costs on the manufacturer's maximum long-run average profit. Some of the findings are interesting and not so intuitive. In general, technological obsolescence and functional depreciation reduce consumer valuation of used products, which should in turn lower the manufacturer's profitability. However, we identify scenarios under which they can actually increase a manufacturer's expected profit. Moreover, we characterize situations under which higher innovation frequency helps or hurts the manufacturer's bottom line.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3264], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Jiayi ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jiayi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan H Xu", "Susan H Xu", "Duncan Fong", "Terry Paul Harrison", "James Samuel Shortle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan H Xu, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan H Xu, Committee Chair", "Duncan Fong, Committee Chair", "Terry Paul Harrison, Committee Member", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Empirical research", "pricing", "forecasting", "trade-in programs"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "STUDY OF ARTIFICIAL FRUSTRATED ARRAYS OF SINGLE-DOMAIN FERROMAGNETS\n", "id": "11804", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3196", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Geometrical frustration is an intriguing area where systems show exotic spin states that are not exhibited in any other systems, including spin fluctuation down to lowest temperature in spin liquid materials, finite entropy at absolute zero and magnetic monopoles as emergent particles in spin ice materials, as well as the connection to neuron networks (chapter 1).

Among the four protozoan species that cause malaria in humans, Plasmodium falciparum is the most fatal, accounting for 1.5-2.7 million deaths and 300-500 million clinical cases each year. Drug resistance in Plasmodium and insecticide resistance in vector mosquitoes are probably responsible for the resurgence of the disease in the world. Novel drugs and control measures are desperately needed to bring this disease under control. To this aim, we need to better understand the fundamental biology and the molecular mechanisms governing the complicated developmental cycle of the parasite. The recently completed genome sequence of the P. falciparum is a milestone in malaria research, which has contributed greatly to our understanding of the molecular biology of the parasite, and led to the discovery of parasite-specific metabolic pathways and identification of potential targets for the development of new drugs and vaccines.  Meanwhile, deciphering the functions of individual genes remains a formidable task of the post-genomic era.\nMalaria is caused by the bite of an infected mosquito, which injects Plasmodium sporozoites into the human circulatory system. These sporozoites invade liver cells and undergo multiple rounds of schizogony to produce thousands of merozoites, which are released into the blood to invade erythrocytes. While the majority of the parasites undergo cycles of asexual multiplication in the erythrocytes, which is responsible for the clinical symptoms of the disease, some merozoites initiate sexual development to produce gametocytes. Gametocytes are the only form that initiates further sporogonic development in the mosquitoes, an obligatory process for the transmission of the parasite. The complex life cycle of the malaria parasites is a challenge for vaccine designs, which preferentially target multiple developmental stages.  Among them, transmission-blocking vaccine that targets parasite antigens of sexual stages aims at interrupting the transmission cycle of malaria. Although morphological changes during sexual development of the malaria parasite were known almost a century ago and a number of sexual stage-specific genes have been identified and functionally characterized, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular biology of malaria sexual development is still lacking.\nDuring studies examing the sexual development of the malaria parasite, members of a family of RNA-binding proteins were identified in P. falciparum gametocytes by using RNA differential display. This family was named Puf after the two first-characterized proteins Pumilio in Drosophila melanogaster and fem-3 binding factor (FBF) in Caenorhabditis elegans.  Puf is an evolutionarily conserved RNA binding protein family in eukaryotes. The eight imperfect tandem repeats in Puf proteins constitute the essential RNA binding domain (RBD), which forms a rainbow structure with the concave surface interacting with the target mRNA. The target mRNAs characterized to date contain conserved elements in their 3\u00a1\u00af untranslated regions (UTRs), and binding of Puf to these elements imposes translational repression on the target mRNA.  The biological functions of Puf family proteins have been characterized in a few biological systems. Although varying from system to system, it has been postulated that the ancestral function of Puf is to promote proliferation and suppress differentiation.\nThe two Puf members in P. falciparum, PfPuf1 and PfPuf2, are preferentially expressed in gametocytes. The finding that Puf proteins in D. melanogaster and C. elegans have a conserved function in germline stem cell maintenance has prompted us to investigate the functions of PfPuf1 and PfPuf2 during P. falciparum gametocytogenesis. PfPuf1 and PfPuf2 mRNAs are spliced and located on chromosome 5 and 4, respectively. PfPuf1 encodes a much larger protein (1894 amino acids) than PfPuf2 (514 amino acids). Phylogenetic analysis of Pufs showed that the RBDs of PfPuf1 and PfPuf2 only share 27% amino acid identity, with PfPuf1 being more related to Pufs in plants and fungi and PfPuf2 more related to FBF in C. elegans.  Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), northern blots and western blots confirmed the preferential expression of both Puf genes in gametocytes. Using RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA end and primer extension, the transcription initiation site of PfPuf2 was mapped to 297 bp upstream of the translation start codon. Since the target genes for PfPuf proteins remain to be identified, the Drosophila nanos-responsive element (NRE) sequence in the hunchback 3\u00a1\u00af UTR was used as a conserved artificial target sequence to evaluate the RNA-binding activity of PfPufs by using gel mobility shift assays and the yeast three-hybrid system. The results showed that both PfPuf RBDs displayed specific RNA binding activity to the conserved NRE sequence. This result suggests that both Puf members in P. falciparum utilize a similar mechanism of translation control of their target genes. \nTo further explore the functions of PfPuf genes, the newly developed parasite transfection technology was applied to disrupt PfPuf2.  A plamid construct was designed to truncate PfPuf2 at the 8th Puf repeat. After electroporation of the ring- stage parasites, pyrimethamine was used to select resistant parasites. Parasites with the construct stably integrated into the PfPuf2 locus were obtained and cloned by limiting dilution. Disruption of PfPuf2 in these single parasite clones was confirmed by integration-specific PCR, genomic Southern blot, and RT-PCR. Phenotypic analysis showed that PfPuf2 disruptions did not affect asexual growth of the parasite, but gametocytes in the disruptants were formed at a much accelerated rate. The disruption of Puf genes provides us an opportunity to identify the Puf target genes through genome-wide microarray analysis.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2716], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Jinfang ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jinfang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Liwang Cui", "Gary Felton", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster", "Paul Lee Babitzke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Liwang Cui, Committee Chair", "Gary Felton, Committee Member", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster, Committee Member", "Paul Lee Babitzke, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["RNA-binding", "Puf", "PfPuf1", "PfPuf2", "sexual development"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Three Essays on the Health-Related Product Attributes and Consumer Purchasing Behavior: An Application to Ready-to-Eat Breakfast Cereal Market", "id": "k930bx00t", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12947", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation focuses on exploring the relationship between health-related product characteristics and consumers' purchase behaviors in the ready-to-eat breakfast cereal market. It consists of three related topics as follows:\n\nEssay One: Demand for Ready-to-Eat Cereals with Household-level Censored Purchase Data and Nutrition Label Information: A Distance Metric Approach\n\nIn this essay, we investigate the demand for ready-to-eat breakfast cereals in the U.S. using censored, household-level purchase data matched with product-level nutrition data.  Instead of using a multi-equation based approach, we propose an alternative approach that relies on Pinkse, Slade, and Brett\u2019s (2002) distance metric method, which is highly practical and less burdensome computationally than some multiple-equation methods. Among other results, we find that households with children are less price sensitive to cereals with whole grain as the first ingredient and to cereals that contain a higher number of fortified vitamins. Additionally, we find that households tend to switch between products with similar fiber content and whole grain content profiles.\n\nEssay Two: Quantifying the Welfare Effect of Changing Healthy Attributes in the Ready-to-Eat Cereal Market\n\nThis essay quantifies the welfare impact of changing healthy attributes of ready-to-eat cereal products. We develop a equilibrium model of production and demand, incorporating the optimal demand choice of consumers facing multiple products in the market and optimal pricing strategy for multi-product firms. We use this model to evaluate how changing healthy attributes in the ready-to-eat cereal market affects consumer welfare, producer surplus, and total welfare, taking into account that product prices and consumer demand are endogenous in the equilibrium. We find that improving healthy product attributes has a substantial impact on consumer welfare, producer surplus, and total welfare, but these changes may not necessarily be positive. The results reflect how consumer demand and production costs change when nutritional content changes.\n\nEssay Three: How Important is Preference for Variety in Consumer Demand: Evidence from Ready-to-Eat Cereal Market\n\nIn this essay, we investigate the role preference for variety in shaping consumer demand and how the preference for variety varies by household characteristics,  by estimating a model of heterogeneous consumers' demand. The model allows consumers to choose a subset of products to consume, and if any, by how much for each product, based on their interdependent direct preferences for product attributes and their preferences for variety. The purchasing record of ready-to-eat breakfast cereal at the household level from Nielsen Homescan data provides a natural field to quantify the effect of preference for variety. Estimation results show that preference for variety is important for understanding consumer demand. Removing consumer preference for variety would leads to a loss of market size by about 26%. The effect is heterogeneous on different products.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12256], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Jing ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C.

Its remarkably high carrier mobility in a wide range of temperature makes it sui generis, to date the mean free path in h-BN encapsulated graphene devices can be as large as 10 \u03bcm. In addition, Dirac fermions in graphene possess extra pseudospin and valley degree of freedom, this makes graphene unique compared with conventional semiconductor 2DEGs. Charge carriers in bilayer graphene are viewed as massive Dirac fermions, they inherit novel properties, e.g. high mobility, pseudospin and valley degree of freedom from graphene. Moreover, bilayer graphene supports an up to 250 meV band gap tunable by a perpendicular electric field. Besides, the electric field serves as an efficient knob to manipulate the valley degree of freedom, and this makes bilayer graphene an ideal platform to implement new types of valley-based electronics (valleytronics). This motivates the experimental studies done in this dissertation.\n      In this dissertation, six electrical transport studies in bilayer graphene are summarized in three chapter. (1) The electric field tunable band gap in bilayer graphene are obtained using thermal activation measurements with high precision and in a large field range. This provides precise energy scales in other bilayer graphene studies, e.g. calculating Landau level (LL) energies described in Chapter 5 (in Chapter 2). (2) We carefully measured the electrons and holes effective mass (m*) in bilayer graphene using temperature-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, and observed a strong suppression in holes m* at low carrier density. This study reveals a surprising and unusual effect of disorder on m* that is unique to gapless 2D materials (in Chapter 2). (3) We experimentally demonstrated the theory predicted valley-momentum locked conducting channels (kink states) in the line junction of two oppositely gated bilayer graphene using a dual-split-gated device structure (in Chapter 4). (4) We obtained ballistic kink states (4 e2/h conductance) with improved sample quality, and further demonstrated a few valleytronics operations, e.g. valley valve, waveguide and electron beam splitter, by constructing multiple kink states with controllable helicity in a dual-quad-split-gated bilayer graphene device. This is the first experimental realization of a valleytronic device with valley based operational capabilities (in Chapter 4). (5) We built an empirical LL diagram for the E = 0 octet in bilayer graphene in the presence of both perpendicular electric field and magnetic field, using measured band gap values and coincident-points D field for the \u03bd = 0 state up to 31 T. This study provides a unified and intuitive framework which can interpret many experimental observations in literature and offers a good base for future experimental and calculation studies (in Chapter 5). (6) We demonstrated gate-controlled transmission of quantum Hall edge states in bilayer graphene, where perfect transmission and sequential pinch-off of edge states were observed by controlling the tunnel junction potential with a gate. This study is the first demonstration of controllable transmission of quantum Hall edge states in graphene systems, and is a starting point for designing more sophisticated structures, e.g.  interferometers, to study exotic quasiparticle statistics in the novel even denominator fractional quantum Hall states in bilayer graphene (in Chapter 5).\n      This dissertation also present device fabrication details, e.g. efforts on making clean h-BN encapsulated graphene stacks, fabricating sub-100 nm nanostructures on h-BN substrate and precise alignment of top and bottom gates. We also discuss how COMSOL simulations can guide the designing of gates in nanostructures (in Chapter 3).\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15268], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Jing ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "first_name_ssi": "Jing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Zhu", "Jun Zhu", "Chaoxing Liu", "Nitin Samarth", "Saptarshi Das"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Zhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Jun Zhu, Committee Chair", "Chaoxing Liu, Committee Member", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Saptarshi Das, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bilayer graphene", "valleytronics", "quantum Hall effect", "quantum valley Hall", "kink state", "effective mass", "quantum Hall edge tunneling"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "NANOCOMPOSITES BASED ON FERROELECTRIC POLYMERS FOR ELECTRICAL ENERGY STORAGE", "id": "10019", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3185", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based ferroelectric polymers exhibit much higher electrical energy storage capability than other linear dielectric polymers. These ferroelectric polymers, therefore, find the most promise in manufacturing advanced electronic devices and electric power systems with reduced weight, size, and cost. Polymer-based capacitor technology has the advantages of high energy density, low dielectric loss, easy processing, and good flexibility. In order to further improve and tailor the energy storage capability, carefully selected inorganic nanoparticles are incorporated into polymer matrices. Structural and dielectric properties of the resulting nanocomposites have been examined.\nFirstly, high dielectric constant BaTiO3 nanoparticles, whose surface were functionalized by ethylene diamine, were used as dopant to prepare nanocomposite with poly (vinylidene fluoride-chlorotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-CTFE)] and poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE)]. The morphology, crystalline structure, and dielectric responses were revealed in dependence on the loading of BaTiO3 and selection of polymer matrices. It was concluded that the polymer matrices play a decisive role in determining the energy density of nanocomposites.\nTo obviate the negative influence of dielectric contrast, polymer nanocomposites were then fabricated based on surface-functionalized TiO2 nanoparticles dispersed in a ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE). TiO2 nanoparticles with barium hydroxide (Ba-OH) as surface modifier possess dielectric permittivity of 47, comparable to that of P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) around 42, were uniformly dispersed in polymer matrix with limited aggregation. The resultant nanocomposites revealed a large enhancement in polarization response at high electric fields and hence the energy density, which might be attributed to the change in polymer microstructure induced by the nano-fillers as well as the interfacial effect.\nTo eliminate the adverse influence of surfactant on the overall dielectric properties, \u201cGraft to\u201d method was also utilized to fabricate polymer nanocomposites. Phosphonic acid group, which is proven to attach to metal oxide surface firmly, was introduced as end functional group of P(VDF-CTFE) by free radical polymerization initiated by a functional benzoyl peroxide (BPO) with phosphonate group followed by transformation of phosphonate to phosphonic acid. The phosphonic acid end-groups were grafted onto the surface of ZrO2 nanoparticles.

Geography, in terms of location and destination, plays a key role in firm activity. The thesis is composed of two chapters that are relevant to geography and firms' decisions on exporting and investment.\n\nPrevious research on export dynamics addresses a firm's tradeoff between generating a profit now or in the future, but it overlooks the importance of a firm's export decisions across markets. In the first chapter paper, I study a firm's dynamic export destination choice over two markets (the North and South) using a structural model in which I take into account of both the selection effect and the learning-by-exporting effect. Using data from the Chinese plastic industry, I distinguish and model two determinants that impact a firm's sales: a general component productivity that affects the firm's (entry) sales in all markets, and a market-specific component demand that influences sales only in that market to which the firm is exporting. I find that a firm's decision to export to the North promotes entry (sales) in other markets through productivity improvement. In contrast, a firm's decision to export to the South merely increases the sales in the South through a market-specific demand impact. Counterfactual analysis shows that omitting the benefits of exporting to the South deters 7% of all exporting firms that may have exported to the North; yet eliminating the benefits of exporting to the North deters 34% of all exporting firms that may have exported to the South.\n\nIn addition to research on export destinations, the location of the firm also determines the way they make decisions. In the second chapter, I study a panel dataset for firms in the equipment-making industry in China and observe that the investment rates in urban areas are consistently lower than in suburban areas by 6-7 percentage points. Three factors could explain this - the production technology, profit shocks and capital adjustment costs. I build a structural model and quantify the relative importance of three factors in determining the firms' investment rate. The results indicate that while the production technology is similar in urban and suburban areas, profit shocks tend to be more volatile and with higher means among firms in suburban areas. Moreover, urban firms face higher (even if more easily reversible) adjustment costs for capital. The counterfactual analysis reveals that profit shocks are responsible for 70-80% of the differential in investment rates whereas difference in adjustment costs explains only about 20-30%.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12026], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Kai ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts", "Mark John Roberts", "James R.

Density is a predominant factor in the performance of materials. The effect of density on a wide variety of properties of powder metallurgy has been thoroughly documented. Generally, as density is increased almost all properties, including strength and magnetic performance, are improved. 440C stainless steel is a martensitic stainless steel with high corrosion resistance, good resistance to the atmosphere and mild acids. It is used in high quality knife blades and rolling element bearings. 440C stainless steel was densified to 98-99% density by sintering in 4-10 Torr dynamic partial pressure conditions while the same alloy stops to densify at 92-95% density at 760 Torr due to the mechanisms that occur during the final stage of sintering. Case studies were carried out to determine how vacuum affects final stage sintering. This was done by comparing the samples sintered in 4-10 Torr dynamic partial pressure and 760 Torr.  The density, hardness and carbon level of samples were also examined. The microstructure was then observed after grinding and polishing. Density increased when partial vacuum of 4 Torr was applied. Hardness also increased as density increased. In addition, the pores are more likely to be on the grain boundaries in partial vacuum than in typical atmosphere. The dominate mechanism for this behavior is believed to be evaporation/condensation which is promoted by partial vacuum and resulted in keeping the pores on the grain boundaries, which was verified by microstructural examinations. Final-stage densification is critically dependent on minimized grain growth and attachment of the pores to the grain boundaries. When a vacuum is applied, the ability for metals to evaporate and transport across the pore is greater, thus the higher sintered density can be achieved. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3903], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Li ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Li", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Francis Heaney Jr.", "Donald Francis Heaney Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Francis Heaney Jr., Thesis Advisor", "Donald Francis Heaney Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Evaporation/Condensation", "Pore Mobility", "Density", "Vacuum", "Final Stage Sintering"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "DESIGNING ENERGY-EFFICIENT AND RELIABLE CACHES AND INTERCONNECTS", "id": "6754", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3763", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The minimum feature size of VLSI technology has shrunk exponentially in the past three decades and this trend is expected to continue in the near future. This phenomenon has resulted in an increase in the number of transistors integrated onto a single chip, a decrease in supply voltages and threshold voltages, and an increase in clock frequencies for each generation. The scaling of these design parameters impacts digital circuits and systems design in two important ways: a dramatic increase in energy consumption and a deterioration of reliability.\n\nThis thesis proposes design methodologies and techniques at the micro-architecture level for improving energy-efficiency and reliability in cache memories and on-chip interconnects.\n\nFirst, architectural techniques are proposed to reduce both leakage and dynamic energy consumption in cache memories. State-preserving and state-destroying leakage control mechanisms are integrated into L2 cache to reduce leakage energy consumption due to the data duplication across different levels of cache hierarchy. A crossbar-connected cache configuration is proposed for on-chip multiprocessor systems. The dynamic energy consumption in L1 cache is reduced due to sharing a single, banked cache among processors.\n\nNext, the impact of crosstalk noise on the reliability of on-chip interconnects is investigated, and a crosstalk-aware interconnect is proposed. A crosstalk analyzer circuit is designed to be incorporated into the sender side of the bus to estimate the delay based on the data pattern to be transmitted. Then, a variable cycle transmission mechanism is implemented to use a faster clock and dynamically control the number of cycles required for transmission.\n\nFinally, the interaction between energy consumption and reliability is studied. Based on the soft error injection implemented in the cache system of SimpleScalar simulator, the impact of two architectural-level leakage reduction approaches, drowsy cache and cache decay, on the data reliability are evaluated. Then, providing data reliability in an energy-efficient fashion is investigated. An adaptive error coding scheme is proposed that treats dirty and clean data cache blocks differently. Furthermore, an early-write-back scheme is introduced to enhance the ability to use a less powerful error protection scheme for a longer time without sacrificing reliability. Adaptive error protection scheme is also applied to on-chip interconnects for energy efficiency, where the type of error detection coding scheme is modulated dynamically based on the dynamic variations observed in noise behavior.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3742], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Lin ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Jane Irwin", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Yuan Xie", "Kenan Unlu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Chair", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Member", "Yuan Xie, Committee Member", "Kenan Unlu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Energy-Efficiency", "Reliability", "Cache", "Interconnect"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Three-phase Mixing Cell Method for Gas Flooding ", "id": "18134", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8185", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "CO2 miscible gas flooding is a major source of oil production in the U.S., particularly in West Texas where natural sources of CO2 can be obtained at reasonable cost. Low-temperature oil displacements by CO2 involve complex phase behavior, where three hydrocarbon-phases can coexist. \nReliable design of miscible gas flooding requires knowledge of the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), which is the required pressure for high displacement efficiency. A recent published study on MMP calculation by a new mixing cell method proved to be robust and reliable for two-phase flash calculations. Unlike previous two-phase \u201cmixing cell\u201d methods, this new method relies entirely on robust P-T EOS flash calculation.\n  Previous computational aspects of MMP estimation do not attempt to estimate the MMP for mixtures exhibiting three hydrocarbon-phases due to lack of robust algorithms for three-phase equilibrium.  Further, computation of multicontact miscible gas flooding involves a large number of phase equilibrium calculations in a near-critical region, where the calculations are time-consuming and difficult. \nResults from experiments and simulation show that more than 95% displacement efficiency can be achieved without the development of complete miscibility for three-phase flow for low-temperature oil displacements by CO2. Recent investigation on the mechanism for high displacement efficiency improved our understanding of the effect of a third hydrocarbon-phase using the robust three-phase equilibrium algorithms developed. The mechanism for high displacement efficiency occurs when critical endpoints (CEP) are encountered at the leading and trailing edges of the three-phase region. \nHow miscibility is developed for three-phase displacements is not well known. A potential solution could be achieved by developing a new mixing cell model by using a similar methodology as the recently published two-phase mixing cell method.\nWe develop a three-phase mixing cell method involving two- and three-phase behavior, which is based on robust phase equilibrium calculation algorithm. By performing cell-to-cell contacts, the mixing-cell model determines the minimum tie-line lengths and minimum tie-triangle lengths developed at a certain pressure. These tie-line lengths are used to determine the MMP by extrapolation to an infinite number of contacts.\nFor three-hydrocarbon-phase displacement, an inaccurate prediction of injection pressure may have significant consequences. For example, if the injection pressure is relatively high, although the displacement efficiency may be satisfactory, leads to an unnecessarily large cost of pressurizing the injected gas. If the injection pressure is low, however, the miscible displacement process may become ineffective and less oil recovery would be achieved. \nWe demonstrate the importance of considering three-hydrocarbon phases, where the MMP assuming a two-phase approximation can result in unnecessary increase of injection pressure without a corresponding increment on oil recovery. The novel three-phase mixing cell method can be used to predict the pressure for an efficient displacement. We further show that there may be no MMP in some displacements where three hydrocarbon-phases exist.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8118], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Liwei ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "first_name_ssi": "Liwei", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns", "Li Li", "Luis F Ayala H"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns, Thesis Advisor", "Li Li, Thesis Advisor", "Luis F Ayala H, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Three-hydrocarbon-Phase equilibrium", "Pressure of an efficient displacement", "mixing cell method"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Self-healing Wireless Networks under Insider Jamming Attacks", "id": "19715", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9385", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As jamming is a very serious threat to the normal operation of wireless networks, recently much research work has been done to deal with it.

Still, there are some challenges in understanding the nature of worm propagation because of the complex\nstructure and dynamics of networks, in conducting detailed network worm emulation experiments, and in devising and evaluating new worm defense or containment strategies. In this report, we propose a new virtualization method for running high-fidelity network emulation experiments on a network testbed and present an integrated toolkit\nwe developed for the benefit of experiment specification and data visualization. On the analytical model and computer simulation front, we extend the KMSim worm model, a variation of\nKermack-McKendrick epidemic model that takes enterprise networks as the unit of analysis so that various distributions of worm susceptible and network topology characteristics can be accounted for. Extension of KMSim worm model is used to study the self-destructing and removal/death behavior of worms and for the\nsimulation of worm propagation in enterprise networks.\n\nOn the defense side, we call attention on the danger of a class of worms which target specific enterprise networks. The efficiency and\nstealthiness of such local scanning worms with advanced scan strategies would render most existing worm defense schemes ineffective. For this reason, we propose a new dark port detection\nscheme to actively monitor all intra-enterprise network connections and raise security alerts when a new connection attempt targeting a\nnon-servicing host/port tuple is detected. To compensate possible false positives and balance between worm defense and maintaining normal service, we further explore using a Markov decision process model to quantitatively evaluate various defense strategies and make best defense decisions based on this cost-benefit analysis.\n\nCost-effective containment requires accurate estimation of worm virulence and extent of network damages under various game scenarios. In this regard, we develop a maximum likelihood\nestimation algorithm to estimate the size of susceptible population using inter-arrival timing information collected by the dark port detectors. Based on the idea of worm propagation detection and worm virulence estimation algorithm, we propose two collaborative containment strategies which can effectively containment a local scanning worm and cause minimum service disruption to the network.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3834], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Lunquan ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lunquan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu", "Chao Hsien Chu", "Prasenjit Mitra", "George Kesidis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Committee Chair", "Chao Hsien Chu, Committee Member", "Prasenjit Mitra, Committee Member", "George Kesidis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["computer worm", "testbed", "simulation", "optimal containment", "dark port"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF DETERMINISTIC AND STOCHASTIC\nIMPLICIT INTERFACE MODELS OF FLUID-INTERFACE INTERACTIONS", "id": "10480", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4423", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-02-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The work presented in this thesis focuses on the analysis of fluid implicit interface interaction models.\n\nSome rigorous theory is presented for a phase \ffield Navier-Stokes vesicle-fluid interaction model in Chapter 2.

With the rapid growth in the volume of data and the scale of networks, simply transferring the data generated at different host nodes to a single site for storing and processing becomes impractical, incurring excessive communication overhead while raising privacy concerns.

However, students often struggle when conducting essential tasks, such as making complex inferences, examining arguments, or vetting sources, during the process of comprehending complex, content-rich texts (e.g., expository texts).  Text-based discussions have been shown by prior research to effectively promote students\u2019 basic and high-level comprehension as well as critical-analytic thinking about and around text.  However, very few studies have been conducted to examine the effects of text genre, knowledge, and interest on students\u2019 high-level comprehension as mediated by text-based discussions.  Therefore, the goal of this dissertation study was to investigate the effects of text and learner characteristics on students\u2019 acquisition of high-level comprehension.  Specifically, the present study controlled for text topic and examined the degree to which text genre, topic knowledge, and perceived interestingness influenced students\u2019 achievement in reading comprehension as evidenced by discourse elements during small-group text-based discussions as well as post-discussion comprehension measures.  Two fourth-grade teachers and their 28 students from a private elementary school in the northeastern United Stated consented to participate in the study.  The current study employed a single group, repeated measures design in which students read three texts and conducted QT discussions on the text every other week for six weeks in total.  The three texts were written in different genres (i.e., expository, narrative, and mixed) on the same topic.  Data concerning student discourse, post-discussion reading assessments, as well as measures of topic knowledge and perceived interestingness were collected at three time points.  Piecewise multilevel modeling was employed to analyze changes in students\u2019 discourse and reading performance due to text genre by incorporating variables at different levels.  Regarding the effect of text genre on students\u2019 acquisition of high-level comprehension, the results suggested that a) students performed best with narrative text regarding high-level comprehension, especially the co-construction of exploratory talk; b) students performed better with mixed genre text than with expository text regarding high-level comprehension, especially the generation of elaborated explanations; c) the number of authentic questions raised by students during discussions did not differ statistically significantly by text genre; d) students scored statistically significantly higher on the post-discussion reading comprehension measures with narrative and mixed texts, compared to the expository text.  Moreover, pertaining to the effects of prior knowledge and perceived interestingness of students\u2019 acquisition of high-level comprehension, the results indicated that a) students\u2019 personal connection to the text was a positive predictor of their production of elaborated explanations during discussions; b) students\u2019 personal connection to the text was a negative predictor of their participation in exploratory talk; and c) topic knowledge scores positively predicted students\u2019 post-discussion comprehension scores.

In many scenarios, nodes for communication, either transmitters or\nreceivers, are informed of knowledge about the state or are capable of measuring the state. Hence, a fundamental problem is to understand methods of leveraging state information available at nodes to enhance communication reliability over channels. This dissertation makes progress along this line of study and\nconcentrates on exploring new problems in multi-user communication setups, in order to provide fresh insights on different channel\nmodels with state from an information theoretic point of view.\n\nTwo themes are of particular interest in the dissertation. The first theme focuses on the merits of strictly causal state information at encoders. Within this theme, two models have been considered. First, multiple access channels (MACs) with independent states, each known strictly causally to one encoder, are studied. An achievable strategy that generalizes and improves upon previous studies is identified. Capacity results are found for a class of channels. Moreover, the proposed scheme is extended to state-dependent MACs with an arbitrary number of users.\n\nSecondly, a state-dependent relay channel is studied in which strictly causal channel state information is available at the relay and no state information is available at the source and\ndestination. The source and the relay are connected via two unidirectional out-of-band orthogonal links of finite capacity, and a state-dependent memoryless channel connects the source and the relay, on one side, and the destination, on the other. Two achievable schemes are proposed that exploit both message and state cooperation, possible due to the orthogonal links and the availability of state information at the relay. Capacity results are identified for some special cases.\n\nThe second theme involves hop-by-hop communication channels with state. In particular, a state-dependent parallel-relay diamond channel is studied, where the source-to-relays cut is modeled with two noiseless, finite-capacity digital links with a degraded broadcasting structure, while the relays-to-destination cut is a general multiple access channel controlled by a random state. It is assumed that the source has non-causal channel state information and the relays have no state\ninformation. In this model, first, the capacity is characterized for the case where the destination has access to the state sequence. It\nis demonstrated that in this case, a joint message and state transmission scheme via binning is optimal. Next, the case with\nstate information at the source only is considered. For this scenario, lower and upper bounds on the capacity are derived for the\ngeneral discrete memoryless model.\n\nIn general, this dissertation points to the advantages of strictly causal state information in multi-user communication channels. The results are in contrast to the single-user channel, in which strictly causal state information is not beneficial. Moreover, this dissertation provides methods of leveraging state information available at the source node in hop-by-hop communication channels.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7521], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Min ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aylin Yener", "Aylin Yener", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "David Jonathan Miller", "Guohong Cao", "Osvaldo Simeone"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aylin Yener, Dissertation Advisor", "Aylin Yener, Committee Chair", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member", "Osvaldo Simeone, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["state-dependent channels", "strictly causal state", "non-causal state", "multiple-access channels", "relay channels", "GP binning", "feedback"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS TO LANGUAGE LEARNING AS PERCEIVED BY UNIVERSITY-LEVEL CHINESE HERITAGE LANGUAGE LEARNERS", "id": "1544bp08d", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12764", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Research has shown that heritage language learners (HLLs) have different characteristics and needs than foreign language learners (FLLs).

Previous studies have proposed various mobility concepts, striven to overcome empirical barriers to achieve accurate national measures, and mapped out cross-country patterns and time trends of mobility. The three essays in dissertation contribute to a recent strand of this literature which seeks to understand the mechanisms through which social status is transmitted across generations. \n\nAfter an overall introduction in chapter one, chapter two uses recently published county-level data to study the determinants of intergenerational mobility, measured by income levels and teen birth rates. Following Solon\u2019s mobility model, we study the impacts of public investment in human capital, returns to human capital, and taxation. The results show that better school quality and higher returns to education increase adult incomes and reduce teen birth rates for children from low income families. By comparing counties within or adjacent to metropolitan areas to other counties, this study finds that urban upward mobility is sensitive to parents' education while non-urban upward mobility is sensitive to migration opportunities.\n\nChapter three employs court-ordered School Finance Reforms (SFRs) as quasi-experiments to quantify the effects of education equity on intergenerational mobility within commuting zones. First, I use reduced form difference-in-difference analysis to show that 10 years of exposure to SFRs increases the average college attendance rate by about 5.2% for children with the lowest parent income. The effect of exposure to SFRs decreases with parent income and increases with the duration of exposure. Second, to directly model the causal pathways, I construct a measure for education inequity based on the association between school district education expenditure and median family income. Using exposure to SFRs as the instrumental variable, 2SLS analysis suggests that one standard deviation reduction in education inequality will cause the average college attendance rate to increase by 2.2% for children at the lower end of the parent income spectrum. Placing the magnitudes of these effects in context, I conclude that policies aimed at increasing education equity, such as SFRs, can substantially benefit poor children but they alone are not enough to overcome the high degree of existing inequalities.\n\nChapter four studies the Intergenerational Persistence of Self-employment in China across the Planned Economy Era. It finds that children whose parents were self-employed before China\u2019s socialist transformation were more likely to become self-employed themselves after the economic reform even though they had no direct exposure to their parents\u2019 businesses. The effect is found in both urban and rural areas, but only for sons. Furthermore, asset holding data indicate that households with self-employed parents before the socialist transformation were more risk tolerant. These findings suggest that the taste for self-employment is an important conduit of parents\u2019 effects on self-employment, and that the taste being transferred can be mapped to known entrepreneurial attitudes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14852], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Minghao ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "first_name_ssi": "Minghao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephan J Goetz", "Stephan J Goetz", "David Gerard Abler", "Scott J Colby", "Stephen Augustus Matthews"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephan J Goetz, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephan J Goetz, Committee Chair", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Scott J Colby, Committee Member", "Stephen Augustus Matthews, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Intergenerational mobility", "human capital", "self-employment"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Hybrid Integration of Nanowire Resonator Arrays", "id": "7898", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4590", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the development and demonstration of a hybrid integration method in an approach to nanofabrication that enables fabrication of nanomechanical resonator arrays using nanowires.

After having acceptable detection performance, how to make the hashes as compact as possible to enable scalable applications? How to efficiently and accurately detect the positions of missing / inserted frames so that temporal synchronization and hash extraction can form a single automatic process? This thesis makes some effort to solve these open problems. Specifically, contributions of this thesis consist of three aspects:\n1)Robustness: We apply tensor factorization to extract video hashes which are robust to most distortions due to a spatio-temporal separation property: When the attack is spatial, the temporal components of hash vectors stay approximately invariant; likewise spatial components stay unperturbed if the attack is purely temporal. 2)Compactness: We model the input video to be a structural graphical model and partition the graph into several subgraphs. The number of subgraphs enables an explicitly controllable and very nice tradeoff between detection performance and hash length. 3) Automatic synchronization and hash fusion: We try to incorporate the automatic temporal synchronization, which is based on dynamic time warping, into the video hashing system. We also proposed a hash fusion method called distance boosting which can fuse different types of hashes in a future-proof manner to further improve detection performance.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9888], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Mu ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vishal Monga", "William Evan Higgins", "David Miller", "Yanxi Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vishal Monga, Dissertation Advisor", "William Evan Higgins, Committee Member", "David Miller, Committee Member", "Yanxi Liu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["video hashing", "video fingerprinting", "near-duplicate detection", "anti-piracy search"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Designing for cross-cultural group chat", "id": "22957", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10552", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cross-cultural communication is taking place everywhere as the world is getting flat.

How these escape genes are transcribed from a largely inactivated chromosome is not fully understood, but underlying genomic sequences are thought to be involved. We developed a transgene approach to ask whether an escape locus, that includes the mouse Jarid1c gene, is autonomous or is instead influenced by X chromosome location. Two BAC clones carrying Jarid1c and adjacent X-inactivated transcripts were randomly integrated into mouse XX embryonic stem cells. Four lines with single copy, X-linked transgenes were identified and we established that each integrated into regions that are normally X inactivated. As expected for genes that are normally subject to X inactivation, BAC transgene transcripts Tspyl2 and Iqsec2 were X inactivated. However, allelic expression and RNA/DNA FISH indicate that transgenic Jarid1c escapes X inactivation. Therefore, transgenes at four different locations on the X recapitulate endogenous inactive X expression patterns. We conclude that escape from X inactivation is an intrinsic feature of the Jarid1c locus and functionally delimit the Jarid1c escape domain as the 112 kb representing the maximum overlap of the BACs tested. Additionally, although extensive chromatin differences normally distinguish active and inactive loci, unmodified BACs are capable of directing proper inactive X expression patterns. Therefore, these studies establish that primary DNA sequence alone, in a chromosome position-independent manner, is sufficient to determine X chromosome inactivation status.

Various enzymes employ transition metals to facilitate this chemical process. The ferritin-like dimetal-carboxylate oxidases or oxygenases, which include soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO), toluene/o-xylene monooxygenase, phenol hydroxylase (PhOH), alkene monooxygenase (AMO), plant soluble fatty acyl\u2013acyl carrier protein desaturase, and the \u03b22 (R2) subunit of class Ia ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), as well as N-oxygenase AurF and cyanobacterial aldehyde decarbonylase (cAD), activate O2 at a carboxylate-bridged non-heme dimetal center. Such enzymes have been extensively investigated due to their extremely interesting and complicated chemistry, as well as their potential commercial usage. These enzymes usually function in multicomponent complexes including a reductase, a scaffold subunit, and a ferritin-like oxygenase/oxidase. Diiron is most commonly employed by these oxygenases/oxidases as the metal cofactor. A general reaction cycle of the diiron cofactor involves: 1) the reduction of the diferric form to diferrous by the reductase component, in which electrons are transferred from NADH or NADPH; 2) activation of molecular oxygen by the diferrous cofactor, forming some type of peroxo-diferric intermediate; 3) oxidation of the substrate as the peroxo species is converted to diferric form, ready to be reduced to start another catalytic cycle. Manganese has also been reported to replace one or both of the iron atoms of the metal cofactors, most notably in the \u03b22 subunits of class Ib and Ic ribonucleotide reductases. The class Ic \u03b22 subunit utilizes a heterodinuclear Mn/Fe cofactor while the \u03b22 subunit of class 1b ribonucleotide reductase employs a dimanganese cofactor. Due to the presence of the transition metals, these enzymes usually possess rich spectroscopic features, allowing multiple spectroscopic methods such as M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, UV/visible absorption spectrophotometry, electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, etc. to be used to study the reactions. Due to the speed at which most of the reactions catalyzed by these dimetal enzymes occur, the millisecond to second time scale is required, thereby necessitating fast quench or real time measurement; therefore, rapid-mix techniques are usually adjoined to spectroscopic methods to meet this requirement.\nIn this thesis, the reaction mechanism and intermediates of dinuclear ferritin-like oxygenase/oxidase are summarized and the progress I have made during my Ph.D. study on AurF and cADs is narrated in detail.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7686], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Ning ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ning", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carsten Krebs", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Squire J Booker", "Ming Tien", "Wayne Roger Curtis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carsten Krebs, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Chair", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member", "Wayne Roger Curtis, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["diiron", "kinetics", "mechanism", "oxidation", "intermediate", "ferritin-like"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Exploring the Use of Unsolicited Email in EFL Education in Taiwan: Authentic and Critical Literacy in Context\n\n", "id": "8020", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5008", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using authentic materials has been regarded as a source of learning language and culture among foreign language teachers. In recent years, a large body of studies has suggested that the Internet offer EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners authentic materials and the use of e-mail, particularly, provide a teaching mode that affects student\u00a1\u00a6 learning. However, as time goes on and more people surf the Internet, the amount of unsolicited advertising e-mail grows. Since authentic literacy has become remarkably important in language learning, advertising e-mail naturally should become one of the potential materials in EFL teaching and learning.

For instance, several recent Nobel Prize winners have made their discoveries using femtosecond optics applications in physics, chemistry and biomedicine. \nThis dissertation covers three important applications of ultrafast femtosecond lasers. \nFirst, we study the single particle scattering spectroscopy using supercontinuum white light tweezers.  We have developed supercontinuum white light optical tweezers by using the ultrabroad band supercontinuum (SC) generated in highly nonlinear photonic crystal fibers pumped by ultrafast laser pulses and for the first time studied the scattering spectra in tightly focused supercontinuum. When the scatterer is of spherical shape, we describe modeling based on Mie\u00a1\u00afs scattering theory and angular spectrum decomposition. For the non-spherical-shaped scatterers, when the size of the scatterer is small or the refractive index of the scatterer is close to the surrounding medium, another modeling based on Born approximation and Green\u00a1\u00afs function is derived. The calculation results are provided as well. This work has built the foundation to understand optical scattering spectroscopy of single particles in the supercontinuum white light optical tweezers and further application to probe the single particle\u00a1\u00afs physical and chemical properties via the linear and nonlinear optical scattering spectra, which can lead to many important applications particularly in nanoparticle characterization and sensing. \nThe second part of this dissertation is dedicated to the study of the femtosecond pulse beam shaping. For femtosecond laser pulses, which cover bandwidths of tens of nanometers, the performance of beam-shaping a Gaussian beam into a flat-toped rectangular intensity profile is discussed for a practical realization. In the meantime, the convergence of the improved Gerchberg\u00a8CSaxton algorithm has been studied and the number of iterations for phase element design is optimized. The temporal and spatial properties of femtosecond laser pulses during beam shaping are studied. This study is expected to benefit many industrial, medical and military applications where specified beam shaping profiles are desirable. \nThe last part of this dissertation is terahertz (THz) generation by optical rectification of femtosecond laser pulses.  A method using optical rectification of supercontinuum is proposed to improve the conversion efficiency over a broadband range. Highly efficient broadband terahertz will accelerate the development of terahertz technologies and their applications to areas such as biomedical imaging and remote security screening.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4987], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Peng ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Peng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhiwen Liu", "Shizhuo Yin", "C Russell Philbrick", "William O Hancock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhiwen Liu, Committee Chair", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "C Russell Philbrick, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ultrafast optics", "supercontinuum", "optical tweezers", "scattering", "beam shaping", "terahertz"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "ANALYSIS OF PEPTIDYLARGININE DEIMINASE 4 AND HISTONE CITRULLINATION IN TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION AND INNATE IMMUNITY", "id": "11096", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5041", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 is an enzyme capable of converting both histone arginine and monomethyl-arginine residues into citrulline through reactions termed deimination/citrullination or demethylimination to regulate histone arginine methylation.

This dissertation first investigated the role of PAD4 and PAD4 catalyzed histone citrullination in the transcriptional repression of p53-target genes, such as p21/CIP1/WAF1. PAD4 is recruited to the p53-target gene promoter in a p53-dependent manner. Paused RNA Pol II and PAD4 are detected at the p21 promoter before UV irradiation, while RNA Pol II activity and PAD4 association at the p21 promoter are dynamically regulated after UV irradiation. We also detected that PAD4 and histone citrullination coordinate with HDAC2 that mediates histone lysine deacetylation in repressing tumor suppressor gene expression. PAD4 and HDAC2 associated with p21 promoter simultaneously, and both dissociated from several p53-target gene promoters after DNA damage. Our data further revealed that PAD4 promoter association and histone citrullination level are dependent on both p53 and HDAC activity, but HDAC2 promoter association and histone Lys acetylation level are only slightly affected by p53 and PAD4 activity. PAD4 inhibitor Cl-amidine and HDAC inhibitor SAHA induced p53-target gene expression and inhibited cancer cell growth additively in a p53-dependent manner. Using knockout PAD4 mice as a genetic model, we found that PAD4 knockout mice cannot form neutrophil extracellular traps, which are highly decondensed chromatin structures that are important in fighting against invading pathogens after stimulated with chemokines and bacteria. These PAD4 knockout mice are more susceptible to bacterial infection due to the lack of NET-mediated anti-bacterial ability, suggesting an essential role of PAD4 and histone citrullination in innate immunity.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5017], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Pingxin ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pingxin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yanming Wang", "Yanming Wang", "David Scott Gilmour", "Zhi Chun Lai", "Joseph C.

Mobile sensing can be applied to environmental monitoring, traffic monitoring, healthcare, etc. However, the large-scale deployment of mobile sensing applications is hindered by several challenges, including privacy leakage from sensing data, the lack of incentives for mobile device users to participate, and the lack of security mechanisms for data collection when communication infrastructure is unavailable.\n\nThe specific goal of this dissertation is to provide security and privacy support for mobile sensing. We achieve this goal by devising techniques to address the aforementioned challenges. First, to provide incentives for users to participate and at the same time preserve privacy, we propose two credit-based privacy-aware incentive schemes for mobile sensing. These schemes reward users with credits for their contributed data without exposing who contributes the data. They also ensure that dishonest users cannot abuse the system to earn unlimited credits. One scheme relies on a trusted third party to protect privacy. The other scheme removes the assumption of trusted third party, and provides unconditional privacy by combining blind signature, partially blind signature, and commitment techniques. Second, for a broad class of applications that need to periodically collect useful aggregate statistics of sensing data, we propose a privacy-preserving aggregation protocol for the Sum aggregate, which can provide differential privacy--a strong and provable privacy guarantee. To perform private and efficient aggregation, we design a novel HMAC-based encryption scheme which allows the aggregator to get the sum of all users' data but nothing else, and a novel ring-based overlapped grouping technique to efficiently deal with dynamic joins and leaves of users. We also extend the aggregation scheme for Sum to derive Max/Min and other aggregate statistics. Third, for mobile devices without communication infrastructure support, opportunistic mobile networking techniques are used to connect these devices. We address three security issues that may degrade the performance of sensing data collection in opportunistic mobile networks: social selfishness, flood attacks, and routing misbehavior. Specifically, we propose a Social Selfishness Aware Routing (SSAR) protocol which allows users to behave in the socially selfish way but improves routing performance by considering user selfishness into relay selection; we employ rate limiting to defend against flood attacks and design a distributed scheme which can probabilistically detect the violation of rate limit; to mitigate routing misbehavior, we devise a distributed scheme to detect packet dropping in opportunistic mobile networks and an algorithm to reduce the amount of packets forwarded to misbehaving users.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8720], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Qinghua ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qinghua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Thomas F Laporta", "Sencun Zhu", "Aylin Yener"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas F Laporta, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Aylin Yener, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mobile sensing", "security and privacy", "incentive", "data aggregation", "opportunistic mobile networks"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Hydrogen Storage in Carbon-supported Catalysts via Hydrogen Spillover", "id": "14475", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7315", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To realize hydrogen as a clean fuel for automobiles, one has to store it on board in a tank with reasonable size and low mass at ambient temperature. Hydrogen spillover is a very promising means for hydrogen storage, owing to its appropriate reaction conditions, fast adsorption/desorption kinetics, as well as ideal binding energy between hydrogen and the adsorbate. This study is aimed to investigate the role of surface chemistry of carbon-supported catalysts on hydrogen storage via spillover in order to meet the hydrogen storage goal set by the U.S. Department of Energy (5.5 wt.% by 2015 up to 100 bar). \nThe investigation is focused on the following aspects: 1) the influence of surface modification of activated carbon (Maxsorb) and Pt precursors on Pt metal particle size; 2) the synergistic effect of surface oxygen groups and Pt particle size on hydrogen uptake;3) the role of oxygen groups on a modified carbon surface as catalytic component is held constant through use of secondary spillover studies; 4) the evolution of surface oxygen groups in the presence of trace water during sample pretreatment and its influence on hydrogen storage; 5) the pressure dependence of hydrogen spillover; 6) desorption of hydrogen at elevated temperature. \nCarbon-supported catalysts have been synthesized either by direct depositing metal precursors on a high-surface area activated carbon (Maxsorb) or by physically mixing metal catalysts with activated carbon (AC). The former could lead to a better contact between the catalyst and the support, but the formation of metal particles can be affected by surface oxygen groups; the latter, however, was used to emphasize the role of surface chemistry on spillover without altering the catalyst. Prior to direct deposition, Maxsorb surfaces have been modified by HNO3 and KOH treatment in order to increase the surface oxygen groups or by high temperature annealing to remove the oxygen groups. Both volumetric and gravimetric methods have been utilized for the measurement of hydrogen uptake. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) have been carried out for the identification, qualification and quantification of surface oxygen groups. Temperature programmed desorption combined with Mass spectroscopy (TPD-MS) was used to asses hydrogen desorption from the species and detect possible decomposition products. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were performed for the measurement of the specific surface area and Nonlocal Density Function Theory (NLDFT) for pore size distribution. Metal particle size/dispersion has been investigated by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Carbon crystallite structure was shown by Raman spectroscopy.\nExperimental results show that surface oxygen groups were of importance in enhancing the uptake of PtC/AC-o (mixture of a PtC catalyst with KOH-modified AC), which has a hydrogen storage of 1.4 wt.% at 20 bar and 298 K, the highest hydrogen storage capacity among all tested materials. The majority (70%) of the enhancement was below 100 mbar, shown by a sharp rise on the adsorption isotherm. Trace amount of water, present during sample pretreatment, increases the formation of oxygen functional groups and active carbon sites, leading to the significant enhancement of hydrogen storage at low pressure.\nSurface oxygen groups determine Pt particle size when Pt is deposited from a wet chloroplatinic acid and acetone solution on Maxsorb. When the Maxsorb surface is annealed prior to deposition, surface oxygen groups are significantly reduced, and this leads to the smaller metal particle size (2 nm) with dispersion approaching 70%, and higher uptake at 1 bar. However, at 70 bar, no enhancement in hydrogen uptake is found relative to the precursor, demonstrating physisorption dominates over spillover at high pressures. Contrary to some literature reports,[1, 2] the results imply that catalyst particle size (2 nm) alone cannot account for differences in high-pressure uptake reported in the literature.\nHydrogen enhancement at low pressure is further investigated via a series of experiments where PtC/AC-o, PdC/AC-o, Pd powder, Pt-C, and AC are cooled at extremely low pressure (10-6 mbar). The mole ratio of hydrogen atom to surface metal atoms in the materials exceeding unity, and hydrogen desorption on PtC/AC-o and PdC/AC-o (not seen on AC, Pt-C and Pd) at 150 oC supported the observation of hydrogen adsorption at extremely low pressure. The square root pressure dependence of hydrogen spillover claimed by previous models is not shown by current experimental results.\nAlthough increased hydrogen uptake at low pressure could lead to pressure savings (i.e. equal mass loading of hydrogen at significantly reduced pressure) in the practical hydrogen storage vessels, the desorption isotherm of Pt/AC-o indicates that less than 1/3 of adsorbed hydrogen is ready for desorption with pressure reduction to 12 mbar at 298 K. XPS and FTIR surface characterization after H2 desorption suggests strongly bound hydrogen forms hydroxyls with introduced functional groups on Pt/AC-o. Although no H2O desorption is observed on PtC/AC-o, PdC/AC-o and Maxsorb-supported Pt with heating up to 400 oC, the requirement to release a portion of adsorbed hydrogen above 100 oC indicates these materials might also need a temperature-swing process for on-board hydrogen storage.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7289], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Qixiu ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qixiu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Angela Lueking", "Angela Lueking", "Ljubisa R Radovic", "Chunshan Song", "Renee Denise Diehl"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Angela Lueking, Dissertation Advisor", "Angela Lueking, Committee Chair", "Ljubisa R Radovic, Committee Member", "Chunshan Song, Committee Member", "Renee Denise Diehl, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydrogen Spillover", "Hydrogen Storage", "Surface Chemistry", "Surface modification", "Oxygen Functional Groups", "KOH", "metal dispersion"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Molecular Dynamic Simulation of Aluminum/Water Reaction\nUsing Reactive Force Field\n\n", "id": "10351", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5402", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past few years, it is becoming more likely that the emphasis on cleaner fuel will lead to use of hydrogen in a significant way. The worldwide increasing demand of hydrogen, such as in hydrogen fuel cells, has made it crucial to find hydrogen generation methods from inexpensive simple processes. One of the most promising approaches is hydrogen generation from the aluminum-water reaction. The hydrogen produced via such aluminum-water reactions can be employed to power fuel cell devices for portable applications such as emergency generators and laptop computers. Also, aluminum-water reactors can be used for emergency hydrogen storage on fuel cell-powered vehicles.\nIn this work, molecular dynamic simulations were conducted to study the aluminum-water reaction using the reactive force field (ReaxFF), which is optimized especially for Al and aluminum oxide. The initial reaction between water molecules and an Al cluster was considered to be the chemisorption of water molecules, and then the dissociation of adsorbed water molecules. Both water self-assisting effect and self poisoning effect on H2O reaction are observed. The dissociation of adsorbed water molecule is assisted by other water molecules due to the interactions between them, which is referred to as water self-assisting effect on H2O reaction. On the other hand, adsorbed water molecule can also prevent further reaction with the Al cluster, which is the water self poisoning effect. When too many water molecules are present in the system, considerable surface reaction sites are lost because of the chemisorption of water molecules. As a result, these adsorbed water molecules can\u2019t further dissociate, since the hydrogen atoms needs a free site to move into. The adsorbed water molecules tend to connect and form layers of water molecules starting from the adsorbed ones and stretching to the ones in the gas phase around the cluster. These layers of water molecules will also block the pathways for the reactants to arrive at the Al cluster surface. \nWater dissociation (conversion) rate depends on the number of water molecules present in the system. The dissociation rate firstly increases with the number of water molecules because of the water self-assisting effect and then decreases with the number of water molecules due to water self poisoning effect. A maximum water dissociation rate of 100% is obtained for a 100 molecule Al cluster when 30 water molecules were originally added. \nAmong the intermediate species produced during the reaction, the hydronium ion is believed to be crucial to assist water molecule dissociation and facilitate hydrogen generation. \nActing as an inert specie, noble gas neon (Ne) was added to the aluminum-water mixture. Direct collisions between Ne atoms and water molecules are not observed, but Ne atoms can temporarily adsorb on the aluminum cluster. Due to water self-assistance and self poisoning effect, an optimum Ne concentration (corresponding to an optimum water concentration) is found with respect to higher water dissociation rate and hydrogen generation rate.\nDifferent aluminum cluster sizes were also studied in this work. When the same average surface coverage of aluminum cluster by water molecules is maintained, higher water molecule dissociation rate and better hydrogen generation performance are obtained from larger aluminum cluster, due to the additional surface reaction sites provided by the larger aluminum cluster. However, for aluminum clusters with different sizes, the same optimum water concentration with respect to better water dissociation and hydrogen generation performance was found.\nThe influences of aluminum oxide layer on aluminum-water reaction are also investigated in this work. The presence of aluminum oxide layer causes the loss of available surface reaction sites, which is demonstrated by the reduction of chemisorption and dissociation of water molecules during the reaction. As the aluminum oxide layer becomes thicker, the spontaneous reaction of aluminum with water is severely prohibited or even stopped. To activate aluminum-water reaction, continuous removal of aluminum oxide either by mechanical or chemical methods is required. For future studies, modifying aluminum cluster structure or cluster surface configuration, or adding other materials to the aluminum cluster, may have the potential of promoting aluminum-water reaction. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5395], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Rong ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rong", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clinton Matthew Mench", "Matthew M Mench", "Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clinton Matthew Mench, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew M Mench, Thesis Advisor", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["aluminum water reaction", "reactive force field"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Toward a Holistic Framework of Indoor Wayfinding Behaviors: The Impacts of Architectural Intelligibility and Individual Differences", "id": "15398", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5401", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of indoor wayfinding behaviors, I propose that the environments and individual differences including familiarity and mobility all have to be incorporated into a holistic framework. In this dissertation, indoor wayfinding behaviors are organized into three categories: the wayfinding performance, the acquisition of spatial knowledge, and the development of spatial awareness. I present the results of two behavioral experiments: First, 24 novices and 28 experts performed four book locating tasks, pointed to an unseen distant location, and then estimated their location and orientation on a map. Second, 40 participants (split into two groups based on mobility) were taken individually to 12 locations on different floors in a library where they estimated their location and orientation on a map. They were either required to stand in a single location (static) or permitted to move before responding (active). In both experiments, locations were characterized using space syntax measures in terms of their architectural intelligibility including visibility, connectivity, and layout complexity. Additionally, the spatial homogeneity and heterogeneity of these locations were considered. Individual differences were assessed using a battery of established tasks in both experiments and familiarity in the first experiment. Results show that architectural intelligibility and individual differences including familiarity and mobility all affect performance.  First, architectural intelligibility has a more dominant role than familiarity in wayfinding performance. Second, architectural intelligibility has a less dominant role than familiarity in the acquisition of spatial knowledge. Third, mobility has a more dominant role than architectural intelligibility in the development of spatial awareness. In particular, self-reported wayfinding skills predict both location and orientation performance. Psychometric tests including mental rotation, water level, and paper folding   predict only orientation performance. The first contribution of this dissertation is the geographic perspective taken to categorize locations in an environment based on their spatial homogeneity and heterogeneity, as both spatial homogeneity and heterogeneity have influences on wayfinding behaviors in all three aspects. The second important contribution of this dissertation is the clarification of the dominant role of architectural intelligibility versus familiarity on the acquisition of spatial knowledge. This was reported conflictingly in the literature.

On the one hand, such messages could raise awareness of potential risks and cause viewers to follow the recommendation. On the other hand, these messages have the potential to threaten viewers\u2019 freedom of action by telling them what to do and what not to do. This can generate psychological reactance, leading to boomerang effects, as numerous studies have shown. Scholars have identified several ways to reduce psychological reactance, including raising audience\u2019s liking for the message content and increasing their credibility judgment of the message. However, almost all the existing literature has been focusing on identifying and utilizing message features to reduce reactance.\nAs campaigns go online, many technological affordances of digital media, such as audience metrics that reflect audience evaluations, could provide important cues that influence user\u2019s perceptions, evaluations, and credibility judgments of the message and the message source, which can in turn influence message acceptance. In addition, these affordances facilitate a variety of user actions, which could potentially empower users and afford them choices and control. Can such technological affordances attenuate psychological reactance individuals experience in response to health messages? The present dissertation aims at answering this question by examining the role played by the presence of audience size metrics (known as \u2018bandwagon cues\u2019) and the affordance of commenting action in reducing reactance and enhancing persuasive outcomes of health messages that pose a threat to freedom of action.\nTo test the effect of technological affordances in influencing persuasion in health communication, a 2 (message threat: high vs. low) X 2 (bandwagon cue: high vs. low) X 2 (comment function: presence vs. absence) between-subjects experiment was conducted. Findings suggest that high bandwagon cues do indeed reduce reactance and improve message acceptance by eliciting bandwagon perceptions and feelings of isolation. Comment action is associated with a strong sense of agency, which in turn predicts individuals\u2019 strong intention to follow the message recommendation. A series of moderated mediation tests reveal that effects of bandwagon cues override effects of message features, such that in low bandwagon conditions, message threat affects message acceptance through perceived threat to freedom, whereas in high bandwagon conditions, viewers\u2019 perceived threat to freedom does not mediate the effect of message threat on persuasion. In addition, the action effect overrides effects of bandwagon cues\u2014only when users do not leave a comment will high bandwagon cue improve persuasion by enhancing their evaluation of message persuasiveness; for users who post a comment, this effect is not found. \nThis dissertation contributes to psychological reactance theory, and the theory of interactive media (TIME) by exploring new ways of reducing audience reactance to persuasive messages conveyed via online media, and provides practical implications for communicators and designers interested in improving the effectiveness of advocacy in the domain of persuasion, particularly health communication.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15697], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Ruobing ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ruobing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["S.

One game-changing breakthrough in genetics was the invention of genotyping and sequencing technology that allows researchers to examining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the entire genome. The other major breakthrough was the identification of haplotypes of common alleles in major human populations, which permitted the design of genotyping assays that effectively cover entire human genomes at a resolution appropriate for genetic mapping. Together, these technology breakthroughs have permitted researchers to carry out Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) on a wide range of traits including, for example, height and disease status. With GWAS, causal SNPs have been identified for some Mendelian traits, but for more complex genetic traits, the genetic heritability explained by the associated SNPs are low. In addition, high-throughput technologies to generate other types of -omics data such as gene expression, DNA methylation, and protein levels data have also emerged recently. How to best utilize the SNP data and other multi-omics data to understand genetic traits is one of the most important questions in the field today. \nWith the increasing prevalence of multi-omics data, new types of analysis schemes and tools are needed to handle the additional complexity of the data. In particular, two areas of method development are in great need. First, statistical methods employed by GWAS do not consider the potential interacting relationships among genetic loci. Thus, methods that can explore the joint effect between multiple genetic loci or genetic factors could unveil new associations. Second, different types of \u2013omics data may give distinctive representations of the overall biological system. By combining multi-omics data, we could potentially aggregate non-overlapping information from each individual data types. Thus, the focus of this dissertation is on developing and improving computational methods that can jointly model multiple types of genomics data. First, an evaluation of an existing method, grammatical evolution neural network, was conducted to identify the optimal algorithm settings for the detection of genetic associations. It was found that under certain algorithm settings,  the neural networks have been restricted to one-layer simple network. Using a parameter sweep approach, the analysis identified optimal settings that allow for building more flexible network structures. Then, the algorithm was applied to integrate multi-omics data to model drug-induced cytotoxicity for a number of cancer drugs. By combining different types of \u2013omics data including SNPs, gene expression and methylation levels, we were able to model a higher portion of the observed variability than any individual data type alone. However, one drawback of the existing neural network approach is the limited interpretability. To this end, a new algorithm based on Bayesian Networks was created. One novelty of the approach is the ability to independently fit a distinct Bayesian Network for each categories of a phenotype. This allows for identifying category specific interactions as well as common interactions across different categories. Analysis using simulated SNP data has shown that the Bayesian Network approach outperformed the Neural Network approach in many settings, particularly in situation where the data contains multiple interacting loci. When applied to a type 2 diabetes dataset, the algorithm was able to identify distinctive interaction patterns between cases and controls.  Ultimately, the goal of this dissertation has been to fully take advantage of the newly available data to understand the genetic basis of complex traits. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13537], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Ruowang ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ruowang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie", "Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Shaun A Mahony", "Le Bao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie, Dissertation Advisor", "Marylyn Deriggi Ritchie, Committee Chair", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Shaun A Mahony, Committee Member", "Le Bao, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Bioinformatics", "Genomics", "Statistics", "Data Integration", "Bayesian Network", "Epistasis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "An examination of Petromyzontidae in Pennsylvania", "id": "14576", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6084", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lampreys are one of the two jawless vertebrate groups in Agnatha. The adult\u2019s life is shorter than the larval stage which is known as \u201cammocoete\u201d. They are either in parasitic forms or non-parasitic forms. Parasitic adults attach to other species, rely on the blood or flesh of the hosts, and non-parasitic adults die after spawning. There is little historical data on lampreys because ammocoetes are filter feeders who are in the sediment, and captures of adults were all by chance. The objectives I achieved in this study were included: 1) Compiled all existing PA historical data (prior to 1990s) of lampreys and created database and distribution maps for each species; 2) Sampled historical sites for native lampreys in 2011 by using backpack designed for ammocoetes, documented changes in lamprey communities at the watershed scale; 3) Conducted substrate sampling at sites where ammocoetes were present, analyzed substrate size preferred by ammocoetes; 4) Identified collections to species, compared the current data and historical data to see the presence and absence of native lamprey species and value the changes of distributions. \nIn Pennsylvania, 7 species were found historically. They are Lampetra aepyptera, Lampetra appendix, Ichthyomyzon bdellium, Ichthyomyzon fossor, Ichthyomyzon greeleyi, Ichthyomyzon unicuspis, Petromyzon marinus, among which I. fossor and I. unicuspis are endangered, and other species are in concern. In 2011, 21 streams were inspected, 18 creeks were sampled by using an ammocoete backpack shocker designed in Dr. Stauffer\u2019s lab, and 4 species- Lampetra aepyptera, Lampetra appendix, Ichthyomyzon greeleyi and Petromyzon marinus were found in 14 creeks statewide. Lampreys were extinct at some sites because of flow regulation, channelization, poor water quality, and chemical treatments. In tributaries of Lake Erie, Sea Lamprey treatment might be a major reason to the population declining of other native species. Substrate size and water velocity are the most important factors determine the presence and absence of larval lampreys, so substrate samples were collected at 5 sites where ammocoetes were present. Differences on size of the sediments were found between lamprey spots and non-lamprey spots. Ammocoetes prefer smaller sized substrate with particle diameter less than 0.25mm in shallow, warm waters with dissolved organic matter. This study elaborated the current status of different larval lamprey species and indicated that their distributional range is shrinking and there might be a declining trend of native lamprey species although abundance survey was not implemented. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6077], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Shan ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr.", "C Paola Ferreri", "Donna Jean Peuquet"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jay Richard Stauffer Jr., Thesis Advisor", "C Paola Ferreri, Thesis Advisor", "Donna Jean Peuquet, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Petromyzontidae", "ammocoete", "substrate", "backpack electrofishing", "distribution", "PA"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A revision of the Pseudotropheus elongatus group with a description of a new genus Chindongo and seven new species", "id": "23565", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10551", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lake malawi is an African lake surrounded by Malawi, Tanzania, and Mozambique, and is known for its endemic haplochromine species flock, most notably, the rock-dwelling cichlids known as mbuna.

Comb-like strip transducers comprised of Piezoelectric Fiber Composite (PFC) are investigated, which have better structural integrity and tailorability than bulk piezoceramics. Strategic placement of these transducers enables damage monitoring over a large area for a variety of structures. Many factors including fiber orientation, fiber volume fraction, poling direction and electrode location are considered for these PFC transducers. Piezoelectric and mechanical properties for these innovative transducers are estimated through micromechanical modeling. A new Finite Element Analysis (FEA) employs co-simulation using ABAQUS Standard and ABAQUS Explicit together to simulate transient wave propagation from a PFC comb type strip transducer into a plate. The benefit behind this co-simulation analysis is to couple multiphysics (piezoelectric) analysis with transient dynamic (wave propagation), which is not possible with the two codes individually. Finally, trial experiments using PFC transducers for exciting planar Lamb waves that interact with damage such as corrosion, cracks and holes are also conducted. This experiment employs a laser vibrometer to visualize the wave propagation and is compared with FEA animations with unwanted reflection absorbing boundary conditions. The approach combines infinite elements with viscous surface pressure and is verified as an efficient way to remove edge reflections in 3D wave propagation problems.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5980], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Sheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sheng", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["structural health monitoring", "piezoelectric fiber composite transducer", "guided waves"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Essays on Productivity, Uncertainty, and Firm Activities", "id": "21072", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9730", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation studies the interaction between firm heterogeneity in productivity and demand uncertainty and firm export participation.

Firms have uncertainty about foreign demand and they gradually learn about it based on the prices and quantities they observe in their individual export transactions in the Bayesian style. Firms' export decisions are dynamic and depend on the evolution of both productivity and beliefs about foreign demand. I empirically identify the role of each process in determining firm-market-level export participation and estimate the dynamic model. The identification and estimation use data on both firm shipment-level exports and firm-level production information for the Chinese ceramics industry. The empirical results indicate substantial firm heterogeneity in both productivity and demand uncertainty. Demand uncertainty is the dominant difference between potential entrants in export markets and experienced exporters. In particular, experienced exporters have higher expectations and face less uncertainty about foreign demand. Both the learning process and productivity evolution are driving forces of export participation for experienced exporters but for potential entrants the former plays a more important role. A further counterfactual exercise shows that reducing the level of uncertainty of potential entrants to that of experienced exporters causes the number of exporters to fall by 11%.\n\nChapter 2: Production Function Estimation with Unobserved Input Price Dispersion\n\nWe propose a method to consistently estimate production functions in the presence of input price dispersion\nwhen intermediate input quantities are not observed.\nThe traditional approach to dealing with unobserved input\nquantities---using deflated expenditure as a proxy---requires strong\nassumptions for consistency.  Instead, we control for heterogeneous\ninput prices by exploiting the first order conditions of the firm's profit maximization problem.\nWe show that the traditional approach tends to underestimate\nthe elasticity of substitution and biases estimates of the distribution parameters. Our\napproach applies to a general class of production functions. It can accommodate both heterogeneity in input prices and a variety of heterogeneous intermediate input types.\nA Monte Carlo study illustrates that the\nomitted price bias is significant in the traditional approach, while our\nmethod consistently recovers the production function parameters. We apply\nour method to a firm-level data set from Colombian manufacturing industries.\nThe empirical results are consistent with the predictions that the use of\nexpenditure as a proxy for quantities biases the elasticity of substitution downward.\nMoreover, using our preferred method, we provide evidence of significant input price\ndispersion and even wider productivity dispersion than is estimated\nusing proxy methods.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9485], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Shengyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shengyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts", "Mark John Roberts", "James R.

These materials are usually created with polymers and ligands to achieve stable and specific cell-material interactions through ligand-receptor recognition. However, the strong and stable binding of cells on a material also poses a challenge to the subsequent release of the cells from the material in applications such as cell separation. To tackle this challenge, great efforts have been made in developing materials with the function of switching the cell binding state from adhesion to release responsive to different stimuli, such as pH, light, and temperature. However, most of these stimuli can cause detrimental effects on cells or even the death of cells. Therefore, it is important to create materials that can undergo changes in physiological conditions. \nNucleic acid aptamers are an emerging class of ligands that bind cell receptors or soluble molecules with high affinity and specificity. In comparison to other ligands, they have various merits for the developments of cell attaching materials. Those merits include high affinity, low immunogenicity, and great stability. In addition, aptamers can be chemically modified for different conjugation chemistries. Importantly, the structure of aptamers can be programmed and tuned in physiological conditions. \nThe purpose of this work was to synthesize aptamer-functionalized hydrogels for cell catch and release. It was hypothesized that aptamers conjugated hydrogels can induce cell catch on the hydrogel, and that the change of the chemical or physical status of the aptamers in physiological conditions can lead to cell release noninvasively. To test the hypothesis, two tasks were performed, including to develop aptamer-functionalized hydrogels and to examine its functions in chemical and physical changes. Chemical changes were achieved by using restriction endonuclease. Physical changes were achieved through DNA inter- and intra-molecular hybridization. These changes occurred in physiological conditions. The data show that target cells can be specifically captured on the aptamer-functionalized hydrogels, and more importantly that the cells can be released with high viability in physiological conditions. Thus, this work has successfully demonstrated a promising biomaterial for programmable cell catch and release in physiological conditions. The work described herein will make great contributions to the development of dynamic materials for controlling cell adhesion, thus improving diagnosis and therapy of a spectrum of diseases. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11597], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Shihui ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shihui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yong Wang", "Yong Wang", "Siyang Zheng", "Peter J Butler", "Na Xiong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yong Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Yong Wang, Committee Chair", "Siyang Zheng, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Na Xiong, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydrogel", "aptamer", "restriction endonuclease", "cell adhesion", "molecular reconfiguration", "nondestructive cell release"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "BIOCHEMICAL AND FUNCTIONAL STUDIES OF S-RNASE-BASED SELF-INCOMPATIBILITY IN PETUNIA INFLATA", "id": "13440swl5324", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13440", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Self-incompatibility (SI) is an intraspecific reproductive barrier that is widely adopted by flowering plants to prevent inbreeding and promote outcrossing.  Studies on SI in five families during the past three decades have revealed three distinct mechanisms, and our lab focuses on the SI system employed by the Solanaceae family, using Petunia inflata as a model.  In Solanaceae SI, self/non-self recognition between pollen and pistil is regulated by a highly polymorphic locus, the S-locus, which houses a single S-RNase gene regulating pistil specificity and, in S2-haplotype and S3-haplotype, 17 S-locus F-box (SLF) genes collectively regulating pollen specificity in SI.  According to the collaborative non-self recognition model, for a given S-haplotype: (i) each SLF functions as the F-box protein component of an SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein) complex, which mediates uniquitination of S-RNase(s), with which the SLF interacts, and its (their) subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome; (ii) each SLF only interacts with a subset of its non-self S-RNases, and a complete suite of SLFs are collectively required to detoxify all non-self S-RNases to allow cross-compatible pollination; (iii) none of the SLF proteins interact with their self-S-RNase, allowing it to degrade RNAs in the cytosol of the self pollen tube to result in incompatible pollination.\n\nThe overall goal of my dissertation research is to assess several predictions of the collaborative non-self recognition model to better understand the molecular and biochemical basis of Solanaecae type SI.  In Chapter 2, I describe the use of Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) followed by Mass Spectrometry (MS) to identify the components of the SLF-containing complex.  Our lab previously showed that PiSSK1 (a pollen-specific Skp1-like protein), PiCUL1-P (a pollen-specific Cullin1), and PiRBX1 (a Petunia conventional Rbx1) co-immunoprecipitated with S\u00ac2-SLF1:GFP (GFP-fused SLF1 of S2-haplotype) expressed in transgenic pollen.  Using PiSSK1:FLAG:GFP expressed in transgenic plants as bait, I confirmed the presence of PiCUL1-P and PiRBX1 in the S2-SLF1-containing complex, and further identified two additional SLF proteins, SLF4 and SLF13, as the F-box protein component of similar SCF complexes.  To address the question of whether all 17 SLF proteins of S2-haplotype and S3-haplotype are assembled into similar SCF complexes, I modified the Co-IP/MS procedure, including addition of style extracts of four different S-genotypes to pollen extracts containing PiSSK1:FLAG:GFP.  The results, described in Chapter 3, showed that all 17 SLF proteins were assembled into similar SCF complexes, suggesting that these SCFSLF complexes have evolved specifically to function in SI.  Interestingly, an SLF-like protein and four of the 179 non-SLF F-box proteins predicted to be expressed in pollen, also co-immunoprecipitated with PiSSK1:FLAG:GFP.  Sequence comparison revealed a 6-amino acid motif conserved among all the F-box proteins that interacted with PiSSK1.\n\n Our lab initiated a lab-wide effort to determine the interaction relationships between 17 SLF proteins of S2-haplotype and S3-haplotype and 11 S-RNases.  In Chapter 4, I describe the use of the transgenic functional approach established in our lab to obtain genetic evidence for SLF-S-RNase interactions.  Using this approach, I determined the interaction relationships between S2-SLF15 and all 11 S-RNases, and between S3-SLF15 and two of these S-RNases.  The comprehensive interaction relationships will not only address the validity of the collaborative non-self recognition model but also allow biochemical and structural studies of differential interactions between SLF proteins and S-RNases.  To facilitate the identification of amino acids of SLF proteins required for specific interactions with certain S-RNases, I set out to study 17 allelic variants of SLF1, as their deduced amino acid sequences share a higher degree of similarity than do the amino acid sequences of 17 paralogous SLF proteins.  So far, I have determined the interaction relationships between seven of these allelic variants of SLF1 and S2-RNase and S3-RNases.  Comparison of the amino acid sequences of all 8 SLF proteins that were found to interact with S3-RNase has revealed 8 conserved amino acids in the domain (named functional domain 3, FD3) that the lab has found to containing the amino acids of S2-SLF1 required for interactions with S3-RNase. \n\nFinally, in Chapter 5, I summarize all the major findings of my dissertation research and describe two of the projects that I carried out but were not completed.  I discuss how all the findings made have advanced our understanding of Solanaceae SI, and laid a foundation for future studies of this complex self/non-self recognition system. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13222], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Shu ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Teh-Hui Kao", "Teh-Hui Kao", "Gabriele Brigitte Monshausen", "Dawn S Luthe", "Michael Axtell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Teh-Hui Kao, Dissertation Advisor", "Teh-Hui Kao, Committee Chair", "Gabriele Brigitte Monshausen, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member", "Michael Axtell, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Self-incompatibility", "S-Locus F-box proteins", "SCF complexes", "Mass Spectrometry", "Co-immunoprecipitation", "Petunia inflata"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "INTEGRATED MODELING OF MULTI-SCALE HYDRODYNAMICS, SEDIMENT AND POLLUTANT TRANSPORT", "id": "9062", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5843", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Modeling hydrodynamics, sediment and pollutant transport over a wide range of spatial scales and hydrological events (e.g., inland flood and storm surges) remains a fundamental impediment to flood risk prediction, water resources management, and environmental protection. In addition, forecasting of extreme hydrologic events caused by severe weather and climate change [Milly et al., 2002] is a growing challenge. The goal of this study is to develop a modeling system appropriate to predict the multiple scale hydrodynamics, sediment and pollutant transport as well as extreme hydrological events for rivers, floodplains, coastal areas and their watersheds.\n    Two major contributions are made in this dissertation. First, a two-dimensional (2-D) finite volume model (PIHM-Hydro) was developed to fully couple the hydrodynamics, pollutant transport, and sediment transport at the scale of river, floodplain, and coastal area. This is the first 2-D high-order model to fully couple shallow water flow and sediment transport in the successful simulation of a real flow field. The model is based on standard upwind finite volume methods using Roe\u2019s and HLL approximate Riemann solvers on unstructured triangular grids. A multidimensional linear reconstruction technique and multidimensional slope limiter were implemented to achieve second-order spatial accuracy. Model efficiency and stability are treated using an explicit-implicit method for temporal discretization with operator splitting. \n    The advantages of the present model are that (1) it can handle complicated geometry by using the Delaunay triangulation based on Shewchuk\u2019s algorithm; (2) it is capable of producing accurate and stable solutions over a wide range of spatial scales and hydrological events such as discontinuous flow and wetting/drying process by using the approximate Riemann solver and the semi-implicit time integration technique based on the CVODE; and (3) it can accurately simulate the interactions of hydrodynamics, sediment transport and pollutant transport by fully coupling these processes physically and numerically. These advantages of PIHM-Hydro have been illustrated by its successful application on the test cases where multiscale physical processes are dominant over a wide range of spatial scales.\n    The second contribution of this dissertation is to develop a spatially-distributed physically-based sediment transport modeling component at the watershed scale (PIHM-Sed) which is fully coupled with the hydrological processes within the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model system (PIHM) [Qu and Duffy, 2007]. This is the first spatially-distributed physically-based model to \u201cfully-couple\u201d hydrology and sediment transport in terms of physical and numerical coupling. It integrates the hillslope and channel processes, and is capable of predicting major surface/subsurface hydrological processes, sediment yield as well as spatial distribution of erosion/deposition. For the hillslope, the erosion processes of rain splash and sediment transport by overland flow are simulated; for the channel, it simulates the erosion of bed material and sediment transport by channel flow. An algorithm for bed armoring was also implemented in the channel component. In the model system, all hydrological and sediment transport processes are defined on discretized unit elements as a fully-coupled system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using a semi-discrete finite volume method (FVM) on unstructured grids. The implementation of the model has been performed on a hypothetical storm event at the Shale Hill watershed for demonstrating the capability of the model in multi-process simulation at watershed scale.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5840], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Shuangcai ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shuangcai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy", "Christopher J Duffy", "Patrick M Reed", "Rudy L Slingerland", "Thorsten Wagener", "Xiantao Li", "Wen Shen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Chair", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Member", "Rudy L Slingerland, Committee Member", "Thorsten Wagener, Committee Member", "Xiantao Li, Committee Member", "Wen Shen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["flood modeling", "hydrological modeling", "numerical modeling", "sediment transport", "pollutant transport", "PIHM"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Exploring the mediating effect of social capital on human capital in economic well-being: A micro-analysis of four countries", "id": "16246", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8028", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While the importance of human capital and social capital have been widely recognized in a range of social phenomena, the mediating effect of social capital on human capital is only occasionally acknowledged. This study examines the role of social capital in the relationship between human capital and economic well-being. Both the additive effect and the interaction effect of social capital with human capital are considered to better depict its significance with a cross-cultural perspective.\n\nDrawing on the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP 2001) on social networks and social support, the study focuses on four countries: two developed countries \u2013 the United States and Japan, and two developing ones \u2013 the Philippines and Brazil. The outcome variable of interest is individual economic well-being as measured by individual wages. Human capital is measured by formal schooling and work experience, and social capital by a diversity of social contacts (i.e., relatives and close friends) and social engagement in various groups or associations. Econometric models (e.g., OLS, Heckman Selection model, and SUR model) are used to test the roles of social capital in different contexts.\n\nThe empirical findings are mixed and heterogeneous. The significance of human capital remains for all the four countries, reaffirming the theory of human capital. However, different aspects of social capital (bonding, bridging and linking) tend to demonstrate different effects for different countries. In spite of the mixed results, social capital is not negligible in terms of its magnitude and significance, but rather deserves further specific study in depth to reveal the effect of each of the indicators. Furthermore, social capital is never meant to substitute but complement human capital either in positive or negative effects, as it is commonly observed in the real world that people utilize the social capital at their disposal from time to time out of habit. It may also be the case that people are asked for help by their network ties, bearing losses to a certain degree, to benefit the latter's economic well-being. In other words, certain types of social capital amplify human capital while others offset human capital in their effects on economic well-being, or compensate for lower levels of human capital.\n\nThere are two limitations of this study. First of all, the measurement of social capital needs to be further refined so as to cover not only the quantity of social network ties but also the quality of these ties, both of which matter in social contexts. Second, the cross-sectional data from the ISSP survey on social networks do not allow drawing causal inferences for social capital in the relationship between human capital and economic well-being. Even though the current research design considers the possible sample selection issues and uses both the Heckman selection model and the SUR model, it does not consider the potential endogeneity of social capital in the process of social and economic development. Further causal inferences would be able to shed more light on how social capital is leveraged for human capital to work best towards the improvement of economic well-being. Should panel data be available in the future survey cycles, this issue might be addressed by controlling for potentially unobservable factors. In addition, social capital is so complex a topic that it is highly contingent on social culture and economic institutions. Cross-cultural comparisons are very interesting but would be more insightful if cultural factors were included in the theoretical framework.

The current limitation on synthetic Met inclusion in organic poultry diets could lead to reduced bird growth and subsequent economic losses (Fanatico, 2010). Therefore, the primary focus of this thesis was to determine the nutritive value of Met-rich feedstuffs, namely high-Met corn (HMC), triticale, naked oats (NO), lentils, de-hulled screw-pressed sunflower seeds meal (SSM), Black Soldier Fly (BSF) prepupae meal, and post-extracted algae residue (PEAR) as well as evaluate the feeding value of several selected ingredients, i.e. HMC, NO, BSF, and PEAR in broilers. Results from thesis studies indicated that the most Met-rich feedstuffs by ingredient type are NO [15.5% crude protein (CP) and 0.24% Met] as a plant energy ingredient, SSM (48% CP and 1.04% Met) as a plant protein ingredients, and the BSF prepupae meal (42.2% CP and 0.85% Met) as an unconventional ingredient, on an \u201cas is\u201d basis. \nThis research consisted of three primary studies. First, a feeding and digestibility trial demonstrated that NO could successfully replace corn as the major dietary energy source in organic broiler diets with 0.1% lower synthetic Met supplementation. In particular, supplementing 0.05% Rovabio Excel AP10 (R) [an organically approved combination of 19 enzymes] alone (NO+R) or together with 0.025% Optiphos (O) [a phytase] (NO+R+O) enhanced apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of CP (P < 0.0001) and Met (P < 0.0001) in the organic naked oat based diets and improved 21 d body weight gain (BWG), 10-21 d feed conversion ratio (FCR), overall BWG, and FCR, equal to that of the corn/soybean (CS) control. In the second study, a BSF prepupae meal was prepared by washing, drying and grinding BSF prepupae fed a mixture of 80% hen manure and 20% kitchen waste. The effects of increasing dietary levels (0, 2, 4, and 6%) of BSF on broiler performance were evaluated. Results indicated that BSF was a suitable nutrient supplement for poultry due to its high CP (42.2%) and favorable AA profile (e.g. 0.24% Met) by benefiting broilers at a moderate inclusion rate (4% BSF) to obtain optimal growth and performance comparable to that of the CS diet; however, the high ash (12.34%), and calcium (6.09%) contents need to be considered when formulating diets. In the third study, the AID and true ileal digestibility (TID) of AA and jejunum digesta viscosity of five HMC hybrids, i.e. Corn-F, Corn-V, Corn-614, Corn-6360, and Corn-6150, and PEAR were determined in 35-d-old broilers to enable these ingredients to be incorporated into organic poultry diets on a digestible AA basis. Among the corn hybrids, the CP contents ranged from 9.12% for C-614 to 7.33% for Corn-F, and the crude fiber (CF) contents ranged from 2.69% for Corn-F to 2.20% for both Corn-614 and Corn-6150, on an \u201cas is\u201d basis, respectively. As for Met digestibility, results showed that Corn-F had the highest AID (72.59%) while Corn-6360 had the highest TID (107.33%). Post-extracted algae residue was reported to contain 30.2% CP, 9.08% CF, 10.4% ash, 0.48% Met, and 3.34% sodium, on an \u201cas is\u201d basis, respectively. The high AID of CP (90.13%) were favorable; however, low AID of CF (18.65%) and Met (35.33%), and low TID of Met (47.25%) indicated that the non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) in PEAR might contribute to the high viscosity of the jejunum digesta  (1.08 cPs) and the low CF and AA digestibility.

Over the past two decades, microfluidics has emerged as a powerful platform for cell analyses and studies. In particular, acoustofluidic technologies offer some attractive features and have great application potential in cell biology and its related fields. This dissertation presents the development of acoustofluidic or microfluidic platforms that tackle some current challenges faced in cell biology. First of all, an acoustofluidic-based multichannel droplet sorter is demonstrated that can effectively sort picoliter droplets into multiple outputs. The future development of a fluorescence-activated droplet sorter (FADS) can realize the screening and sorting of cells based on secreted biomarkers. Secondly, an acoustofluidic-based, automatic, and continuous-flow cell washing device is developed and its application in the transfer of inflammatory cells from human sputum samples is reported. This acoustofluidic device preserves the viability and integrity of transferred inflammatory cells and effectively removes residual dithiothreitol (DTT) utilized during sputum liquefaction to facilitate more accurate identification of inflammatory lung cells from human sputum samples. Thirdly, a cell co-culture platform is developed that can form organized cell co-culture for studying heterotypic cell-cell interactions. The study of cancer cell mobility within co-culture demonstrates its utilization as an in vitro platform for the evaluation of the invasiveness of cancer cells and anti-tumor drug screenings.

While traditional genetic and molecular biology approaches focus on identifying functions of one individual component at a time, systems biology approaches have become essential for biologists to understand the complex interactions of the cellular components, and to distill key regulators out of the rich data that are generated by high throughput experiments. I have undertaken two projects that address two general questions in systems biology: 1) how to reconstruct the network of the interacting molecular components, and to simulate the cellular process that is carried out by the molecular network. 2) Given a compendium of gene expression data from multiple tissues in a multicellular organism, how to identify novel genes that function in a specific cell type.  In both projects, I have used plant guard cells as a model system, while each project has been developed using specific computational methods.  \nDozens of cellular components have been found to be involved in the guard cell ABA response, however, most interactions between these components are indirect, and the detailed parameters of known direct reactions are largely unknown. A Boolean network approach is adopted to address the problem of lack of details regarding the guard cell signal transduction network.  Random asynchronous update and random initial states of the components are introduced to model both the uncertainty that is inherent in the intracellular signaling process as well as our incomplete knowledge of the signaling process.  Simulations are carried out to determine whether knockout of each component has an impact on the ABA induced stomatal closure. Computational predictions are validated by wet-bench experiments using chemical inhibitors that \u201cclamp\u201d intracellular signaling components.            \nIn a multicellular organism, each cell type performs specialized functions using genes that are expressed in that cell type. To understand the general principle of how genes are expressed in multicellular organisms, tissue-based gene expression patterns are analyzed for thousands of genes from four multicellular organisms: human, mouse, rice and Arabidopsis. Expression kurtosis is found to be the common organizing principle of tissue preferential expression in all four organisms, thus is used to define in which tissues a high kurtosis gene is preferentially expressed, for every high kurtosis genes in both human and Arabidopsis. To identify novel genes that are essential to guard cells\u2019 functions, transcriptome data are obtained using Arabidopsis transcriptome microarray.  A linear model approach is used to merge the expression profiles generated by our group with published results from other published transcriptome data before the identification of high kurtosis genes that are preferentially expressed in guard cells.  Many high kurtosis genes are found to be preferentially expressed in multiple tissues. Using high kurtosis genes as signatures for tissue functions gene-centric tissue networks are constructed to explore the similarities between different tissues. Tissues from similar organ origination are found to group into modules in the gene-centric tissue networks, supporting the predictive power of the tissue network approach. Four genes that are newly predicted to function in guard cells and/or roots are validated using knockout mutants, and the phenotypes of mutants agree well with the in silico predictions. \nThe results of gene tissue associations and the tissue networks are of general interest to biologists.

This general framework is named Abstract Principal Component Analysis (APCA) which is an extension of the classical Principal Component Analysis to abstract operator spaces. This work is motivated by the growing need to facilitate both theoretical modeling and numerical computation with high dimensional complex systems. Modern scientific research often relies on complicated theoretical analysis and heavy computation with high dimensional models and data sets. In many occasions a suitable low dimensional and simplified model with only dominant features will be sufficient to demonstrate most essential properties of the high dimensional counterpart. There are various issues about the feature extraction process, such as identifying most significant information, extracting information in different scale and reconstructing high dimensional signals. The primary focus of this work is the development of a general APCA framework and APCA applications to model reduction problems. This model reduction framework could be utilized as a data driven approach to study mixing dynamics data sets arising from physical problems and informational problems.\n\nThis thesis is organized as follows. First we review some major existing methods for model reduction. Reviewed methods include the classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and some extensions such as Nonlinear PCA and Kernel PCA, Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), ISOMAP, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), Diffusion Map, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Compressive Sensing, Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Principal Interval Decomposition (PID). One particular PCA extension called Generalized Principal Component Analysis (GPCA) is introduced in details since it serves as the foundation for APCA general framework and shares a lot of common features with APCA. The principal and algorithm of each method will be introduced and its applications will be illustrated with examples from existing references. We will also show some experiments using existing methods to solve mode extraction problems. The failure of existing methods on mode extraction is the motivation for us to develop APCA which serves as a universal framework for some mode extraction problems.\n\nThe general APCA framework is developed with a basic setting of Banach algebra including operator elements. Different specializations of APCA solve model reduction problems such as segmenting sample points to linear subspaces and decomposing single wave modes from mixing signals. Mode extraction is implemented in the local single stage pattern when wave motions preserve their characteristic features such as traveling speed and scaling parameters. Basic wave motion types include scaling in the dependent variable (standing wave), scaling in the independent variable (scaling wave) and moving with fixed profile (traveling wave). Complex wave motions include compositions of three basic motion types. Processing schemes for these composition wave modes are consistent with compositions of processing schemes for single wave modes. There is an alternative optimization approach for certain procedures in mode extraction, which are equivalent as procedures in APCA. Synthetic numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of mode decomposition algorithms. Some complex motions are indeed simple single stage motions under certain coordinate transformation and some examples are shown for illustration.\n\nApplications of the APCA model reduction framework are illustrated primarily with those partial differential equations describing wave signal propagation processes, such as the one dimensional Burgers' equation and the two dimensional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation. These equations permit solutions which are approximately superpositions of single independent wave modes. The most discussed wave modes are tanh shape modes for the Burgers' equation and soliton modes for the KP equation. We illustrate decomposition results with comparisons between mixing signals and corresponding decomposed single modes. With mode characteristic parameters and reconstructed mode functions in a short time, long time solution behaviors can be predicted without solving partial differential equations in a long time period.\n\nIn order to investigate independent signal mode information from the global complex mode evolution, we have developed several techniques and some additional processing procedures. The global rigid motion reduction is introduced with some earlier work designed for the purpose of facilitating molecular dynamics simulations. This global rigid motion reduction serves as a preprocessing procedure on the training data. In the presence of noise, mode extraction results involve moderate level of error. Attentions are given to signal processing issues such as independent signal mode number overestimation, mode characteristic parameter estimation error and mode reconstruction error. Mode number selection schemes are used to choose the independent mode number. An optimization approach would provide a more robust processing scheme for solving mode parameters. We use different snapshots as multi-stage mode evolutions and use the mode function alignment as a post-processing procedure to reduce noise effects on mode profiles. Global multi-stage complex motions are approximated with local single stage motions from different subintervals in time. Multi-stage motion parameters are approximated by piecewise constant local single stage motion parameters. Multi-stage complex wave motions are approximated by piecewise single stage motions and the approximation accuracy is determined by comparing the reconstructed snapshots with original given snapshots.\n\nIn the end we present conclusions as well as some processing issues and directions for future studies.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6358], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Tianjiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tianjiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiang Du", "Qiang Du", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov", "Xiantao Li", "Anna L Mazzucato", "Runze Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiang Du, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiang Du, Committee Chair", "Ludmil Tomov Zikatanov, Committee Member", "Xiantao Li, Committee Member", "Anna L Mazzucato, Committee Member", "Runze Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Banach operator algebra", "standing and traveling waves", "signal decomposition", "extraction of transient modes", "abstract principal component analysis", "data mining"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Design and Synthesis of Chiral Ligands and Their Applications in Transition Metal-catalyzed Asymmetric Reactions", "id": "12770", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7031", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Transition metal catalyzed reactions are among the most powerful and direct approaches for the synthesis of organic molecules.  During the past several decades, phosphorous-containing ligands have been extensively studied in transition metal -catalyzed transformations particularly asymmetric hydrogenations.  Development of new chiral ligands and efficient catalyst systems for various prochiral unsaturated substrates in asymmetric hydrogenations are the focus of this dissertation.  An important family of atropisomeric biaryl bisphosphine ligands, C3*-TunePhos and related bisaminophosphines have been designed and synthesized. The Ru catalysts of the highly modular C3*-TunePhos have been proved to be highly efficient (up to 99.8% ee, up to 1,000,000 TON) for practical asymmetric hydrogenations of a wide range of unfunctionalized ketones as well as \u03b1-, \u03b2- keto esters and N-2-substituted allylphthalimides. The synthetic utility of bisaminophosphine ligands was studied for rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenations of \u03b1-dehydroamino acid esters, affording up to 98% ee\u2019s. A new chiral tridentate NNN-type indan-Ambox ligand was designed and synthesized targeting the direct hydrogenation of unfunctionalized aryl and alkyl ketones. Successful examples of unfunctionalized ketone reduction in a enantioselective catalytic pathway display the potential of tridentate ligands in asymmetric catalysis. Another rational design and synthesis of PNP-type bulky chiral tridentate ligand was also fulfilled, yet it failed to provide superior enantioselectivity. To solve the problems of asymmetric hydrogenation of imines and heteroaromatics, a series of Ir- or Pd-based catalyst systems have been developed. Highly enantioselective and highly efficient hydrogenation of N-aryl imine, N-H imines, \u03b2-enamine esters, quinoline derivatives and unprotected indole derivatives have been successfully achieved respectively, with up to 98% ee and 10,000 TON. Catalyst systems containing strongly electron-donating and sterically hindered bisphosphine ligand have displayed significant advantages and will lead to more updated breakthroughs. Other examples of transition metal-catalyzed reactions such as Cu-catalyzed conjugate reduction of cyclic \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketones and Ru-catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution of \u03b1-substituted cyclic ketones have also been investigated.

Ever since the 1970s, interdisciplinary teams have been working in Shale Hills watershed to study a wide range of earth science problems. However, a watershed model was not constructed until Qu and Duffy (2007) proposed the PIHM model. In recent years, the PIHM had a major update by Kumar and Bhatt where they added new flux components to the channel flow, implemented macropore effects, throughfall drainage, evaporation from ground and transpiration from the canopy. At the same time, PIHM was extended to include national databases which are referred to as A-priori data. This research was performed with NSF funding through the Susquehanna River Basin Project, the Critical zone Observatory project and the RTH_NET project. The focus of this thesis is to implement a new version of PIHM at Shale Hills using data sets recently acquired through the Critical Zone Observatory Project. These new data sets include: 3 meter digital elevation data, a new bedrock elevation coverage, the latest soil classification data from SSURGO with site specific extensions to SSURGO made by H. Lin\u2019s group, and the National Land Cover Data distribution dataset. The updated model is calibrated through a trial and error process, using the 1974 artificial irrigation experiment by Lynch et al. The model successfully reproduces the runoff at the watershed outlet during a sequence of 6 rainfall events. It shows that the Horton overland flow and subsurface storm flow are the main drive for the runoff peak in the channel. The model also simulates groundwater levels, recharge, transpiration, etc. The model represents a preliminary calibration which will be implemented in real-time model with current data. Operating the model in real-time will allow the continuous calibration using CZO experimental data and provide feedback to scientists. Finally, Bhatt and Kumar have implemented a GIS interface for PIHM and this was used at Shale Hills for setting up the model new data coverages. A tutorial for the PIHMgis and the PIHM model is included as part of this thesis. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6592], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Wenfang  ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wenfang ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy", "Christopher J Duffy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher J Duffy, Thesis Advisor", "Christopher J Duffy, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["modeling", "Shale Hills", "PIHM"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF GENES REQUIRED FOR MEIOSIS IN ARABIDOPSIS", "id": "6961", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6535", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-09-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Meiotic prophase I is a long and complex phase. Interactions between homologs during meiotic prophase I, such as recombination and synapsis, are required for proper chromosome segregation. Although mutant studies have revealed a number of genes required for recombination and synapsis, few genes have been identified in Arabidopsis. Here I describe the mutant analysis of three Arabidopsis genes that are essential for recombination and synapsis in Arabidopsis: SOLO DANCERS; AtRAD51; and AtRAD51C.\n The solo dancers (sds) mutant was obtained from a collection of Ds-transposon insertional mutants and mutant plants exhibit severe defects in homolog synapsis, recombination and bivalent formation during meiotic prophase I, subsequently resulting in seemingly random chromosome distribution and formation of abnormal meiotic products. Sequence and protein interaction analyses indicate that SDS encodes a novel cyclin (Azumi et al., EMBO J, 2002), arguing strongly that homolog interaction during meiotic prophase I requires a novel meiosis-specific cyclin in Arabidopsis. Because mutation in AtSPO11-1 causes similar abnormal meiosis, we hypothesized that AtSPO11-1 might be one of the downstream or interacting components of the SDS protein. To test this hypothesis, expression of AtSPO11-1 in sds was characterized and meiosis in the sds atspo11-1 double mutant was analyzed. The results indicate that AtSPO11-1 expression is not blocked in sds, and double mutant analysis of sds syn1, sds ask1, and sds atrad51-1 suggests that AtSPO11-1 retains its function in Double stranded DNA breaks (DSB) formation in the sds mutant.\nIn addition to the mutant characterization of sds, I analyzed the T-DNA insertional mutants for the other two genes, AtRAD51 and AtRAD51C.  AtRAD51 is an Arabidopsis homolog of yeast and mammalian RAD51, and AtRAD51C is a RAD51 paralog in Arabidopsis. Reverse genetics was applied to analyze the in vivo function of these two genes. Both mutants exhibit normal vegetative and flower development and have no detectable abnormality in mitosis, suggesting these two genes are not necessary for genome integrity under normal conditions. However, both mutants are completely sterile and are defective in both male and female meiosis. During meiotic prophase I, meiotic chromosomes in these two mutants fail to synapse and become extensively fragmented. The severe fragmentation of meiotic chromosomes in these two mutants can be suppressed or partially suppressed by an atspo11-1 mutation, suggesting that the fragmentation phenotype largely represents a defect in processing DSBs generated by AtSPO11-1. Analysis using electron microscopy of meiosis in these two mutants indicates that atrad51-1 exhibits a more severe abnormality in the formation of synaptonemal complexes (SCs), arguing that although both genes are required for processing of DSBs. Furthermore, major aspects of meiotic recombination seem to be conserved between yeast and plants, especially the fact that chromosome pairing and synapsis depend on the function of SPO11 and RAD51 related genes.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6534], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Wuxing ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wuxing", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy W Mcnellis", "Richard Cyr", "Teh Hui Kao", "Hong Ma"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member", "Richard Cyr, Committee Member", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Hong Ma, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["recombination", "meiosis", "Arabidopsis", "synapsis", "pairing", "solo dancers", "atrad51", "atrad51c"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Evanescent Field Coupled Microdisk Cavities\n\n", "id": "7908", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6679", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-08-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation focuses on studies of spontaneous and stimulated emissions from\nwhispering gallery mode (WGM) (Ga, Al)As/GaAs based microdisk cavities that are\nevanescent field coupled with each other.

We employ molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) to prepare the\nsamples that have epitaxial heterostructures of (Ga, Al)As/GaAs. Then we use cleanroom\nprocessing techniques to fabricate the microdisk devices. We then perform static\nand dynamic optical spectroscopy measurements to investigate their optical properties.\nThe first experiment in this thesis describes external strain engineering of the\nmicrodisk lasers to lower the lasing thresholds. A stressed silicon nitride (SiNx) thin\nfilm was deposited on the microdisk surfaces to provide an external compressive strain.\nLasing thresholds were decided with static light-in light-out intensity plot and charge\nlife time dynamics.\nThe second and third experiment are both about evanescent field coupled microdisk\ncavities. We fabricated three types of twin coupled microdisk cavities: twin\ncircular ones, twin elliptical ones coupled along the long axis and twin elliptical ones\ncoupled along the short axis. Normal mode splitting was observed in these coupled cavities\nwith a lower energy bonding mode and a higher energy antibonding mode. The\nsecond experiment characterizes the mode energy splitting as a function of different\ngeometrical layout, excitation power and ambient temperature. We observed a clear correlation between the mode energy splitting and the splitting mode intensities. The\nmode splitting increases as the intensities increase, and vice versa. This correlation is a\nresult of the evanescent field coupling.\nIn the third experiement, we simulated the electromagnetic field patterns inside\nand outside the twin coupled microdisk cavities.

In contrast to several of the probabilistic approaches in the control literature, we explore the problems' structure, i.e., convexity, to design more efficient algorithms. For a class of design problems which are convex in controller parameters, we introduce stochastic optimization methods to solve them. For a large class of non-convex problems, we provide a new approach which is shown to converge to the desired robust controller. This is accomplished by choosing an appropriate set of intermediate optimization variables at each iteration.

As an unconventional resource, various stimulation techniques including hydraulic fracturing and enhanced gas recovery have been proposed to maximize production. This study examines some of these techniques combining experiments and models. Part I of this dissertation (Chapter 1) examines the use of CO2 for enhanced shale gas recovery (CO2-ESGR) using a dual porosity dual permeability model to better understand its feasibility and effectiveness. Part II (Chapter 2) explores the use of gas stimulants for hydraulic fracturing to assess the form and behavior of fractures in shale driven by different gas compositions and states. Part III (Chapter 3) examines the evolution of permeability in artificially propped fractures in Green River Shale for native CH4 contrasted against sorbing CO2, slightly sorbing N2 and non-sorbing He, specifically to examine the deleterious influence of proppant embedment. Together, the findings of these experiments and analyses aid in the understanding of proppant embedment and fracture diagenesis in shales. Finally, part IV (Chapter 4) examines the role of stress reorienation in aiding productivity increases in the refracturing of previoslu fractured wells in shales to determine the optimal timing of refracturing as well as in quantifying its potential improvement.\nChapter 1 explores the roles of important coupled phenomena activated during gas substitution especially vigorous feedbacks between sorptive behavior and permeability evolution. Permeability and porosity evolution models developed for sorptive fractured coal are adapted to the component characteristics of gas shales. These adapted models are used to probe the optimization of CO2-ESGR for injection of CO2 at overpressures of 0MPa, 4MPa and 8MPa to investigate magnitudes of elevated CH4 production, CO2 storage rate and capacity, and of CO2 early-breakthrough and permeability evolution in the reservoir. For the injection pressures selected, CH4 production was enhanced by 2.3%, 14.3%, 28.5%, respectively, over the case where CO2 is not injected. Distinctly different evolutions are noted for permeability in both fractures and matrix due to different dominating mechanisms. Fracture permeability increased by ~1/3 for the injection scenarios due to the dominant influence of CH4 de-sorption over CO2 sorption. CO2 sequestration capacity was only of the order of when supercritical for a net recovery of CH4 of m3. We investigated the potential of optimal CO2-pulsed injection to enhance CH4 production (absolute mass recovered)-without the undesirable effects of CO2 early-breakthrough and also minimum cost on CO2 injection. This utilizes the competitive sorptive behavior between CH4 and CO2, can also reduce the potential for induced seismicity hence the entire system can be near net neutrality in terms of its carbon and seismic footprint.\n\tIn Chapter 2, fracturing is completed on cylindrical samples containing a single blind axial borehole under simple triaxial conditions with confining pressure ranging from 10~25MPa and axial stress ranging from 0-35MPa ( ). Results show that: 1) under the same stress conditions, CO2 returns the highest breakdown pressure, followed by N2, and with H2O exhibiting the lowest breakdown pressure; 2) CO2 fracturing, compared to other fracturing fluids, creates nominally the most complex fracturing patterns as well as the roughest fracture surface and with the greatest apparent local damage followed by H2O and then N2; 3) under conditions of constant injection rate, the CO2 pressure build-up record exhibits condensation between ~5-7MPa and transits from gas to liquid through a mixed-phase region rather than directly to liquid as for H2O and N2 which do not; 4) there is a positive correlation between minimum principal stress and breakdown pressure for failure both by transverse fracturing ( ) and by longitudinal fracturing ( ) for each fracturing fluid with CO2 having the highest correlation coefficient/slope and lowest for H2O. We explain these results in terms of a mechanistic understanding of breakdown, and through correlations with the specific properties of the stimulating fluids. \nIn Chapter 3, experiments are conducted on 1inch diameter, 2 inch long split cylindrical samples sandwiched with proppant at a constant confining stress of 20 MPa and with varied pore pressure \u2014 increases in pore pressure represent concomitant decreases in effective stress.  Permeability and sorption characteristics are measured by pulse transient methods. To explore the effect of swelling and embedment on fracture surface geometry, we measure the evolution of transport characteristics for different proppant geometries (single layer vs. multi-layer), gas saturation, and sample variance. In order to simulate both production and enhanced gas recovery processes, both injection and depletion cases are investigated. Embedment morphology is measured by scanning white light interferometry and characterized by roughness through a variety of surface roughness parameters including Sa, Sq and Sz as well as complexity through fractal dimension. For both strongly- (CO2, CH4) and slightly-adsorptive gases (N2) the permeability first decreases when gas pressure increases because of swelling. It then increases beyond the Langmuir threshold due to the over-riding influence of effective stresses. Due to its highest adsorptive affinity, CO2 returns the lowest permeability among these three gas permeants. Compared to the case of a mono-layer propped sample, the sample with four layers exhibits less swelling as implied by its elevated k/k0 ratio and reduced embedment surface roughness and complexity. Interestingly the duration of gas exposure and saturation tested here which is up to ~20hrs does not have a significant influence on permeability for either adsorptive or non-adsorptive gases. Permeabilities recovered from both injection and depletion cycles generally overlap each other and are repeatable with little hysteresis. This suggests the dominant role of reversible swelling over irreversible embedment. Permeability variance between different samples is of the order of ~1.5 - 2 times but with repeatable trends and order of magnitude parity. Gas permeant composition and related swelling effects exert important influences on the permeability evolution of shales under nominally in situ conditions.\nIn Chapter 4, key factors include the time dependency of the stress reorientation, the threshold of \u03c3hmax/\u03c3hmin for the presence of the stress reversal region, the influences of permeability anisotropy/heterogeneity, pressure drawdown and rock-fluid properties - these factors are investigated. The results show that stress reorientation develops as soon as the reservoir begins to produce and the stress reversal region extends with time to a maximum extent following which it retracts until the direction of the maximum principal stress gradually returns to the initial state. The optimal refrac timing and the size of the stress reversal region are either positively or negatively correlated to the factors examined here. \u03c3hmax/\u03c3hmin ratio and Poisson\u2019s ratio are negatively correlated to the size of stress reversal region as well as the timing of optimal refracturing; permeability magnitude and porosity have no influence on the size but are negatively and positively correlated to the timing, respectively; permeability anisotropy is positively correlated to the size and negatively correlated to the timing if the permeability is greater in the direction perpendicular the initial fracture, however it is negatively correlated to the size and positively correlated to the timing if the permeability is greater in the direction parallel to the initial fracture; permeability heterogeneity has no influence on the size nor the timing; pressure drawdown and Biot coefficient are positively correlated to the size as well as the timing.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11668], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Xiang ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Derek Elsworth", "Chirs Marone", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Li Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth, Dissertation Advisor", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Chair", "Chirs Marone, Committee Member", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Member", "Li Li, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["enhanced gas recovery", "hydraulic fracturing", "breakdown pressure", "fracture complexity", "adsorption", "swelling", "stress redistribution"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Ultrafast Charge Transfer \u000bin Conventional Solvent \u000band Ionic Liquids\n", "id": "11674", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6648", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-01-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis work is aimed at understanding ultrafast intermolecular electron transfer and solvation processes in conventional solvents and ionic liquids. Following a brief introduction in Chapter 1, Chapter 2 explains the main experimental techniques and data analysis methods used in this thesis. Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 are focused on charge transfer reactions in representative ionic liquids in comparison to conventional solvents. Chapter 5 carefully examines a selected system for studying dynamic heterogeneity studies in ionic liquids. \nCharge transfer is an important step in many types of chemical and biochemical reactions.  The energetics and rates of charge transfer are greatly affected by the polarity and dynamics of the surrounding medium and extensive research has explored the effect of polar solvents on charge transfer.  In contrast, despite the large amount of attention on ionic liquids for many applications, few studies have focused on fundamental aspects of charge transfer ionic liquids.  I have surveyed the behavior of several solvent-controlled intramolecular charge transfer reactions in representative ionic liquids and compared it to what is found for these same reactions in conventional dipolar solvents using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.  \nIn chapter 3, crystal violet lactone (CVL), which exhibits distinct dual emission in fluid solution as a result of a rapid excited-state charge transfer reaction, was measured in series of conventional solvents as background for ionic liquids studies.  Solvatochromic analysis using a dielectric continuum model suggests dipole moments of 9-12 D for the initially excited (LE) state and ~24 D for the charge-transfer (CT) state.  Intensities of steady-state emission as well as kinetic data provide free energies for the LE &#8594; CT reaction that range from +12 kJ/mol in nonpolar solvents to -10 kJ/mol in highly polar solvents at 25 &#61616;C.  Reaction rates constants, which lie in the range of 10-100 ns-1 in most solvents, depend on both solvent polarity and solvent friction.  In highly polar solvents, this charge transfer reaction was confirmed to follow two-state kinetics as used in typical dual fluorescence probes like aminobenzonitriles.  Reaction rates are correlated to solvation times in a manner that indicates the reaction is a solvent-controlled electron transfer on an adiabatic potential surface having a modest barrier.\n\tIn Chapter 4, the charge transfer reaction of CVL was studied in ionic liquids.  Compared with conventional solvents, the reaction is much more complicated. Equilibrium is not reached in any ionic liquid due to the much slower reaction.  Furthermore, in two other well-studied charge transfer probes in several classes of ionic liquids, we also found the reaction kinetics are typically more complicated.  Multi-exponential decays are observed when reaction times are comparable to solvation times, which are on the nanosecond scale in most ionic liquids at room temperature.  Time-resolved spectra were dissected into LE and CT states using non-polar solvents as reference.  Reaction times in ionic liquids calculated from LE/CT decays are slower than in conventional solvents approximately in proportion to the larger viscosities and longer solvation times of ionic liquids \nIn Chapter 5, C102 in the ionic liquid [N4441][Tf2N] was chosen as a promising system to confirm the red edge excitation dependence observed in previous studies using C153 in [Nip311][Tf2N].  We were not able to approach the far red edge of the ionic liquid in the previous study.  This study is also aimed to support the other dynamic heterogeneity observations in ionic liquids. An experimental temperature was first determined to get the complete solvation response function.  Decay data was collected at perpendicular angle for better defined time-resolved spectra.  Normalized time-resolved spectra show no difference with the ones collected at magic angle, which is evidence for using perpendicular angle for future experimental condition.  The asymmetry factor was also fixed when fitting the spectra with log-normal function.  Solvation response function was fitted with stretched exponential function and the frequency at time infinity was found to be important in solvation time calculation.  No significant trend of solvation time dependence on excitation wavelength was observed considering the uncertainty of TCSPC instrumentations.  Other systems or detection system with higher resolution is needed for future studies.\nChapter 6 describes the initial result of an on-going project in our group about the \u201cup-relaxation\u201d behavior of solvation dynamics in slow solvents using nanosecond dye laser.  Only one set of up-relaxtion behavior is observed for now using 4-AP in propanol at -90 &#61616;C.  Spectra exciting at far-edge are still too noisy and need to be improved with other instrumentation skill. Probes with longer lifetime and ionic liquids will be studied in the future in a similar way. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6645], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Xiang  ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiang ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Maroncelli", "Mark Maroncelli", "Tom Mallouk", "John B Asbury", "John H Golbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Maroncelli, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Chair", "Tom Mallouk, Committee Member", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ultrafast Fluorescence Spectroscopy", "Ionic Liquids", "Charge Transfer"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "TOWARD A NEUTRAL ATOM QUANTUM COMPUTER", "id": "10012", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6678", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I will describe an experiment directed toward making a neutral atom quantum computer.

Due to non-stationarity and the large number of unknown parameters, existing\nmethods that are developed for stationary or locally stationary time series are not applicable. Based on a self-normalization technique, we address several inference problems, including self-normalized Central Limit Theorem, self-normalized cumulative sum test for change-point problem, long-run variance estimation through blockwise self-normalization, and self-normalization based wild bootstrap for non-stationary time series. Monte Carlo simulation studies show that the proposed self-normalization based methods outperform stationarity based alternatives. We demonstrate the proposed methodology using two real data sets: annual mean precipitation rates in Seoul during 1771\u20132000, and quarterly U.S.\nGross National Product growth rates during 1947\u20132002. In the literature on change-point analysis, much attention has been paid to detecting changes in certain marginal characteristics, such as mean, variance, and marginal distribution. For time series data with nonparametric time trend, we study the change-point problem for the autocovariance structure of the unobservable error process. To derive the asymptotic distribution of the cumulative sum test statistic, we develop substantial theory for uniform convergence of weighted partial sums and weighted quadratic forms. Our asymptotic results improve upon existing works in several important aspects. The performance of the test statistic is examined through simulations and an application to interest rates data. To model the frequently observed nonstationarity phenomena in social and scientific fields, we propose a class of time-varying exogenous autoregressive models. While the model exhibits nonparametric time-varying dependence structure over a long time span, the model dynamics possess local stationarity within each small time interval. Furthermore, the model can incorporate important external nonstationary inputs to model the main time series of interest. These features allow for theoretical tractability as well as flexible applications. For nonparametric estimation of the coefficient functions, it is shown that the local linear estimation can adapt to the unknown nonstationarity, whereas the local constant estimation is strongly affected by the local stationarity. Some practically important inference and hypothesis testing problems are investigated. To better take into account the nonstationarity and dependence, we propose a sieve-wild bootstrap by combining the ideas from both the sieve and the wild bootstrap.

This dissertation aims at addressing the integrated optimization problems of some critical components in SCM, particularly, for supply- and demand-driven channels in two-stage supply chains. Four specific problems are incorporated in this dissertation.\nThe first problem integrates the decision making process of supplier selection and lot sizing for a manufacturer who orders one type of product from multiple candidate suppliers to fulfill a fixed demand rate. Particularly, we consider the case where suppliers are capacitated and offer a certain type of quantity discount. The product\u2019s perfect rate varies among suppliers and a minimum average perfect rate is required. Besides, in order to facilitate production plans, which are usually made on a daily/weekly/monthly basis, each placed orders is required to cover the demand corresponding to an interval that is multiple of a given time unit. A cyclic order schedule is employed, where the entire planning horizon is divided into repeating order cycles and the set of selected suppliers and corresponding order quantities and frequencies are determined accordingly so that the total cost per time unit is minimized. \nThe second problem is similar to the first one but considers a different discount scheme, where the unit price of a product depends on the total order quantity of a given supplier over a certain period of time, instead of a discount applied to an individual order. Two cases are considered: order quantities are continuous/integer.\nA joint order acceptance and scheduling problem is studied as the third problem, which considers the scenario where a manufacturer receives multiple orders characterized by their revenue, processing time, due date, and tardiness penalty per time unit. The manufacturer can be represented as a single-machine system that adopts a make-to-order strategy. Due to the capacity limitation, the manufacturer cannot accept all the orders and needs to determine the optimal set of acceptable orders and the corresponding production schedule simultaneously such that the total profit is maximized. \nIn the fourth problem, we investigate a real-world application of the integrated optimization of supplier (source) selection and supply planning in the shale gas and oil industry. We aim at assessing a novel fracking approach, called CO2 fracking, from an economic perspective, by considering the collection, supply, transportation, and storage of CO2. More specifically, a CO2 source selection and supply planning problem is defined and discussed from three aspects: CO2 collection and storage at sources, CO2 transportation, and CO2 storage and usage at well pads.\nIn each of the problems included in this dissertation, real-world scenarios and factors are considered, and mathematical models are built to describe the problem. Due to the complexity of these models, existing software packages are either inefficient, difficult, or even impossible to use directly. To address this issue, properties of the models are analyzed. Based on the properties, we customize the solution procedures for each problem which either solve the problem optimally or produce near-optimal solutions. For the latter case, we provide the approach to evaluate the quality of the produced solutions.

Thus it is important to understand how the defect formation energies (DFEs) of all the defects are changed with T and PO2, which is not easily measured experimentally. Density Functional Theory (DFT) is combined with thermodynamics to construct a new methodology to calculate the DFEs ab initio. Rutile TiO2 is chosen as a model material because it is a relatively simple binary system and there is a wealth of existing macroscopic experimental data, such as its dependence of the electrical conductivity on T and PO2, temperature dependent thermal expansion coefficient, etc. \n   Chapter 1 introduces the general method to calculate DFEs, which combines DFT with thermodynamics, including the supercell method to calculate the total energies of defective and pure supercells; the use of Bader analysis to analyze the real space charge distribution, which helps choose a potential alignment method to correct for the artificial interaction caused by periodic boundary conditions, and a thermodynamic approach to extrapolate DFEs to any T and PO2. \n    Chapter 2 discusses the temperature-dependent defect-induced phonon free energy in the harmonic approximation, which gives nontrivial contributions to the DFEs. The temperature dependences of the defect-induced phonon free energies are different from the pure rutile structure, and more importantly they are different for differently charged defects. The physical origin is largely associated with the soft phonon mode at low frequencies for titanium interstitials, while for oxygen vacancies and titanium vacancies the differences in the phonon free energies are caused by the collective contribution from all phonon modes influenced by the introduction of the charged defects. \nChapter 3 points out the necessity of considering the thermal expansion of the materials in the DFE calculation. The differences between harmonic and qusi-harmonic approximations for the phonon free energy and Gibbs free energy calculations are discussed.

In order to minimize CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, sequestration of CO2 in underground geological formations has been considered the most promising alternative to control greenhouse effects. In particular, deep saline aquifers are prime candidates for CO2 sequestration due to their large potential storage capacity and common occurrence. CO2 sequestration in deep saline aquifers can be achieved by several trapping mechanisms which are generally categorized as structural, dissolution, mineral and capillary trapping. Capillary trapping is a physical mechanism by which CO2 is naturally immobilized in the pore spaces of aquifer rocks during geologic carbon sequestration operations, and thus a key aspect of estimating geologic storage potential. It is an important, yet poorly understood trapping mechanism, primarily because of the lack of well characterized, laboratory or field data that could lead to a better understanding of the physical mechanism associated with capillary retention of CO2 in geological media. \nHere, we studied capillary trapping of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2), and the effect of initial scCO2 saturation and flow rate on the storage/trapping potential of Berea sandstone. We performed two-phase, scCO2-brine displacements in two sequential drainage-imbibition core flood cycles to quantify end saturations of scCO2 with the aid of micro-computed tomography imaging. Drainage I led to an average initial scCO2 saturation of 45% after scCO2 injection, and Imbibition I resulted in an average residual scCO2 saturation of 26% after brine injection. In comparison, Drainage II and Imbibition II were performed at higher flow rates and yielded average initial and residual scCO2 saturations of 61% and 31%, respectively. We also analyzed pore size distribution to estimate primary capillary pressure characteristics of the samples under investigation. Overall, we concluded that the initial scCO2 saturation influences the residual scCO2 saturation to a greater extent than the rate of imbibition and therefore, it is a dominant factor in determining the amount of CO2 that can be geologically stored.\nOur study contributes to the research of CO2 capillary trapping in saline aquifers by proposing experimental methods that can mimic deep saline aquifers conditions in the lab, by investigating pore size distribution with high resolution X-ray imaging and, most important, by quantifying the capacity of capillary trapping of CO2 in a brine-CO2-rock system. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8728], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Xinqian ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xinqian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "R Larry Grayson", "Li Li", "Hangsheng Lin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn, Dissertation Advisor", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Chair", "R Larry Grayson, Committee Member", "Li Li, Committee Member", "Hangsheng Lin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supercritical CO2", "carbon sequestration", "capillary trapping", "initial-residual CO2 saturation", "X-ray micro-computed tomography"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "HORMONAL PRODUCTS IN COCKROACH EMBRYOS; \nHOST SPECIFICITY OF ENTOMOPATHOGENIC NEMATODES AND THE EFFECT OF SURFACE COAT PROTEINS FROM NEMATODES ON INSECT IMMUNITY\n\n", "id": "6713", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6634", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nMy thesis is composed of two parts.

JH is produced only after dorsal closure has occurred during embryogenesis.  \nI found that the ratio of dorsal closure to embryo development time was about 45 % of embryogenesis across most cockroach species.  This conservation was linked to reproductive biology of the cockroaches.  Cockroach embryos produced and released both JH and MF across all three reproductive modes.  These include Periplaneta americana, Eurycotis floridana, Blaberus discoidalis, Byrsotria fumigata, Rhyparobia maderae, Nauphoeta cinerea, and Diploptera punctata.  My results suggest that whether the conversion of MF into JH is a rate-limiting step was species specific.  \n\nII\nEntomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) enter insect hosts and release symbiotic bacteria that kill the hosts.  Insects defend against EPNs by cellular immune responses. \nHeterorhabditis bacteriophora and Steinernema glaseri infected and reproduced well in their susceptible hosts.  In susceptible hosts, EPNs were melanized and encapsulated at low percentages and high percentages of EPNs were free-moving.  S. glaseri NC strain was more successful compared to the FL strain in the same hosts.  These results suggest the nematodes elicited immune responses in the hosts that correlated with their infectivity.  The hemocytes from Manduca sexta, a susceptible host, recognized S. glaseri at a low percentage during the first hour post nematode introduction. Different species and strains of EPNs had different SCPs.  The SCPs from S. glaseri suppressed immune responses in the oriental beetle larva Exomala orientalis thus protecting H. bacteriophora from being killed in the same host, as it normally would.  Immuno-suppression was dose-dependent.  Multiple injections of the SCPs protected H. bacteriophora better than single injections.  In a nondenatured state, two isolated SCPs from S. glaseri each conveyed this immuno-suppressive effect.  The two SCPs were composed of smaller proteins when separated on 2D-PAGE.

ECE may provide an effective means of realizing cooling devices for a broad range of applications in both household appliances as well as industrial facilities. Refrigeration based on ECE has the potential of reaching higher efficiency compared with vapor-compression cycle systems. This dissertation focuses on ECE in relaxor ferroelectric polymers, which exhibit large electrocaloric response over a broad temperature range. Various relaxor ferroelectric polymers have been examined in this work, through theoretical considerations, structural analysis and electrical measurements, to explore general rules to develop material systems with giant ECE.\n\nFirst, the background and principle of ECE, along with prototypical materials with notable electrocaloric responses are introduced. It is shown that ECE can be generated in various materials including ceramics (bulk and thin film), polymers, polymer composites, polymer/nanoparticle composites, dielectric fluids and ionic crystals. Compared with other types of materials, poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE))-based relaxor ferroelectric polymers exhibit superior properties in many ways. ECE cooling device has been discussed to derive critical parameters and requirements for designing elctrocaloric materials.\n\nThe electrocaloric performance of relaxor ferroelectric polymers can be predicted and\nunderstood using theoretical guidelines such as thermodynamic analysis, Landau-Devonshire phenomenological theory, coexisting phases rule near invariant critical points. Based on these\nconsiderations, many efforts have been made to tailor material systems in order to generate large ECE response. Specially, defect modifications, such as high energy electron irradiation and copolymerization with monomer with larger size, provide a few facile ways to increase random states and thus improve material properties. To characterize ECE, two different methods, i.e.,indirect measurement and direct measurement are utilized. It should be noted that indirect method would result in a large deviation when used to deduce ECE in relaxor ferroelectrics, due to the non-ergodic nature of relaxors.\n\nHigh energy electron irradiated copolymers are then discussed. The impact of high energy electron irradiation, which reduces dipole correlations and thus increases ECE response of\nP(VDF-TrFE) by introducing defects into the copolymers, is studied in different ferroelectric copolymers. As irradiation dose increases, P(VDF-TrFE) 65/35 mol% copolymer gradually transforms from normal ferroelectric into relaxor ferroelectric material, with dielectric constant peak and ECE response peak shifting from high temperature to room temperature. It is also demonstrated that high energy electron irradiation alleviates hysteresis loss while increases the number of disorder states, therefore, irradiated P(VDF-TrFE) 65/35 mol% copolymer with 20 Mrads shows a large entropy change as high as 130 JKg-1K-1 and large temperature change of 28 \u00b0C. While For P(VDF-TrFE) with high VDF content (>75 mol%), the high energy electron irradiation fails to complete the conversion of these copolymers form normal ferroelectrics to relaxor ferroelectrics. Similarly, for poly(vinylidene chlorotrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-CTFE)) and poly(vinylidene hexafluoropropylene) (P(VDF-HFP)), the impact of irradiation on electrocaloric effect is also feeble.\n\nAnother typical relaxor ferroelectric polymer, the poly(vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene-\nchlorofluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)) tempolymer is elaborated in the following chapter. The influence of uniaxial stretching on electrocaloric and other properties of P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) relaxor terpolymer has been investigated to probe how material preparation process may affect its behaviors. Although dielectric constants are almost identical in the nonstretched and stretched samples, it has been found that ECE response varies upon uniaxial\nstretching. Data reveal that the relaxor terpolymer maintains a high ECE over a broad temperature range, which is in sharp contrast to what observed in the normal ferroelectric polymer where ECE exhibits a sharp peak at ferroelectric paraelectric phase transition temperature. Around 30 \u00b0C, both films shows an adiabatic temperature change DT of 15 \u00b0C under 150 MVm-1. Besides, the directly measured electrocaloric effect and the indirectly measured results P(VDF-TrFE-CFE) terpolymer are compared. The results show that the directly measured \u0394T in the relaxor terpolymer is much larger than that indirectly deduced from Maxwell relation. The large difference between the directly measured \u0394T and that deduced indicates that the Maxwell relation, which is derived for ergodic systems, is not suitable for deducing ECE in the relaxor ferroelectric polymers, which are nonergodic (polar-glass) material systems.\nMoveover, P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)-based composites, e.g., P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)/P(VDF-TrFE) and P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)/ZrO2, are analyzed. It is shown that the electroactive properties, especially ECE, of PVDF-based ferroelectric polymers can be tailored by blending. When P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer content is low in the terpolymer/copolymer composite (<15 wt%), interfacial coupling between the relaxor terpolymer and the nano-phase copolymer increases the crystallinity of the composite, resulting in an enhanced relaxor polarization response and a significant increase in the electrocaloric effect. At high copolymer content, the blends exhibit mixed structures of the two components and ECE gradually decreases as copolymer becomes more dominant. A larger electrocaloric effect is also observed in relaxor ferroelectric terpolymer (P(VDF-TrFE-CFE))/ZrO2 nanocomposites with modest ZrO2 content. The interface effect between the polymer matrix and nano-fillers increases the polarization response and provides additional electrocaloric entropy changes. Furthermore, the internal bias electric field generated in poled blends of P(VDF-TrFE-CFE)/P(VDF-TrFE) is favorable to obtaining higher polarization\nand enhanced ECE. \n\nBesides keeping the effort to develop materials with giant ECE response, future works also need to focus on increasing the thermal conductivity of electrocaloric materials and reducing the driving electric field required for generating large ECE.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9107], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Xinyu ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xinyu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Zhiwen Liu", "Noel Christopher Giebink", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Noel Christopher Giebink, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electrocaloric effect", "relaxor ferroelectric", "polymer blends"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Inventory refill policies analysis models for two-echelon supply chain", "id": "25295", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11242", "abstract_tesi": "There is a growing attention in the world on supply chain management as a new source of potential profits.

With the increase in Pennsylvania\u2019s gas production, the wastewater from gas development has been going up as well. Accordingly, the demand for wastewater disposal facilities should goes up as well. One way to deal with wastewater is to inject it into deep underground through underground injection wells. However, Pennsylvania does not encounter an significant increase in supply of underground injection wells and it currently has less than twenty underground injection wells until 2016 (Johnson, 2015), suggesting an under-capacity in methods for wastewater disposal compared to other states with significant shale gas development under way. This thesis provides information about shale gas development in the last decade (2004-2016) in the United States. \nThis thesis focuses on key questions related to why the underground injection wells used for wastewater disposal from hydraulic fracturing process in Pennsylvania are used far less than other states, such as Ohio, that are also developing natural gas from shale rock formations. The major research question is further broken down into hypothesis about geological aspects, regulatory aspects, and other economic factors. This thesis seeks to identify the possible barriers in front of Pennsylvania\u2019s underground injection development process. If policy makers and other decision makers better understand and consider these barriers, the cost of shale gas development in Pennsylvania might be reduced and the efficiency can be improved (i.e., the state would be in a better position to have the capacity to handle the wastewater it generates, and not impose externalities on other states).\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12301], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Xueyi ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xueyi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural, Environmental and Regional Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Jaenicke", "Charles Abdalla", "Edward Jaenicke"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Jaenicke, Thesis Advisor", "Charles Abdalla, Committee Member", "Edward Jaenicke, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["shale gas", "wastewater", "underground injection well", "Pennsylvania"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Local Modeling For Data With Autocorrelations\n", "id": "7938", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6775", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Motivated by a study on how the levels of air pollutants affect the\nnumber of daily hospital admissions for circulatory and respiratory\nin Hong Kong, we propose new procedures for nonparametric regression\nmodels and varying coefficient models with auto-regressive (AR)\nerrors.

The work investigates the influence of ceria and nickel additions to alumina-supported Rh catalysts for propane steam reforming at low temperatures using different loading levels for ceria and Ni. An optimum loading is found in terms of reforming activity. In this work, 2 wt% Rh and 5 wt% Ni supported on 20 wt% ceria modified alumina exhibits the highest activity. TPR characterization shows ceria and nickel loading can change both the metal-metal and metal-support interactions. Generally, adding ceria makes rhodium oxide easier to reduce, and the presence of rhodium makes ceria easier to reduce, whereas the addition of nickel makes rhodium oxide more difficult to reduce. FE-SEM and XPS results indicate that ceria is highly dispersed on alumina surfaces with ceria loading of less than 20 wt%. Adjusting ceria and nickel loading can change the nanostructures of catalytically active phases, thus influencing the propane reforming rate of Rh catalysts at low temperatures. A kinetic study at different temperatures (450 - 650 \u00b0C) indicates that adding ceria and nickel can greatly increase the propane reforming rates by lowering the activation energies. A kinetic equation based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model was applied to Rh-based catalysts. Results at different partial pressures of propane and steam reveal the addition of ceria can enhance steam and propane adsorption, while the addition of Ni can promote propane adsorption, probably through working with Rh as propane adsorption sites. The kinetic study shows the importance of a balance between steam and propane adsorption.

The false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) is now a widely accepted concept in the context of large scale multiple testing, and the corresponding Benjamini-Hochberg procedure is widely adopted.  We considered problems related to \"multi-dimensional\" multiple testing, when the multiple hypotheses being tested cannot be arranged into a single vector, but rather multi-dimensional structures, such as a matrix in the two-dimensional case. Concrete examples we considered include time-course gene expression studies, multiple comparisons of treatments for gene expression studies, hierarchical tumor classification, etc.. Meta-analysis is also an important topic in statistics. We focused on meta-analysis methods for genomic data with heterogeneity, where the goal is to detect consistent signals across the studies. In this thesis, we explored a weighted multiple testing procedure for meta-analysis, where the significance of the genes are weighted by its degree of heterogeneity; we discussed a two-step hierarchical hypothesis set testing framework for multi-dimensional multiple testing that applies to many of the examples aforementioned; and we developed a meta-analysis method based on weighted ordered p-values that aims at detecting signals in the majority of studies.

Severe disease epidemics have been reported in various regions of the United States, and it has been most prevalent in the northeastern region. Airborne conidia of M. oryzae serve as the major inoculum for the development of disease epidemic that can cause extensive damage on perennial ryegrass turf under favorable environmental conditions. However, the effects of environment on infection, fungal colonization, disease development and conidiation are not fully understood. Therefore, understanding the role of environmental factors on inoculum and disease development of gray leaf spot of perennial ryegrass turf is warranted. \nThe objective of the first study was to determine the effects of intermittent and interrupted leaf wetness periods on incidence and severity of gray leaf spot of perennial ryegrass turf. Results indicated significant effects of wet and dry cycles on disease incidence and severity. Under optimum temperature (28\u00b0C), the highest disease incidence and severity were observed on plants exposed to 18h continuous leaf wetness. The frequencies and durations of dry periods significantly reduced gray leaf spot incidence and severity. Further, strong correlations were found between frequency and duration of dry periods and disease incidence or severity reduction rates. Interruption of leaf wetness durations with longer dry periods significantly reduced gray leaf spot incidence and severity. Additionally, there were negative correlations between the length of interrupted dry periods and gray leaf spot incidence or severity. The relationship was best described by a quadratic model for disease incidence and a linear model for disease severity. Results of this study indicate that turfgrass canopy moisture management strategies may be employed as an important cultural practice as part of a gray leaf spot integrated disease management program in perennial ryegrass turf. \nIn the second study, the effects of relative humidity (RH, 85% to 100%) on infection, colonization, and conidiation by M. oryzae were investigated at 28\u00baC in controlled environment chambers. Results of the study showed that the RH threshold for successful M. oryzae infection was 91% at 28\u00b0C. The fungal biomass from colonized leaf tissue increased with increasing levels of RH. Green fluorescent protein-tagged M. oryzae strains provided a rapid and accurate method for visual and quantitative determination of the fungal colonization. Further, daily conidiation rates were quantified at 88% to 100% RH. The most abundant conidiation of M. oryzae was found at eight days after inoculation at 100% RH. Reduced conidiation was associated with decreased RH, and no conidiation occurred at RH of 91% or lower. This study showed that relative humidity at >90% is required for infection of perennial ryegrass plants by M. oryzae and the subsequent disease development under the favorable temperature regime in the gray leaf spot pathosystem. The results from this research can be integrated to improve the current disease forecasting model. \nThe objectives of the third study were to examine the availability and the dispersal pattern of conidia in the field, and to determine the relationship between certain environmental parameters and the concentration of airborne inoculum. The field monitoring of airborne conidia was conducted in Dillsburg and Leesport, Pennsylvania in 2010 and 2011. Analyses of the air samples indicated that airborne M. oryzae conidia were present at all sampling sites. Average hourly conidia counts indicated that the peak concentration was generally observed during the early part of the day (0500 to 0900 hour). Concurrent occurrence of both high concentration of airborne conidia (>1000 conidia/m3) and favorable environmental condition (percent infection index>90) was always confirmed before the reported disease epidemics which is the important determinant for predicting disease epidemics. Correlation analyses between environmental parameters and conidia concentration indicated that the temperature may be used to forecast initial inoculum availability and humidity levels may be a critical indicator for the hourly conidia concentration. Results of this study will be employed as a component of the current gray leaf spot forecast system based on inoculum level.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8203], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Yinfei ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yinfei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wakar Uddin", "John Edward Kaminski Iii", "Beth Krueger Gugino", "Scott Alan Isard", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wakar Uddin, Dissertation Advisor", "John Edward Kaminski Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "Beth Krueger Gugino, Committee Member", "Scott Alan Isard, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Turfgrass disease management", "Magnaporthe oryzae", "Gray leaf spot", "Perennial ryegrass", "Epidemiology", "Blast disease"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "PURIFICATION OF PLASMID DNA USING ULTRAFILTRATION MEMBRANES", "id": "14303yxl255", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14303", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous studies have demonstrated that plasmid transmission through ultrafiltration membranes can be controlled by adjusting the filtrate flux thereby controlling the extent of plasmid elongation.  This phenomenon can be used for the separation of different plasmid isoforms by exploiting the differences in flexibility of the supercoiled, linear, and open-circular isoforms. However, there are a number of critical challenges that still need to be overcome in order to apply these novel membrane-based processes for commercial scale manufacture of DNA for gene therapy applications and for use as DNA-based vaccines. The overall objectives of this dissertation are to develop novel strategies to enhance the separation resolution during ultrafiltration of different plasmid isoforms and control membrane fouling during ultrafiltration of concentrated DNA solutions.\nThis work first focused on developing the strategy of pre-conditioning, accomplished by pre-elongating the DNA by passage through a region with large pore size, to minimize fouling and enhance DNA separations.  Data were obtained using both asymmetric hollow fiber membranes, with flow in either the normal or reverse orientation, and with composite membrane structures made by placing a larger pore size flat sheet microfiltration membrane in series with an ultrafiltration membrane.  In all cases, flow through the larger pore size region pre-stretched the plasmid, leading to an increase in plasmid transmission and a significant reduction in fouling.  This pre-conditioning also provided a significant increase in selectivity for separation of the linear and supercoiled isoforms.  The performance of composite membrane system can be optimized by controlling the pore size and morphology of the microfiltration membranes.\nThis work also examined the effects of ionic conditions (including solution ionic strength and ion type) on separation of the different plasmid isoforms. The transmission of the linear and open-circular isoforms slightly increased with increasing solution ionic strength (NaCl or MgCl2 concentration) due to shielding of intramolecular electrostatic interactions. The effect of ionic strength was greatest for the supercoiled plasmid due to changes in its plectonemic structure, providing opportunities for enhanced purification of this therapeutically active isoform.  Polycation spermine was found to induce DNA condensation at a threshold concentration, above which transmission of the plasmid DNA dropped rapidly with the membranes becoming nearly completely retentive to the plasmid. DNA condensation was reduced in the presence of high concentrations of monovalent salts, potentially providing an opportunity to \u201ctune\u201d the transmission of the DNA isoforms by proper of addition of spermine and NaCl to the solutions.\nSolution conditions also have a significant effect on the fouling characteristics of supercoiled plasmid DNA isoforms with different numbers of base pairs.  Sieving coefficient and filtrate flux data were analyzed using a model based on the partial blockage of the membrane pores by trapped plasmids.  Fouling increased dramatically at low ionic strength, with the flux decline parameter for the 3.0 kbp plasmid in a 1 mM NaCl solution being an order of magnitude greater than that in a 10 mM solution.  Fouling was also most pronounced for the larger 16.8 kbp plasmid, consistent with the greater probability of plasmid trapping at the pore entrance.  \nUltrafiltration membranes also have the potential to separate supercoiled plasmids based on differences in their size (i.e., number of base pairs). An up to 30-fold selectivity between 3.0 and 16.8 kbp plasmids was achieved using commercial ultrafiltration membranes. The reduction in transmission of the supercoiled plasmids with increasing chain length was a direct result of the morphology of the supercoiled isoform; no significant affect of plasmid size was seen during ultrafiltration of linear versions of the same plasmids. The supercoiled isoforms adopt a branched structure due to the under-twisting of the DNA, with the number of branches increasing, and the DNA transmission decreasing, with increasing chain length. \nIt is anticipated that the results from this study will provide important information needed for successfully implementing UF processes into commercial systems for the large-scale manufacture of therapeutic DNA products.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15358], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney", "Andrew Zydney", "Manish Kumar", "Janna Kay Maranas", "William O Hancock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Manish Kumar, Committee Member", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Membrane", "separation", "plasmid DNA", "bioprocessing", "chemical engineering", "ultrafiltration"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition ZnO thin film transistors for large area circuit applications", "id": "19030", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9180", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis investigates approaches for robust, high-performance thin film transistor (TFT) technology for use in large area electronic applications.  The focus of the work is on oxide semiconductor TFTs and specifically ZnO TFTs.  In previous work, this research group demonstrated high mobility (> 20 cm2/V\u2022s) ZnO thin film transistors (TFTs) and fast circuits on glass and flexible polymeric substrates at 200 \u00b0C using weak oxidant plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD). This thesis extends this foundation to hybrid inorganic/organic circuits with ink-jet printed organic semiconductor TFTs that can provide high-gain analog circuits, double-gate ZnO TFTs that can provide high-gain enhancement/depletion mode amplifiers and low operation voltage circuits, and ZnO TFTs and circuits fabricated using a tri-layer dielectric-semiconductor-dielectric deposition approach with near-zero turn-on voltage, and improved device passivation and stability.\n\nCMOS is an important technology for both digital and analog circuits. In this thesis, an inorganic PEALD n-channel ZnO and organic ink-jet printed p-channel diF-TESADT CMOS has been developed to provide high gain for analog circuits. Ink-jet printed diF-TESADT organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) on Si substrates with a thermally grown SiO2 dielectric had field effect mobility as large as 0.4 cm2/V\uf0d7s. Hybrid organic/inorganic TFT inverters had sub-pA leakage current for both high and low states, high gain (~35), and good logic level conservation.  Bi-functional Al/Au contacts served for both the ZnO TFTs and the diF-TESADT OTFTs, and only 4 lithography steps and 1 ink-jet printing step were used to complete the circuits.  \n\nA double-gate ZnO TFT process was developed to provide flexibility in circuit design. Compared to bottom-gate-only ZnO TFTs, double-gate ZnO TFTs have improved mobility, subthreshold slope, and bias stability. For some applications, the TFT top-gate can be used to adjust the bottom-gate turn-on and threshold voltage. This allows the logic transition point for circuits to be adjusted for low voltage operation. Using this approach, high-gain inverters (gain >100) and low-voltage ring oscillators using double-gate TFTs have been demonstrated.  Double-gate inverters using a depletion mode load device have gain larger than 100. 15-stage double-gate ZnO TFT ring oscillators operate with VDD = 1.5 V, ID = 28 \u00b5A, and a propagation delay of 2 \u00b5s/stage. \n\nFinally, tri-layer PEALD ZnO TFTs were developed to provide improved stability and passivation for ZnO TFTs.  Turn-on and threshold voltage shifts after passivation are common problem for oxide TFTs. Bottom-gate, top-contact tri-layer TFTs use an Al2O3-ZnO-Al2O3 tri-layer deposited in one deposition run that provides protection for the active layer back surface with no extra passivation step.  Compared to conventional passivated (non-tri-layer) ZnO TFTs, these tri-layer devices have similar field effect mobility, but near zero turn-on voltage and improved bias stability. 7-stage ring oscillators operated at 100 ns/stage with a supply voltage 10 V and operated at 3.5 MHz at a supply voltage of 17 V, corresponding to a propagation delay of ~ 27 ns/stage. The developments outlined in this thesis provide a foundation for highly stable ZnO TFTs and high-gain, low operation voltage TFT circuits fabricated at low temperature.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9002], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Yuanyuan ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuanyuan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Suman Datta", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Nelson Jackson, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Chair", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ZnO thin film transistors", "Plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition", "hybrid CMOS", "low-voltage operation circuits", "tri-layer TFTs"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Modeling Pt and Catalyst Layer Degradation in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells", "id": "14270yxl270", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14270", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "       Cost and durability of polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) are two most critical issues faced by commercialization of fuel cells. Cathode catalyst layer (CCL) plays an important role in PEFCs from both aspects of cost and durability. Due to the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at CCL, sufficient Pt-loading is needed at CCL to provide electrochemical surface area (ECA) for the ORR. Meanwhile, a micro-scale oxygen transport resistance through the ionomer film covering the Pt nanoparticles is recently found. Sufficient Pt-loading is also needed at CCL to prevent large micro-scale oxygen transport loss. The cost of the Pt metal could not be reduced by mass production and features largely in the total cost of PEFC stack. At the same time, the Pt catalysis in CCL is inevitable to degrade during the PEFC lifetime, and ECA loss and PEFC performance loss are caused consequently. So using the precious Pt wisely and reducing the Pt degradation are vital challenges to achieve long-term good performance of PEFCs. Based on this, modeling the Pt and catalyst layer degradation in PEFC is urgently needed to understand the fundamental mechanisms of CCL degradation and finding methods to mitigate the CCL degradation.\n       A one-dimensional model is firstly developed and validated to study Pt degradation and subsequent ECA loss through the CCL of PEFCs. The model includes two mechanisms of Pt degradation: Ostwald ripening on carbon support and Pt dissolution-re-precipitation through the ionomer phase. Impact of H2 | N2 or H2 | Air operation, operating temperature, and relative humidity (RH) on Pt degradation during voltage cycling is explored.  It is shown that ECA loss is non-uniform across the CCL with a zone of exacerbated Pt degradation and hence much lower ECA found near the membrane. This non-uniform Pt degradation is caused by consumption of Pt ions by crossover H2 in both H2 | N2 and H2 | Air systems.  An important consequence is that thinning the cathode electrode in a PEFC would lead to more ECA loss as a higher fraction of the thin CCL would fall in this exacerbated degradation zone. We have quantified the effect of thin CCLs on Pt degradation for the first time.\n       The micro-scale oxygen transport resistance significantly complicates the consequence of Pt degradation. It is found that this micro-scale oxygen resistance increases with ECA normalized current density. So as the ECA in CCL losses during the Pt degradation, it not only induces higher ORR kinetic losses, but also causes extra voltage loss by increasing the micro-scale transport resistance. To elucidate this complicated issue, the 1D physics-based Pt degradation submodel is coupled into the transient M2 model to study the non-uniform Pt degradation and its impacts on long-term PEFC performance. The performance loss of a low Pt-loading PEFC with Pt degradation, the interactions of Pt degradation with the micro-scale transport resistance, the cause and consequence of non-uniform Pt degradation, as well as a strategy of raising lower current density in current cycling test are quantified. This Pt degradation model is demonstrated to be an effective approach to better understand Pt degradation, performance loss caused by Pt degradation, and mitigation strategies to alleviate Pt degradation, all important for achieving excellent durability of PEFCs.\n       The non-uniform Pt degradation in the channel-land direction is well predicted by the transient physics based Pt degradation model. However, further application of this method is limited by computational cost. On the other hand, the along-channel non-uniform ECA distribution can cause non-negligible effect on end-of-life (EOL) performance of PEFC compared with uniform ECA distribution when the cathode Pt-loading of the PEFC is low. Thus capturing the along-channel non-uniform Pt degradation is essential to predict the EOL performance of PEFC. In this dissertation, an empirical model for Pt degradation is developed and integrated into M2 model to predict the along-channel non-uniform Pt degradation and the EOL performance of low Pt-loading PEFCs. This method is first applied on 3D single channel PEFC modeling case. The shift of current density distributions, and the critical role of micro-scale oxygen transport loss during the degradation for low Pt loading PEFCs are also discussed with this model. Then, this modeling method is applied on a medium scale PEFC modeling case to demonstrate its future applicability to realistic industrial PEFC regarding to EOL performance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14932], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Yubai ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "first_name_ssi": "Yubai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chao-Yang Wang", "Chao-Yang Wang", "Donghai Wang", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chao-Yang Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Chao-Yang Wang, Committee Chair", "Donghai Wang, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells", "Durability", "Catalyst Degradation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "ADAPTIVE INFORMATION EXTRACTION FROM COMPLEX SYSTEMS VIA SYMBOLIC TIME SERIES ANALYSIS", "id": "kd17cs845", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13026", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation represents a framework for adaptive information extraction from complex systems via symbolic time series analysis (STSA). The key idea for STSA is to convert original time series of digital signals into a sequence of (spatially discrete) symbols from which embedded dynamic information can be extracted and analyzed. The main challenges are: 1) selection of symbol alphabet size; 2) identification of partitioning locations in signal space of time series; and 3) dynamic modeling of symbol sequences to extract embedded temporal patterns. In this context, probabilistic deterministic finite-state automata (PDFA), a special class of\nHidden Markov models (HMMs), are used to learn the temporal patterns embedded in symbol sequences. A novel unsupervised symbolization algorithm is developed to construct PDFA models from time series by maximizing the mutual information measurement between symbol set and state set. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach can capture the underlying dynamic information of time series more effectively than existing unsupervised symbolization methods such as equal frequency partition and equal width partition. In order to evaluate the information dependence and causality between two time series, a special class of PDFAs, called \u00d7D-Markov (pronounced as cross D-Markov) machines, is adopted in this dissertation. To quantify the information flow from one time series to the other, an information-theoretical measurement derived from the concept of transfer entropy is introduced.\nIn this dissertation, the proposed STSA approaches are adapted and applied to three different types of complex systems for different purposes. The first is state estimation and parameter identification for SISO systems via symbolic dynamic modeling of synchronized input-output time series. By considering input-output jointly instead of system output alone, the proposed data-driven approach has ability to provide robust results under fluctuating or varying input patterns. To overcome the deficiencies of solely model-based filtering and those of solely data-driven approaches, the estimation framework is constructed based on a model-based recursive Bayesian estimator combined with a data-driven measurement model. The second type of system under investigation is a large-scale sensor network. The problem is to identify and locate useful information under a dynamic ambient noise from the environment, which impacts each individual sensor differently. In general, the changes in a dynamic environment may significantly affect the performance of pattern recognition due to limited training scenarios and the assumptions made on signal behavior under a static environment. Both symbol level and feature-level fusion schemes are proposed to evaluate the information content of sensor nodes. The third research topic is dimensionality reduction of high dimensional data (e.g., video) for information extraction. The main challenge is to develop feature extraction and information compression algorithms with low computational complexity such that they can be applied to real-time analysis of video (i.e., a sequence of image frames) captured by a high-speed camera. In the proposed method, the sequence of images is converted to a sequence of symbols where embedded dynamic characteristics of the physical process are preserved.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12104], "author_name_tesi": "Li, Yue ", "last_name_ssi": "Li", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yue", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Asok Ray", "Asok Ray", "Christopher Rahn", "Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Shashi Phoha", "Minghui Zhu", "Thomas Wettergren"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Asok Ray, Dissertation Advisor", "Asok Ray, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Hosam Kadry Fathy, Committee Member", "Shashi Phoha, Outside Member", "Minghui Zhu, Outside Member", "Thomas Wettergren, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Symbolic time series analysis", "Hidden Markov modeling", "Pattern recognition", "Finite-state Automaton", "Information Fusion", "Sensor  Networks", "Battery SOC estimation", "Battery SOH estimation", "Recursive Bayes Filter", "Image processing"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "In/From the Art of Wenda Gu and Trinh T.

I argue that at root, transnationalism represents a different approach towards difference, an approach that negates binary thinking and promotes permeable subjectivity. Positioning myself simultaneously as an art critic and an art educator, I interpret the art by Gu and by Trinh from a transnational perspective, and analyze their common features, which include nomadism, dialogism, liminality, and border-crossing. Guided by three principles to approach artworks pedagogically, I propose that the pedagogy in a transnational model of education and art education needs to demonstrate these qualities: dialogism, hybridity, nomadism, reflectivity and reflexivity, fluid subjectivity, the view of difference as surmountable, and a goal to cultivate world citizens.\n\nThis study not only offers an alternative in defining transnational individuals and transnationalism and transnationality, it also introduces the transnational artists and their artworks into the art classroom and identifies the characteristics of a transnational pedagogy.
