Photorefractivity has been utilized in many important applications including high density optical data storage, image processing (correlation, pattern recognition), spatial light modulation, phase conjugation, optical limiting, simulations of neural networks and associative memories, and programmable optical interconnections. They have been investigated, theoretically and experimentally, in this thesis, in the contexts of stimulated orientational scattering and photorefractivity in liquid crystals.\nStimulated orientational scattering (SOS) is a unique optical wave-mixing phenomenon that a scattered noise beam, generated by liquid crystal director oscillation, gets amplified through its interaction with the transmitted beam and liquid crystal director reorientation grating under an intense laser illumination. In this research work, I developed the first steady-state SOS theory without the compromise of non-pump-depletion approximation and it showed good agreement with previous experimental results. Based on the prediction of the developed theory, I successfully implemented polarization conversion in the infrared wavelength regime (1.55 \u0192\u00ddm) and the experimental observations agree well with the numerical simulation. The control of external low frequency AC electric field to the stimulated orientational scattering was experimentally investigated as well. \nFurthermore, I investigated the dynamics of this liquid crystal director reorientational process by analyzing the Fourier spectrum of the stimulated signal under various input laser intensity. The influence of the modulating AC field to the stimulated signal was also studied. The oscillating frequency of the liquid crystal director grating agreed with theoretically calculated characteristic frequency when the input laser intensity exceeds the threshold value.\nIn addition, I have theoretically and experimentally studied the photorefractivity in nematic liquid crystals. Based on the transport band model, the generated space charge field was developed and showed the similar spatial distribution as the illuminating optical field. With the help of an externally applied DC field, the space charge field is able to induce liquid crystal director reorientation and analytical solutions have been derived for both the director reorientational angle and the resulting refractive index grating. The relationship between the first order diffraction efficiency and various material parameters has been discussed in details and shown to be in good agreement with experimental observations. Single-wall carbon nanotube doped nematic liquid crystal films showed a big increase in the effective optical nonlinearity compared with previous reported result in C60 doped photorefractive liquid crystals. The generation of the diffractive grating in the pure and Methyl-red doped liquid crystal has also been theoretically studied and the absence of the two-beam amplification has been explained as well.\nIn the last, this investigation in the optical wave-mixing and photorefractivity in liquid crystal is concluded and the future works are proposed.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2941], "author_name_tesi": "Ding, Jianwu ", "last_name_ssi": "Ding", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jianwu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Iam Choon Khoo", "Kultegin Aydin", "Ruyan Guo", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Mark Maroncelli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Iam Choon Khoo, Committee Chair", "Kultegin Aydin, Committee Member", "Ruyan Guo, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nonlinear optics", "photorefractivity", "liquid crystals", "stimulted scattering"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Systems theoretic approach to textured image and video processing\n", "id": "7906", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6322", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Control Theory and Image Processing are all exciting research areas with great power for the applications to wide fields. There are many common methods in system analysis, design and development in these two different fields. The progress of these two area also shows that the techniques developed to solve the problems of one area often find applications to the other one.\n\nThe theme of this dissertation is systems theoretical approach to textured image processing and video processing. It is an attempt to setup and solve the textured image processing problem from a viewpoint of control, especially the study of robust identification and robust control theory. The work focus on texture modelling, synthesis, recognition and classification. A novel image modelling and model reduction approach is introduced. It is shown how recently developed robust identification techniques can be applied to find models for textures which are capable of image compression and reconstruction. On the other hand, video inpainting problem is addressed under a framework combining Local Linear Embedding (LLE), Rank Minimization Interpolation (RMI) and Radial Basis Function (RBF) Mapping, leading to a simple, computationally attractive, dynamic video inpainting algorithm. Proceeding along the same lines, rank based approaches are proposed to solve event detection and track matching problem.\n\nThe contribution of this dissertation can be viewed both as theoretical and practical: It provides answers to the robust identification of 2-D discrete, quarter causal, shift invariant systems that have a periodic impulse response, which is also of great practical interest in image processing, distributed systems and so on. Moreover, by introducing rank minimization algorithm, a new solution is provided to the problem of video inpainting, which can deal with video inpainting under the conditions of non--periodic target motions, non--stationary backgrounds and moving cameras. Finally, with the idea to detect dynamics changes by parsing it into segments according to the complexity of the model required to explain the observed data, a rank based approach is introduced to solve track stitching and dynamic event detection in a unified way.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6322], "author_name_tesi": "Ding, Tao ", "last_name_ssi": "Ding", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mario Sznaier", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa", "Octavia I Camps", "Qian Wang", "William Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mario Sznaier, Committee Chair", "Constantino Manuel Lagoa, Committee Chair", "Octavia I Camps, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Committee Member", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["video processing", "image processing", "texture", "control theory", "Systems theory", "computer vision"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A Fresh Look At Data Locality On Emerging Multicores  And Manycores", "id": "22506", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10288", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The emergence of multicore platforms offers several opportunities for boosting ap- plication performance. These opportunities, which include parallelism and data locality benefits, require strong support from compilers as well as operating sys- tems. However, architectural abstractions relevant to memory system are scarce in current programming and compiler systems. In fact, most compilers do not take any memory system specific parameter into account even when they are perform- ing data locality optimizations. Instead, their locality optimizations are driven by rule-of-thumbs such as \u201cmaximizing stride-1 accesses in innermost loop positions\u201d. There are a few compilers that take cache and memory specific parameters into account to look at the data locality problem in a global sense.\nOne of these parameters is the on-chip cache hierarchy, which determines the core connection and thus data sharing between computations on different cores. Another parameter is the memory controller. In a network-on-chip (NoC) based multicore architecture, an off-chip data access (main memory access) needs to travel through the on-chip network, spending considerable amount of time within the chip (in addition to the memory access latency). In addition, it contends with on-chip (cache) accesses as both use the same NoC resources. The third parameter that will be discussed in this thesis is the row-buffer. Many emerging multicores employ banked memory systems and each bank is attached a row-buffer that holds the most-recently accessed memory row (page). A last-level cache miss that also misses in the row-buffer can experience much higher latency than a cache miss that hits in the row-buffer. Consequently, optimizing for row-buffer locality can be as important as optimizing for cache locality.\nMotivated by this, in this thesis, we propose four different compiler-directed \u201c locality\u201d optimization schemes that take these parameters into account. Specifi- cally, our first scheme targets cache hierarchy-aware loop transformation strategy for multicore architectures. It determines a loop iteration-to-core mapping by\niii\ntaking into account application data access pattern and multicore on-chip cache hierarchy. It employs \u201ccore vectors\u201d to exploit data reuses at different layers of cache hierarchy based on their reuse distances, with the goal of maximizing data lo- cality at each level while minimizing the data dependences across the cores. In case of dependence free loop nest, we customize our loop scheduling strategy, which, on the other hand, determines a schedule for the iterations assigned to each core, with the goal of reducing data reuse distances across the cores. Our experimental evaluation shows that the proposed loop transformation scheme reduces miss rates at all levels of caches and application execution time significantly, and when sup- ported by scheduling, the reduction in cache miss rates and execution time become much larger.\nThe second scheme explores automatic data layout transformation targeting multithreaded applications running on multicores (which is also cache hierarchy- aware). Our transformation considers both data access patterns exhibited by dif- ferent threads of a multithreaded application and the on-chip cache topology of the target multicore architecture. It automatically determines a customized memory layout for each target array to minimize potential cache conflicts across threads. Our experiments show that, our optimization brings significant benefits over state- of-the-art data locality optimization strategies when tested using 22 benchmark programs on an Intel multicore machine. The results also indicate that this strat- egy is able to scale to larger core counts and it performs better with increased data set sizes.\nIn the third scheme, focusing on multithreaded applications, we propose a compiler-guided off-chip data access localization strategy, which places data el- ements in the memory space such that an off-chip access traverses a minimum number of links (hops) to reach the controller that handles this access request. We present an extensive experimental evaluation of our compiler-guided optimization strategy using a set of 12 multithreaded application programs under both private and shared last level caches. The results collected emphasize the importance of optimizing the off-chip data accesses.\nThe fourth scheme presents a compiler-directed row-buffer locality optimization strategy. This strategy modifies the memory layout of data to increase the number of row-buffer hits without increasing the number of misses in the on-chip cache hierarchy. We implemented our proposed optimization strategy in an open-source compiler and tested its effectiveness in improving the row-buffer performance using a set of multithreaded applications.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9967], "author_name_tesi": "Ding, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Ding", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Padma Raghavan", "Dinghao Wu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Dinghao Wu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Data Locality", "Multicore", "Manycore", "Compiler", "Loop"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Acoustic tweezers: manipulating cells in microfluidics", "id": "18717", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8928", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Techniques that can noninvasively and dexterously manipulate cells and other bioparticles (such as organisms, DNAs, proteins, and viruses) in a compact system are invaluable for many applications in life sciences and medicine. Historically, optical tweezers have been the primary tool used in the scientific community for bioparticle manipulation. Despite the remarkable capability and success, optical tweezers have notable limitations, such as complex and bulky instrumentation, high equipment costs, and potential damage to cells. To overcome the limitations of optical tweezers and other particle manipulation methods, we have developed a series of acoustic-based, on-chip devices called acoustic tweezers that can manipulate cells and other bioparticles using sound waves. The power density required by our acoustic device is 10,000,000 times less than that of optical tweezers, which renders the technique noninvasive and amenable to miniaturization. Cell viability, proliferation, and apoptosis assays are also conducted to confirm the non-invasiveness of our technique. The simple structure/setup of these acoustic tweezers can be integrated with a small radio-frequency power supply and basic electronics to function as a fully integrated, portable, and inexpensive cell-manipulation system. \nIn this dissertation, we demonstrated an acoustic tweezers platform that can achieve the following functions: 1) trap and dexterously manipulate single microparticle, cell, and entire organism (i.e., C. elegans) along a programmed route in two-dimensions within a microfluidic chip; 2) dynamically tune the cell patterning in microfluidic channel; 3) precisely sort cell into five separate outlets in one step, rendering it particularly desirable for multi-type cell sorting; and 4) achieve high-efficiency (>95%) separation of human leukemia cells (HL-60) and human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) from human blood cells. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8768], "author_name_tesi": "Ding, Xiaoyun ", "last_name_ssi": "Ding", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaoyun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jun Huang", "Jun Huang", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Corina Stefania Drapaca", "Qiming Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jun Huang, Dissertation Advisor", "Jun Huang, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Corina Stefania Drapaca, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microfluidics", "surface acoustic wave", "cell manipulation", "lab on a chip", "acoustics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Modern Control System Design for Hydro-power Plant\n", "id": "11831", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6642", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis addresses dynamic model and advance controller design for entire Hydro-power plant.

Other factors, such as ease of verification and validation of individual cores (as compared to complex unicore architectures) and the ability to exploit both thread level (coarse grain) and instruction level (fine grain) parallelism, also boost trends towards chip multiprocessing.\n\nWhile CMPs have already made their way into the commercial market, software support for CMPs is still in its infancy, and is expected to be the main roadblock to the effective use of CMPs. As the number of processor cores is expected to keep increasing, how to fully utilize the abundant computing resources on CMPs becomes a critical issue. Two possible ways of exploiting CMPs include a single application scenario and a multiple application scenario. In the first case, the entire CMP is dedicated to a single application at a time. This option can be effectively exploited by applications that are getting increasingly complex and data intensive (particularly large codes from scientific computing, database and embedded image/video processing domains), unless the number of cores on the chip is increased beyond a certain count. In the multi-application scenario, which is also called multi-tasking, multiple (independent) applications are executed on the CMP at the same time. This is expected to be an important alternative at least in the short term\nespecially for applications that have limited parallelism.\n\nParallelization has been studied for many years since the invention of the first parallel machine. However, there are still a lot of open questions to be solved such as compiler-based automatic parallelization. The multi-core era brings new challenges into the research scope of parallel architecture and applications. For example, resources on a single chip such as caches and inter-connections are now shared by multiple processing elements, which is not the case for traditional parallel or distributed systems.\n\nMotivated by these observations, this dissertation work focuses on how to adapt application executions dynamically to improve the energy-efficiency and quality-of-service by utilizing the application level characteristics in the resource management. There are two major reasons to study the dynamic adaptations of applications. First, an application can have different characteristics and computing requirements during different phases of computations. Second, future computer architecture will have parameter variations and heterogeneity due to process variations or heterogeneous system design. My work investigates dynamic application adaptations, the partition of processors cores among multiple applications, and different thread scheduling schemes for both threads of the same application and threads across concurrently-running independent applications.\n\nPerformance has been the most important metric for computing in the past. This has been changed recently as optimization metrics other than performance are becoming increasingly important. These metrics include availability and energy efficiency among others. In many execution scenarios where CMPs are involved, satisfying multiple metrics (e.g., achieving high availability and low energy consumption) can be critical. In the first half of this dissertation, several approaches are studied to adapt the application executions at runtime in order to improve the energy efficiency. Different metrics are used with an emphasis on the tradeoff between performance and energy consumptions. Helper threads are proposed to collect characteristics of the application execution threads and to determine the ideal resource allocation schemes.\n\nManaging quality of service (QoS) and providing service differentiation have drawn a lot of research interest recently, especially as CMPs become prevalent and virtualization environments are widely deployed. The lack of quality assurance on CMPs has become a major concern because concurrently-executing applications or even threads for the same application can compete arbitrarily on shared resources such as cores, shared caches, and off-chip memory bandwidth. Various hardware resource partitioning/reservation schemes have been discussed in the literature. In the second half of this dissertation, a software approach is investigated for QoS by dynamic tuning the time-slices of multi-application workloads in time-sharing operating systems. In order to satisfy the QoS requirements specified by users, a formal feedback control framework is built to dynamically tune the process nice values and associated CPU time-slices for simultaneously running applications. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can successfully track the quality of service targets and provide service differentiation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6746], "author_name_tesi": "Ding, Yang ", "last_name_ssi": "Ding", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Padma Raghavan", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Qian Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Dissertation Advisor", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Chair", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Qian Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dynamic resource management", "runtime system", "Chip Multiprocessors", "energy-efficiency", "QoS"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Multi-Criteria Multi-Period Supplier Selection and Order Allocation Models", "id": "22374", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9842", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis considers the use of multi-criteria optimization methods applied to supplier selection and order allocation problem over a planning horizon under multiple sourcing strategy.

It allows mice to have constant access to nicotine yet not be forced at any time to consume the drug, features which appear to resemble human tobacco use. However, despite its use as a model of human smoking initiation, there are many issues about the interpretation of free-choice nicotine experiments that have yet to be resolved. For example, it is unclear to what extent mouse nicotine drinking is stimulated by the rewarding psychoactive properties of the drug.\n     In order to gain a better understanding of the motivations underlying mouse nicotine drinking, I attempted to identify predictors of voluntary oral nicotine consumption in C57BL/6J (B6) mice. I reasoned that if influences other than drug seeking have a prevailing effect on mouse nicotine drinking, then the potential role of the reward value of nicotine in the behavior is reduced. In order to evaluate the voluntary oral nicotine consumption method as a model of human tobacco use, I assessed the import of these other potential influences on nicotine drinking using commonly accepted parameters of validity.\n     The first study investigated the effect of the availability of nicotine, concentration of nicotine solution, and prior experience with high or low concentrations of nicotine solutions on B6 nicotine drinking. It was found that adding a second nicotine bottle to a mouse\u2019s cage significantly increased nicotine consumption (doubling it in many cases). It was also observed that mice displayed less preference for nicotine solutions as the concentration of those solutions increased, yet mice consumed a larger daily dose from high-concentration nicotine solutions. Finally, it was found that previous experience with elevated concentrations of nicotine served to suppress intake at lower concentrations. This last result was confirmed in the second study, where it was found that adult and adolescent mice displayed suppressed consumption of a low concentration (25 \u00b5g/mL) of nicotine after voluntary consumption of a high concentration (200 \u00b5g/mL). Adolescent mice also displayed suppression of 25 \u00b5g/mL nicotine after voluntary consumption of a moderately-high concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL. Suppression in a subset of adult mice after exposure to 200 \u00b5g/mL persisted for up to 12 days.\n     In the third study, voluntary oral nicotine consumption over a period of 20 days in adult B6 mice was observed. In a subgroup of mice, the association between initial orosensory response to nicotine in brief-access tests and long-term consumption of nicotine was examined. There was no association, but also there were no concentration-dependent changes in lick rate seen in the brief-access tests. It was found that voluntary oral nicotine consumption over a 20-day period was unstable unless position bias was taken into account, and that the degree of position bias displayed by B6 mice was itself a significant predictor of oral nicotine consumption.\n     The results of these experiments suggest caution should be taken when attempting to employ voluntary oral nicotine consumption as a model of human tobacco use. They indicate that environmental influences (e.g. availability, drug concentration, prior exposure history) and habitual mouse behavior play a large part in determining the amount of nicotine B6 mice consume in a free-choice nicotine experiment, and thus the contribution of nicotine seeking to that consumption is unclear. Future work should strive to elucidate the role of the hedonic value of nicotine in mouse nicotine drinking.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8756], "author_name_tesi": "Dingman, Marc Adam", "last_name_ssi": "Dingman", "middle_name_ssi": "Adam", "first_name_ssi": "Marc", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David John Vandenbergh", "Byron C Jones", "Laura Klein", "Erica Unger", "David A Blizard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David John Vandenbergh, Dissertation Advisor", "Byron C Jones, Committee Member", "Laura Klein, Committee Member", "Erica Unger, Committee Member", "David A Blizard, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["free-choice nicotine", "nicotine drinking", "voluntary oral nicotine", "oral self-selection", "2-bottle choice"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Real Estate, Industry Structure, and Shareholder Value", "id": "18714", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8815", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent studies suggest that real estate ownership by non-real estate firms negatively affects shareholder value. If this is indeed the case, then why do most of these firms elect to own substantial amounts of real estate? Borrowing from the industrial organization (IO) literature on capacity entry deterrence strategies, I argue that industry structure affects the impact of real estate ownership and shareholder value. Production capacity expansion often requires substantial real estate investment. In competitive industries where potential benefits from excess capacity strategies are competed away, firms saddled with substantial amounts of real estate are likely to suffer a value discount. On the other hand, since investments in additional capacity may insulate profit margins by deterring new entries, investors are likely to have a more favorable view of real estate ownership by firms operating in concentrated industries.\n\nAn important consideration is the concept of strategic (firm-specific) vs. generic real estate. Generic real estate is any real estate that can easily be deployed for other uses and therefore has a high resale value. A typical example is office space. In contrast, strategic real estate serves specific needs of the owner and, as a result, trades in thinner markets. Investments in strategic real estate therefore represent credible long-term commitment to the industry. Unlike generic real estate, strategic real estate is mostly owned. Real estate investments that are part of capacity strategies are more likely to be of that type.\n\nThe study provides  empirical evidence on the relation between real estate and shareholder value through a comprehensive dataset spanning the 40-year period ending in 2010. Using a stock portfolio formation technique, it shows that the documented negative impact of real estate ownership on shareholder value is specific to competitive industries. On the contrary, in concentrated industries, real estate ownership does not necessarily have an adverse effect on firm value. This finding is robust to alternative measures of real estate ownership and industry classifications. Additionally, controlling for industry structure alleviates the crucial identification problem between real estate ownership and stock returns noted in previous studies.\n\nNext, the study examines the effects of real estate ownership on stock risk at the firm level. This analysis comprises the estimation of firm level risk exposure yearly and the extent of cross-sectional variation explained by real estate ownership and industry structure. The final section of the paper analyzes the determinants of real estate ownership by non-real estate firms. In addition to the usual factors identified in the literature, it examines the contributions of market power and industry structure.  This study is the first to highlight the potential role of industry structure in the impact of real estate ownership on shareholder value; thereby identifying a channel for further research.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8662], "author_name_tesi": "Diop, Moussa ", "last_name_ssi": "Diop", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Moussa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brent William Ambrose", "Brent William Ambrose", "Austin Jay Jaffe", "N Edward Coulson", "Jiro Yoshida", "Quanwei Cao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brent William Ambrose, Dissertation Advisor", "Brent William Ambrose, Committee Chair", "Austin Jay Jaffe, Committee Member", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member", "Jiro Yoshida, Committee Member", "Quanwei Cao, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Real Estate", "Shareholder Value", "Stock Returns", "Industry Structure", "Product Market Competition", "Asset Specificity"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "THE DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF AN INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE PRESERVICE TEACHERS\u2019 SELF-EFFICACY IN REGARD TO THE TEACHING OF SCIENCE AS INQUIRY", "id": "6236", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3696", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to develop, validate and establish the reliability of an instrument that measures preservice teachers\u2019 self-efficacy in regard to the teaching of science as inquiry.  The instrument (TSI) is based upon the work of Bandura, Riggs, and Enochs & Riggs (1990).  The study used Bandura\u2019s theoretical framework in that the instrument uses the self-efficacy construct to explore the beliefs of prospective elementary science teachers with regards to the teaching of science through inquiry: specifically, the two dimensions of self-efficacy beliefs defined by Bandura: personal self-efficacy and outcome expectancy. Self-efficacy in regard to the teaching of science as inquiry was measured through the use of a 69-item Likert scale instrument designed by the author of the study.  A 13-step plan was designed and followed in the process of developing the instrument. \n\tTo develop the instrument, the researcher first defined the construct to be measured, self-efficacy, as well as a content matrix to represent the five essential elements of classroom inquiry.  Second, eighty-one draft Likert type items for the instrument were prepared with at least three representations of each cell in the Essential Elements of Classroom Inquiry matrix.  These draft items were modeled after those composing the STEBI A and STEBI B (Riggs, 1988; Enochs & Riggs 1990).  This version of the TSI instrument was given to a panel of reviewers that consisted of experts within the field of science education and self-efficacy research.  Feedback from the panel was then used to revise Version 1 of the instrument.\nFollowing this revision, a ninety-four item instrument was drafted.  This version, Version 2, was also reviewed by the panel of experts.  Feedback from the reviewers was collected by the researcher and then analyzed.  This same process of content and construct validity was conducted through eight versions of the TSI to ensure clarity and comprehension. \nVersion 7 of the instrument was administered to the approximately 200 prospective elementary teachers in the Elementary-Kindergarten Education Program (EK ED) at The Pennsylvania State University in the beginning of the Fall semester of 2003.  The participants were enrolled in six sections of SCIED 458: Teaching of Science in the Elementary School.  This group of participants represented the intended population for the final instrument.  Item analysis was performed with the following goal: \nWhat is the most reliable and valid combination of items to compose the TSI for the purposes of assessing preservice elementary teachers\u2019 self-efficacy in regard to the teaching of science through inquiry, and the two dimensions of self-efficacy: personal self-efficacy and outcome expectancy? \n\nThe data obtained from administering Version 7 of the instrument to the SCIED 458 classes was then used to develop Version 8.  Version 8 was also administered to the same group of preservice elementary teachers during the week of December 1, 2003.  Although the actual content of the first draft was not changed as a result of data analysis, aesthetic revisions were made to enhance the ease with which a participant completed the instrument.\nUsing the results from Chronbach Alpha and Analysis of Variance, a 69- item instrument was found to achieve the greatest balance across the construct validity, reliability and item balance with the Essential Elements of Classroom Inquiry content matrix.  Based on the standardized development processes used and the associated evidence, the TSI appears to be a content and construct valid instrument, with high internal reliability for use with prospective elementary teachers to assess self-efficacy beliefs in regard to the teaching of science as inquiry.  Further study of the instruments construct validity is recommended.  Norming the TSI may provide some insights and will provide additional information on the TSI that will be useful to users.  Additionally, development of a form of the TSI for practicing elementary teachers should be pursued. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3676, 3677], "author_name_tesi": "Dira-Smolleck, Lori Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Dira-Smolleck", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Lori", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carla Zembal Saul", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Debra M Freedman", "Kathleen Anderson Sillman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Chair", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Chair", "Debra M Freedman, Committee Member", "Kathleen Anderson Sillman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Elementary Science Teaching", "Scientific Inquiry", "Science Teaching", "Science", "Self-Efficacy", "Instrument Development"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Synthesis and characterization of semiconductor nanomaterials for thermoelectric applications\n", "id": "9961", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4327", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation, I explore simple chemical means to produce various nanomaterials.

This precursor was used to fabricate semiconductor nanowires of varying diameter and thin films through simple templatingmethods. Electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power measurements of these films are only slightly lower than for antimony telluride films fabricated by vacuum deposition.

Random and block copolymer proton exchange membranes (PEMs) and anion exchange membranes (AEMs) with unique properties, such as diblock and triblock copolymers, superacidic moieties, and charge-delocalized polymer-tethered Ru-complex based cations, were investigated, and new metrics were developed to analyze fundamental ion transport behavior in these polymers. The morphology of the polymer systems was examined using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), small angle neutron scattering (SANS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). By studying a number of different ion-conducting systems using multiple techniques and deep analysis of structure-property relationships, a more complete picture of the property landscape of these materials was developed.\n    Model diblock and unique triblock copolymer systems with center-functionalized blocks based on poly(styrene), PS, and poly(hexyl methacrylate), PHMA, were synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The PS block was functionalized for backbone-independent comparisons of PEM and AEM water uptake and conductivity to provide insight in how the properties of PEMs and AEMs compare and aid in further AEM development. The ratio of the mobile ion diffusion coefficients and dilute solution ion diffusivity (D/D0) was developed as a new metric, allowing for accurate comparison of polymer systems with different ion moieties and contents. Subsequently, it was determined that block copolymer PEMs and AEMs demonstrate the same barriers to ion transport if the mobility of the charge carrier is considered.\n    Solution and membrane morphology was correlated for the PS-PHMA membrane systems using SAXS, SANS and TEM techniques. Two additional polymer systems incorporating unique Ru-complex-based and superacid ionic groups were investigated, as well. The effect of cross-link density on water uptake and conductivity was studied for bis(terpyridine) ruthenium-based AEMs with the new metrics to compare the conductivity of various AEM counterions. Finally, the conductivity, water uptake, and morphology of superacid random and block copolymer PEMs were explored. The perfluorosulfonic acid groups in these polymers led to enhanced conductivity over the alkyl and aryl sulfonic acid groups.\n    Through this research, new insight was gained into the fundamental associations between water and ions in polymer membranes.

Though it is thought to be partially caused by Propionibacterium acnes colonization, studies suggest that patients\u2019 specific immune responses to P.acnes may play a larger role in acne than the pathogenicity of P.acnes itself.  \n\nIsotretinoin, a pro-drug for retinoic acid, is the only agent that induces a permanent remission of acne, but the mechanism underlying its long-term efficacy is unknown.  We hypothesized that modulation of the immune response to P.acnes is key to isotretinoin\u2019s ability to induce long-term or permanent remissions of acne. \n\nIn this Thesis, we show that acne patients\u2019 monocytes express higher levels of TLR-2 and secrete more IL-1\u00e2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12 in response to P. acnes than monocytes from normal volunteers.  Isotretinoin therapy significantly decreases TLR-2 expression and inflammatory cytokine secretion by acne patients\u2019 monocytes compared to baseline.  These changes continue through 20 weeks of isotretinoin therapy and persist for at least six months after the cessation of therapy, indicating that modification of patients\u2019 immune responses to P. acnes may represent a long-term mechanism by which isotretinoin can cure acne.\nBecause the exogenous administration of retinoids causes severe side-effects including birth defects, studies characterizing the action of isotretinoin in humans in vivo are lacking.  This is the first study to show that isotretinoin has immunomodulatory effects in acne patients in vivo.  Findings from this study extend to other diseases for which isotretinoin is used as a therapy as well as inflammatory disorders characterized by TLR-2 over-expression. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3989], "author_name_tesi": "Dispenza, Melanie Claire", "last_name_ssi": "Dispenza", "middle_name_ssi": "Claire", "first_name_ssi": "Melanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Diane M Thiboutot", "Diane M Thiboutot", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Charles H Lang", "Gary Alan Clawson", "Stephen R Rannels"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Diane M Thiboutot, Dissertation Advisor", "Diane M Thiboutot, Committee Chair", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Gary Alan Clawson, Committee Member", "Stephen R Rannels, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["monocytes", "innate immunity", "acne"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Fabrication of 2D and 3D Photonic Crystals and Templates\n\n", "id": "6238", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2425", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-04-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The prediction and the confirmation that artificial periodic dielectric structures can be used to manipulate electromagnetic wave propagation affected significantly the development of the micro- and nano-optoelectronics.  Many new devices such as on-chip waveguides with sharp bends and cavity resonators were developed based on this idea.  There is a great diversity in the fabrication approaches for making 2D and 3D photonic crystals and there is always a need for improving them in terms of being more feature size flexible, materials flexible and less time consuming.\nThis thesis presents three new ideas.  First, it is introducing a synthetic approach for the fabrication of 2D photonic crystals by combining interference lithography and potentiostatic electrodeposition of CdSe.  This two-step process offers the flexibility of using composite materials to build PCs and also allows the integration of PCs onto arbitrary substrates.  Secondly, the single diffraction element used to generate 2D interference patterns was redesigned to create 3D patterns.  The results proved the versatility of the proposed method and confirmed that the single diffraction element setup can be used to create uniform 3D structures over a large substrate area.  Thirdly, a tunable beam splitter for the purpose of multibeam interference was designed, giving the opportunity to adjust the incident beam angles and thus allowing a fabrication of structures with different periodicities.  This beam splitter advances the principle on which the single diffraction element works by solving its most important limitations.  The final results demonstrated the flexibility of fabricating different 3D periodic structures in photosensitive polymers by means of four-beam interference. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2409], "author_name_tesi": "Divliansky, Ivan Borissov", "last_name_ssi": "Divliansky", "middle_name_ssi": "Borissov", "first_name_ssi": "Ivan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Iam Choon Khoo", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "Thomas E Mallouk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Chair", "Iam Choon Khoo, Committee Member", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["replication", "interference lithography", "photonic crystals", "holographic lithography"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Robust Models For Property Testing", "id": "27153", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11920", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Property testing [Rubinfeld Sudan 96,Goldreich Goldwasser Ron 98] is a formal framework for studying approximate sublinear time randomized algorithms for decision problems. These algorithms have black-box query access to the input functions. Property testers are required to distinguish between functions that satisfy a given property from those that are \u2018far\u2019 from satisfying the property. Informally, a function is far from satisfying a given property if many function values need to be changed to satisfy the property. The notion of distance from a property is central to property testing. The distance of a function f : D \u2192 R from a property P is the smallest distance\nbetween f and any function g : D \u2192 R that satisfies P. One of the most widely studied model [Rubinfeld Sudan 96,Goldreich Goldwasser Ron 98] uses the relative Hamming distance as the notion of distance between two functions. That is, the distance between two functions f : D \u2192 R\nand g : D \u2192 R is the fraction of domain points on which f and g differ. A long line of work has been dedicated to the design and study of sublinear time algorithms for a number of function properties using this model.\n\nThis works focuses on studying practical generalizations of the aforementioned model. In the first part, we work with generalizing the notion of distance between functions. The relative Hamming distance can also be viewed as the distance between functions with respect to the uniform\ndistribution. As part of our study, we design optimal testers for a large class of functions properties, called the bounded derivative properties, when the distance is measured with respect to a known or an unknown product distribution. The class of bounded derivative properties include well studied\nfunction properties like monotonicity and the Lipschitz property.\n\n\nThe second part of our work focuses on a generalization of the input access model. In many practical scenarios, a black-box access to the whole input function might not be possible. Some of the function values might not be available to the tester due to privacy requirements or adversarial\nerasures.We refer to such domain points as erased. The location of an erasure becomes known to the tester only upon querying the respective domain point. We design efficient erasure-resilient sublinear time testers for a large number of properties including the bounded derivative properties and convexity.

Of particular interest, though, is the nanoporous structure that arises from dealloying Ag from AgAu.  Details about the formation of AgAu alloys and the different methods for dealloying AgAu alloys are discussed, including a brief history of the dealloying mechanism for a binary alloy.  The chapter concludes with a brief overview of the thesis\u2019 subsequent chapters.  \nThe second chapter focuses on the preparation and characterization of nPG thin films of varying thickness and etch times.  We adapted the approach of dealloying Ag from AgAu due to its widespread application, well understood mechanism, uniformity in pore size, and reproducible structure formation.  The atomic percentage of Ag70Au30 was chosen for this work since an initial collaboration and previous studies have used this particular ratio, and demonstrated pore sizes on the order of tens of nanometers were achievable upon dealloying.  We designed a new technique to deposit AgAu alloys onto surfaces.  Specifically, the technique entailed argon ion sputtering a premade ingot containing Ag70Au30 onto a substrate.  This technique had the advantage of reproducibility in AgAu concentration over codeposition of Ag and Au since slight variations in the rate of codeposition presumably changed the resulting surface concentrations.  Dealloying of the AgAu film on the substrate was carried out using concentrated nitric acid due to its relative simplicity over electrochemical methods and the fact that the Ag70Au30 concentration falls within the parting limit range for the AgAu alloy.  Also, multiple samples and various sample sizes could be etched under the same conditions, as opposed to electrochemical etching that may have varied from sample to sample or from sample geometry or size.  The amount of residual Ag left in the nanoporous films was measured by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the structure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy.  Surface areas of a variety of different films were estimated by N2 adsorption isotherms and electrochemical capacitance measurements.  Lastly, the optical properties of the films were estimated using spectroscopic ellipsometry and surface plasmon resonance.  The characterization described in this chapter laid the groundwork for preparation of samples used throughout the rest of the thesis.\n\tThe third chapter describes the functionaliztion and subsequent characterization of organic films chemisorbed onto a variety of nPG films.  Self-assembled monolayers of thiol containing molecules were made using typical literature procedures.  The coverage of a variety of molecules were estimated using depth profiling XPS, solid state nuclear magnetic resonance, adsorption measurements and redox electrochemistry.  Film quality was estimated using electrochemical tunneling measurements and reflection infrared spectroscopy; these showed that film quality on nPG was comparable to that on flat Au.  The macroscopic wetting properties of functionalized nPG, as measured using contact angles, were found to reflect the morphology of the underlying substrate, while the microscopic wetting of functionalized nPG, as measured by water vapor adsorption, inhibited the adsorption of water vapor.\n\tChapter 4 applies the nPG films to Surface Enhance Raman Spectroscopy (SERS), in the context of developing reproducible and uniform high-intensity substrates.  The SERS response of a variety of nPG films prepared under different conditions were measured with various thiol molecules.  Optimum substrate conditions were found for the highest SERS intensity for both untreated nPG and electrochemically roughened nPG.  Enhancement factors of the nPG substrates were measured to be on the order of 104-105.  Cleaning the nPG and refunctionalization demonstrated that \u201chigh intensity\u201d samples could be reused.  Application of the electrochemical roughened nPG substrate to vapor adsorption of dimethyl methylphosphonate, a surrogate for Sarin, demonstrated nPG\u2019s potential for use in sensor applications.\n\tIn the appendix there are related supplemental materials for Chapters 2, 3 and 4 along with two unfinished manuscripts.  The supplemental material provides information that could be of use to future Allara group members studying nPG.  A table containing all the different sample etch times, thicknesses and techniques used for characterization was included.  The unfinished manuscripts both involved collaborations with other research groups, and most of the relevant work on my end dealt with typical surface characterization including infrared spectroscopy, ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy and contact angles.  These are placed in the appendix because the main focuses of the manuscripts were performed by the collaborators.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3987], "author_name_tesi": "Dixon, Matthew Curran", "last_name_ssi": "Dixon", "middle_name_ssi": "Curran", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Lawrence Allara", "Nicholas Winograd", "Karl Todd Mueller", "Carlo G Pantano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Lawrence Allara, Committee Chair", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Member", "Karl Todd Mueller, Committee Member", "Carlo G Pantano, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanoporous Au", "porous Au", "nanoporous gold", "porous gold"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Symbolic Landscapes of Identity: Monumentality, Modernity and Memory on Mexico City\u2019s Paseo de la Reforma\n", "id": "9385", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5814", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mexico City\u2019s landscapes carry powerful discourses that memorialize the nation and national heroes, especially in monuments on major roads.

Erosion studies are part of the overall program, but not\npart of this thesis. Zn, Al 1100 and Galvalume were chosen as the constituents of the sacrificial layer. A\ngroup of panels coated with organic coating were donated by NOV Tuboscope and were tested as the\nbarrier layer. Also, three steel substrates (bare, burned-off and white-metal finish) were tested to\nobserve the substrate behavior. The Zn, Al 1100, Galvalume coated steel samples, and the steel panels\nwere tested for a week under constant immersion, while the coated panels were tested for 14-18 weeks\nunder constant immersion. The testing and constant immersion environments simulated to the\ntemperature, chloride concentration, and pH of the environment in the oil and gas pipelines in Qatar.\nThe solution used in these two environments was a-2000 ppm Cl- containing CO2 saturated NaCl-HCl\nmixture at a pH of 3.5 and at 60oC. To investigate the corrosion behavior of the Zn, Al 1100, Galvalume,\nOpen Circuit Potential, Polarization Resistance measurements and Electrochemical Impedance\nSpectroscopy scans were conducted.

The first essay presents a model characterizing a Pareto optimal brokerage agreement between a seller of a property and a real estate broker who has private information about the market valuation of the property. Under the assumption that the broker faces increasing costs of securing higher offers for the property, the model predicts that an optimal brokerage commission should be a convex function of the size of the offer that the broker secures for the property. In addition, we present a novel sample of actual contracts from a major commercial real estate broker that is largely consistent with the predictions of the model.\nThe second essay argues against a highly debated externality question by presenting a self-selection model that indicates homeowners as having a greater incentive than renters to select jobs with productivity that matches their ability. Differential search and mobility costs inherent across housing tenure result in homeownership serving as a signal for job match quality. Additionally, through the lens of the self-selection hypothesis, this chapter presents a job match quality explanation for varying unemployment and employment duration across tenure. Finally, we present empirical evidence that provides support for the self-selection model and suggests that homeowners are indeed better matched than renters.\nThe third essay presents a framework to examine the trading decisions of institutional investors and the information content of credit ratings.

Identifying novel mechanisms underlying patient response to cancer risk factors and therapeutic stratagems can offer clinicians new avenues for prevention and treatment. In particular, there is a large degree of inter-individual variability of drug metabolism within patient populations. The mechanisms governing human drug metabolism are very complex and the purpose of this dissertation work is to identify novel mechanisms contributing to this process.\nThe UDP-Glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) gene family codes for 19 unique protein isoforms responsible for the phase II metabolism of many endogenous and exogenous compounds. This includes >60% of all known drugs. The UGT enzymes attach a sugar moiety (glucuronic acid) to target substrates including endogenous compounds such as bilirubin and steroid hormones as well as drugs and environmental agents including tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs), morphine, and chemotherapeutic compounds such as raloxifene. The UGTs exhibit substantial inter-individual variability with respect to their mRNA expression, protein expression, and enzymatic activity. This contributes to variability in patient response and toxicological issues associated with compounds and therapies metabolized by the UGTs. Understanding the mechanisms governing UGT expression and regulation can provide insight into patient response to disease risk factors and treatments. We hypothesized that microRNA (miRNA) contribute to the expression regulation of UGT protein family members.\nmiRNA are an endogenously expressed class of RNA species that do not code for proteins. miRNA generally bind to the 3\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA and help guide a large protein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to the target mRNA. RISC binding represses protein expression of the targeted mRNA via inhibition of protein translation and often causes mRNA degradation. Using in silico prediction analyses, we have identified miR-491-3p as an endogenous regulator of hepatic expression of UGT1A protein expression. Transfection of miR-491-3p mimics into HuH-7 cells significantly repressed UGT1A1 (P<0.001), UGT1A3 (P<0.05), and UGT1A6 (P<0.05) mRNA levels. This repression correlated with a significant reduction in the metabolism of raloxifene into raloxifene-6-glucuronide (ral-6-gluc; P<0.01) and raloxifene-4\u2019-glucuronide (ral-4\u2019-gluc; P<0.01). When endogenous miR-491-3p expression levels in HuH-7 cells are repressed, there is a significant increase (~80%; P<0.01) in UGT1A1 mRNA and a corresponding increase in glucuronidation of raloxifene into ral-6-gluc (50%, P<0.05) and ral-4\u2019-gluc (22%, P<0.01).  Knockdown of endogenous miR-491-3p in HepG2 cells did not significantly alter UGT1A1 mRNA levels, but did increase the formation of ral-6-gluc (50%, P<0.05) and ral-4\u2019-gluc (34%, P<0.001). Furthermore, a significant (P<0.05) increase in UGT1A3 and UGT1A6 mRNA levels was observed in miR-491-3p non-expressing versus expressing liver specimens and both UGT1A3 (P<0.05; r = -0.296) and UGT1A6 (P<0.01; r = -0.487) mRNA levels are inversely correlated with miR-491-3p expression levels in human liver. These results suggest that UGT1A isoforms are regulated by miR-491-3p. This is the first study to examine miRNA regulation of the UGT drug-metabolizing enzyme family. \nThe UGT2B gene family is comprised of six unique genes and protein isoforms. We have identified miR-216b as a novel epigenetic regulator of UGT2B protein expression. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed miR-216b conserved binding motifs within the 3\u2019 UTRs of UGT2B4, 2B7, 2B10, and 2B15 that were identified using in silico prediction algorithms. The functionality of these binding sites were further confirmed using in vitro pull-down assays. Over-expression of miR-216b mimics in HuH-7 cells significantly repressed UGT2B7 (P<0.001) and UGT2B10 (P<0.01) mRNA levels and over-expression of miR-216b in Hep3B cells decreased UGT2B4 (P<0.001) and UGT2B10 (P<0.01) mRNA levels. UGT2B7 protein levels were significantly repressed in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of increasing miR-216b concentrations in HuH-7 cells and this was correlated with decreasing levels of epirubicin glucuronide formation (P<0.01). Inhibition of endogenous miR-216b levels increased UGT2B7 mRNA levels in HuH-7 (P<0.05) and in Hep3B cells (P<0.01) and increased UGT2B7 epirubicin glucuronidation by approximately 40% and 25%, respectively (P<0.05). This is the first evidence indicating that miRNA genes can regulate members of the UGT2B gene family and that miR-216b regulation of UGT2B proteins may play a role in the metabolism of UGT2B substrates in human liver. \nThe results presented in this dissertation identify novel miRNA regulators of UGT protein expression. miR-491-3p and miR-216b directly regulate expression of UGT1As in the liver and UGT2B isoforms in cell lines, respectively, and contribute to the complex mechanisms involved in UGT-mediated drug metabolism. These studies could have important implications in inter-individual expression of UGT enzymes. This will be imperative in identifying predictors of patient response to clinical therapies.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9339], "author_name_tesi": "Dluzen, Douglas F", "last_name_ssi": "Dluzen", "middle_name_ssi": "F", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Philip Lazarus", "Gavin Peter Robertson", "Faoud T Ishmael", "Jianming Hu", "Curtis John Omiecinski", "David Joseph Spector"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Philip Lazarus, Dissertation Advisor", "Gavin Peter Robertson, Committee Chair", "Faoud T Ishmael, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Committee Member", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Drug metabolism", "microRNA", "epigenetics", "pharmacology", "gene regulation", "UGTs"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EARLY TO BED AND EARLY TO RISE MAKES A PERSON HEALTHY: RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SLEEP PATTERNS AND PHYSICAL HEALTH", "id": "8845", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4700", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Chronic lack of sleep and sleep disorders are becoming increasingly more prevalent in the United States, and evidence suggests that severe lack of sleep is detrimental to the functioning of individuals and society.

Growth Mixture Models with latent time basis were used to estimate daily profiles of diurnal cortisol among participants taking part in up to four consecutive days of saliva collection (N=1,622; age ranged between 34 and 87 years old). The 3-class solution provided the best model fit across all four days of saliva collection, with results further indicating a striking stability within estimated parameters of each profile across the entire study period. The majority of respondents exhibited a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153typical\u00e2\u20ac\u009d profile, characterized by relatively low awakening and bedtime levels, coupled with robust slopes following awakening and prior to bedtime.

After accounting for relevant control variables, the typical profile was associated with younger age (p<.001). Additional analyses demonstrated that report of greater chronic stress in early midlife is associated with a lower probability of exhibiting a typical profile, and an increased risk of exhibiting a flat profile (p<.001). The current dissertation demonstrates the utility of the Growth Mixture Modeling approach to the study of diurnal cortisol, and supports previous work showing that older age, minority status, and poorer physical health and health behaviors are associated with a deviation from the robust waveform of diurnal cortisol.

Factors that explained the variance in preventive behaviors among the workers were explored as well.  Based on the identified respirator use beliefs, educational topics were identified and selected to design a respiratory safety training module for the workers.\nA criterion-based sampling technique was used to select agricultural workers in the College of Agricultural Sciences at the Pennsylvania State University for the needs assessment phase of the study.  Seventy-three usable questionnaires were returned for data analysis.  For the program implementation phase, research participants were invited to sign up to attend the respiratory safety program.  Fourteen workers participated, including 13 workers who took part in the needs assessment.\nThe results showed that a typical agricultural worker who perceived him or herself to be vulnerable to respiratory disease hazards, and was aware of the consequences (perceived severity) of being affected by the hazard, and had a positive perception about the benefits of using respiratory protection tended to rate the educational topics high on importance and relevance for the respiratory safety program.  The worker\u2019s perceived vulnerability to respiratory hazards and perceived benefit to be derived by using respiratory protection tended to influence the mean ratings of all the educational topics that were listed.  Also, current beliefs regarding the use of respiratory protection among the agricultural workers were influenced by the type of job performed and this tended to influence behavior towards respirator use.\nFactors influencing the choice of behavior were identified as: 1) work policy stipulating use of respirators; 2) availability of respirators, 3) job types that required the use of respirators/dust masks; and 4) perceived control or self-efficacy belief the worker had over using respiratory protection.  These factors explained 64.1 % of the variance in preventive behavior.  Two of these factors were negatively related to preventive behavior \u2013 perceived availability of respirators and job type requiring respirator usage.  Work policy stipulating the use of respiratory protection contributed 42.3% to the parsimonious model.  Perceived control belief significantly contributed to the variance in preventive behavior.

Yet, a lack of consensus or certainty remains in terms of how to conceptualize and operationalize L2 motivation. For the most part, researchers tend to rely on teacher and student self-reports, questionnaires and surveys, to measure motivation, and they apply a series of statistical analyses to predict how certain conditions, related to the learner or the learning situation, will influence motivation. With these tendencies, extant L2 motivational research has yet to sufficiently consider how motivation is actually achieved in the contingencies of classroom interaction. This dissertation is a partial attempt to fill this gap in the research.\nDrawing on the tenets of conversation analysis (CA), the study treats L2 motivation as a socially-shared, observable phenomenon co-constructed and displayed by teachers and learners as they participate in everyday classroom activities. Based on the empirical and theoretical work connecting motivation with the presence of positive relationships (e.g., Allen, Witt, & Wheeless, 2006; Deci & Ryan, 2000; D\u00f6rnyei, 2001; Schumann, 2010, 2013), this dissertation assumes that teacher-student affiliative interactions offer a productive starting point for investigating the interactional realization of L2 motivation, and because shared laughter is considered to be affiliative (e.g., Ellis, 1997; Glenn, 1991, 2003), it operationalizes motivation as shared laughter.\nThe data for the dissertation come from the Corpus of English for Academic and Professional Purposes (CEAPP) and consist of approximately 30 hours of audio and video recorded classroom interaction collected over the course of a semester in an adult, high beginner-level grammar class of an intensive English program at a US university. From the 30 hours of video, 453 episodes of teacher-student interaction featuring shared laugher were identified and transcribed in detail, and the methods of CA, and membership categorization analysis (MCA) were used to examine and compare the teacher\u2019s and students\u2019 participation in and across the episodes.\nThe analysis discovered that identity play was the primary source of shared laugther, and it revealed eight interactional practices the teacher used for doing identity play, four practices involving play with the teacher\u2019s identity and four reciprocal practices involving play with the students\u2019 identities. Each of the practices involved playful category work that juxtaposed two opposing elements of teacher or student identity. The teacher-initiated identity play practices engendered a high level of student involvement, evidenced in an abundance of student self-selected turns. The practices encouraged students to affiliate with the teacher and each other, motivating them to initiate and extend affiliative interactions in pursuit and achievement of both pedagogical and interpersonal goals.  Finally, the anlaysis offers some evidence that student participation may become more diverse and complex as students repeatedly participate in the playful interactions. This finding suggests that the students\u2019 motivated action, then, may bring about the development of interactional competence.\n These findings have significant implications for teaching and learning. They confirm the crucial role affiliation plays in motivating language learners and they contribute to our understanding of how teachers may effectively nurture L2 motivation and development in the classroom.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13673], "author_name_tesi": "Dobs, Abby Marie Mueller", "last_name_ssi": "Dobs", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie Mueller", "first_name_ssi": "Abby", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Applied Linguistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan Kelly Hall", "Joan Kelly Hall", " Suresh Canagarajah", "Karen E.

Determined through reduced-order models, the insights are intended to facilitate control of these devices. The selection of these devices comes from two similarities. First, populations of these devices are utilized for filtering differences between power demanded and power supplied. Control of power demanded by TCLs is a proposed method to integrate renewable resources into the grid without the need to shed excess supplied energy or disrupt grid frequency. Likewise, stationary battery packs are implemented for renewable resource integration, and packs are used in partially or fully electric vehicles to match the power requirements.\nSecond, beyond the application connection there exists a fundamental connection: the aggregate behavior of both systems is inherently different from the average unit behavior. As the literature states, despite the fact that individual TCL power dynamics are oscillatory, heterogeneous populations of TCLs exhibit damped aggregate power dynamics. This damping phenomenon is beneficial to control methods attempting to match power demand to supply. As this damping introduced by heterogeneity changes the nature of the aggregate dynamics, there is a focus on developing low-order aggregate power dynamic models that incorporate heterogeneity. Similarly, studies and experiments in the battery literature show that pack capacity degradation is not captured by the average battery cell. The battery pack capacity and other pack state of health (SOH) parameters are unfavorably influenced by the unhealthiest cells within the pack, impacting pack control through the SOH parameter-determined current and voltage limits. Furthermore, studies show that heterogeneity found within the cells influences the degradation of other cells within the pack, with and without cell charge balancing strategies.\nThough the literature discusses these aggregate behavior dynamics, there are still fundamental insights missing for both systems. Studies do exist that attempt to determine a relationship between TCL heterogeneity and the damped aggregated dynamics, but there is a lack of a concrete study relating how heterogeneity of multiple parameters impacts the aggregate dynamics. There are studies that attempt to determine how heterogeneity of battery cells impact aggregate pack SOH, but there is a lack of insights determined from analyzing a model specifically developed to capture heterogeneity dynamics. This dissertation proposes the solution to both of these problems through the development of reduced-order models that are built with the explicit purpose of determining the insights missing from the literature. \nFor the TCL problem, a model of an individual TCL is reformulated and a stochastic parameter integral is applied to develop a reduced-order aggregate power demand model. A set of second-order linear time-varying (LTV) differential equations characterize this model, with the time-varying damping ratios describing the strength of the damping observed in the aggregate power demand. This model, shown to be accurate for low-order approximations, furnishes several insights, including: (i) Only heterogeneity in the TCL power demand\u2019s characteristic frequency creates damping in the aggregate response. Other heterogeneities, such as in the demand\u2019s duty cycle, do not. (ii) Low levels of heterogeneity in the characteristic frequencies also create a beating phenomenon in the aggregate power dynamics. (iii) The damping ratios depend on the dominant characteristic frequencies and decay over time. These insights lead to understanding useful for system design through intelligent selection of TCL populations to meet operator needs. The damping ratios lend themselves to better-informed controller design, potentially allowing more aggressive demand response controllers without inducing instability.\nFor the battery pack problem, a framework is developed to determine insights into the behavior of heterogeneity within a pack for different balancing strategies. An electrochemical cell model is reduced to describe heterogeneity between cells through an LTV model for two different studies. In the first study, charge and capacity heterogeneity are considered, and insights lead to the knowledge that voltage balancing algorithms do not remove capacity differences within the lifespan of the pack. A novel control algorithm is developed from these insights, which balances not voltage, but rather charge and capacity, and is shown to increase pack lifespan by up to 9.2%. In the second study, charge and temperature heterogeneity are considered, and the tradeoffs between balancing these are formulated. It is discovered that temperature heterogeneity removal can be assisted by control of an average current through two cells using entropic and ohmic effects, and a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm is developed to show this.\nThrough this dissertation, an understanding is gained regarding how the aggregate response of heterogeneous groups of energy storage devices is inherently different than individual device response. For both the TCL demand response problem and the battery pack problem, the insights coupled with reduced-order models are intended to facilitate the development of accurate and efficient control methods.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15501], "author_name_tesi": "Docimo, Donald John", "last_name_ssi": "Docimo", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Donald", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Hosam Kadry Fathy", "Christopher Rahn", "Sean N Brennan", "Antonios Armaou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hosam Kadry Fathy, Dissertation Advisor", "Hosam Kadry Fathy, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Sean N Brennan, Committee Member", "Antonios Armaou, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heterogeneity", "Battery Packs", "Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs)", "Controls", "Model Reduction", "Demand Response", "Energy Systems", "Model Predictive Control (MPC)", "Lithium-Ion Batteries", "Battery balancing"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Job satisfaction of experienced and novice music teachers in high-poverty urban public schools", "id": "15499", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7059", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study involved music teachers in six large urban districts in the United States.

Obesity has diverse etiologies, but there are critical periods of life at which time weight status may be affected by experiences, and the individuals responses to their experiences.

A sample of male (n=36) and female adolescents (n=42) and a parent or care-giver of each adolescent participated in the study.  The adolescent participants collected saliva for cortisol assay and completed daily experiences diaries for four consecutive days.

Three hierarchical linear regression models were evaluated in which cortisol reactivity to a stressor, childhood vulnerabilities, specifically depression and high cortisol reactivity, exercise and daily hassles were hypothesized to predict adolescent body mass index.  The stability of daily cortisol profiles from childhood to adolescence, and across consecutive days in adolescence were evaluated using trajectory analyses, and the associations between daily hassles, total daily cortisol secretion, and cortisol reactivity were evaluated using HLM procedures.  The results indicated that daily hassles, cortisol reactivity and symptoms of depression in childhood were not associated with adolescent weight status after controlling for childhood weight status.  Habitual exercise was associated with weight status in both male and female adolescents.  Daily cortisol trajectories were stable across consecutive days in adolescence, but were not stable from childhood to adolescence.  The results of the HLM analyses indicated that hours of sleep and daily hassles were associated with total daily cortisol secretion, but the strength of this association was not predicted by the magnitude of cortisol response to a laboratory stress challenge.  These results demonstrate the impact of daily experiences in adolescence on levels of cortisol, and illustrate the change in daily cortisol secretion patterns with age and exposure to daily hassles.  In summary, this study provides evidence that studying the associations between daily hassles and cortisol reactivity to a lab stressor in adolescence may have utility in expanding models of stress and weight status.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5809], "author_name_tesi": "Dockray, Samantha ", "last_name_ssi": "Dockray", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Samantha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Susman", "Laura Klein", "Sheila Grace West", "David Manuel Almeida"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Susman, Committee Chair", "Laura Klein, Committee Member", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cortisol", "daily hassles", "obesity"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "CONFLICT COMMUNICATION AND THE USE OF QUALITY MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS", "id": "6245", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "132", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-03-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThis dissertation examined conflict communication and quality management practices in four academic departments at a large public research institution.  Four conflict communication styles were identified, including interactive equality, supportive dissension, suppression, and deconstructive dissension.  Three conflict types were observed, all having an identity element: task, process, and relationship conflict.  Further, five quality management domains were identified, including systems thinking, strong leadership and decision making, focus on continuous renewal, faculty development and generativity, and stakeholder engagement. \n\nConstructive conflict communication patterns and quality management practices are two important processes in the development of an academic department.  Both co-exist in a mutually reinforcing developmental framework.  The goal of each process is the same: to enhance departmental effectiveness.  Supportive dissension and interactive equality may be the developmental tasks that departments need to master in order to achieve the cooperation and learning recommended by Deming (1993) in his framework of profound knowledge.  Conversely, quality management practices may be the developmental tasks best suited to enhancing supportive dissension and interactive equality.  It also appears that an important aspect of their successful interaction is strong leadership that facilitates systems thinking.\n\nThis dissertation employed descriptive case study methodology (Yin, 2003).  Data collection included the following methods:  survey, interview, observation, and document analysis.  Pattern matching (Campbell, 1975) served to reveal the degree to which the data matched the patterns for each study variable as suggested by face negotiation theory and cooperative conflict theory.  Tenets of both theories, with the exception of their propositions regarding the use of cooperating, yielding, and avoiding conflict styles, received support.\n  \nSignificant differences among departments surfaced in the degree to which the three conflict types were present and also in the degree to which the departments used quality management practices.  Departmental differences for the use of conflict communication styles also emerged.  Additionally, significant differences in the ways tenured and non-tenured faculty viewed their departments\u2019 use of the two quality constructs of information and analysis and process excellence were in evidence.\n\nThe developmental framework proposed in this dissertation provides indicators that can be used to recognize the organizational structures and processes that are critical to the development of quality management and constructive conflict patterns.  The framework also provides guidelines for conflict management, including when to increase, maintain, or reduce conflict.  Leaders and accreditors could use the indicators as they work to facilitate positive change in academic departments.  This positive change could, in turn, enhance the quality of teaching, research, and service to the benefit of future generations and society at large.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [131], "author_name_tesi": "Dodd, Ann H.", "last_name_ssi": "Dodd", "middle_name_ssi": "H.", "first_name_ssi": "Ann", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum", "Dennis Stephen Gouran", "Michelle E Day", "Michael John Dooris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Chair", "Dennis Stephen Gouran, Committee Member", "Michelle E Day, Committee Member", "Michael John Dooris, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["conflict management", "quality management", "higher education", "group communication", "organizational communication"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Influences on principal evaluations of teacher performance.", "id": "26395", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11353", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Colorado Senate Bill 10-191, the Great Teachers and Leaders Bill (SB 191) passed in 2010 in support of the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Race to the Top program and No Child Left Behind Act, mandated increased teacher and principal accountability by affirming improved teacher evaluation will advance K-12 schooling. As a result, the 27,000-student Pioneer Valley School District (PVSD) in Colorado initiated a new evaluation protocol weighting 50% of teacher and principal summative performance ratings on professional practice using a new instrument called the 5 Dimensions+ Teacher Evaluation Rubric (5D+), and 50% on student achievement data using a PVSD-created value-added model (VAM).

One attractive approach involves the maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacterium, Wolbachia pipientis (=Wolbachia). After artificial infection with Wolbachia, many mosquitoes become refractory to viruses and malaria parasites. By manipulating arthropod reproduction, Wolbachia can spread through the host population and replace the natural vector population with one that cannot maintain pathogen transmission. However, Wolbachia studies have been limited to few pathogens and mosquito hosts, and some studies have shown that Wolbachia-induced pathogen modulation may differ depending on mosquito species, Wolbachia strain, and pathogen type. Thus, we studied the breadth of effects that a somatic Wolbachia infection has on three genera of viruses, including Flavivirus, Bunyavirus, and Alphavirus. \nFirst, we studied the effects of Wolbachia (wAlbB strain) on infection, dissemination, and transmission of West Nile virus (WNV; Flavivirus) in the mosquito Culex tarsalis. After injection into adult female mosquitoes, wAlbB reached high titers and disseminated widely to numerous tissues including the head, proboscis, ovarian follicles, thoracic flight muscles, and fat body. Contrary to other systems, WNV infection rate was significantly enhanced in wAlbB-infected mosquitoes compared to the control. \nNext, we evaluated the effects of wAlbB on Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; Bunyavirus) in the mosquito Cx. tarsalis. wAlbB had no effect on RVFV infection, dissemination, or transmission rates, nor on body or saliva titers in this mosquito. However, high levels of wAlbB were correlated with low viral titers or no infection, suggesting that wAlbB may suppress RVFV in a density-dependent manner in this species. \nThen, we tested the effects of two strains of Wolbachia (wAlbB and wMel) on two alphaviruses (Sindbis virus [SINV] and o\u2019nyong-nyong virus [ONNV]) in Cx. tarsalis and Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Ae. aegypti was included because it is the primary vector of select alphaviruses and is the species used in Wolbachia field releases. Neither Wolbachia strain blocked SINV or ONNV in either mosquito species, and in fact, there were instances where the viruses were enhanced. In Ae. aegypti, there was a nonsignificant trend toward wAlbB-induced enhancement of ONNV dissemination and transmission rates as well as body and saliva titers compared to a cell lysate control. SINV infection rates were significantly enhanced in wAlbB-positive Ae. aegypti. Additionally, there was a significant positive correlation between wAlbB and SINV body titer and a significant negative correlation between wMel and SINV body titer. In Cx. tarsalis, wAlbB or wMel had no effects on any SINV rates or titer. Also, we found that Cx. tarsalis is not a laboratory vector of ONNV.\nFurthermore, we explored the mechanism of Wolbachia-induced WNV enhancement in Cx. tarsalis by characterizing the microbiomes of Wolbachia-positive and Wolbachia-negative mosquitoes, as well as mosquitoes with varying degrees of WNV susceptibility. We found that Wolbachia introduction to Cx. tarsalis decreased the native bacteria Asaia, and Asaia was also associated with high WNV susceptibility.\nFinally, we tested the vector competence of several Anopheles and Culex mosquitoes for Zika virus (ZIKV). Before control tools such as Wolbachia can be deployed, we need to know which mosquito species contribute to the transmission of the virus so that they can be targeted. Except for our control Ae. aegypti mosquitoes, none of the mosquitoes we tested were positive for infectious ZIKV (Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles stephensi, Anopheles quadrimaculatus, Anopheles freeborni, Culex quinquefasciatus, Cx. tarsalis).\nOn the basis on these results, we conclude that pathogen blocking by Wolbachia is not always a guarantee, and that in some instances, the bacterium can enhance virus infection frequency and intensity. In fact, Wolbachia-induced phenotypes are dependent on a variety of factors including mosquito host, Wolbachia strain and density, and virus type. Additionally, Wolbachia-induced enhancement of WNV infection frequency in Cx. tarsalis may be explained by Wolbachia manipulation of the microbiome. Overall, these studies stress the importance of examining the range of Wolbachia-induced pathogen modulation, because the efficacy of pathogen control efforts using the Wolbachia tool could be impeded.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16311], "author_name_tesi": "Dodson, Brittany Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Dodson", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Brittany", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jason Rasgon", "Jason Rasgon", "Matthew Brian Thomas", "Kelli Hoover", "Marilyn J Roossinck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jason Rasgon, Dissertation Advisor", "Jason Rasgon, Committee Chair", "Matthew Brian Thomas, Committee Member", "Kelli Hoover, Committee Member", "Marilyn J Roossinck, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mosquito", "microbiome", "bacteria", "viruses", "infectious diseases", "wolbachia"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "The Minimum Number of Ground Measurements Required for Narrow Sonic Boom Metric 90% Confidence Intervals", "id": "14826wfd5057", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14826", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-10-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For subsonic aircraft noise certification, the value of the effective perceived noise level EPNL must be known within an adequately narrow 90% confidence interval at the ground during a takeoff, during the climb, and during the approach to landing.

While much effort is being put into integrating the marks from various combinations of features, the contribution of each feature to accuracy of enhancer prediction is not known. We began with predictions of 4,915 candidate erythroid enhancers based on genomic occupancy by TAL1, a key hematopoietic transcription factor that is strongly associated with gene induction in erythroid cells. Seventy of these DNA segments occupied by TAL1 (TAL1 OSs) were tested by transient transfections of cultured hematopoietic cells, and 56% of these were active as enhancers. Sixty-six TAL1 OSs were evaluated in transgenic mouse embryos, and 65% of these were active enhancers in various tissues. Inclusion of additional epigenetic features improved the prediction accuracy, with combinations of TAL1, GATA1, EP300, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac giving high accuracy of enhancer prediction (70%-75% success depending on method of clustering) while having strong discriminatory power maintaining good sensitivity (Sn, up to 84%) and specificity (Sp, up to 80%). Importantly, it was shown that activating histone marks in the absence of key transcription factors or open chromatin profile is a weak predictor of enhancer activity, and had no discriminatory power to predict enhancers. Motifs that distinguish active from inactive TAL1 OSs implicate IRFs, STATs, and FOX protein families as candidate positive co-factors with TAL1, while REST (NRSF) and HOX family proteins are implicated in inactivity. While signals for evolutionary constraint were weak over the entire TAL1-bound DNA segments regardless of activity in either assay, phylogenetic preservation of a TF-binding site motif was associated with enhancer activity. Additionally, we reported that the conservation of GATA1 occupancy is linked to pleiotropic functions, meaning they are enhancers in multiple tissues, including non-hematopoietic tissues. Furthermore, the TAL1-bound enhancers validated in enhancer assays were assigned to their target genes and they include not only erythroid but also non-erythroid genes.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9990], "author_name_tesi": "Dogan, Nergiz ", "last_name_ssi": "Dogan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nergiz", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "David Scott Gilmour", "Robert Paulson", "Philip L Reno", "Anton Nekrutenko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison, Dissertation Advisor", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Chair", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Philip L Reno, Committee Member", "Anton Nekrutenko, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Functional genomics", "Gene regulation", "TAL1", "GATA1", "Histone modifications", "Enhancer assay"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Eexperiences of Korean Early Arrived International Students (EA-I Students)and Recently Arrived International Students(RA-I Sstudents): A Comparison of Attachment Styles, Acculturation, Psychological Distress, Loneliness, and Resilience\n", "id": "12368", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4577", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This quantitative study examined the differences in acculturation, attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety, depressive and anxiety symptoms, loneliness, and resilience among three groups of Korean-born international college students: (a) Early Arrived-International (EA-I) students who had spent most of their adolescence in North America (the U.S. or Canada) without the presence of their parents, (b) EA-I students who lived in North America with a parent during their adolescence, and (c) more Recently Arrived-International (RA-I) students who had left their families to live in North America to attend college.

In sum, all the main hypotheses except the one on the difference in identification with the host culture were not supported by the results of the study.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4544], "author_name_tesi": "Doh, MinJung ", "last_name_ssi": "Doh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "MinJung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counseling Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Woodhouse", "Susan Woodhosue, Ph D", "Kathleen Bieschke", "Benjamin D Locke", "Hoi Kin Suen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Woodhouse, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Woodhosue, Ph D, Committee Chair", "Kathleen Bieschke, Committee Member", "Benjamin D Locke, Committee Member", "Hoi Kin Suen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["psychological distress", "acculturation", "attachment styles", "parachute kids", "Korean international students", "loneliness", "resilience"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "ECOPHYSIOLOGY OF OVERWINTERING IN HONEY BEES (APIS MELLIFERA, L.)", "id": "14587mad435", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14587", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Winter is a great challenge for all animals living in the temperate climates.  Among insects, honey bees are unique for their overwintering behavior.  While virtually all other insect species go into diapause (a dormant state), honey bee colonies comes to a reproductive arrest but existing worker bees form a thermoregulatory cluster to generate and maintain heat against the ambient temperature (D\u00f6ke, Frazier, & Grozinger, 2015).  During this process, the colony solely depends on food they have collected through the previous spring and summer and stored in the form of honey for energy (Owens, 1971).  Moreover, the workers in fall must survive until the end of winter since there simply cannot be worker turn-over during this broodless period (Mattila, Harris, & Otis, 2001).  Thus, in fall, workers with a distinct physiological state and increased longevity are produced in the colony, replacing the short-lived summer bees (Fluri, L\u00fcscher, Wille, & Gerig, 1982; Z. Y. Huang & Robinson, 1995).  \nPopulations of honey bee colonies maintained in the same area for several generations can adapt to their environment and moving colonies between climatic regions can lower their overwintering survival, suggesting existence of selectable, genetic components for overwintering success (B\u00fcchler et al., 2014; Hatjina et al., 2014; Parker et al., 2010).  On the other hand, all of the individuals throughout the year are half-sisters \u2013 daughters of a multiply mated queen \u2013 making them genetically similar.  Yet worker bees of summer and winter are radically different in their physiology and behavior suggesting existence of differentially expressed genes that modify the individual phenotype according to environmental cues.  The research presented in this dissertation establishes a solid foundation for the genetic, transcriptomic, physiological, and social components of honey bee overwintering and its regulation.\nChapter 1 reviews the current state of research on honey bee overwintering and best practices to maximize survival rate of managed honey bee colonies.  Additionally, using the literature, a testable hypothetical model for the environmental cues acting on honey bee overwintering is offered.  We believe this model will be a useful framework for researchers in testing the effect of individual environmental parameters on honey bee overwintering, and indeed we initiate testing of this model in Chapter 5. \nChapter 2 examines the molecular mechanisms underlying the unique \u201cwinter bee\u201d physiological state.  We evaluate expression patterns of key metabolic and antioxidant genes in the abdominal fat body tissues and thoracic flight muscles of nurses, foragers, and winter bees collected from the same colonies throughout the year.  When the three groups are compared using gene expression patterns in the abdominal fat body tissues, winter bees resemble nurses.  However, when the gene expression in thoracic flight muscle is compared, winter bees resemble foragers.  These findings suggest two distinct genetic toolkits working in tandem in different tissues to mix-and-match expression profiles of summer workers tending different tasks to generate a novel phenotype; the winter bee.\nChapter 3 explores the interactions between host physiological state and parasites, including the unique phenotype of the winter bee. Nosema is a microsporidian parasite infecting honey bees, which has been shown to alter the physiology of their hosts and increase behavioral maturation rates from nursing the foraging.  However, these studies have been largely conducted by infecting one day old bees, and thus the impacts of Nosema on nurses, foragers, and winter bees have not been evaluated. Findings from this chapter show the effect of infection on longevity is greatly affected by host physiology.  Moreover, previously identified \u201cNosema responsive\u201d genes in honey bees (whose expression was altered by Nosema infection of young, cage-reared bees) were here shown to be primarily affected by the physiological state of the host rather than the infection state, suggesting that previous transcriptional studies were capturing the impact of Nosema on host maturation rather than a direct host immune response.  Overall, these findings demonstrate the need for contextual experiments for realistic assessment of the effects infectious diseases have on their hosts.\nChapter 4 compares the overwintering success colonies from southern (TX & FL) and northern (WV & VT) United States when placed in the same apiaries in temperate central Pennsylvania to examine the effect of genotype on winter survival and investigate whether northern stocks are locally adapted to colder and longer winters.  Findings from this chapter suggest that while there are small \u2013 but detectable \u2013 genetic differences between populations of honey bees reared in the northern and southern United State, these differences are not associated with variation in overwintering survival.  Instead, overwintering survival is greatly dependent on the size of the colony and can vary dramatically with the specific location \u2013 and its associated floral resources and climatic conditions -  in which the colony is placed.    \nChapter 5 investigates the theory that landscape floral nutritional resources and climatic conditions influence social interactions and demographic structure in the colony, which then in turn mediates the production of winter bees and prepares the colony for winter.  As was proposed in Chapter 1, two worker-produced pheromones (brood pheromone and forager pheromone) can act antagonistically, creating a push and pull model for the initiation and maintenance of winter phenotype.  Testing this hypothesis, we did not find evidence to support a direct effect of the pheromones on colony vigor or survival.  However, this study was limited by the fact that we experimented solely in the field where multiple confounding factors likely acted on the colonies.  \nLastly, Chapter 6 summarizes the findings from this dissertation, integrates results with current scientific literature, and discusses the future of research on honey bee overwintering.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15548], "author_name_tesi": "Doke, Mehmet Ali", "last_name_ssi": "Doke", "middle_name_ssi": "Ali", "first_name_ssi": "Mehmet", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christina Grozinger", "Christina Grozinger", "Tom Baker ", "Rudolf Schilder", "Naomi Altman", "Diana Cox-Foster"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christina Grozinger, Dissertation Advisor", "Christina Grozinger, Committee Chair", "Tom Baker , Committee Member", "Rudolf Schilder, Committee Member", "Naomi Altman, Outside Member", "Diana Cox-Foster, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Honey bee", "Overwintering", "Ecophysiology", "Pheromones", "Gene expression", "Immunity"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "An Exploratory Examination of Social Media, Informal Learning, and Communities of Practice in the Workplace", "id": "18669", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9025", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In organizations of any size, communication, collaboration and informal learning among employees can be critical contributors to meeting goals and succeeding in the marketplace (Mason & Lefrere, 2003).  When done well, over time these groups of employees form loose bonds and evolve into communities of practice that promote shared learning and increased understanding among the membership.  Unfortunately, achieving this state can be a challenge for many organizations. Differing communication styles and practices, isolated business functions, and even geographic disbursement can lead to a disconnected workplace, and have an impact on the organizational members\u2019 ability to all work toward the same goal, with the same information at their disposal.  Innovations in communication over time have contributed to increased employee engagement, and with the advent of Web 2.0 technologies, there are even more tools that allow for the exchange of ideas and knowledge sharing between co-workers in organizations.\nThis research examined how Web 2.0 technologies, specifically social networking sites, are used in an organizational setting to contribute to workplace learning and build engagement and community among employees.  Due to the size of the sample, statistically significant inferences were not able to be made. However, there was a pattern of evidence that indicated that social networking sites were contributing factors in informal learning within an organization, and that they were useful in building networks and engagement among employees, especially those with whom the respondents did not work directly or in close proximity, which illustrate evidence of the existence of a community of practice. Several examples of learning were identified through the open-ended questions included in a survey, through one-on\u00ad one interviews, and through analysis of posts made on social media.\nWhile several criteria were met, it does not appear that the use of social networking sites fulfills all of the requirements of the definition of a community of practice for this particular audience.  Still, it is clear that the use of these tools contributes to greater communication and community in the workplace.

One area in need of further development is the handling of compliant workpieces.  Adhesive joints experience a decrease in volume as they cure, causing either an accumulation of residual stresses inside the adhesive joint or a distortion of the bonding substrates.  Compliant workpieces will elastically distort as these PAAW joints polymerize, making it difficult to achieve tight tolerances as these workpieces are processed.\n\nThis work characterizes the distortion caused by PAAW adhesive joints in response to factors such as workpiece compliance, joint thickness, and adhesive joint diameter.  Empirical models are fit to the experimental data to predict workpiece distortion.\n\nThe bonding surfaces, known as Grippers, used in PAAW technology transmit a non-uniform distribution of curing light intensity to the adhesive joint by design.  The interaction of adjacent adhesive regions with different light intensities and consequently different polymerization rates is explained in terms of a support column model, where the region that develops a significant elastic modulus first will oppose further motion of the substrate.  This idea is demonstrated through experiments with varying adhesive joint diameter.\n\nTo offer insight regarding workpiece distortion reduction for typical industrial use of PAAW fixturing, a scenario involving multiple adhesive joints curing simultaneously and sequentially is explored.  A methodology is created to predict the resulting distortion of a workpiece for any PAAW fixturing setup and curing sequence.  A case study with experimental results validates the approach.\n\nIn an attempt to find a low distortion adhesive, a number of different types of filler content and adhesive base resin are evaluated.

The current study consisted of 126 toddlers at 24/25 months, 70 preschoolers at 4.5 years, and 60 children at the peer visit (mean age 77 months).  Toddler temperament groups were created by observing positive and negative affect and approach/withdrawal behavior in a series of high and low intensity tasks.  Three groups, inhibited, exuberant, and low reactive, were formed taking a person-centered approach.  At 4.5 years, two tasks designed to elicit the emotions of frustration/anger and disappointment was used to measure children\u2019s putative regulatory behaviors.  When the children were 6-7 years of age, their social behaviors were observed while interacting with 2-3 same-sex, same-aged peers in two free plays.  Results revealed direct relations between toddler temperament and later social behaviors with exuberant and inhibited children more likely to exhibit negative peer behaviors than low reactive children.  Direct relations were also found between toddler temperament and types of putative regulatory behaviors used.  Exuberant and low reactive children were more likely to show goal-directed behavior than inhibited children in a frustrating situation.  Several significant interactions with regulatory behaviors in the Disappointment task as the moderating variable emerged when predicting social competence.  As low reactive children increase in their negative vocalizations when disappointed they are more likely to show low levels of solitary passive behaviors.  Also, exuberant children who showed higher levels of internally-directed behaviors when disappointed were more likely to show higher levels of solitary passive behaviors in the peer context.  These same exuberant children were also found to show lower levels of social play with peers.

However, given that existing research has linked positive affect to both beneficial and maladaptive childhood behaviors, the current dissertation sought to advance the literature on the role of positive affect in the development of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social and psychological adjustment.  The goal of this dissertation was to investigate if the importance of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intensity of positive affect and related behaviors, as well as children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to regulate positive affect, varied according to the temperamental style of the child in predicting later social and behavioral adjustment.  In addition, maternal parenting behaviors were examined as a mechanism by which children learned to regulate positive affect.  Data for both studies was drawn from a longitudinal study of 125 children and their families.  Latent profile analysis was used to identify 3 separate subgroups of children (exuberant, inhibited, and average), which were used as the measure of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temperamental styles in both studies.\n\nThe goals of the first study were to examine the role of the intensity of positive affect that 42-month old children displayed in different contexts in predicting social and problem behaviors at 48-months, and to investigate the moderating role of intensity of positive affect and vigor of activity on the relation between temperament and behavior problems/social behaviors longitudinally.  Support was found for the adaptive role of positive affect in that regardless of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temperamental profile, children who displayed high intensity positive affect in a low-intensity game were less likely to be rated by their mothers as high in internalizing and externalizing behavior problems.  Evidence for the constructive role of positive affect was also revealed for children of specific temperamental profiles.  Exuberant children who showed higher intensity of positive affect were rated as more successful in peer relations and lower in oppositional defiant behaviors than exuberant children who displayed lower intensity of positive affect.  Evidence was also provided for the importance of considering the behavior that accompanies exuberant children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intense positive affect.  As hypothesized, exuberant children who displayed both high intensity of positive affect and vigor of activity were rated as higher in conduct problems by their mothers.  Collectively, these findings substantiate the protective role of positive affect when not coupled with intense vigor of activity in lowering children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risk of developing maladaptive behaviors.  However, exuberant children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s inability to restrain their intense, vigorous activity when excited might represent a liability to the child.  \n\nStudy 2 investigated if 42-month old children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temperamental styles were directly related to their ability to regulate positive affect, as well as examining if children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to up- and down-regulate positive affect was related to the socialization behaviors that parents employed.  Further, this study examined the role of children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s temperament and ability to regulate positive affect, as moderated by maternal parenting behaviors, in predicting children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s later behavior problems and social behaviors.  This investigation provided support for the significance of maternal parenting behaviors as a mechanism by which children of varying temperamental styles learn to up- and down-regulate positive affect.  In particular, exuberant children were better able to down-regulate positive affect when mothers employed high levels of attention-grabbing behaviors and positive commands.  In addition, a mediated moderation analysis revealed preliminary evidence for the role of up-regulation of positive affect as a mechanism by which inhibited children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s risk of developing poor peer relations was lowered.  However, maternal overprotective behaviors were found to lower the likelihood that inhibited children would show up-regulation of positive affect, which in turn, heightened their risk of having poor peer relations.\n\nIn conclusion, the results from these studies add to the existing literature by showing that the role of positive affect in children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social and behavioral adjustment largely depends on children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vigor of activity, as well as their temperamental style.  Further, evidence was provided that one mechanism by which children learn to up- and down-regulate positive affect is through the socialization behaviors that mothers employ and children\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to regulate positive affect may affect later behavioral and social adjustment.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12797], "author_name_tesi": "Dollar, Jessica ", "last_name_ssi": "Dollar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia A.

In this thesis, I examine two relatively new proxies for the evolution of the Earth\u2019s surface oxidation state, both of which use stable isotope measurements to identify a permanent oxidations of the surface that occurred between ~2.4 and ~1.8 billion years ago (Ga). \nStable isotope measurements of Fe in sediments demonstrate an increase in maximum &#61540;56Fe  prior to ~1.8 billion years ago (Ga) and in the magnitude of &#61540;56Fe prior to ~2.3 Ga. These data have been interpreted as being the result of stepwise changes to the oxidation state of the Earth\u2019s oceans. However, Fe isotope measurement has also been proposed as a biomarker, as Fe isotopes have been shown to fractionate during metabolic processes and upon complexation with organic acids. In the first two chapters of the thesis, I model the fractionation associated with complexation of Fe with organic ligands. Equilibrium constants are predicted for equilibrium isotope exchange for redox and ligand exchange reactions. These predictions allow comparison of these two types of fractionation and place the two proposed uses of Fe isotopes in better theoretical context.\nAnother novel tool for tracking the redox history of the Earth is the measurement of multiple S isotopes. A large spread in &#61508;33S  values in sediments older than ~2.45 Ga and the complete absence of significant &#61508;33S in sediments younger than ~2.3 Ga is commonly accepted as evidence that atmospher O2 concentrations permanently rose at ~2.4 Ga. Subsequent analyses have uncovered uncover secondary features in the &#61508;33S record. The most notable excursion is a decline in the magnitude of &#61508;33S between ~3.2 and ~2.7 Ga that has been used to invalidate the aforementioned use of &#61508;33S to date the rise of atmospheric O2. In Chapter 3, I propose a new control on &#61508;33S \u2013 namely an organic haze that could have limited production of &#61508;33S in an anoxic atmosphere. I use a 1-dimensional photochemical model to predict the reaction rates for photolysis of SO2, a reaction thought to be required for &#61508;33S production. Finally, in Chapter 4, I examine the climatic implications of the haze and of other hydrocarbon species that would have been present in the Archean atmosphere, and demonstrate how \u201cGaian\u201d-like feedbacks should have existed in the Archean that stabilized climate and atmospheric composition.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5536], "author_name_tesi": "Domagal-Goldman, Shawn David", "last_name_ssi": "Domagal-Goldman", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Shawn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James David Kubicki", "James Kasting", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James David Kubicki, Committee Chair", "James Kasting, Committee Chair", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Archean", "Isotope Geochemistry", "Atmospheric Models", "Molecular Models"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "STABLE ISOTOPE AND LIPID SIGNATURES OF PLANTS\nACROSS A CLIMATE GRADIENT: IMPLICATIONS \nFOR BIOMARKER-BASED PALEOCLIMATE RECONSTRUCTIONS\n", "id": "26221", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10408", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Plant wax n-alkanes are long, saturated hydrocarbons that form part of the protective, waxy cuticle on leaves.  These lipids are pervasive and persistent in soils and sediments and are ideal biomarkers of ancient terrestrial organic matter. In ecosystems dominated by C3 plants, fractionation of carbon and hydrogen isotopes during production of whole leaves and hydrocarbon lipids are well documented, but the sensitivity of isotopic fractionation between leaves and lipids to climate has not been fully investigated.  Further, there are few studies of stable isotopes in C4 plant lipids.  In both cases, it is unclear if carbon and hydrogen isotopic fractionations during lipid production are sensitive to environmental conditions, such as moisture, or if they reflect inherited characteristics tied to taxonomic or phylogenetic affiliation.  This study used a natural climate gradient on the Kohala peninsula of Hawaii to investigate relationships between climate and the \u03b413C and \u03b42H values of n-alkanes in three taxa of C3 and two taxa of C4 plants. \nAt Kohala, \u03b413C values of C3 plant leaves and lipids decreased 5\u2030 from the driest to the wettest sites, consistent with published data.  As expected, the carbon isotopic composition of C4 leaves varied less than 2.2\u2030 for sites that received less than 1060 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP).  At sites above 1060 mm MAP, C4 leaf \u03b413C values were depleted by up to 15\u2030 compared to drier sites.  This is likely due to shade-related carbon leakage from photosynthetic cells (which can result in a 5-10\u2030 depletion in \u03b413C), possibly enhanced by the influence of a forest canopy at the very wettest site.  Biomass \u03b413C values are lower under a closed canopy where understory plants fix carbon from 13C depleted, previously respired CO2.  The combination of these two factors could account for the unusually depleted leaf and lipid carbon isotope values observed at the wettest Kohala sites. \nIn all C3 plants and in buffel grass, carbon isotopic fractionation between leaves and lipids (13\u03b5lipid) ranged between 5\u2030 and 8\u2030, and did not vary with MAP.  In the C4 Kikuyu grass, 13\u03b5lipid was consistently lower, between 8 and 10\u2030, although it was more variable for samples from exceptionally wet sites.  Estimates of leaf \u03b413C for C3 and for C4 plants below 1060 mm MAP derived from analyses of alkanes preserved in ancient sediments are not sensitive to climate.  The apparent fractionation of carbon isotopes in leaves and lipids is sensitive to differences among plant functional type and species.\nHydrogen isotopic values of n-alkanes from all plant types did not vary with MAP, but differed consistently between plant functional types and sampled taxa.  The absence of a strong trend between fractionation and aridity supports the use of \u03b42Hlipid as a record of environmental waters at the time of lipid synthesis, provided that the relative contributions of each plant functional type can be identified with other proxies. \n\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10071], "author_name_tesi": "Doman, Christine Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Doman", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Christine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katherine Haines Freeman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Isotpe fractionation", "n-alkanes", "C4", "Kohala", "Kikuyu grass"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Reactivity and Epitaxy of Metal Thin-Films on Few-Layer Molybdenum Disulfide", "id": "14635acd184", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14635", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-09-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry were used to better understand the interactions between molybdenum disulfide and a large number of metal thin films.

The results allow one to predict the equilibrium reaction products resulting from the interaction of a metal and molybdenum disulfide. Overall, many early transition metals were predicted to react to form either a metal sulfide or ternary compound, while most late transition metals were predicted to be in equilibrium with molybdenum disulfide. \n\nExperimental investigation of the interaction between various metals and few-layer molybdenum disulfide found that Ti, Nb, Re, and Al were not reactive on molybdenum disulfide after annealing to 673 K for 4 h. On the other hand, Ni and Ag both diffused into the molybdenum disulfide (potentially into the van der Waals gaps between layers), with signs of diffusion of Ni appearing at temperatures as low as 473 K. The change of the Raman spectrum for molybdenum disulfide after indiffusion with Ni and Ag was investigated. This study is the first of Raman spectra changes due to transition metal indiffusion. Indiffusion of the contact metal has been shown to decrease contact resistance for Ag contacts to molybdenum disulfide system due to doping and improved carrier transport between the molybdenum disulfide layers beneath the contact. \n\nLastly, the crystallographic orientation between various metals deposited at room temperature and molybdenum disulfide was explored. Epitaxy of Pd, Ag, Al, and Zn on molybdenum disulfide was seen but Mn, Mo, Ru, Re, and Ni were not epitaxial. Metals with face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, and hexagonal close packed structures were tested, and a number (although not all) FCC and HCP metals were found to be epitaxial. The metals that were epitaxial on molybdenum disulfide all had a close packed plane with a hexagonal structure, a high homologous temperature, and a low barrier to surface diffusion on molybdenum disulfide---criteria that could apply to other metal/transition metal dichalcogenide systems.

First, residents who held a negative social representation of local recreation were found to be less aware of these opportunities.  Next, results supported literature which noted that long-term residents have more awareness than newer residents, but also indicated that awareness of return migrants did not differ from long-term residents.  Additionally, residents with higher levels of civic engagement were more likely to be aware of and participate in local recreation.  Finally, civic engagement was a stronger predictor than both migration history and social representation regarding awareness of and participation in local recreation.\n\tStudy results regarding awareness and participation generally performed as the literature predicted, but valuable information was gained from the research question that addressed the relationship between social representation and migration history.

In patients with autoimmune disease, GCs develop in the absence of overt infection (called spontaneous germinal centers, Spt-GCs). Altered selection of B cells within Spt-GCs promote the development of high-affinity and class-switched antibodies to self-antigens (autoAbs). Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a polygenic autoimmune disease that is characterized by the excessive production of autoAbs that target nuclear self-antigens, causing systemic inflammation and organ failure. Current SLE therapies reduce pathogenic autoAb titers and associated disease pathology by immunosuppression, leaving patients susceptible to lethal infections. A characteristic signature of interferon-associated genes is a known biomarker of SLE initiation and progression. Interferon (IFN) blocking therapies have been proposed for the treatment of SLE, but immunosuppression complications remain a continuing challenge. The objective of this study is to understand how Type 1 and 2 IFNs differentially regulate Spt-GCs to identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention with limited immunosuppression complications. Primary investigation into IFN-blocking therapies suggests that the GC pathway could be altered during IFN-blockade, necessitating detailed analysis of the mechanisms that control GC to improve SLE treatments. To study Spt-GCs in SLE, we use a preclinical model, B6.Sle1b mice, that carry the lupus-associated SLAM (signaling lymphocytic activation molecule) family genes derived from NZM2410 mice. B6.Sle1b mice have an increased frequency of Spt-GCs, elevated numbers of self-reactive B cells and higher anti-nuclear autoantibody (ANA) titers as a result of altered GC selection. Using the B6.Sle1b model of SLE, we discovered that GC-derived serum IgG AutoAb titers are altered by modulation of both type 1 IFN (T1IFN) and type 2 IFN (T2IFN, IFN\u03b3). B6.Sle1b mice that lack the receptor for type 1 IFN, (Sle1b.IFNaR1-/-) form smaller Spt-GCs with reduced titers of ANAs, whereas Sle1b.IFNgR1-/- mice fail to form Spt-GCs and also have reduced titers of ANAs. To determine how B cell intrinsic T1IFN and T2IFN signaling affects Spt-GC formation and activity, we used transgenic B cell transfer, bone marrow chimeras and conditional gene expression based approaches. We found that B cell intrinsic IFNgR1 expression and the associated downstream signaling pathways (STAT1 and Tbet) maintain a positive feedback signaling network that is required for the formation and regulation of Spt-GCs and elevated titers of ANAs. We also found that B cell intrinsic IFNaR1 signaling maintains Spt-GC structures by enhancing B cell receptor signaling to disrupt GC B cell selection. Collectively, these findings show that type 1 and type 2 IFNs differentially regulate Spt-GCs in SLE-prone mice, and these pathways can be further studied for the development of targeted therapeutics with limited immunosuppression complications.

In addition, primary care physician density was obtained from the Area Resource Files (ARF) data collected in 2003-2005 and linked to the BRFSS dataset for analysis. Key Measures: Diabetes prevalence was assessed by self-report of physician diagnosis. Analyses: State-level data diabetes prevalence from 1995 to 2005 was reported by each year. Prevalence for the 25 BRFSS county-level regions in Pennsylvania was reported for 2003-2005. The sociodemographic factors (age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education), known disease risk factors (obesity, hypertension, fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, and smoking), and primary care physician density were reported for 2003-2005. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between diabetes, demographics and disease risk factors at three time points (1995, 2000 and 2005) and in two geographic regions selected for having lower and higher prevalence of diabetes in 2003-2005. Results: Diabetes prevalence in Pennsylvania, which increased from 5.7% in 1995 to 8.1% in 2005, followed national trends, but exceeded them each year by approximately 1%.  A pattern of obesity becoming a more dominant risk factor for diabetes emerged over this time period. As expected in 2003-2005, the burden of disease was highest in Pennsylvania residents who were male, age 65 and above, non-white, obese, had hypertension, had no leisure time for physical activity, and were of lower SES (education and income levels); smoking was negatively associated with diabetes. Low intake of fruit and vegetables was positively associated with diabetes. Primary care physician density decreased the odds for reported diabetes. Significant differences in the prevalences of diabetes across the 25 BRFSS regions in 2003-2005 were observed. In two selected geographic regions, one with lower and another with higher diabetes prevalence than that of the state, different patterns of risk factor prevalence and associations with diabetes were observed; this analysis must be extended to other regions before firm conclusions can be drawn.

Only the final report deals directly with the purpose of this dissertation, to develop a simulation of sit to stand that can be used to examine performance of the sit to stand in the elderly, and exploited to examine the influence of strength training on sit to stand performance in the elderly.  The other three studies were used for the development of the simulation model.  The first study investigated the effect of squat depth on jump height.  Experimental subjects showed no difference in jump height in jumps from the deep and preferred positions.  The optimal squat depth for the simulated jumps was the lowest position the model was able to jump from.  Because jumping from a deep squat is rarely practiced, it is unlikely that these jumps are optimally coordinated.  \n\nThe second study examined how arm swing contributes to maximum vertical jump height.  There was an increase in jump height with arm swing.  The vertical velocity of the arms relative to the shoulder at takeoff was large enough to account for the performance enhancement.  The work produced by the shoulder extensors was more than sufficient to explain the increase in jump performance.  The work produced by the lower extremity muscles was slightly reduced in jumps with arm swing.  \n\nThe third study investigated the effect of chair height on sit to stand mechanics.  It was found that forward trunk movement prior to seat off decreased as seat height decreased.  This is the result of a higher initial hip angle in trials from low seat heights and forward trunk movement moving the hip extensors to a less favorable region of the force-length curve.  The reduction in trunk movement prior to seat off increases the load on the knee extensors, which are already heavily burdened as a result of high initial knee angles.\n\nThe fourth study examined the effect of strength training individual muscle groups on sit to stand performance.  It was found that strength training the hip extensors and the knee extensors produced similar improvements in performance.  These improvements were approximately one half of the improvement seen when training all muscles.  There was potentially better control of the movement when all muscle groups were trained; as demonstrated by a reduction in peak joint extension angular velocities and a change in the timing of the maximum horizontal momentum.  The results of these simulations suggest it is important to train all of the muscles rather than one specific muscle group for improving sit to stand performance.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6953], "author_name_tesi": "Domire, Zachary ", "last_name_ssi": "Domire", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zachary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Henry Challis", "Henry Joseph Sommer Iii", "Richard Carroll Nelson", "Neil Sharkey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Henry Challis, Committee Chair", "Henry Joseph Sommer Iii, Committee Member", "Richard Carroll Nelson, Committee Member", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["simulation", "chair rise", "biomechanics", "model"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A New Class of Bivariate Weibull Distribution to\naccommodate the Concordance Correlation\ncoefficient for Left-censored Data", "id": "23318", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10640", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In many clinical studies, Lin\u2019s concordance correlation coe\ufb03cient (CCC) is a common\ntool to assess the level of agreement of a continuous response measured under two\ndi\ufb00erent conditions.

The fuel-rich diffusion flame, which is located only a few millimeters away from the anode side of the SOFC, is used to reform the fuel and heat the SOFC. On the cathode side, an oxidizing gas is either stagnant or forced to pass over the face. The SOFC used is a 20mm diameter button cell with a Ni-based anode, a Hionic electrolyte (which is a material specially made by Fuel Cell Materials), and a strontium-doped lanthanum manganite (LSM) cathode.\nExperiments were conducted to study the effects of different parameters of the flame as well as the oxidizers being used. The total flame gas flow rate and the equivalence ratio (\u00f6) were tested using two different current collecting meshes for the cathode. It was found that when using a silver mesh, which has high electric conductivity, the SOFC preformed best at the highest flow velocities (1200 SCCM) and equivalence ratios (\u00f6), which produced a power output of 38.13 mW/cm2.\nThe SOFC was also tested to see how an impinging oxidizer affected the SOFC performance. Pure molecular oxygen was used as the oxidizer and produced the highest power density recorded when the equivalence ratio was the highest (72.64 mW/cm2 at \u00f6=2.0).

Nanoparticles suspended in laser dye solution are an example of a system that can facilitate this response. At sufficiently high scattering strength, fluorescent emission from dye solution undergoes multiple scattering events amongst the particles. This scattering extends the path length of light within the gain region, resulting in amplification of the emission wavelengths. Additionally, coherent resonance occurs with the scattering cavities made by the nanoparticles, which amplifies specific modes and results in lasing. The scattering events that govern these responses are a function of the nanoparticle characteristics relative to their surrounding medium. By using electric field enabled particle assembly techniques, parameters such as particle orientation, position, and concentration can be adjusted to influence random laser properties. Described here is the first example of nanoparticle assembly being used as a tool to control random lasing in a reconfigurable manner. Anisotropic titanium dioxide particle alignment is shown to tune the average effective particle scattering cross section, and in turn the lasing performance.

An estimated 225,000 new cases are diagnosed each year worldwide, resulting in 140,200 deaths annually.   Approximately 90% of primary ovarian cancers are epithelial in origin, and the most common presentation (75%) is in the advanced stages (stage III/IV).  Cytoreductive surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy serve as the major treatment modalities.  Initial clinical response is excellent; however, nearly 65% of advanced-staged patients relapse within 2 years of initial therapy.  Once ovarian cancer recurs, all subsequent treatments are palliative.  The cellular and molecular events involved in ovarian cancer pathogenesis need to be defined, and major improvements in treatment will require new therapies based on exploitation of biological pathways.\nDysregulation of cell proliferation is an integral part of the ovarian cancer phenotype.  One native biological regulatory system of cell replication in normal cells and a variety of cancers is the opioid growth factor (OGF) and its receptor, OGFr.  Chemically termed [Met5]-enkephalin, OGF is a constitutively active opioid peptide that is autocrine produced and secreted, and interacts with OGFr to delay the G1/S interface of the cell cycle by modulating cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory (CKI) pathways, without affecting cell survival.  The studies depicted in this thesis were aimed at establishing the role of the OGF-OGFr axis in the modulation of cell proliferation and determining the repercussions of modulating this axis on human ovarian cancer both in vitro and in vivo.\nThe first study evaluated the presence, mechanism, and role of the OGF-OGFr axis on the modulation of the growth of OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 human ovarian cancer cell lines.  OGF and OGFr were present and functional.  Exogenous OGF was observed to have a dose-dependent, serum-independent, reversible and receptor-mediated inhibitory action on cell proliferation that was dependent on RNA and protein synthesis.  The repressive effect of OGF on cell proliferation also was also observed in CAOV-3 and HEY ovarian cancer cell lines.  Endogenous OGF was found to be constitutively produced and tonically active on cell replicative activities, with neutralization of this peptide accelerating cell proliferation.  Silencing of OGFr by siRNA technology stimulated cell replication, and abolished the inhibitory actions of exogenous OGF, documenting its integral role in mediating the effects of endogenous and exogenous OGF.  The mechanism of OGF-OGFr action on DNA synthesis was related to the CKI pathways because knockdown of p16 and p21 in OVCAR-3 cells, and p21 in SKOV-3 cells eliminated OGF\u00a1\u00a6s inhibitory effect on growth.  These data are the first to report that the OGF-OGFr system is a native biological regulator of cell proliferation in human ovarian cancer cells using an in vitro model system.    \nThe next study determined whether OGF inhibits tumor growth in mice with established subcutaneous xenografts of ovarian cancer, and determined whether the combination of OGF biotherapy with taxol or cisplatin chemotherapy (the standard of care) provides an additive inhibitory effect on ovarian cancer proliferation and tumor growth.  Cell proliferation assays on SKOV-3 cells treated with OGF and/or taxol, or OGF and/or cisplatin, demonstrated that cell number and DNA synthesis were inhibited to a greater extent by combination treatments compared to individual treatments.  The action of OGF, but not taxol or cisplatin, was mediated by a naloxone sensitive receptor, and was reversible and not toxic. Tumor volumes in mice with established subcutaneous xenografts were reduced up to 50% by OGF, up to 50% by taxol, and up to 58% by cisplatin treatment, compared to saline administered controls.  Tumor volumes from the OGF plus taxol group were decreased 28% from mice treated with OGF alone, and 29% from mice treated taxol alone; tumor volumes in mice treated with OGF plus cisplatin were reduced 50% from mice treated with OGF alone, and 44% from mice treated with cisplatin alone.   Importantly, OGF treatment in mice receiving cisplatin provided a significant degree of protection against the toxic effects of cisplatin (weight loss) seen in mice receiving cisplatin treatment alone.  Evaluation of tumor tissue after 37 days of treatment revealed that taxol and cisplatin, but not OGF, induced apoptosis, while all treatments, markedly inhibited DNA synthesis and tumor angiogenesis; an additive inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis and angiogenesis was seen in mice receiving OGF with chemotherapies compared to mice receiving chemotherapy alone.  Both OGF and OGFr were detected in tumor tissue, and OGFr binding and expression was reduced up to 51% and 81%, respectively, by OGF treatment, revealing a feedback mechanism.  This preclinical evidence, demonstrates that OGF biotherapy markedly inhibits ovarian tumor growth in a non-toxic manner in vivo, and can be combined with taxol or cisplatin chemotherapy to provide an enhanced therapeutic benefit.  \nWe next investigated the repercussions of pharmacologically manipulating the OGF-OGFr axis in human ovarian cancer cells in vitro using the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (NTX), which is a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist that blocks the interaction of OGF and OGFr.  It is well understood that the response to opioid antagonist administration is a compensatory upregulation in the production of endogenous opioids/opioid receptors.  Pharmacokinetic and nociceptive studies have revealed that administration of a low dosage of NTX (LDN) in vivo, which blocks endogenous opioids from opioid receptors for a short period of time (4\u00a1V6 h) each day, provides a window of 18\u00a1V20 h for the upregulated opioids and opioid receptors to interact.  In vivo daily administration of a low dosage of NTX (LDN, 0.1 mg/kg) has been shown to inhibit progression of colorectal cancer and neuroblastoma in xenograft models of cancer and is suggested to target cell proliferation.  A tissue culture model of LDN, using short term NTX treatment, was established to investigate the mechanism of LDN in human ovarian cancer and to determine whether its action is independent of immune function and systemic factors.  A single application of short term NTX (10-5 M, 6h) to SKOV-3 cultures inhibited cell number by 21-28% between 48 and 96 h.  To determine which opioid peptide(s) mediate(s) the inhibitory actions of LDN on growth, cultures were exposed to various opioid peptides; under conditions and concentrations where OGF (10-6 M) inhibited cell number, none of the opioid peptides specific for the classical \u0192\u00dd, \u0192\u00d4, or \u0192\u00db opioid receptors altered growth.  To establish whether the inhibitory actions of LDN are invoked by endogenous OGF, as well as determine the involvement of a particular opioid receptor, an OGF neutralizing antibody, and siRNA\u00a1\u00a6s against the \u0192\u00dd, \u0192\u00d4, \u0192\u00db, and OGF receptors were administered in combination with short term NTX; neutralizing OGF and silencing of OGFr, but not \u0192\u00dd, \u0192\u00d4, or \u0192\u00db\u0192nopioid receptors, blocked the inhibitory action of LDN.  An evaluation of the effects of short term NTX on the expression of OGF (RT-PCR, Immunohistochemistry, radioimmunoassay) and OGFr (Northern blot, Western blot, Immunohistochemistry, receptor binding) revealed a translational, but not transcriptional, upregulation of both peptide and receptor.  To ascertain whether LDN\u00a1\u00a6s inhibitory action is related to decreased survival and/or proliferation, TUNEL, trypan blue staining, and BrdU incorporation were evaluated.  Beginning 12 h and persisting 66 h after a single application of short term NTX, DNA synthesis was decreased up to 48%, with no alterations in cell survival noted.  Silencing of p16 and/or p21 blocked the inhibitory action of short term NTX indicating a mechanism directed to the CKI pathways.  This study demonstrated that short term opioid receptor antagonism, the equivalent of LDN, inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation independent of immune function and systemic factors, through upregulation of the OGF-OGFr axis.  Upregulation of the OGF-OGFr axis by short term opioid receptor blockade with LDN may provide a novel target for biotherapy of ovarian cancer. \nThe next study evaluated whether LDN inhibits tumor growth in mice with established subcutaneous xenografts of ovarian cancer, and determined whether the combination of LDN biotherapy with taxol or cisplatin chemotherapy (the standard of care) provides an additive inhibitory effect on ovarian cancer proliferation and tumor growth.  Cell proliferation assays on SKOV-3 cells treated with LDN and/or taxol, or LDN and/or cisplatin, demonstrated that cell number and DNA synthesis rates were inhibited to a greater extent by combination treatments compared to individual treatments.  The action of LDN, but not taxol or cisplatin, was reversible and not toxic. Tumor volumes in mice with established subcutaneous xenografts were reduced up to 48% by LDN, up to 54% by taxol, and up to 54% by cisplatin treatment, compared to saline administered controls.  Tumor volumes from the LDN plus taxol group, were comparable to those in mice treated with LDN or taxol alone; however, tumor volumes in mice treated with LDN plus cisplatin were reduced 35% from mice treated with LDN alone, and 37% from mice treated with cisplatin alone.   Importantly, LDN treatment in mice receiving cisplatin provided a significant degree of protection against the toxic effects of cisplatin (weight loss) seen in mice receiving cisplatin treatment alone.  Evaluation of tumor tissue after 35 days of treatment revealed that taxol and cisplatin, but not LDN, induced apoptosis, while all treatments, markedly inhibited DNA synthesis and angiogenesis; an additive inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis and angiogenesis was seen in mice receiving LDN with cisplatin, but not LDN with taxol, compared to mice receiving chemotherapy alone.  Both OGF and OGFr were detected in tumor tissue.  Revealing the mechanism and compensatory upregulation of the OGF-OGFr axis, OGF expression was increased 37% by LDN treatment, and OGFr binding and expression was increased up to 133% and 46%, respectively, by LDN treatment, compared to saline administered controls.  This preclinical evidence, demonstrates that LDN biotherapy markedly inhibits ovarian tumor growth in a non-toxic manner in vivo, and can be combined with cisplatin, but not taxol chemotherapy to provide an enhanced therapeutic benefit.\nWe next investigated the effects of OGF or LDN on ovarian cancer tumor growth using what is considered to be a more clinically relevant model of human ovarian cancer, where cancer cells are injected and grown in the intraperitoneal cavity as opposed to subcutaneously.  Immediately after tumor cell inoculation, mice were treated with OGF, LDN, or an equivalent volume of saline.  At the end of 40 days of treatment, the number of tumor nodules was decreased 41% and 38% by OGF and LDN, respectively, and tumor mass was reduced 68% and 46%, by OGF and LDN, respectively, compared to saline administered controls.  This preclinical evidence, using the more clinically relevant ovarian cancer model, suggests that OGF or LDN biotherapy markedly inhibits ovarian tumor growth by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis, without inducing apoptosis.   \nMolecular regulation of tumor cell progression was studied in two independent experiments whereby constructs to overexpress OGFr or underexpress OGFr were established and characterized both in culture and subsequently in nude mice.  Using SKOV-3 cells, 5 clonal lines overexpressing OGFr were examined and demonstrated increases in OGFr protein expression, as measured by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry and Western immunoblotting.  OGFr binding assays of clonal lines revealed 51-154% increases in binding capacity compared to wild-type (WT) and empty vector (EV) controls; binding affinity was comparable in all groups. Under standard growth conditions, cell number in clonal lines overexpressing OGFr was decreased by 31-85%, and doubling times were extended 41-177% compared to WT and EV cultures.  Nude mice injected subcutaneously or intraperitoneally with clonal cell lines overexpressing OGFr had increased latencies to tumor formation, and the tumors were markedly decreased in volume/number, weight, and exhibited increases in OGFr expression compared to mice injected with WT or EV cells.  These data on the stable overexpression of OGFr indicate that OGFr is vital to cell replicative events in human ovarian cancer both in vitro and in vivo, and support treatments that amplify OGFr to decrease the growth of these neoplasias. \nshRNA constructs were prepared to knockdown OGFr in SKOV-3 cells; 2 clonal lines were examined.  OGFr protein expression was decreased up to 73% in clones compared to wild-type (WT) and empty vector (EV) controls; binding assays of clones revealed 50-55% decreases in binding capacity compared to controls.  Growth and DNA synthesis were increased 33-146%, and doubling times decreased 29-35% compared to WT and EV cultures.  Nude mice injected subcutaneously with cells underexpressing OGFr had an increased tumor incidence, decreased latency to tumor formation, and tumors were increased in volume and decreased in OGFr expression compared to WT and EV controls.  OGF treatment in mice with WT or EV tumors, but not OGFr underexpressing tumors, markedly inhibited tumor volume, weight, and DNA synthesis.  These data on the stable underexpression of OGFr demonstrate the critical nature of the OGF-OGFr axis in the progression of human ovarian cancer.   \nIn summary, upregulation of the OGF-OGFr axis by treatment with exogenous OGF, pharmacologic upregulation of OGF and OGFr by short term opioid receptor antagonism with LDN, or stable molecular overexpression of OGFr, all inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in a non-toxic manner.  This pre-clinical data supports treatment modalities that amplify OGF/OGFr to decrease the growth of these neoplasias.  The critical role of OGFr in the progression of this cancer was documented through experiments evaluating the repercussions of stably underexpressing OGFr, and will be important in understanding factors determining the success/failure of therapeutic modalities. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5268], "author_name_tesi": "Donahue, Renee N.", "last_name_ssi": "Donahue", "middle_name_ssi": "N.", "first_name_ssi": "Renee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Mclaughlin", "Patricia J Mc Laughlin", "Ian Stuart Zagon", "Ronald Paul Wilson", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Michael Verderame"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Mclaughlin, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia J Mc Laughlin, Committee Chair", "Ian Stuart Zagon, Committee Member", "Ronald Paul Wilson, Committee Member", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Michael Verderame, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ovarian Cancer", "Opioids", "Opioid Growth Factor (OGF)", "Opioid Growth Factor Receptor (OGFr)", "Naltrexone (NTX)", "Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN)"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Performance and Cost Effectiveness of Modular Block Retaining Walls\n", "id": "11369", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5617", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Modular block walls (MBWs), also known as segmental retaining walls (SRWs), continue to be a growing segment of the public retaining wall market.  While MBWs have long been popular in the private sector, estimates by the Federal Highway Administration show that MBWs have had a distinct growth over the last ten years in the public sector. Still, many state Departments of Transportation do not permit the use of MBWs based on expectations of poor performance.  This thesis presents information obtained from available literature including published papers and reports in regards to cost and performance of MBWs.  In addition, a telephone survey was conducted of thirty-two departments of transportation to determine which states utilize modular block walls, how cost effective modular block walls have been, and how they have performed in comparison to more traditional wall types.  The effectiveness of new freeze-thaw requirements was evaluated.  States not currently using modular block walls revealed their current concerns that discourage these DOTs from utilizing MBWs.  Based on the completed analysis and evaluation, advantages and disadvantages of MBWs are presented, and recommendations for successful implementation of MBWs are offered.       \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5607], "author_name_tesi": "Donahue, Steven J", "last_name_ssi": "Donahue", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Mian Wang", "Dr Mian Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Mian Wang, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Mian Wang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["performance of segmental retaining walls", "performance of modular block walls", "MSE walls", "mechanically stabilized earth walls", "masonry block walls", "SRW", "segmental retaining walls", "MBW", "modular block walls", "cost effectiveness of modular block walls", "freeze thaw durability", "DOT survey", "modular block wall advantages", "modular block wall disadvantages"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Application of Product Family Design Tools to Explosive Ordnance Disposal Robots\n", "id": "9159", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "887", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT \n  This thesis details the application of product family design tools to a future line of \nrobots. A number of design tools are discussed and applied using both marketing and \nengineering data related to the robot product family.

Each scenario had dozens of quantitative requirements \nand functional needs along with accompanying data to score the effectiveness of existing \nrobots. In order to reduce the number of variables for trade space exploration, the \nscenarios were grouped using fuzzy C-means clustering with respect to the scenarios\u2019 \nrequirements and functionality into 9 clusters based on the best fit to the data. Histograms \nwere also created for the individual scenarios and clusters to visualize the resulting \ndistributions, allowing noteworthy and difficult outliers to be quickly identified for future \ndiscussion. \n  To connect the mission scenarios to existing robot architectures, two quantitative \ndesign tools were applied to three existing third-party robots. The first design tool, \nGenerational Variety Index (GVI), used matrices to score future market needs that are not \ncurrently satisfied and determine which subsystems/modules will most likely need to be \nredesigned to satisfy these needs. The second design tool, Design Structure Matrix \n(DSM), examined internal connections and interfaces in the robots to determine how \nredesign in one subsystem would affect other subsystem. Both design tools highlighted \nthe subsystems and specifications that were most influential (or most influenced). \n  The final analysis combined both the mission scenario data and the design tools to \nexamine each subsystem or specification for use in the robot platform. For each \nsubsystem, the analysis explains whether it could satisfy all scenarios in a single (or a \nfew) forms, if standardization is possible in certain dimensions to reduce engineering costs; and for the more difficult-to-standardize subsystems, what redesign would make \nstandardization more possible.

Because of the long history of Chinese leisure, and because China has the largest population in the world, understanding Chinese leisure may greatly assist us in understanding the evolution of leisure in general and in predicting its future.\nIn this study, I use a secondary dataset to identify and compare leisure lifestyles, types of Chinese leisure, and leisure constraints in a variety of contexts across six Chinese cities: Hangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Chengdu, and Shenzhen. The data were collected by the Asia Pacific Center for the Study of Leisure (APCL), located in Hangzhou, China, from March to November, 2005.\nThe data collection was accomplished in two steps in the six Chinese cities. In the first step, because there is relatively little research on urban Chinese leisure lifestyles, the APCL used a face-to-face free-listing technique for the initial data collection. Because previous research has not reported how leisure activities are spent or how leisure constraints are perceived by Chinese urban people in the six cities, the free-listing technique can be viewed as the best way to explore how urban people pursue their leisure and identify their leisure constraints. In this study, the free-listing technique particularly helps researchers to use appropriate domains (leisure activities and constraints) because it ensures that the domains are culturally related (Weller & Romney, 1988). Moreover, the advantage of free listing is that leisure activities and constraints listed by the technique can be used in developing a larger survey.\nIn the second step, a questionnaire was created on the basis of the results of the free listing by the APCL. The survey consisted of two sections. The first section comprised leisure activity, leisure constraints, leisure satisfaction, and health items. The second section elicited socio-demographic information including location of residence, gender, income, educational level, family members, marital status, and sources of leisure information. Both the free-listing and the survey data were used for this study.\nThe findings of this study are similar to the results of previous leisure-activity studies of the U.S. population that found that media habits or mass media were major leisure activities pursued in the United States. Similarly, media habits (e.g., movies, reading, etc.) are considered the most important activities in terms of frequency of participation and importance of activities by urban Chinese. This study also found that social activities (visiting friends and relatives, dating, chatting, attending family gatherings) play important roles in Chinese urban daily life. Furthermore, the activities that were reported by the informants are more frequently and more importantly associated with passive leisure activities, which are identified by previous research. Passive leisure, as a form of leisure, continues to play a dominant role in the leisure activities of the Chinese urban population. Among the passive leisure activities pursued by the Chinese urban population, meditation is not only one form of leisure activity, it is also an alternative medicine that may contribute to enhance the Chinese urban population\u00a1\u00afs health. Furthermore, Chinese traditional culture may still influence urban people\u00a1\u00afs leisure preferences; modern urban Chinese people continue to seek mountains and water places for their leisure. At the same time, the findings of this study offer evidence that there are high consensuses on leisure activities by using an informants-by-informants matrix within the cities. Although all cities face very similar constraints on leisure, there is no consensus on constraints within cities. \n\tThe findings of the study indicate that for participation rates in primary leisure activities, the perceived importance of primary leisure activities is the same for some pairs of cities in subgroups. Urban Chinese in most pairs of cities face similar leisure constraints. The degrees of leisure satisfaction are the same between all pairs of cities in female, older, and younger groups.\nIn sum, this preliminary study, based on an analysis of existing data, is the first to apply the new systematic ethnographic approach to understanding intra-city and intercity variances on leisure activities and leisure constraints in a cross-cultural urban setting. This study also provides new insights that cognitive anthropology can make significant contributions to the comparative study in terms of inter-cultures and intra-culture for leisure research dominated by social psychology. Further findings will be discussed.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1888], "author_name_tesi": "Dong, Erwei ", "last_name_ssi": "Dong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Erwei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Leisure Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Garry Chick", "Geoffrey Clay Godbey", "Duarte Morais", "Edward Paul Durrenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Garry Chick, Committee Chair", "Geoffrey Clay Godbey, Committee Member", "Duarte Morais, Committee Member", "Edward Paul Durrenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["leisure", "China", "constraints"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Characterization of Distributed Performance of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells under Low Humidity Conditions", "id": "7275", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5076", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nLow humidity operation is helpful to restrain flooding within polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs), as well as to reduce system overhead.  However, low humidity operation also brings challenge on membrane hydration.  In order to better understand the water transport in PEFCs under low humidity condition, as well as provide detailed experimental validation for development of advanced modeling of PEFCs, an experimental study combining simultaneous current, resistance and species distribution measurements was conducted, and a quasi-two-dimensional mass transport model was developed to analyze the effect of transport properties of fuel cell materials on water management for low humidity operation.\nTwo segmented fuel cells with very different flow field configurations and thermal boundary conditions were designed and developed for this study.  The actively control on the backing plate temperature of the improved design enables an isothermal boundary condition.  Two new techniques for in-situ species measurement, a Micro Gas Chromatograph (Micro GC) and a Real Time Gas Analyzer (RTGA), have been applied with the ability to measure up to saturated levels in the flow stream.\nTypical PEFC steady-state and transient behaviors under low humidity operating conditions were investigated respect to various operation parameters, including inlet humidity, reactant stoichiometry, temperature, and pressure.  The results show that, under reduced humidity conditions the anode water content has dominating effect on current density profile.  The current distribution curves look qualitatively similar to water mole fraction in the anode curves, and the inverse of the high frequency resistance (HFR) profiles.  Based on these experimental results, a characteristic profile of current density, species, and HFR distributions is proposed for low humidity operation.  The change of thermal boundary does affect the distributed performance, although the essential distribution profiles are maintained, reaffirming the importance of thermal management on water management.  \nThe dynamic response of fuel cell performance to step change in voltage is heavily affected by humidification condition.  For a dry cathode condition, the anode water content adjusts relatively slowly from high to low current, while for a dry cathode condition, the adjustment is relatively fast.  For both cases, the current density adjustment time corresponds to the time of mass adjustment in the anode side, not the cathode side, indicating a non-linear water content profile in the electrolyte membrane.\nWith low inlet humidities, the fuel cell performance is more limited by insufficient electrolyte hydration instead of depletion of oxygen.  In general, the higher overall input relative humidity results in the higher bulk cell performance, despite very different local distributions.  The humidifying effect from water production on the cathode catalyst layer is another critical factor for the performance PEFCs under low humidity condition.  Higher cathode stoichiometry, elevated cell temperature, and lower exit pressure can all increase the amount of water required for humidification and reduce the humidifying effect of water production, resulting in lower cell performance.  However, a high overall inlet relative humidity can negatively impact the cell performance under the combination of high temperature and low pressure due to the extremely low oxygen concentration.\nA mass transport model was developed to examine the transport properties of Gore SELECT\u00810\u20263 MEAs, as well as be a tool to look at ideal low humidity operation design.  The mass transport model found that the water diffusion coefficient in Gore SELECT\u00810\u20263 reinforced membrane roughly equals the coefficient in Nafion\u00810\u20263 membrane.  It was also detected that the mass transport resistance of porous gas diffusion media can create considerable water activity difference between the gas flow channel and the catalyst layer, which boosts the humidifying effect of generated water.  The relatively high binary diffusion coefficient of H2O/H2 in the anode compared to the air cathode contributes to the dominating effect of local anode water profiles on local cell performance.  These findings also provide direction to the development of MEA for low humidity operation.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5052], "author_name_tesi": "Dong, Qunlong ", "last_name_ssi": "Dong", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qunlong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Matthew M Mench", "Chao Yang Wang", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "Kendra V Sharp"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Matthew M Mench, Committee Chair", "Chao Yang Wang, Committee Member", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Member", "Kendra V Sharp, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell", "Low Humidity", "Current Distribution"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Thermal Response Modeling and Thermodynamic Analysis of Horizontal Wellbore Fluids", "id": "22360", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10287", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Wellbore models are required for integrated reservoir management studies as well as the optimization of production operations.

This study conducted a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis to interpret thermal response of horizontal wellbore fluids. A generalized wellbore thermal response model (\u03b7_s-driven model) is derived starting from 1-D conservative mass, momentum and energy balance equations. Steady-state velocity, pressure and temperature profiles are presented along with its single-phase and two-phase solution procedures.  Steady-state applications are conducted and discussed. In steady state, both single-phase and two-phase flows are considered in both openhole and perforated wellbore conditions. Both the homogeneous and drift-flux models are implemented in two-phase flow, together with the comparison of results between the two models. Results show that for single-phase flow, oil and water are heated, while gas is cooled along the horizontal wellbore; thermal behavior of wellbore fluid is driven by wellbore inclination, flowrate, roughness, radius and completion type. When two-phase flow appears, a temperature derivation compared with single-phase case can be detected from temperature profiles. The effects of each thermal factor on overall thermal response are also discussed in the study for both horizontal and inclined wellbores.

Before leakage power becomes the dominant part in the power budget, disruptive emerging technologies are needed.\n\nFortunately, many new types of non-volatile memory technologies are now evolving.  For example, emerging non-volatile memories such as Spin-Torque-Transfer RAM (MRAM, STTRAM), Phase-Change RAM (PCRAM), and Resistive RAM (ReRAM) show their attractive properties of high access performance, low access energy, and high cell density.

The goal of this thesis topic is to develop a method to improve the accuracy of the fetal ECGs by applying digital filtering techniques to weaken and even remove interference signals including the maternal signal and echo noise. The experiments confirmed that the frequency domain non-power normalized sequential processing removes most maternal interference and applying the adaptive comb filter as the very last step further refines the result. Adaptive filtering techniques are applied to self-adjust the filter parameters to provide the optimal performance of the filtering process. A sequential filtering structure with linear prediction (LPC), an adaptive noise canceller (ANC), and an adaptive comb filter (ACF) was determined to by Matlab simulation. Critical values for several important adaptive filter parameters such as optimal descending step size, iteration numbers and order, and filter coefficients were also determined during the experiments. This thesis presents a theory of how LPC-ANC-ACF sequential processing is capable to extract fetal signals from noninvasive abdominal measurements. Results are presented to demonstrate that 1) frequency domain processing is more effective than time domain processing in signal pre-process stage, 2) multi-channel adaptive processing is more accurate than signal channel processing, and 3) the adaptive comb filter processing has a better performance in extracting fetus signal than non-adaptive does. In addition, results illustrate that sequential LPC-ANC processing followed by comb filtering is more effective than direct looping these three stages while the sequential in-loop LPC-ANC-ACF processing is more effective than the single ACF processing.

For a given system, the Pareto Frontier is the set of parameters that possess the state of results for which it is impossible to make any one design variable better off without making at least one other variable worse off.  A relatively flat Pareto Frontier, found from altering the design variables makes using a typical goal seek routine difficult.  However, improvements can still be realized either through a typical goal-seeking approach or by using a more interactive approach.  \nThe contribution of this work is applying a CFD based interactive optimization method to a very mature intake port design.  This thesis has shown that even an intake port worked on for multiple decades can be improved using computer aided engineering tools as well as current-day engineering optimization practices and knowledge.  The outcome of this research is an improvement to an already very mature intake port design based on CFD solutions and a low-level optimization approach.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12700], "author_name_tesi": "Donnelly, Michael J", "last_name_ssi": "Donnelly", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Justin Kyle Watson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Justin Kyle Watson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["CFD", "optimization", "induction system"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Developments in the Teaching of Engineering Electromagnetics for Improvement in Student Interest and Understanding\n", "id": "28734", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12402", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The study of electromagnetics, one of the least popular undergraduate specializations in the field of electrical engineering, focuses on the study of Maxwell\u2019s Equations which govern how information can travel as electromagnetic waves through open air. While some sparse analogies can be drawn between electromagnetic waves in air and real waves on a string, electromagnetic theory is extremely intricate to visualize and is therefore both difficult to teach and difficult to learn. \nAt the Pennsylvania State University, the introductory electromagnetics class for undergraduates teaches concepts such as transmission lines, static and time-varying electric and magnetic fields, antennas, and radiation through lectures and textbook problem-solving sessions and sometimes includes a few activities over the course of the semester that require the use of MATLAB. The problem is that this teaching structure lacks connection to applicable, real-world examples, a primary factor in drawing students\u2019 interest. Without this connection, many students develop a sense that these mathematical theories are not of practical use which results in the avoidance of more advanced courses in electromagnetics. As modern wireless technology advances, individuals with a strong understanding of electromagnetics continue to become more valuable. Low undergraduate interest and high demand for the electromagnetic specialization poses a problem. \nIn some fields more than others, hands-on experience is a necessary part of learning. In engineering, many concepts simply cannot be fully taught in a lecture hall or out of a textbook. The aspects of teaching which cause students to retain the material they have learned \u2013 two of the most important being motivating students to learn and sparking students' interest \u2013 often pertain less to the material being taught and more to the method by which the material is presented to the students. In the long term, the plan is to create a laboratory component for this electromagnetics class in which the students will spend two hours every week complementing what they have learned in lecture and homework problems with hands-on experiments related to real-world problems. For the purpose of this thesis, two of these new laboratories have been developed, implemented, and measured against the pre-existing MATLAB activities.\nThese new labs introduce the students to measurement devices, such as network analyzers and anechoic chambers, in combination with a technical computing language such as MATLAB as a tool to create a visual representation of complex concept, transforming the students\u2019 understanding from mathematical theory into mathematical reality. In addition, the students gain first-hand experience with the same equipment and software used to take measurements and perform analysis in both advanced research and industry.

Rational vaccine design requires a mechanistic understanding of how T cells are activated in vivo. Thus, we sought to examine the requirements of the direct and cross-priming pathways of CD8+ T cell activation as well as examine the antigen processing and presentation pathways available to a model antigen when expressed by viral vaccine vectors. Investigation of the requirements for direct and cross-priming revealed that the two pathways utilize different pools of antigen. Direct presentation requires newly synthesized, rapidly degraded antigen while cross-priming requires long-lived stable antigen. Additionally, antigen donor cells had no requirement for proteasomal processing, protein synthesis or vesicular transport of the antigen or other cellular factors in order to donate antigen to the cross-priming pathway in vivo.  Investigation of the antigen processing and presentation pathways available to a model antigen, OVA, when expressed from viral vectors produced unexpected results. We found that recombinant Vaccinia Virus (rVV) expressed OVA was permitted to access the TAP-independent cross-priming pathway- a pathway which OVA is normally unable to access. Although rVV expression permitted the model antigen to access an additional antigen processing and presentation pathway, recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (rVSV) expression stimulated 5-\nfold more model antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Initially, rVSV-expressed OVA also appeared to require TAP for MHC class II presentation.  However, subsequent experiments revealed that\nthe lack of presentation in TAP knockout mice was not due to TAP-dependent MHC class II presentation of rVSV-expressed OVA but instead due to a lack of antigen presenting cell subsets\nin the gamma-irradiated TAP knockout mice.  Together these findings have broad implications\nfor the rational design of vaccines aimed at the generation of protective T cell responses.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3343], "author_name_tesi": "Donohue, Keri B", "last_name_ssi": "Donohue", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Keri", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Charles Norbury", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "Leslie Joan Parent", "Todd Schell", "John Warren Wills", "Charles H Lang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Charles Norbury, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Chair", "Leslie Joan Parent, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "John Warren Wills, Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["antigen presentation", "T cell activation", "cross-priming", "antigen processing", "vaccine vector"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "The Whirlpool and the Mountain: Scenes of Cannibalistic Worlding in American Literature", "id": "26270", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "11681", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Throughout this dissertation, I argue that the contrapuntal arrangement of mountains and whirlpools has framed and revealed scenes of cannibalistic worlding in the literatures of the Americas since the period of discovery to the present day.

This may be the kind of remaking that leads to the whirling together of European, African, Asian, and American sources into new poetic symbols, or it may be a negative, but still cannibalistic poetics of undoing, a consuming and negating of alterity that empowers the devourer to remake the emptied world, which is a world no longer, in his or her own image.\nScenes of cannibalistic worlding are contrapuntal sites where American literature emerges as the heterotopic/heterotropic translation of \u201cworld literature,\u201d the consumption and attempted annihilation of the same, or, however paradoxically, both at the same time.

Insect-feeding richness remained low on fossil leaf floras until the late Paleocene. However, Mexican Hat, a fossil plant locality in southeastern Montana with a typical, low-diversity \"disaster flora,\" uniquely exhibits high damage diversity compared to all known local and regional early Paleocene sites, on nearly all its plant hosts. The locality is in the Lebo Member of the Fort Union Formation (ca. 65 Ma), and the flora is dominated by four widespread, unrelated leaf species that show minimal damage elsewhere: Platanus raynoldsii, Juglandiphyllites glabra, Zizyphoides flabella, and Cercidiphyllum genetrix. We investigated whether the high insect damage diversity at Mexican Hat was more likely related to the survival of Cretaceous insects from refugia or to an influx of novel Paleocene taxa. We compared damage on 1073 leaf fossils from Mexican Hat to over 9000 terminal Cretaceous leaf fossils from the Hell Creek Formation of nearby southwestern North Dakota. A supporting data set of over 9000 local and regional early and late Paleocene leaf fossils from the Fort Union Formation of North Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming was also used for comparison. We described the entire insect-feeding ichnofauna at Mexican Hat and focused on leaf mines because they are typically host-specialized and preserve a number of morphological features that allow for detailed comparisons and potential identification of mining culprits. Eight mine morphotypes attributable to three orders of insects are found at Mexican Hat. We found all of them to be unique to the site except for one, a lepidopteran mine also found on C. genetrix at late Paleocene Wyoming sites. Not only is there no\nevidence linking any Cretaceous mines with those found at Mexican Hat, there is also no conclusive evidence for the survival of any Cretaceous leaf miners over the K-Pg boundary regionally, even on the well-sampled, surviving plant families Platanaceae and Cercidiphyllaceae.

Most of what we know about the response of terrestrial ecosystems to the catastrophe comes from a small area in Western Interior North America (WINA), severely limiting understanding of global recovery patterns. However, recent paleontological evidence from Patagonia, Argentina suggests that extinction and recovery patterns may differ from WINA. I present analyses of the response of plant-insect associations on fossil leaves from the latest Cretaceous to early Paleocene of Chubut, Patagonia, Argentina. The diversity of insect herbivory decreased from the latest Cretaceous to early Paleocene, but returned to pre-extinction levels within ca. 4 million years, compared to 9 million years in WINA. No evidence for survival of the diverse Cretaceous leaf-mining fauna was found on angiosperms in Patagonia. However, novel insect damage types occur at all Danian localities in Patagonia providing additional evidence for a more rapid recovery compared to WINA.\n\tAlthough plant-insect associations were negatively impacted during the mass extinction, many extant plant and insect groups first appeared in the early Cenozoic. During the early Paleogene, a rainforest biome stretched across Gondwana. Many floral elements from early Paleogene Patagonia have affinities to extant rainforests in Australasia and Southeast Asia, including Agathis (Araucariaceae), a conifer genus. Agathis occurs in early Paleocene, early and early/middle Eocene, and possibly latest Cretaceous floras from Patagonia and is associated with diverse insect herbivory. The genus probably tracked rainforest environments throughout its history, potentially providing stability for associated herbivore communities. To examine whether insects and fungi established long-term, host-specialized associations on Agathis, I compared damage on fossil and extant Agathis. Similar associations on fossil and extant Agathis include blotch mines, which are found on Cretaceous and Paleogene leaves, suggesting associational survival through the extinction. Other similarities include diaspidid scale insects, external foliage feeding, and rust fungi. The associations suggest the establishment of conservative associations tracking the genus through range shifts and environmental changes.

Combinations of epigenetic modifications affect gene expression through the \u00a1\u00a5histone code\u00a1\u00a6 in a synergistic or antagonistic fashion.  These modifications are dynamically regulated allowing chromatin to transition between transcriptionally active or silent states.  Thus, epigenetic marks arranged on chromatin function as a fundamental regulatory mechanism to control eukaryotic transcription.  \n   Numerous residues located on histones are covalently modified by regulatory enzymes.   Specifically, arginine residues located on core histone N-terminal tails may be mono-methylated, asymmetrically or symmetrically di-methylated.  These arginine isoforms affect gene expression through two possible consequences: creation of possible binding sites for proteins and disruption of potential hydrogen bonding.  Thus, methylated arginine residues function as crucial epigenetic marks.  \n   Throughout this study, the histone modifying enzyme protein arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4), which catalyzes the deimination or demethylimination of arginine and mono-methyl arginine, was examined.  PAD4 dynamically regulates arginine residues by producing citrulline, an unconventional amino acid.  Although PAD4 modifies both arginine and mono-methyl arginine, there has been no evidence supporting that PAD4 regulates the di-methyl form.  My studies present data indicating PAD4 may catalyze the \u00a1\u00a5demethylation\u00a1\u00a6 of di-methyl arginine through a novel regulatory mechanism.\n   Furthermore, two compounds were used to study the repressive effects of histone citrullination on gene expression.  The first compound, Cl-amidine, irreversibly inhibits PAD4 activity thus preventing the dynamic regulation of arginine residues.  The second compound, resveratrol, increases expression of p53 target genes.  MCF-7 cells treated with either compound displayed elevated expression of the TGF-\u0192\u00d2 family member NSAID activated gene-1 (NAG-1).  Chromatin immunoprecipitation following treatment with resveratrol revealed reduced levels of histone citrullination and increased levels of histone arginine methylation.  Together, these studies indicate that PAD4 negatively regulates the transcription of NAG-1 through citrullination of the promoter nucleosomes.\n   MCF-7 cells treated with either compound showed reduced levels of growth, a possible downstream effect of the up-regulated tumor suppressor NAG-1.  Following translation and secretion, this protein has been postulated to function through membrane bound receptors.  Immunostaining against NAG-1 showed increased translocation to the cellular membranes after resveratrol treatment, indicating the protein may be inducing apoptosis.  Thus, the inhibition of proliferating MCF-7 cells by resveratrol or Cl-amidine may be, in part, due to the increased expression of NAG-1.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4937], "author_name_tesi": "Doret, Patrick Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Doret", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Patrick", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yanming Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yanming Wang, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["NSAID Activated Gene-1", "Peptidylarginine Deiminase 4", "Citrullination"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Detecting ENSO Period Changes in a Proxy Record Spanning the Last Millennium \n\n", "id": "8668", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2908", "abstract_tesi": "Anthropogenic activities have increased radiative climate forcings, causing widespread changes to the climate system.

Further, MPF households are more likely than other households to be characterized by single parenthood, poverty, and low parental education and underemployment. Using a life course perspective and social stress theories as a guide, I provide evidence from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979-2006 which suggests that MPF represents a theoretically important constellation of events that have the potential to disrupt day-to-day life, change family roles, create ambiguity, and introduce chronic stressors into the home that are associated with significant declines in maternal well being over the long-term. This project also considers whether having multiple partner fertility makes women more vulnerable to stressful life experiences. Overall, there was little support of differential vulnerability hypothesis, however, there were several significant interactions which provided surprising results. For example, as the number of residential partners increased, women with single partner fertility saw larger declines in mental health than women with multiple partner fertility. Likewise, single partner fertility mothers were more likely than multiple partner fertility mothers to see declines in physical health as time in poverty increased, and saw fewer gains in mental health and depression as time employed increased. Similarly, among MPF women, Hispanic and African American mothers had higher levels of physical health, mental health, and depression than White mothers. Although these findings were unexpected, they were not without precedent in other literatures, and they provide an important new framework for understanding serial parents who face cumulative disadvantages.&#8195;\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [993], "author_name_tesi": "Dorius, Cassandra J.", "last_name_ssi": "Dorius", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Cassandra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alan Booth", "Alan Booth", "Paul Amato", "Valarie Elizabeth King", "Daphne Hernandez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alan Booth, Dissertation Advisor", "Alan Booth, Committee Chair", "Paul Amato, Committee Member", "Valarie Elizabeth King, Committee Member", "Daphne Hernandez, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multiple partner fertility", "maternal mental health", "maternal physical health", "family instability"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DEMYSTIFYING INTER-COUNTRY INEQUALITY: DATA, MEASURES, AND LONG-RUN TRENDS IN THE INTER-COUNTRY AND GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION OF HUMAN WELL-BEING\n", "id": "11051", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5594", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this research I argue that past and future trends in inter-country and global inequality can be better explained and predicted by giving greater attention to key methodological and theoretical insights that span disciplinary boundaries. I propose a unifying framework for the study of inter-country inequality in non-pecuniary variables that explicitly links innovation diffusion to inequality and argues for a long-run view of world inequality trends. I suggest that the use of formal measures of inequality in the study of inequality trends for variables that are bounded or that can be expressed in complementary form (e.g. literacy and illiteracy) often violates the welfare and anonymity principles. Studies of convergence that rely on limited dependent variables are better served by the standard deviation than by conventional mean-standardized measures of inequality. To test these ideas, I collected national-level estimates of health (life expectancy at birth), fertility (crude birth rates and total fertility rates), education (primary school enrollment rates), income (GDP per capita), and population size for the majority of the world\u2019s countries and people going back to the early 1800s. Using these data, I provide long-run estimates of between-country inequality trends over most of the last two centuries. I find that the long-run inequality trends in key domains have followed a remarkably similar pattern of first rising and then falling inter-country inequality. In all three domains, inter-country inequalities were low in the early and mid 1800s, then began to rise through the early and mid 1900s. Between-country inequalities in fertility, health, and education have declined throughout much of the last half of the 20th century.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5585], "author_name_tesi": "Dorius, Shawn F", "last_name_ssi": "Dorius", "middle_name_ssi": "F", "first_name_ssi": "Shawn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Glenn A Firebaugh", "Glenn A Firebaugh", "Duane Francis Alwin", "Jenny Trinitapoli", "Leif Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Glenn A Firebaugh, Dissertation Advisor", "Glenn A Firebaugh, Committee Chair", "Duane Francis Alwin, Committee Member", "Jenny Trinitapoli, Committee Member", "Leif Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fertility", "measures of inequality", "global inequality", "health", "education", "income"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Ohmic contacts to compound semiconductor transistors\n", "id": "12401", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5094", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis addresses Ohmic contacts to InAlSb/InAs high electron mobility transistor\n(HEMT) heterostructures and InGaAs epilayers.

The increase in contact resistance of Pd/Pt/Au contacts by more than a factor of 2 after a 1 week, 225 \u00b0C aging cycle is discussed in light of the interfacial reactions that occur during aging.

There are currently systems that control a vehicle\u2019s motion; however, many such systems rely on sensors and equipment that is attached to the vehicle itself, are designed for passenger vehicles, or utilize a model-free control approach. In contrast to these existing systems, the goal of this work is to design a system that does not require any sensing or major computing equipment to be located on the vehicle and utilizes a model-based control approach to back a tractor-trailer to a loading dock location. Simulations are carried out, as well as camera-based experimental tests using a 1:14 scale R/C tractor-trailer vehicle.\n\nThe practicality of using a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) unit for vehicle pose detection is also explored. For guiding the truck to the loading dock location, a state-space path-following controller is used. Also, wireless communication is enabled between a computer workstation and the vehicle, which allows for autonomous guidance of the vehicle. Experiments showed rough agreement with simulated behavior, but discrepancies were found between the two approaches. For example, in experimental tests using a dock-mounted LiDAR unit to detect vehicle pose, some vehicle pose configurations could not be detected. However, it is concluded that LiDAR units could still be useful sensors for vehicle pose detection if implemented using more than one sensor.

The vertical orientation of the head-leg-trunk segments, high center of mass, large number of joints, and narrow base of support contribute to making the body mechanically unstable. We study multi-muscle synergies involved in the control of vertical posture. For most of the studies to be presented, we define synergies as task-specific organizations of elemental variables, which stabilize particular performance variables, in a sense of reducing their variability across repetitive trials. We use a computational method of identifying and analyzing muscle synergies, based on the uncontrolled manifold (UCM) hypothesis. UCM analysis is performed in the space of hypothetical elemental variables (M-modes) during repetitive or cyclic whole body tasks. As such, the analysis involves two steps. First, M-modes have to be identified over sets of trials at similar tasks with different parameters. Second, variance in the magnitude of the M-modes has to be analyzed with respect to particular performance variables over repetitive attempts at the same task. More specifically, we studied the multi-muscle coordination during the performance of cyclic whole-body voluntary movements (sway) in the anterior-posterior (AP) direction and production of the moment of force around the vertical axis of the body (MZ). Three studies were performed assuming the existence of at least two levels of control with synergies possible at each level. At the higher level, values or time profiles of specific mechanical variables (COP or MZ trajectory) are stabilized by covariation of magnitudes of M-modes. The hierarchically lower level is the level where M-modes are formed. This lower level ensures proportional involvement of muscles within a group; in other words, it defines the direction of an eigenvector in muscle activation space corresponding to a M-mode. The main findings of the studies are: (1) The UCM method allows to quantify multi-muscle synergies; (2) Postural muscles are united into a small set of M-modes similar across subjects and task parameters for simple sway tasks; (3) The number of significant M-modes and their composition change when the tasks are performed in more challenging condition; (4) Synergies stabilizing performance variables can be built on different sets of M-modes.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [65], "author_name_tesi": "Dos Santos, Alessander ", "last_name_ssi": "Dos Santos", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alessander", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Latash", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky", "Semyon Slobounov", "David A.

Despite a high incidence, its pathogenesis is still poorly understood, hence limiting treatment strategies. Furthermore, since CLL is predominantly a disease of the elderly, numerous therapeutic strategies are unsuitable due to limited physical fitness of the patient.  Therefore, the CLL remains incurable for most patients. Further research is needed to develop novel therapeutic strategies. \nCeramide is a \u2018tumor suppressor\u2019 sphingolipid known to regulate differentiation, senescence and cell cycle arrest. While a large body of work reveals the mechanism of nanoliposomal ceramide (CNL)-induced cell death in several types of cancers, the effect in CLL remains unclear. This study investigates the effect of CNL in CLL and deciphers the key signaling mechanisms mediating CNL-induced cell death. We have shown that CNL selectively induces cell death in CLL cells by targeting the Warburg effect through reducing levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), with no detrimental effects on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Additionally, CNL treatment results in tumor regression in an in vivo murine model of CLL. Several reports in the literature have shown that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is constitutively phosphorylated on serine-727 in CLL and that STAT3 might be a therapeutic target in this disease. We demonstrate that CNL suppresses STAT3 phosphorylation at both tyrosine-705 and serine-727 by inhibiting multiple upstream kinases that include Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and protein kinase C. This suppression in STAT3 phosphorylation and the subsequent downregulation of STAT3 transcriptional activity mediates CNL-induced cell death in CLL. Recent work in the literature has uncovered that STAT3 phosphorylated at serine-727 associates with mitochondrial components and regulates the respiratory\nchain. Overactivation of mitochondrial STAT3 phosphorylated at serine-727 confers viability and stress protection to CLL cells. Our initial results demonstrate that CNL treatment reduces mitochondrial STAT3 levels, which might also be critical to the cell death induction. \nTaken together, our results suggest that inhibition of glycolytic respiration and inhibition of STAT3 transcriptional activity are key signaling mechanisms of CNL-induced cell death in CLL cells. Additionally, we also speculate that inhibition of STAT3-dependent mitochondrial respiration is also critical for induction of cell death by CNL treatment. We conclude that CNL could potentially be an effective therapy for CLL. Overall, this work emphasizes targeting the sphingolipid pathway and development of sphingolipids-based therapeutics for cancer. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11473], "author_name_tesi": "Doshi, Ushma Atul", "last_name_ssi": "Doshi", "middle_name_ssi": "Atul", "first_name_ssi": "Ushma", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Mark Kester", "Charles H Lang", "Dr Thomas Loughran", "Hong Gang Wang", "David F Claxton", "Jin Yang", "Richard Robert Young"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Mark Kester, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles H Lang, Committee Chair", "Dr Thomas Loughran, Committee Member", "Hong Gang Wang, Committee Member", "David F Claxton, Special Member", "Jin Yang, Committee Member", "Richard Robert Young, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chronic lymphocytic leukemia", "ceramide", "Warburg effect", "STAT3", "cell death"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THE ECOLOGY OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS\u2019 ACADEMIC ADJUSTMENT\n\n", "id": "7324", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "263", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Study 1 explored connections between youth\u2019s time in out-of-school activities and school engagement.

Results showed more time in extracurricular activities was associated with greater school self-esteem and school bonding.  More time spent on homework was associated with greater school bonding for boys.  More time watching television was associated with lower school self-esteem and school bonding.  Study 2 examined the relation between experiences with discrimination and school engagement as well as the role of racial socialization and ethnic identity as protective factors among 148, 6th - 12th grade African American adolescents from working/middle class two-parent families.  Results documented that greater experience with discrimination at school was associated with lower school self-esteem and school bonding.  Parent racial socialization had additive effects on school self-esteem and school bonding, but did not moderate the association between discrimination and school engagement.  Ethnic identity moderated the relation between discrimination and school bonding:  When girls experienced more discrimination and had lower ethnic identity, they had lower school bonding.

Corporate websites are being increasingly accessed via smart phones and companies are scrambling to offer a mobile-friendly user experience on their sites. However, very little is known about how interactivity in the mobile context affects user responses to media content. In order to fill this gap, this dissertation investigates the effects of two types of interactivity upon individuals\u2019 attitudes toward mobile websites as well as relational outcomes. An online 2 (modality interactivity: high vs. low) x 3 (message interactivity: control vs. low vs. high) between-participants factorial experiment was conducted. Modality interactivity was operationalized in terms of the number of interaction techniques employed in a mobile website, whereas message interactivity was operationalized as the degree to which the interface displayed message exchanges in a threaded manner. \n\tFindings from this study suggest that users psychologically discriminate between the different interaction techniques available on mobile websites. When individuals were given various ways of interacting with the website content (i.e., high modality interactivity), they were more likely to express enjoyment and be engaged in website interaction, which in turn yielded better website attitudes and behavioral intentions. Modality interactivity also significantly predicted relational outcomes, and this relationship was mediated by enjoyment and user engagement, with the former preceding the latter. In the case of message interactivity, the analysis revealed two psychological processes leading to positive website attitudes and website behavioral intentions: a cognitively effortful process via perceived contingency and dialogue and a heuristic process via perceived contingency and enjoyment. Furthermore, the level of power usage moderated the effects of the two types of interactivity on negative outcomes, including perceived bells and whistles and perceived distractions. Individuals scoring lower on power usage showed more negative outcomes when the mobile website offered higher level of interactivity, while the opposite was true for individuals scoring higher on power usage. In general, power users prefer interactivity features more than non-power users. Theoretical as well as practical implications of these findings for the study of mobile interactivity in a public relations context are discussed.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8601], "author_name_tesi": "Dou, Xue ", "last_name_ssi": "Dou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xue", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["S.

Specifically, investigating the indirect influence of the U.S. sponsored Al-Hurra Television on Moroccan viewers and Arab public opinion is a main purpose of the study. The overall theoretical approach to the investigation of Al-Hurra Television here is based on the insights of indirect media influence theories, particularly Third Person Effect, to probe the \u201ceffects\u201d that audiences assume this type of media has on public opinion. In that sense, this study assesses the \u201cperceived effects\u201d of Al-Hurra Television through the prism of presumed influence. It provides the first cross cultural test of the Third Person Effect in an Arab or Muslim culture, drawing on the strengths of different methodologies, quantitative and qualitative data analyses. The topic of Al-Hurra Television\u2019s promotion of \u201cpolitical reform\u201d is the issue that respondents had to react to in focus group interviews and surveys. The findings from quantitative analyses suggest that Al-Hurra Television has a negligible influence on the attitudes of its viewers, with less support for the existence of Third Person Effect hypothesis. The qualitative analysis, however, proposes that \u201cindirect influence\u201d of Al-Hurra Television exists, supporting Third Person Effect research. Discussion of these findings leads to the construction of a taxonomy of Al-Hurra Television audiences. Indirect media influence is further connected to the reception of the rhetoric of public diplomacy and international broadcasting. This study thus suggests new linkages between media theory and the policy rhetoric surrounding international broadcasting.    \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [404], "author_name_tesi": "Douai, Aziz ", "last_name_ssi": "Douai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Aziz", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Spicer Nichols", "John Spicer Nichols", "Mary Beth Oliver", "Amit Schejter", "Thomas Walter Benson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Spicer Nichols, Dissertation Advisor", "John Spicer Nichols, Committee Chair", "Mary Beth Oliver, Committee Member", "Amit Schejter, Committee Member", "Thomas Walter Benson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["US/Arab relations", "democracy promotion", "public diplomacy", "media diplomacy", "Al-Hurra", "propaganda", "international broadcasting", "Middle East media", "media and conflict"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "An Analysis of the Attributes of an Online Knowledge Community that Supports Student/Practitioner Collaboration in an Architectural Engineering Capstone Design Course", "id": "7217", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3159", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As the culminating academic activity of most engineering curriculums and an introduction to the practice of the engineering profession, capstone design programs must generate and maintain the ability to obtain timely and significant involvement from industry professionals.

To study these interactions, this project uses measurements and modeling of processes in Beltsville MD. Industry, major transportation corridors, suburban complexes, agricultural lands, and forests are located in this study area. Given this diversity of land use, this location is ideal for investigating the interplay between anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. The first objective of this research is to explore the factors that govern near-sunset atmospheric concentrations of isoprene, a plant-emitted hydrocarbon, using a Proton-Transfer-Reaction mass spectrometer operated during July and August 2011. We hypothesize that increased isoprene concentrations observed during dusk result from increasing stability associated with the shutdown of boundary layer circulations. Data confirm that the atmospheric surface layer becomes stable during this time, and that the increases are likely not due to advection. While nocturnal isoprene destruction is hypothesized to result from the presence of NO3, over 50% of the isoprene destruction rate can not be explained by the sum of NO3, OH, and O3 destruction. Results point to enhanced nocturnal OH as a possible reason for this discrepancy. The model results also suggest sensitivity to ambient NOx levels of both the isoprene destruction rate, as well as the production of isoprene nitrates. Isoprene nitrates have the potential to be important climate drivers because they can eventually form aerosols. \n\nThis potentially important isoprene-aerosol link prompts further investigation of aerosol trends at Beltsville, MD. The second objective of this research is to determine the trends in fine particulate matter at  this site. Environmental Protection Agency aerosol data show that yearly median PM2.5 decreased over the past eight years at a rate of approximately 0.5 micrograms per cubic meter per year. The decrease was most strongly associated with transport from the northwest and southwest quadrants. The decrease in aerosol concentration results primarily from a decline in sulfate, which falls at a rate of around 0.62 micrograms per cubic meter per year for summertime values, and about half that for annual median values. The decline in sulfate is associated with reductions in ambient sulfur dioxide levels, suggesting that reduced emissions caused the change in the concentration of sulfate. Thus, the compositional makeup of aerosols at Beltsville, MD has been modified significantly, from a more sulfate-like regime, to a regime where organic carbonaceous matter contributes to the majority of the PM2.5 mass. \n\nThis change in the composition may govern the levels of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), as organic aerosols are less CCN\u2013active than ammoniated sulfate aerosols. The third and final objective of this dissertation is to determine if the observed compositional change could be responsible for significant changes in numbers of cloud condensation nuclei. To evaluate this hypothesis, levels of CCN are modeled using in-situ measurements of PM2.5 bulk composition, particle size distribution from a fast mobility particle sizer, and these modeled results are compared with measurements of CCN from a DMT-100 CCN counter. The resultant estimated number of CCN is sensitive to the assumed mixing state of the particles, with the best results being for insoluble internally mixed aerosols. Using four sets of assumptions about mixing state and organic hygroscopicity, the theoretical sensitivity of CCN to the observed changes in organic fraction from 2005 to 2012 is tested. The results indicate that the long-term changes are significant, but only represent <32% of the total CCN number concentration, and <10% for soluble organics a relatively small amount. However, the rainfall sensitivity in this location has not been tested. Additionally particle growth events result in the highest observed concentrations of CCN, even though levels of PM2.5 pollution were lower. During the first few hours of particle growth events the aerosol particles are best represented by externally-mixed and nonhygroscopic organic matter. This change corresponds with with an increase in organic carbon. After several hours, the CCN activity returns to pre-particle growth event conditions, with an increase in the number of CCN and an increase in PM2.5 sulfate.  This suggests that the sulfate and the other chemical reactions occur rapidly  and make aerosols more hygroscopic. This is an important result: that particle growth events can significantly contribute to the levels of CCN, and that the presence of sulfur dioxide plays a role in making the freshly nucleated particles more hygroscopic.\n\nTo summarize these results, we observed that the levels of isoprene just before sunset were driven by turbulence, and that post-sunset declines were caused by OH and NO3. The NO3-modulated destruction has the potential to result in production of organic nitrates, which can eventually contribute to aerosol mass. Because of this, we examined aerosol mass concentration trends, and observed that there was a significant trend in fine particulate matter, and in the amount of sulfate and ammonium in that aerosol mass. This decrease is linked to decreases in ambient sulfur dioxide decreases over the past eight years. Conspicuously, organic matter had not changed significantly, and so the organic fraction has increased. We used an equilibrium model to estimate the influence that the changed composition could have on the numbers of CCN, finding that the sensitivity was less than 32% of the total number concentration, but observing that particle growth events resulted in the highest numbers of CCN during the observation period.

Specifically, this study addressed the following research aims: (1) to describe the trajectory of sibling differentiation from middle childhood through adolescence, (2) to assess linkages between sibling differentiation and sibling intimacy and conflict, and (3) to assess linkages between sibling differentiation and youths\u2019 self-worth. \n   I began by charting the developmental trajectory of differences between siblings\u2019 self-reported activity interests from middle childhood through late adolescence. Based on deidentification theory and existing work in behavioral genetics, it was anticipated that siblings would become increasingly different over time. Sibling dyad gender constellation was also examined as a potential moderator of change patterns, given its importance to sibling differences from both the deidentification and behavioral-genetic perspectives. \n   Multi-level modeling (MLM) was then used to examine the longitudinal linkages between differentiation in siblings\u2019 activity interests and their reports of sibling intimacy and conflict. Existing perspectives offer conflicting hypotheses: grounded in Adler\u2019s ideas about the family context of individual development, deidentification theory holds that becoming more different will reduce rivalry and conflict between siblings, allowing for a more harmonious relationship. Principles of homophily suggest the opposite\u2014that the more siblings have in common, the more likely they will be to report  close relationships with one another. Sibling dyad gender constellation and birth order were also examined as potential moderators of change patterns, given their relevance to sibling relationship dynamics.\n   To address the third aim, MLM was used to assess linkages between sibling differences in activity interests and a measure of siblings\u2019 individual adjustment\u2014self-worth. Here again, there are competing predictions: deidentification theory predicts that greater differentiation will be linked with positive self-worth. Self-affirmation theory, however, predicts the opposite, as similarity between siblings serves as a source of personal validation and self-worth.  Sibling dyad gender constellation was included as a potential moderator of change patterns, given its potential relevance to sibling differentiation.\n   Results for Aim 1 revealed a negative quadratic effect that was qualified by a significant cubic effect for sibling differentiation over time: Sibling differences increased in early adolescence, leveled off, and then increased again in late adolescence--findings that generally support both deidentification and behavioral genetics perspectives. A significant linear by gender constellation interaction also emerged, with follow ups showing that mixed-sex sibling dyads, but not same sex dyads, showed linear increases in differentiation over time. \n   For Aim 2, support was found for principles of homophily. At the within-family level, at times when sibling dyads were more different than their average, youths reported lower levels of intimacy. A similar effect was also found at the between-family level, as youths from families with higher than average levels of sibling differences reported lower levels of intimacy. No association was found between sibling differentiation and sibling conflict, although some significant interactions were found between linear age and both birth order and gender constellation.\n   With respect to Aim 3, support was found for self-affirmation theory: sibling similarity was linked positively to self-worth at the between-family level, such that youths from families with higher than average levels of sibling differences reported lower levels of self-worth. Further, at the within-family level (dyads across time), a significant interaction with gender constellation emerged, indicating that youths from same-sex sibling dyads reported lower levels of self-worth at times when sibling differences were higher their cross-time average\u2014an effect not seen in youths from mixed-sex sibling dyads.

Current management options are limited and farmers have expressed a need for improved slug control; however, basic aspects of slug ecology in the region remain obscure. My thesis begins with a review of existing knowledge on slug ecology, natural history, scouting, and management. Through this review, I identified research areas in need of attention for improving integrated management of slugs. In the remaining chapters, I attempt to address several of these needs through laboratory and field experiments. \n\nIn preliminary laboratory experiments, I explored the potential for common generalist predators to contribute to slug suppression in Pennsylvania. Wolf spiders and cantharid larvae were disinclined to eat slugs; however, two common ground beetle species, Chlaenius tricolor and Pterostichus melanarius, preyed on slugs and protected soybean seedlings from damage, indicating a potentially important role for them in biological control. \n\nNext, I examined how crop management decisions influence slugs, insect pests, and predators in reduced-tillage maize systems, in field studies spanning two years. Weed and manure management had few effects on pest activity, crop damage, or predator activity in either year, although cultivation reduced late-season slug activity in 2011. Low-external-input crop rotations using cover crops were somewhat more vulnerable to slugs and European corn borer compared to a control rotation using pre-emptive insect management; however, damage from these pests was likely sub-economic in all rotations. Furthermore, in the second year of the study, the low-external-input rotations supported higher levels of predation on sentinel caterpillars, and comparable or lower levels of slug activity late in the season compared to the higher-input control rotation. Overall the low-external-input rotations were competitive with the more conventional, pre-emptive approach.\n\nFinally, I examined the influence of the common seed treatment, thiamethoxam, on slug damage to soybeans in a tritrophic context. In laboratory experiments, thiamethoxam did not significantly influence slug survival or feeding behavior on soybean. However, slugs that were fed for one week on thiamethoxam-infused soybean seedlings were poisonous to the ground beetle, Chlaenius tricolor. My results suggest that neonicotinoid seed treatments do not prevent slug damage to soybean, and in fact may exacerbate slug damage if slugs pass these insecticides to their predators. This possibility bears further evaluation in field studies.

In recent decades, seed treatment with neonicotinoids has become increasingly widespread in field crop production, but the full ecological and agronomic effects of these insecticides are still far from understood. This dissertation helps to fill this knowledge gap by describing the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments in U.S. agriculture, and examining the influence of these insecticides on pest and predatory invertebrates. In Chapter 1, I synthesized data from various government sources and pesticide use labels to estimate the national use of seed-applied neonicotinoids in the United States. In Chapters 2 and 3, I used laboratory and field studies together with insecticide residue testing to explore the movement of seed-applied neonicotinoids through a crop-slug-beetle food chain and its agronomic consequences in Pennsylvania no-till soybean and corn systems. I found that seed-applied neonicotinoids variably disrupt biological control of non-target pest slugs. Furthermore, field-collected slugs, earthworms, and caterpillars contained concentrations of neonicotinoids likely to harm predatory arthropods that consume them. In Chapter 4, I tested the generality of the effects of neonicotinoid seed treatments on arthropod natural enemies through a meta-analysis of field studies. By assembling almost 1,000 observations from North American and European experiments, I found that seed-applied neonicotinoids have a negative effect on insect natural enemies corresponding to a roughly 16% seasonal reduction in abundance. Taken together, my results shed light on the agro-ecological effects of neonicotinoid seed treatments and inform their targeted use.

Results of the study indicated that training increased the number of communication opportunities with wait time provided by paraeducators to young children with CCN.  In addition, results indicated that all children in the study increased communication turns after paraeducators participated in the online training.  It was also noted that paraeducators provided an increased number of responses to child communication turns.  Results, limitations, and future research directions are discussed.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5716], "author_name_tesi": "Douglas, Sarah Nathel", "last_name_ssi": "Douglas", "middle_name_ssi": "Nathel", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Special Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr David Mc Naughton", "David Brent Mcnaughton", "Janice Catherine Light", "Kathy L Ruhl", "Pamela S Wolfe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr David Mc Naughton, Dissertation Advisor", "David Brent Mcnaughton, Committee Chair", "Janice Catherine Light, Committee Member", "Kathy L Ruhl, Committee Member", "Pamela S Wolfe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["augmentative communication", "language development", "early childhood", "paraeducator", "special education", "training"]}]
