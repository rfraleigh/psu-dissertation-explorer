Chapter two delves into Impressionist characteristics of melody, harmony, rhythm, and tone color.

This difference between the casting dimension and the pattern dimension is termed as \u201cpattern allowance\u201d. Currently, no pattern allowance estimation techniques exist. Lack of pattern allowance estimation techniques results in longer lead times, expensive reengineering cycles, and lost market share. Due to inability of the foundries to predict the pattern dimension correctly and casting dimensional variability, castings are designed with extra stock (machining allowance), which is subsequently removed by machining. However, due to increasing machining costs, more and more foundry customers are demanding smaller machining allowance. \nCasting and pattern dimensional data is collected from production steel foundries along with other process and geometry variables. Statistical analysis is conducted to ensure data integrity through gage repeatability and reproducibility studies and outlier analyses. Dimensional data is then classified according to alloy type, restraint type, location of parting line, and molding method. A new empirical model has been developed to predict pattern allowances for steel castings depending on the abovementioned variables. This model predicts average, minimum, and maximum pattern dimensions based on median, 10th percentile and 90th percentile values of an artificial variable called \u201cShrinkage Error\u201d. This model is then validated by collecting more pattern allowance data and comparing the predicted pattern dimensions.\nA software tool called \u201cPattern Allowance Advisor\u201d has been developed for the implementation of the pattern dimension prediction model. In addition to helping the pattern designers in predicting the pattern dimensions, this software is also designed to serve as a comprehensive casting dimensional data management tool. Furthermore, the software also offers capability of customizing and calibrating the pattern dimension prediction model for a specific foundry through learning from the inspection data. Pattern Allowance Advisor software is acquired by several steel foundries.\nApplication of the new empirical model through Pattern Allowance Advisor has resulted in an increase in first article casting dimensional conformance from 52% to 81% and a reduction in dimensional reengineering cycles from 3.5 to 1.1 during testing in production steel foundries. Overall reduction in total centering errors is also achieved. These improvements have resulted in reduction in lead time and dimensional reengineering costs.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4419], "author_name_tesi": "Deo, Mandar Vighnahari", "last_name_ssi": "Deo", "middle_name_ssi": "Vighnahari", "first_name_ssi": "Mandar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt", "Paul H Cohen", "Timothy William Simpson", "Irene Johnston Petrick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Carl Voigt, Committee Chair", "Paul H Cohen, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member", "Irene Johnston Petrick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pattern dimension prediction", "pattern allowance prediction", "STeel casting shrink rules"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Multiscale Modeling of Polymeric Materials", "id": "7974", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4911", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Polymers are characterized by processes at length and time scales that span orders of magnitude. Molecular dynamics simulations using atomistic models are thus unable to access long-time processes such as diffusion, terminal dynamics and entanglements. This also results in a gap in the length and time scales probed by atomistic and mesoscale models. In this thesis, we develop coarse-grained models that bridge this gap, provide access to simulating entangled chains, and investigate terminal dynamics. These coarse-grained models retain chemical identity to a specific polymer by using information from atomistic models. The main focus is on predicting accurate dynamic evolution of polymers using coarse-grained models. In this work, we develop coarse-grained models for pure polymers and polymer blends.\n\t\nIn the first part of the thesis, we develop a coarse-grained model for polyethylene using information from an underlying atomistic simulation. The dynamics from the coarse-grained simulation are observed to be accelerated by a constant amount, called the speed-up factor. We illustrate that the speed-up factor is predictable and that the dynamics using the speed-up factor are in quantitative agreement with experimental observations. The speed-up factor is also shown be only dependent on temperature. Hence, we use the coarse-grained model to simulate longer polyethylene chains that are entangled. The results from the coarse-grained simulations of entangled chains demonstrate that the model accurately predicts both static and dynamics properties.\n\nSubsequently, we extend the coarse-graining procedure to two more polymers that are widely used: poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(methyl methacrylate).  Here also, we illustrate that static and dynamic properties from coarse-grained simulations are in excellent agreement with experiments and atomistic simulations. We demonstrate the applicability of the coarse-grained models to simulate longer and entangled polymers. \n\nNext, we focus our attention on developing a coarse-grained model for poly(ethylene oxide)/poly(methyl methacrylate) blend. We observe distinct speed-up factors in the coarse-grained simulations, one for each component in the blend. Dynamics of each component calculated using their respective speed-up factors are shown to be in good agreement with viscosity and rheological measurements. We also investigate the effect of poly(methyl methacrylate) on the motion of poly(ethylene oxide) by simulating entangled chains. \n\nFinally, we develop a novel adaptive hybrid model that allows using atomistic and coarse-grained polymer chains in the same simulation. This represents one of the first studies to perform multiscale simulation of polymers involving atomistic and coarse-grained scales. The model introduces a hybrid region between atomistic and united atom regions, which allows for a seamless transition from one scale to the other. We demonstrate that the multiscale simulation predicts static properties in excellent agreement with fully coarse-grained or fully atomistic simulations.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4888], "author_name_tesi": "Depa, Praveen Kumar", "last_name_ssi": "Depa", "middle_name_ssi": "Kumar", "first_name_ssi": "Praveen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janna Kay Maranas", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn", "Michael John Janik", "Barbara Jane Garrison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Chair", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Barbara Jane Garrison, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coarse-graining", "Polymers", "Bridging length and time scales", "Multiscale modeling and simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Women who combine paid and unpaid caregiving roles: Implications for sleep and physical health symptoms ", "id": "14347nzd117", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14347", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Women\u2019s dominance in both paid and unpaid care work has contributed to the growing number of healthcare employees who simultaneously serve as family caregivers, or double-and-triple-duty caregivers.  Double-and-triple-duty caregivers often struggle to engage in healthy behavior and rate their overall physical health more poorly than their non-family caregiving counterparts, or workplace-only caregivers.  Although the convergence of paid and unpaid care work is expected to become more common as the demand for paid and unpaid care increases, the physical health implications of healthcare employees\u2019 transitions to family caregiving roles and day-to-day experiences in such roles are not readily understood.  This dissertation includes two studies that examine how healthcare employees\u2019 transitions to and daily experiences in double-and-triple-duty caregiving roles relate to changes in sleep and physical health symptoms.    \nEach dissertation study uses different sources of data from women who participated in the Work, Family and Health Study.   All participants worked in U.S.-based nursing home facilities for pay, with the majority also occupying unpaid caregiving roles for children (double-duty-child caregivers), adults (double-duty-elder caregivers), or both (triple-duty caregivers), at the same time.  Study 1 draws on longitudinal survey and wrist actigraphic data to assess how baseline family caregiving role quantity (i.e., number of family caregiving roles) and status (i.e., care for children, adults, or both) as well as changes in these quantities and statuses over an 18-month period are associated with subjective and objective sleep indices.  Analyses also track the frequency of family caregiving role transitions over time and test whether baseline family caregiving role quantity moderates longitudinal associations between family caregiving role quantity changes and sleep characteristics.  Study 2 draws on daily diary data to assess how everyday experiences of work-to-family conflict, sleep duration, and sleep quality relate to physical health symptom occurrences and severity among double-duty-child and triple-duty caregivers.  Analyses also examine the moderating role of family caregiver status (i.e., double-duty-child versus triple-duty caregiver) in associations between daily experiences and physical health symptom outcomes. \nFindings from this dissertation suggest that double-and-triple-duty caregiving roles and daily experiences in these roles adversely affect sleep and physical health symptoms, respectively.  Further, women transitioning to double-duty-elder caregiving roles are particularly at risk of poor subjective sleep characteristics and those holding a triple-duty caregiver status are at risk of poorer physical health.  Future research should continue to acquire a better understanding of double-and-triple-duty caregivers\u2019 sleep and physical health with the goal of informing targeted, effective workplace intervention practices.  The health behavior and physical health implications of double-and-triple-duty caregiving will only become a greater concern for the long-term care industry as it seeks to hire or retain adults with an increased likelihood of occupying unpaid caregiving roles.           \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14713], "author_name_tesi": "Depasquale, Nicole Stephanie", "last_name_ssi": "Depasquale", "middle_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "first_name_ssi": "Nicole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Manuel Almeida", "Steven Zarit", "Steffany Jane Fredman", "Martin John Sliwinski", "Orfeu M Buxton", "Alicia Ann Grandey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Manuel Almeida, Dissertation Advisor", "Steven Zarit, Committee Chair", "Steffany Jane Fredman, Committee Member", "Martin John Sliwinski, Committee Member", "Orfeu M Buxton, Outside Member", "Alicia Ann Grandey, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["double-duty care", "triple-duty care", "long-term care", "nursing homes", "sleep", "caregiving"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Development and Field Testing of an Autonomous Soaring System", "id": "12826ntd5006", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12826", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Autonomous soaring has the potential to greatly improve both the range and endurance of small robotic aircraft.

Parameters of the receding horizon controller and parameters in the reward function are tuned using an evolutionary algorithm. The resulting controller is tested using Monte Carlo simulations of flight through Dryden gust fields: results show significant improvement over constant speed flight.

This response is present in cells located in the growing root tip, particularly in epidermal cells of the elongation zone. The response is specific to this region and not detectable in other tissues, such as the mature root, hypocotyl, lateral root cap, and columella. In the growing root tip, transcriptional regulation of a subset of auxin-induced genes displays Ca2+ dependence based on treatment with the pharmacological Ca2+ channel blocker La3+. To learn more about the extent of this regulation using an unbiased approach, RNA sequencing was performed on these samples revealing approximately 1400 auxin-induced genes, half of which were Ca2+-dependent. Quantitative PCR revealed that the La3+ effect on auxin-induced gene expression was absent in tissues that lack a Ca2+ response.

Transportation engineers have tried to combat this congestion in a variety of ways, one of the most inexpensive methods being traffic control. Various attempts have been made to quantify how traffic control impacts the performance of urban transportation networks. A recent study examined the impacts of street directionality\u2014specifically, the use of one-way vs. two-way streets\u2014on traffic network performance (Gayah and Daganzo, 2012) and found that the capacity of two-way street networks could always be increased by simply restricting left turn movements at signalized intersections. The additional travel distance imposed by doing so is more than made up for by the additional capacity that would be available at signalized intersections, and this results in shorter vehicle travel times when the network is operating at capacity. However, because this study focused only on capacity conditions (i.e., the maximum throughput allowed by the networks), it failed to consider the full range of all anticipated traffic conditions, including both uncongested and congested states. Furthermore, this study only focused on static strategies in which one control scheme (either allowing or banning left turns) was applied at all times. This is a limitation as traffic networks are dynamic, and traffic control should also be dynamic to reflect the existing traffic conditions. \nIn light of this, the current research examines the impact of accommodating or restricting left turn movements on traffic network performance across the full range of traffic states that can be expected. Grid networks of different sizes and with different link lengths were created and simulated in the Aimsun micro-simulation software to examine their performance under various left turn control strategies. The performance measures considered include: fuel consumption, vehicle emissions, and measures of traffic performance\u2014specifically, using the Network Exit Function (NEF) and the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). These performance measures are calculated and presented as a function of the current traffic state, measured by the accumulation or number of vehicles using the traffic network. This can be used to easily identify accumulations for which left turns should be allowed or restricted. Additionally, this study also examines the benefits of allowing or restricting left turns dynamically based on the current traffic state. Overall, the results find that restricting left turns can be very beneficial as a network starts to become congested; however, restricting left turns actually reduces performance when the network is relatively empty. The optimal performance is thus achieved by allowing left turns when few vehicles are in the network and then restricting left turns when the network becomes more crowded. This dynamic strategy maximizes the traffic performance of the network at all times and results in the lowest vehicle travel times and reduced delays. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12437], "author_name_tesi": "Deprator, Anthony Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Deprator", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Anthony", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vikash Varun Gayah"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vikash Varun Gayah, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Traffic", "Traffic Flow Theory", "Traffic Operations", "Traffic Control", "Dynamic", "Dynamic Traffic Control", "Urban Grid Networks", "Operations", "Transportation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Organization and Distribution of Middle Devonian Biofacies Within a Sequence Stratigraphic Framework, Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, USA", "id": "16267", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7867", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the controls on the distribution of fossils in time and space is a fundamental aspect of paleontological research, because it underlies studies of ecosystem change through time, patterns of origination and extinction, and the geographic distribution of diversity.

For example, the temporal stability of biofacies gradients in the Middle Devonian Hamilton Group of New York state has been studied extensively using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, yet no studies have been conducted in other regions of the Appalachian Basin to assess the spatial variability of these gradients. Field collection from an extensive outcrop of Mahantango Formation (Hamilton Group) in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania was conducted to characterize ecological gradients and to identify biofacies.

In the same region, concentrated animal production facilities produce manure in excess of crop needs, creating an increased risk of nutrient pollution in surface and groundwater.  Excess poultry manure could be used in mine reclamation, but the large application rates required for successful revegetation could result in significant nutrient discharge.  Furthermore, abandoned mine lands could be used to grow switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), a biofuel crop, to return these lands to productivity.  To achieve high production rates, however, significant and sustained nutrient levels are necessary.  The goal of this research is to identify how poultry manure could be used on abandoned mine lands to ameliorate soil phytotoxicity, minimize nutrient losses, sequester nutrients and produce high switchgrass yields.  Greenhouse, lab and field studies were designed to test two different methods of using poultry manure, composting and C:N ratio adjustment, to achieve this goal. \nIn a greenhouse experiment, columns of mine soil were amended with fresh manure, manure mixed with short fiber paper mill sludge (C:N ratios of 20 - 40) and 3 rates of composted manure and leached every four weeks to assess leaching loss of macronutrients and switchgrass growth.  Fresh manure exhibited the highest leaching of NO3\u00af\u2013 N (192 mg column-1); increasing the C:N ratio to 30:1 resulted in a five-fold decrease in the amount of NO3 leached.  All compost treatments leached less than 6% of added N despite large application rates.  Less than 2% of added P was leached from all treatments, indicating no significant risk of P leaching loss.  There was a linear increase in switchgrass growth with each level of compost addition fresh with paper mill sludge.  These results confirmed the idea that poultry manure N losses could be minimized by C:N adjustment and produce more switchgrass than lime and fertilizer amended soils.\nA lab incubation experiment maximized N mineralization to determine stable and labile N and C pools associated with various treatments, which included lime plus fertilizer, two rates of composted poultry manure and two blends of fresh poultry layer manure mixed with paper mill sludge with C:N ratios of 20:1 and 30:1.  These treatments were incubated immediately following amendment application (year one) and one year after field application (year two).  In both incubations, organic treatments were more effective at building large stable N and C pools compared to lime plus fertilizer, confirming that both methods of C:N adjustment are effective at retaining N and C and are significantly greater than N and C pools associated with inorganic fertilizer.  Manure and paper mill sludge, however, had more microbial biomass after two years, which could translate to enhanced, long-term nutrient cycling.  There was no measured benefit of additional carbon added with the 30:1 C:N adjustment.  \nA field experiment using the same treatments as the lab incubation confirmed that both C:N adjustment methods work equally well to revegetate the mine soil and eliminate phytotoxic conditions.  Leaching losses from composts were <1% of added N, while manure and paper mill sludge lost 8% and 16% of added N with a 20:1 and 30:1 C:N ratio, respectively.  Organic treatments sequestered greater C and N in soil compared to lime plus fertilizer.  Although revegetation was successful for all treatments, manure and paper mill sludge treatments produced superior switchgrass yields after three years.\nBoth composting poultry manure and mixing paper mill sludge with fresh poultry layer manure can be used to effectively minimize phytotoxic mine soil conditions, minimize N leaching losses from poultry manure, and produce high switchgrass yields.  Both of these treatments also generated larger stable N and C pools, implying greater sustainability of nutrient cycling.  Furthermore, increased microbial activity and higher yields with fresh manure and paper mill sludge suggest increased benefits from direct application of these materials.  This new approach could help alleviate the problems of both abandoned minelands and excess manure in Pennsylvania, while potentially generating revenue from switchgrass production.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [217], "author_name_tesi": "Dere, Ashlee Laura", "last_name_ssi": "Dere", "middle_name_ssi": "Laura", "first_name_ssi": "Ashlee", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Charles Stehouwer", "Richard Charles Stehouwer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Charles Stehouwer, Thesis Advisor", "Richard Charles Stehouwer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["compost", "switchgrass", "revegetation", "C:N ratios", "phosphorus"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Shale weathering across a latitudinal climosequence", "id": "22514", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10269", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The thin layer of weathered rock, or regolith, at the Earth\u2019s surface supports most terrestrial life, yet the rates and mechanisms of regolith formation are poorly quantified.

Regolith depth on slopes, however, vary less than ridgetop sites and range from 52\u201386 cm across the Appalachian sites. Based on meteoric 10Be inventories in the augerable regolith, soil residence times, an approximation of the weathering duration, increase from 10 ky at the northern sites to 120 ky in Puerto Rico but erosion rates remain constant within error across the climosequence (~40 m My-1). Thus, climate appears to have a larger effect on the thickness and residence time of regolith on the ridgetop than on the slope.\nUsing Na as a proxy for plagioclase feldspar weathering, the extent of Na depletion at the soil surface (estimated using the mass transfer coefficient) increases from 20% in Wales and Pennsylvania to 100% Na depletion at the surface in Puerto Rico. These observations are consistent with a transition from kinetically-limited weathering in the north, where weathering rates are limited by mineral dissolution kinetics, to transport-limited weathering in Puerto Rico, where weathering rates are limited by the removal of weathered material. Na loss is the deepest reaction observed in the augerable regolith. Na release during plagioclase dissolution may therefore represent the chemical initiation of regolith formation as fractured bedrock is transformed to finer-grained material. The time-integrated Na release rates increase exponentially with MAT and linearly with MAP: calculating an Arrhenius-type temperature dependence yields an apparent activation energy for feldspar dissolution across the climosequence of 115 \u00b1 25.0 kJ mol-1 (excluding New York). This value is equal to the sum of the activation energy and enthalpy of the feldspar dissolution reaction, as expected for kinetically-limited sites. Presumably, if we had more sites along the climosequence, the Arrhenius plot would show a break in slope related to the decrease in apparent activation energy as transect sites are increasingly transport-limited to the south and the apparent activation energy decreases to equal the enthalpy of feldspar dissolution. \nAlthough feldspar may initiate the chemical changes responsible for regolith formation, this mineral constitutes < 12% of the bulk shale. Mg depletion can be used as a proxy for the dissolution of the more abundant chlorite-like minerals in the shale, including vermiculite and hydroxy-interlayered vermiculite (HIV). The extent of Mg depletion at the land surface also increases toward the south but in contrast to Na, Mg is also re-precipitated in secondary clay minerals, maintaining Mg concentrations in the soil. Therefore, although the loss of Mg from regolith along the climosequence can be described with an apparent activation energy of 64.0 \u00b1 14.4 kJ mol-1 (excluding New York), the calculated temperature dependence is not interpreted with respect to an activation energy of dissolution (although the value is within the range of laboratory estimates of chlorite activation energy).\nNew York, the only site underlain by locally-derived shale till, provides a test of the kinetic limitation of regolith formation in the north. At this site, Na release rates are faster than Pennsylvania, a site with similar MAT and MAP. Enhanced Na release in New York shows that the interpretation of kinetic limitation at the northern sites is valid, i.e., an increase in mineral surface area created by glacial grinding causes an increase in weathering rate. Thus, glaciers affect shale weathering rates by increasing mineral surface area and accelerating weathering rates for kinetically limited systems.\nThese observations are consistent with simple reactive transport models for weathering of rock on a convex hillslope. The regolith data can also be considered using a quantitative pedogenic energy model, i.e. the Effective Energy and Mass Transfer (EEMT) model. EEMT combines the effects of precipitation, temperature and biota as a predictor of soil development. According to the model, the biota do not drive the observed differences in regolith depth and weathering. In fact, the variable that is the best predictor of ridgetop regolith depth or weathering extent is MAT. The effect of temperature on the weathering of feldspar and chlorite minerals is observable because variables other than climate have been held constant (e.g. erosion and lithology). Results from this investigation will inform quantitative models of soil formation and hillslope evolution as a function of climate and lithology.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9948], "author_name_tesi": "Dere, Ashlee Laura", "last_name_ssi": "Dere", "middle_name_ssi": "Laura", "first_name_ssi": "Ashlee", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley", "Timothy Stapler White", "Lee Kump", "Jason Philip Kaye"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley, Dissertation Advisor", "Timothy Stapler White, Dissertation Advisor", "Lee Kump, Committee Member", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["geochemistry", "soils", "Critical Zone", "erosion", "mineralogy", "weathering rates"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Neoliberalism and the politics of land use in post-Katrina Mississippi", "id": "11630", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3579", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While scholarly work in critical geography on the neoliberalization of urban governance has been widely influenced by the Regulation Approach, emphasizing the embedded nature of the economy in institutional relationships, it has neglected to explore the role of cultural politics in explaining uneven development and facilitating the stability of capital accumulation.

This process of gene regulation is achieved through protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. The components of gene regulatory mechanisms are the DNA sequences that contain the signals for the accurate temporal and spatial expression of the gene they regulate and the proteins that fulfill the \"instructions\" contained within regulatory sequences. Usually a large number of proteins interact in regulatory regions to differentially regulate the gene in different tissues or by different environmental and developmental stimuli.\nPhenotypic variation is abundant in nature and a fraction of this variation is harbored in components of the regulation of the genes controlling the phenotype of interest. While its importance for gene function and its potential for understanding natural phenotypic variation is widely appreciated, little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of the components of gene regulation. Understanding the processes and dynamics of evolution and natural variation of components of regulatory networks will be essential in understanding the evolutionary transitions in many variable traits in nature.\nIn the chapters that follow I attempt to approach the study of the evolutionary dynamics of gene regulation from various directions and ultimately improve our knowledge on how components of gene regulation vary within and between species.\nIn chapter 1 I look at the level of polymorphism in regulatory sequences of early development genes in Drosophila. I have sequenced 5 regulatory regions in several lines of Drosophila melanogaster from Central Pennsylvania and Africa and quantify the level of nucleotide variation within these regions. I apply traditional methods of analysis of polymorphism and divergence data to understand the potential evolutionary forces that are acting in these sequences. I also use some newly developed methods contrasting the patterns of polymorphism and divergence and apply models of binding site prediction to identify polymorphisms that could potentially have phenotypic effect. Finally I attempt to associate levels of expression of two of these early development genes with nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter regions of these genes.\nChapter 2 is an extension on chapter 1 in the sense that I look at more distant sequence comparisons within the melanogaster subgroup and quantify the level and pattern of evolution of regulatory sequences among several species of Drosophila. I introduce a novel approach for the study of such sequences by applying binding site prediction models and comparing the amount and location of predicted binding sites for transcription factors that are known to regulate the genes under study. I also introduce a novel approach for binding site prediction that appears to be more efficient in identifying binding sites of weaker effect or binding sites that have the potential to become functional. Finally, simulations of sequence divergence reveal the evolutionary potential of regulatory regions of early development genes in Drosophila.\nTo test whether the observations from Drosophila stand in other taxonomic groups I extended my study to mammalian regulatory regions. In chapter 3 I searched the primary literature and mapped transcription factor binding sites in regulatory regions of human, other primates and mouse regulatory sequences. I quantified the level of divergence within the binding sites relative to the remainder of the sequence and compared these divergence levels between binding sites that share function between species vs. binding sites that are species-specific. By using a combination of statistical approaches I estimate the degree of conservation of functional binding sites and the rate of turnover between human and rodents. These results have important implications for the annotation of regulatory sequences and for the understanding of regulatory evolution.\nRegulatory evolution consists of both regulatory sequences and transcription factors. Chapter 4 addresses the question of the evolution of transcription factors. I devised a new method for the study of functional divergence of duplicated genes and test this method in transcription factors of human and mouse. I compare the pattern of amino acid divergence in DNA binding vs. trans-activation domains and attempt to detect where the functional divergence of duplicated genes occurs. I obtain some interesting insights about the evolution of the two different types of domains, which have important bearing on the understanding of how regulatory regions evolve and how their evolution correlates with the evolution of transcription factors.\nGood understanding of the evolution of regulatory sequences relies on good understanding of the functional properties of these sequences. Binding site prediction is one such method that improves our understanding of regulatory sequences. In chapter 5, I take one step further in binding site prediction models and test the features of the internal structure of transcription binding site sequences and how they can be used to improve prediction models. I test interactions between adjacent positions within binding sites of well-characterized transcription factors as well as simulated sets of binding sites by means of statistical tests and I incorporate these properties in binding site prediction models. These models appear to describe the binding site features more efficiently and reduce the degree of false positives.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1887], "author_name_tesi": "Dermitzakis, Emmanouil T", "last_name_ssi": "Dermitzakis", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Emmanouil", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew G Clark", "Hiroshi Akashi", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Esther Siegfried"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew G Clark, Committee Chair", "Hiroshi Akashi, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member", "Esther Siegfried, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["transcirptional regulation", "evolution", "binding site turnover", "promoter"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "An Exploration of the Diffusion and Adoption of Four Innovations in Higher Education", "id": "23568", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10836", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Higher education is at a crossroads; increasing tuition, declining government support, low graduation rates, and controversy over whether students are making gains during college, have led many to call for the sector to innovate or perish. The reality is that institutions of higher education constantly introduce innovative policies and programs to improve outcomes and improve efficiency. Most of these innovations never gain recognition beyond the confines of the campus where they were originally introduced, but others are adopted by additional institutions and eventually become widespread.\n\nThis dissertation examines four innovations that have been introduced since the late 1960s: test optional admissions policies, membership in the Common Application Association, no loan financial aid policies, and massive open online courses (MOOCs). Through the lens of diffusion of innovation theory, factors related to diffusion and adoption in higher education are considered. Specifically, the study looks at: (1) what types of institutions have adopted each of these four innovations and at what rates they have been adopted; (2) what factors are related to adoption; and (3) what similarities and differences exist between the four innovations that influence the type of adopter, adoption rate, and ultimately whether an institution adopts.\n\nTo explore these questions, the study utilizes analysis of descriptive statistics and discrete-time survival analysis on a longitudinal data set of more than 1,300 four-year public and private not-for-profit institutions. Findings of the descriptive analyses suggest that the attributes of the innovation are related to both the types of institutions that adopt and the rate of adoption, and that adoption is related to prestige and competition. Findings of the survival analysis suggest that while characteristics of the institution, the social network within which the institution functions, and the environmental context for the institution all matter, the specific factors that impact adoption within each area are not consistent across the four innovations. In general,though findings were mixed, characteristics related to increased prestige (higher tuition, age, greater selectivity) are related to having higher odds of adoption, though the effect size and significance differ by innovation. Additionally, similar institutions and institutions within similar geographic regions also have greater odds of adopting.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10437], "author_name_tesi": "Derousie, Jason Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Derousie", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Jesse Cheslock", "John Jesse Cheslock", "Liang Zhang", "David R Johnson", "Michael John Dooris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Jesse Cheslock, Dissertation Advisor", "John Jesse Cheslock, Committee Chair", "Liang Zhang, Committee Member", "David R Johnson, Special Member", "Michael John Dooris, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["higher education", "diffusion of innovation", "no loan", "test optional", "MOOC", "common application"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Womanist Restorative Drama: Violence, Community, and Healing by Contemporary Black Women Playwrights\n", "id": "11275", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4854", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study engages the rich tradition of African American literature with a focus on drama.

Abused women can be physically and psychologically affected by gender oppression and patriarchy, but race and other factors (such as class, sexual orientation, and socio-economic status) can compound the problem in complex ways. For example, American rape myths about African American women can impede, halt, or prevent victimized black women from reaching a place of wholeness, which positions racism as the most significant hurdle affecting their healing process. \nIn Chapter 1, I provide a foundation for this study and define womanist restorative drama.

New phenomena begin to emerge when the size of the material is reduced that are unique to the small scale. Nanowires are quasi one-dimensional solids, and their diameters are typically in the range of 10 nanometers to 500 nanometers. The range of nanowire diameters coincides with the critical length scales in materials, where the properties and phenomena are different from bulk. Hence, nanowires serve as excellent systems for studying material properties and behavior at the small scale. Along with their scientific significance, nanowires are also technologically important, and are expected to play an important role in the trend towards miniaturization. However, the small size of the nanowires and lack of sophisticated instrumentation pose several challenges in performing experiments on nanowires. \n   The size effect on the mechanical properties of nanowires was investigated, specifically Young\u2019s modulus and fracture strain. The representative material was chosen to be zinc oxide because of its technologically significant properties, such as being both, a semiconductor and piezoelectric material. The zinc oxide nanowires were synthesized using vapor-liquid-solid process. Uniaxial tensile and cantilever bending experiments were performed in-situ inside electron microscopes on single zinc oxide nanowires. Novel application of post-buckling mechanics was exploited to develop microdevices for high resolution force and displacement in sensing and actuation. For performing the mechanical characterization experiments, different techniques for nanowires specimen preparation were developed that were generic, reliable and robust. Fracture strain and Young\u2019s modulus of zinc oxide nanowires were measured for different diameters and lengths.\nThe fracture strains of zinc oxide nanowires were experimentally measured for the first time, and the strains were between 4 % and 14 %, which is unusually high considering zinc oxide is a brittle material (ceramic) at the bulk scale.  It was also observed that the fracture strains increased with decreasing diameter of the wires. The high fracture strains and diameter dependent strains were attributed to reduced number of defects and increasing contribution of surfaces. The Young\u2019s modulus of the zinc oxide nanowires was measured to be 26 \u00b1 9 GPa by uniaxial tensile experiments and 18 \u2013 44 GPa by cantilever bending experiments. The tensile experiments were used to obtain stress-strain plots for the first time for single crystal zinc oxide. The Young\u2019s modulus values were comparable to modulus values estimated by other researchers on zinc oxide nanostructures, but significantly lower than the modulus of bulk zinc oxide (140 GPa). The significant decrease in Young\u2019s modulus cannot be explained by existing theories such as surface effects and non-ideal boundary conditions. New mechanisms, such as strain induced charge redistribution and influence of electromechanical coupling, were explored. These mechanisms could qualitatively and to some extent, quantitatively explain the reasons for the significant decrease in modulus of zinc oxide nanowires, compared to bulk zinc oxide.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [453], "author_name_tesi": "Desai, Amit ", "last_name_ssi": "Desai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque", "Christopher Rahn", "Eric M Mockensturm", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia", "Melik C Demirel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Md Amanul Haque, Committee Chair", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Eric M Mockensturm, Committee Member", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Committee Member", "Melik C Demirel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["experimental nanomechanical characterization", "electromechanical coupling"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Scaling Regional Land-Atmosphere Fluxes of Carbon Dioxide with Mesoscale Observation Networks: Impact of Land Cover, Management and Disturbance\n", "id": "6997", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "349", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Improving techniques to scale observations of land-atmosphere fluxes from site to region to globe is required for better understanding of processes leading to spatiotemporal variability of carbon sources and sinks, rates of change in global atmospheric CO2 burden and associated climate forcing.

The region is unique for its land-atmosphere observational network density and challenging due to its patchy landscape. The current landscape and exchange of CO2 is strongly mediated by intrinsic abiotic spatial variability and the impact of natural and anthropogenic disturbance. This study investigates how disturbance and land cover variability affects regional carbon exchange and complicates standard observation-based scaling, remote sensing flux estimates and global biogeochemical models.\n\nThe eddy-covariance method uses high-frequency measurements of atmospheric turbulence and scalar concentration to quantify fluxes on scales of 0.1-100 ha. Evidence is presented showing a large difference in net ecosystem exchange between a mature forest harvested 80 years ago and an old-growth forest with the same pre-European settlement composition. This work is extended to further quantify stand age effects on growing season carbon exchange across 14 sites. A parameter assimilation aggregation scheme is developed that relies on flux towers, tower-observed meteorology, remote sensing and forest inventory statistics to estimate regional carbon exchange. Comparison against fluxes measured from a regionally integrating tall tower (396 m) are encouraging, especially after a tall tower directional sampling bias is diagnosed and removed using footprint decomposition and re-aggregation techniques.

The increasing concern for pollutant emissions to the environment has led to a wide interest in studying the process in detail using numerical simulation with an aim to develop predictive models that would minimize expensive experiments. Three main approaches in this direction are direct numerical simulation (DNS), large eddy simulation (LES) and Reynolds average simulation (RAS). Moreover, the presence of high temperatures\nin turbulent combustion results in substantial heat transfer by radiation. Most work until today\nhas either simplified or neglected radiation. This leads to neglect of turbulence&#8722;radiation\ninteractions (TRI).\nIn this work, DNS is coupled with a photon Monte Carlo method to solve the radiative\ntransfer equation (RTE) to isolate and quantify TRI. A canonical statistically one-dimensional\nturbulent premixed combustion system is studied. The inflow boundary condition is improved\nto introduce turbulence and to help simulate a quasi-stationary flow. Both emission TRI and\nabsorption TRI were found to be significant. A statistical analysis showed that using a moving\naverage over time of the radiative source term reduces statistical noise and saves valuable\ncomputational resources without affecting the overall solution.\nFor the first time, a third-order spherical harmonics method, <i>P<sub>3</sub></i> approximation is coupled with DNS to replace the photon Monte Carlo method. A canonical turbulent premixed combustion system is simulated and TRI are studied at large-to-small optical thicknesses. Emission TRI was found to be significant at all optical thickness, while absorption TRI was important at large and intermediate optical thickness and negligible at the optically thin limit. The implementation of the P3 approximation is seen as a viable alternative to the costly photon Monte Carlo method. Elliptic equations are typically solved in RAS-based and LES-based modeling and the <i>P<sub>3</sub></i> approximation consists of six elliptical partial differential equations (PDEs). It is hoped that the demonstration of use of the <i>P<sub>3</sub></i> approximation will generate interest for it to be included in future LES and RAS approaches and developments.\nA low-order model for LES using a &#946;-PDF approach is also developed for a canonical statistically one-dimensional turbulent nonpremixed system. The mixture fraction and its variance are inputs to the model to obtain a PDF of mixture fraction. With the knowledge of the PDF of mixture fraction, the quantities that are functions of mixture fraction are convoluted with the mixture fraction PDF to obtain the chemical source term and the radiative emission terms. The mean profiles are predicted correctly but the nonlinear terms of radiative emission are not\ncaptured accurately, as the &#946;-PDF cannot provide information for the higher-order terms. Still, as\na one-equation model to be used as a first pass for LES simulation, this model has its advantages\nin that it is easy to implement and uses negligible additional computational resources over what is required for LES without any models.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3592], "author_name_tesi": "Deshmukh, Kshitij ", "last_name_ssi": "Deshmukh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kshitij", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael F Modest", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Michael F Modest", "Stephen R Turns", "Robert J Levin", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael F Modest, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Chair", "Michael F Modest, Committee Chair", "Stephen R Turns, Committee Member", "Robert J Levin, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spherical Harmonics Method", "Turbulence--Radiation Interactions", "Combustion systems", "Direct Numerical Simulation", "Photon Monte Carlo methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Allocative Data Envelopment Analysis with Uncertainty", "id": "16259", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8202", "abstract_tesi": "An important objective of managers is to evaluate the performance of their organization in order to continuously improve and grow.  One measure is to compute the performance efficiency of each unit within their organization.  Data Envelopment Analysis is a specific technique that optimizes and computes the efficiency of decision making units (DMUs) relative to the other units within the organization, using deterministic data collected from past performance results.  From these efficiency values, DMUs will be determined to be either efficient or inefficient. \n\nSpecifically for a health care organization, managers evaluate the operating performance of the units within their organization based on the resources and expenditures used, and the revenue generated from the services that they provide.  Allocation Models are especially useful for these types of evaluations, because they look only at units of dollars and the allocation of budgets and resources.\n\n While it is vital to evaluate past performance, as in the traditional DEA model, it is also important to understand and predict future performance.  This thesis, therefore, proposes the use of Allocative Data Envelopment Analysis to consider the uncertainty of future results, with one specific application being the health care industry.  There are three types of models considered: Cost Allocation Model, Revenue Allocation Model, and Profit Allocation Model.  These models optimize and evaluate the performance of a DMU based on its cost efficiency, revenue efficiency, and profit efficiency, respectively.  Methods are also proposed in order to make recommendations to the decision maker to allow for the inefficient units to become efficient.

As young adults struggle for autonomy from family, they actively manage their private information by selectively sharing or withholding information from family members (Petronio, 2002); however, research involving the disclosure of private information is largely limited to dyads such as romantic partners or friends (e.g. Derlega et al., 1994).  There is no systematic research relating the management of private information in sibling relationships. Since young adults describe siblings as important sources of support and influence (Tucker, McHale, & Crouter, 2001), this deficiency is unfortunate. The aim of the descriptive research reported herein was to illuminate how young adults manage private information in interactions with their siblings. \nIn the first part, a two-phase study, 104 young adult participants completed a web-based questionnaire concerning what siblings share and withhold from one another and the functions sharing and withholding serve.  In the second phase, 19 young adults participated in focus group interviews to provide additional findings for Research Questions One and Two from the first phase of the study and to answer Research Question Three by identifying criteria for revealing private information to siblings. \nThe results revealed that, in general, young adult siblings tend to share a good deal of private information with each other, with some tendency to share more intimate information such as sexual relationships with siblings of the same gender.  The data suggested that siblings are important providers of social and family support to one another.  They are rather open with their disclosures in general even though they share more private information with siblings of the same gender.  The primary function of sharing private information with siblings appears to be relational maintenance, which becomes more prominent in the relationship as they move away from the parental home.

The hrl1 (for hypersensitive response-like lesions 1) mutant of Arabidopsis is characterized by spontaneous necrotic lesions, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), constitutive expression of SA- and ET/JA-responsive defense genes, and enhanced resistance to virulent bacterial and oomycete pathogens. Epistasis analyses of hrl1 with npr1, etr1, coi1, and SA-depleted nahG plants revealed novel interactions between SA and ET/JA signaling pathways in regulating PR gene expression and cell death. Northern analysis of the RNA isolated from the lesion\u0192y (local) and the lesion\u0192{ (systemic) leaves of double mutants of hrl1 uncovered different signaling requirements for the expression of defense genes in these tissues.  Expression of ET/JA-responsive PDF1.2 gene was markedly reduced in hrl1 npr1 and in the SA-depleted hrl1 nahG plants. In hrl1 nahG plants, expression of PDF1.2 was regulated by benzathiadiazole (BTH) in a concentration dependent manner: induced at low concentration and suppressed at high concentration. The hrl1 etr1 plants lacked systemic PR-1 expression, and exhibited compromised resistance to virulent Pseudomonas syringae. Inhibiting JA responses in hrl1 coi1 plants lead to exaggerated cell death and severe stunting of plants. Finally, the hrl1 mutation led to elevated expression of AtrbohD, which encodes a major sub-unit of the NADPH oxidase complex. These results indicate that cell death and defense induction in hrl1 is regulated synergistically by SA and ET/JA defense pathways. \n\n\tThe preexisting defense responses enable hrl1 plants to resist virulent pathogen infection. However, the same preexisting defense responses in hrl1 suppress HR cell death against virulent pathogens. Furthermore, the high PR-1 expression observed in hrl1 remains unaltered following avirulent and virulent pathogen infections. The suppressed HR phenotype in hrl1 is observed even when an elicitor is expressed endogenously from an inducible promoter, suggesting that an impaired transfer of avirulent factors is not the reason. Interestingly, the lack of HR phenotype in hrl1 is reversed if the constitutive defense responses are compromised either by a mutation in NPR1 or by depleting salicylic acid (SA) due to the expression of the nahG gene. The rescue of HR cell death in hrl1 npr1 and in hrl1 nahG depends on the extent to which the constitutive systemic acquired response (SAR) is compromised. Pre-treating Arabidopsis wild-type plants with SAR-inducers, prior to pathogen infection resulted in a significant decrease in HR cell death. The suppressed HR cell death and the failure to enhance PR gene expression following avirulent pathogen infection in hrl1 suggest that the preexisting defense responses serve as negative feedback loops to regulate extensive cell death and defense-related gene expression.  In hrl1, the chronic stress response due to PR gene expression may alter the cellular physiology at various nodes that lead to insensitivity to subsequent pathogen attack. Down-regulation of HR cell death in the presence of an already existing systemic resistance response may be a way for plants to prevent excessive cell death and further defense induction\n\n\tMicroarray analyses of plant-pathogen interactions have revealed a complex interplay of multiple signaling pathways (Schenk et al., 2000; Maleck et al 2000). The changes in the transcript levels of approximately 1200 Arabidopsis ESTs were examined in hrl1 and the various double mutants of hrl1. Consistent with the earlier Northern results, genes like PR-1, PR-2, GST1 and PDF1.2 were induced both in the lesion\u0192y and in the lesion- tissue of hrl1. However several GST1-like and PR-1-like genes were not induced in the lesion- tissue suggesting that they are regulated differently in the lesion+ and lesion- tissue. The lesion\u0192y tissue had a stronger overall response than the lesion\u0192{ tissue suggesting that the lesion\u0192y tissue mimic local HR cell death and the lesion\u0192{ tissue resemble the distant SAR response. Approximately 50 genes (22%) that have altered expression pattern in hrl1 encode proteins that are involved in metabolism. This suggests that cell death and defense signaling in hrl1 may interact with components involved in cellular homeostasis. These studies further highlight the complexity involved in the regulation of the defense response in plants against pathogens.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5637], "author_name_tesi": "Devadas, Sendil Kumaran", "last_name_ssi": "Devadas", "middle_name_ssi": "Kumaran", "first_name_ssi": "Sendil", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Teh Hui Kao", "Ramesh Raina", "Timothy W Mcnellis", "Hong Ma", "Richard Cyr"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Ramesh Raina, Committee Chair", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Member", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Richard Cyr, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["epistasis", "genetic analysis", "microarray", "lesion", "arabidopsis", "defense signaling", "cell death"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "Money Creation in a Random-Matching Model of Money\n\n", "id": "5995", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "561", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    I study the effects of lump-sum money creation against the background of the random-matching model of Trejos-Wright (1995) and Shi (1995). That model is interesting for the study of money creation because, alongside with the usual harmful internal margin effects, money creation has beneficial external margin effects. Positive money creation shifts the distribution of\nmoney towards the average holdings, thus increasing the frequency of trades in meetings. Molico (1997) demonstrates numerically that beneficial effects are possible in that model. However, Molico assumes a particular bargaining\nrule, take-it-or-leave-it offers by consumers. That bargaining rule is known to cause too much production in some meetings. Because lump-sum money creation tends to reduce production in meetings with binding producer participation constraints, the beneficial effects he finds may come from offsetting the effects of that bargaining rule. Instead of working with any\nparticular bargaining rule, I consider optima over all implementable outcomes.\n\n\nIn order to keep the optimization problem manageable while enlarging the set of outcomes in that way, I have to make some other compromises. I assume that money is indivisible and that there is a bound on individual holdings - sometimes a low bound but one that always exceeds unity. However, I do permit randomization, which enlarges the set of trades and, thereby, the\npossible distribution effects. Given randomization, there are two main ways\nto define the set of implementable outcomes: either ex ante (allowing people to commit to randomization) or ex post (requiring that people go along with each element in the support of the randomization scheme).\n                                                      \nEssay 1. \"Another Example in which Lump-Sum Money Creation is Beneficial.\" (Joint with Neil Wallace.) We assume a two-unit upper bound on money holdings and adopt ex post individual rationality as the notion of implementability. The policy is a probabilistic version of the standard helicopter drops followed by proportional reduction in individual holdings.\nFor all discount factors greater than a critical value, we show analytically that the ex ante optimum involves creation of money. This is done by finding the best outcome subject to no money creation and by showing that some creation can improve that outcome. Our results for a two-unit bound on holdings are indicative for what can happen with all higher bounds.\n                                                       \nEssay 2. \"Optimal Money Creation in a Random-Matching Model with Ex post Individual Rationality.\" Although Essay 1 accomplishes the goal of showing that money creation can be helpful, it does not describe the optima.

Indeed, from the revival of the Hebrew language at the end of the nineteenth century and all throughout the defining events of the last one hundred years, the trend of the textually sacrosanct appearing as a persistent motif in Judaic cultural production has only increased. \nWhat the discipline of literary studies has neglected to analyze, however, are the comparative aspects of such a rapport, with respect to the interpretive differences in the composition of modern Jewish fiction across geo-political, linguistic, and gender-based paradigms. To that end, this project presents a case study of the cultural variables of modern Judaic discourse through an archetypal analysis of selections from secular Modern Hebrew, Anglo-American, and Francophone Maghrebian Jewish fiction, focusing on the literary works of three major Jewish writers, all of whom were born in the last century. These writers are: the Israeli author A. B. Yehoshua (1936\u2013); the American author Chaim Potok (1929\u20132002); and the Tunisian-born, French-Israeli author Chochana Boukhobza (1959\u2013). These particular authors are relevant for a study of Judaic cultural variables because the literary works of all three have been characterized by their tendency to use religion, myth, and metanarratives to probe crises of identity and interaction in the modern Jewish paradigm. Included in this study are the analyses of Yehoshua\u2019s short stories \u201cHamefaked haakharon\u201d (\u201cThe Last Commander\u201d) (1962) and \u201cBetkhilat kaiyts 1970\u201d (\u201cEarly in the Summer of 1970\u201d) (1972), as well as the analysis of his novel Gerushim meukharim (\u201cA Late Divorce\u201d) (1982). The literary works of Potok\u2019s analyzed are the short story \u201cThe Trope Teacher\u201d (2001) and the novels My Name Is Asher Lev (1972) and The Gift of Asher Lev (1990). The novel of Boukhobza\u2019s explored in this study is Un \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 J\u00e9rusalem (\u201cA Summer in Jerusalem\u201d) (1986). \nThe central methodology used in this study has been taken from the discipline of \u201carchetypal\u201d post-Jungian psychology, which defines archetypes as recurrent themes, motifs, or figures, historically transmitted as patterns or models, which seem to follow a specific ethnic blueprint. This approach implies that many different interpretations of a people\u2019s sub-cultural disposition may be found in a single archetype, depending on the specific sub-group involved. For example, the archetypes present in the common intertextual Judaic narratives or motifs that function as the building blocks for Yehoshua\u2019s, Potok\u2019s, and Boukhobza\u2019s fiction include the Binding of Isaac; the revelation to Moses at Mt. Sinai; and the enigma of the \u201cShekhinah,\u201d the feminine presence of the Divine. And yet, each author engages in a specific, exegetical midrash of these long-held stories based on his or her particular sub-cultural worldview.\nA careful examination of each writer\u2019s response to the Judaic textual tradition demonstrates the ways in which the modern interpretation of foundational Judaic narratives is codetermined by several key environmental factors. These factors include: geo-political affiliation; degree of religious observance; attitudes regarding gender roles; and notions of ethnicity. Such factors create the conceptual frameworks through which Jewish writers from differing backgrounds reference, recast, re-envision, or subvert traditional and/or religious figures, themes, tropes, discourses, or narratives from the intertextual reservoir of Judaic culture. The foundational texts in this reservoir are made up of the Hebrew Scriptures, the Talmud, the Kabbalah, and other celebrated, canonical works that are familiar to Jews the world over as symbolic points of reference. Jewish writers who choose to incorporate into their literary texts well-known elements from the continuum of Judaic textual history ultimately generate the meaning of this incorporation by way of the sub-cultural variables that define the nature of their respective, environmentally-based conceptual frameworks. In the same way that the differences in those frameworks illustrate the sub-cultural schisms that exist between modern Jewish sub-groups, such frameworks are also responsible for the varieties of aesthetic formulae chosen to depict those schisms in the literary text.\nThe core contribution of this project for the field of literary studies is that it is the first to examine the comparative aspects of the cultural variables in the concept of \u201cJewishness\u201d as this concept appears in the context of Jewish literatures. It also breaks new ground in that it offers explanations as to why the idea of \u201cJewish literature\u201d as literature produced by groups of dissimilar Jews must undergo the same scholarly reckoning in literary studies as the idea of \u201cJewish communities\u201d has in sociological and anthropological surveys. This research, therefore, represents the first step toward a broader attempt at troubling the notion of \u201cJewish literatures\u201d across geo-political, linguistic, and gender-based paradigms.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4668], "author_name_tesi": "Devir, Nathan  Paul", "last_name_ssi": "Devir", "middle_name_ssi": "Paul", "first_name_ssi": "Nathan ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Thomas Oliver Beebee", "Daniel Walden", "Kathryn Hume", "Baruch Halpern", "Gila Safran Naveh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas Oliver Beebee, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Chair", "Daniel Walden, Committee Chair", "Kathryn Hume, Committee Member", "Baruch Halpern, Committee Member", "Gila Safran Naveh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Jewish", "Hebrew", "Francophone", "Maghrebian"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The attitude-social influence--efficacy theoretical model: application to cancer screening programs among medically underserved men", "id": "17551", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8426", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Introduction: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the United States and affects African Americans at a disproportionate rate.  There is controversy surrounding the screening guidelines for prostate cancer, but health care professionals agree on the recommendation that men make an informed decision about getting screened for prostate cancer.  Objective: The purpose of this study was to use the results from the Predicting Prostate Cancer Screening Attendance among Underserved African American and White Men Using the Attitude-Social Influence-Efficacy Model study and the Attitude-Social Influence-Efficacy theoretical model to make adaptations to an educational program to improve informed decision making regarding prostate cancer screening among medically underserved men.

Pregnancy loss is associated with significant psychological distress which can persist during subsequent pregnancies. The risk of pregnancy loss is increased for overweight and obese women, with rates of miscarriage and stillbirth currently rising along with rates of obesity in the United States. Exercise behavior (EXB) is associated with positive health outcomes among pregnant women and their offspring. Scant research, however, has examined the extent to which psychological well-being and motivational determinants influence EXB in pregnant women who have experienced a prior pregnancy loss.  Purpose: To examine the extent to which a history of pregnancy loss, prepregnancy weight status, and psychological well-being are associated with and explain pregnant women\u2019s EXB and its motivational determinants during a subsequent pregnancy using the framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Methods: 204 pregnant women (41 with a history of pregnancy loss; 72 overweight/obese) prospectively reported their depressive and anxiety symptoms, TPB motivational determinants, and EXB during the first, second, and third pregnancy trimesters via mailed surveys. Results: During early pregnancy, women with a history of pregnancy loss had higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and lower levels of EXB motivation than women without a history of pregnancy loss. Overweight and obese (OW/OB) women had lower levels of EXB motivation throughout pregnancy and lower prepregnancy EXB than normal weight (NW) women. A smaller proportion of women with a history of pregnancy loss endorsed beliefs positively related to EXB than women without a history of pregnancy loss. A larger proportion of OW/OB women recorded experiencing barriers to EXB than NW women. Pregnancy loss moderated the late pregnancy associations between anxiety and intention, and anxiety and EXB, respectively, in NW women such that highly motivated and active women with a history of pregnancy loss had higher levels of anxiety than highly motivated and active NW women without a history of pregnancy loss. Among OW/OB women, pregnancy loss moderated the association between early pregnancy intention and EXB such that first trimester intention more strongly influenced the EXB of women without a history of pregnancy loss compared to women who had previously experienced pregnancy loss. Conclusion: Both pregnancy loss and prepregnancy weight status contribute individual and combined influences on psychological well-being, TPB motivational determinants and EXB of pregnant women. Practitioners and interventions aimed at promoting EXB in pregnant women should target both prepregnancy weight status and pregnancy loss history and adapt as necessary to meet the unique needs of women.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10781], "author_name_tesi": "Devlin, Courtenay A", "last_name_ssi": "Devlin", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Courtenay", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Danielle Symons Downs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Danielle Symons Downs, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Exercise", "Pregnancy", "Theory of Planned Behavior", "Pregnancy loss", "Miscarriage", "Psychological Well-Being", "Physical Activity"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE GLUCOSE TRANSPORTERS THAT FACILITATE THE PASSAGE OF GLUCOSE ACROSS THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER\n", "id": "10609", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3677", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Glucose is the obligate energy fuel for the mammalian brain which consumes approximately 20% of plasma glucose that is almost entirely oxidized to CO2 and H2O. The first step in the metabolism of glucose within the brain is its transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which is comprised of microvascular endothelial cells joined together by specialized tight junctions and is supported by astroglia and pericytes. These endothelial cells are polarized with the luminal (blood-side) and abluminal (brain-side) membranes being composed of variety of proteins specific to each membrane. Glucose must traverse both membranes of the BBB before entering the brain, and this transport is thought to be mediated by GLUT-1 glucose transporters at the BBB. \n\nWe have investigated GLUT-1 modifications and the presence of alternate transporters to explain the disparity in GLUT-1 levels and glucose transport activity in the luminal and abluminal membranes of the BBB observed in earlier studies. Utilizing 2-D electrophoresis and iTRAQ\u2122 (isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation) approaches, we demonstrate that GLUT-1 is present in post-translationally modified forms at these two BBB membranes. We show that phosphorylation is a potential modification that occurs primarily at the C-terminus and/or cytoplasmic loop (6-7) regions of GLUT-1. We have also investigated glucose transporter expression in vitro using cultured microvascular endothelial cells in an attempt to characterize the in vivo glucose transport mechanism. Our results show that the abluminal forms of GLUT-1 are lost when microvascular endothelial cells are placed in culture, precluding their use for transport studies as they are not reflective of the in vivo situation. We suggest that this results from a loss of polarization of the BBB in vitro as demonstrated by dramatic under-expression of abluminal marker proteins compared to luminal marker proteins.  The current studies demonstrate the presence of GLUT-3, a high affinity, high capacity glucose transporter at the BBB using iTRAQ\u2122, RT-PCR, and Western blots. Overall, we suggest that the modifications in GLUT-1 at the BBB along with the GLUT-3 transporters potentially regulate glucose entry into brain across this vital barrier in normal and pathological states such as hypoxia and hypoglycemia.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3657], "author_name_tesi": "Devraj, Kavi ", "last_name_ssi": "Devraj", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kavi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ian Alexander Simpson", "Ian Alexander Simpson", "Dr David Antonetti", "James Robert Connor", "Dr Steven Abcouwer", "Dr Anthony Carruthers", "Tao Lu Lowe"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ian Alexander Simpson, Dissertation Advisor", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Chair", "Dr David Antonetti, Committee Member", "James Robert Connor, Committee Member", "Dr Steven Abcouwer, Committee Member", "Dr Anthony Carruthers, Committee Member", "Tao Lu Lowe, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["2-D Electrophoresis", "Cultured Endothelial Cells", "Microvessels", "Polarization", "Glucose Transporters", "Blood-Brain Barrier", "Luminal", "Abluminal"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Quantifying the variability of glenoid geometry in intact and osteoarthritic shoulders", "id": "22785", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10214", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this project is to identify sources of variability within the glenoid of the scapula to assist in implant placement and design for Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA). The glenoid is the socket component of the ball and socket connection of the shoulder joint. When a person has osteoarthritis, the glenoid can wear down, resulting in a loss of mobility, pain, or even causing the shoulder to dislocate. To restore range of motion, and reduce or eliminate pain, surgeons perform TSA. This surgery involves inserting a metal implant in the humerus, and a plastic implant in the glenoid. If the glenoid implant is improperly placed, it can wear out or potentially become dislocated within a ten year period. In some cases, the full range of motion is not returned to the patient. Due to the limited visual input during surgery, it can be difficult to obtain the correct angle of implantation. By studying the variability of healthy glenoids, it may be possible to estimate the original healthy geometry of osteoarthritic shoulders. \n\n\nThe objective of this research was to model intact and osteoarthritic glenoids. The model needed to be robust to the observed variability, and of sufficient resolution, such that it informed operative and design decisions. Achieving this required the quantification of variability in landmark locations and relevant bone geometry in both intact shoulders and those exhibiting osteoarthritis. Additionally, the surface geometry of the glenoid vault was modeled. This required the application of existing mathematical and statistical modeling approaches, including geometric fitting, radial basis functions, and principal component analysis. The landmark identification process represented the glenoid in new manner. The work was validated against existing approaches and CT scans from 42 patients.\n\nFor this research, x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans of healthy scapulae were provided. The scapulae were isolated in Osirix, and exported as meshes. The meshes were cleaned using Netfabb and Meshlab.  The code created to process and analyze these meshes was written in Matlab. Each scapula was oriented based on landmarks found on the bone; the center of the glenoid, the inferior-most part, and the connection of the medial border and the spine of the scapula. The concave face of the glenoid was isolated, and a sphere was fit to each glenoid. The sphere fitting provides the inclination and version angles of the glenoid with respect to the landmarks. Additionally, the optimal angle for maximum implant peg room was identified. \n\nA range of information on shoulder geometries can assist with preoperative planning, as well as implant design. As there is a limited supply of CT scans, potential shoulder geometries were synthesized. This was done by placing landmarks on the existing glenoid meshes, such that they provided enough information to represent the geometry, while being consistent across each glenoid. Principal component analysis was used to quantify the variability of shape across the glenoid landmarks. These landmarks were transformed into glenoid meshes using radial basis functions. The process of creation of these shoulder geometries may possibly be useful for the study of other joints. The models created will help surgeons and engineers to understand the effects of osteoarthritis on bone geometry, as well as the range of variability present in healthy shoulders.

Social changes such as increased productivity expectations in the workplace and the movement of mothers into the paid labor force have added to the feeling that family time is scarce.  Time is perceived to be an extremely rare commodity in the U.S., and families desire to spend more of it together.\n     Time allocation in families has enjoyed recent scholarly attention.  Some studies have analyzed how gender, class, and labor force participation relate to family time use.  Other studies have focused on changes in parent-child time.  Despite parents\u2019 worries to the contrary, parent-child time has increased over the past 30 years.  Very few studies have focused on time use among spouses, however.  This three-paper dissertation analyzes research questions related to this understudied area.\n     The first paper studied whether spousal time has declined over the past 30 years.  Although previous research has shown that spouses are doing activities less often together, this study used nationally representative time-diary data to quantify and explain the decline in daily spousal time.  The declines were significant \u2013 between 50 and 90 minutes per day.  Regression and population standardization revealed that increases in married couples\u2019 joint hours in the paid labor force and the increased proportion of dual-earner couples explain most of the change.\n     The second paper investigated the mechanisms that link spousal time and marital satisfaction to understand whether decreasing spousal time matters for contemporary couples.  Using nationally representative longitudinal data, this study found that spouses\u2019 evaluations of the amount of time they spend together completely mediates the relationship between actual time together and marital satisfaction.  That is, if spouses are satisfied with the amount time they spend together their marital satisfaction tends to be high regardless of how much time they actually spend together.  Further, because the actual amount of time that spouses spend together was a weaker predictor of positive evaluations of spousal time than other aspects of time, the declines in spousal time are not likely problematic for spouses.\n     The final paper investigated the relationship between family time and marital satisfaction.  Qualitative studies have found that family time has some very negative aspects.  Consequently, if spouses have to give up spousal time to create family time, they may become dissatisfied with their marriage.  Using nationally representative data, the analyses showed a positive relationship between family time and marital satisfaction for wives.  For husbands, the association between family time and marriage depended on their relationships with their children.  Consequently, although some negative aspects of family time do exist for parents, family time does not seem to interfere with parents\u2019 marital quality.  Rather, the analyses show that family time, spousal time, parents\u2019 relationships with their children, and marital satisfaction relate in complex ways.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2918], "author_name_tesi": "Dew, Jeffrey P", "last_name_ssi": "Dew", "middle_name_ssi": "P", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Eggebeen", "Dr Alan Booth", "Geoffrey Clay Godbey", "Dr Chalandra Bryant", "David Manuel Almeida"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Eggebeen, Committee Chair", "Dr Alan Booth, Committee Chair", "Geoffrey Clay Godbey, Committee Member", "Dr Chalandra Bryant, Committee Member", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Marriage", "Time", "Time-Use", "Gender", "Children"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A Synergistic Passive and Active Shimming System to Optimize B0 Field Homogeneity in Micro MR Spectroscopy", "id": "v692t620b", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12532", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research presents a targeted, synergistically combined passive and active shimming system to correct for susceptibility-induced B0 inhomogeneity artifacts in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy. This system would be of great significance to researchers using MR imaging at ultra-high fields (7\u201314 T), where B0 inhomogeneity artifacts are a major limiting factor for many in vivo applications.\n\nAt boundaries between materials of differing magnetic susceptibility, such as the air-tissue boundaries in the sinus cavities or ear canals, the differing susceptibilities of the imaged tissues can distort the applied magnetic field. These inhomogeneities can lead to local distortion and signal loss artifacts in MR images and line broadening in MR spectra. Active shimming, involving the adjustment of magnetic shim coils, is used to correct first-order inhomogeneities, but higher-order active shimming can be difficult and expensive. Instead, passive shimming may be used to correct such higher-order inhomogeneities. Passive shimming involves placing pieces of material that have high magnetic susceptibility values compared to body tissues in the vicinity of said tissues in order to perturb the magnetic field such that the inhomogeneities are corrected. Previous experiments have been performed with several passive shimming methodologies that show promising results. However, they have various drawbacks, with several lacking precision shim placement and another requiring excessive manual measurements for best results.\n\nThis research pursues precision correction of inhomogeneities via two specific aims:\nSpecific Aim 1: Develop numerical synergistic shim simulation and optimization software, which simultaneously optimizes the linear active shim gradient settings and passive shim element configuration for B0 inhomogeneity correction of a given volume of interest (VOI).\nSpecific Aim 2: Develop passive shim frame hardware that implements the synergistic shimming solution.\n\nThe technique was validated in a 7T Bruker MRI system in a customized susceptibility phantom and in in vivo mice by using it to improve the B0 magnetic field homogeneity and spectral water line widths from predetermined regions of interest within the mouse brain.

In this dissertation, I use publicly available data to identify the potential effects of projected climate and land use change on river water temperature and Brook Trout populations in individual stream reaches throughout the eastern U.S. In Chapter 1, I quantitatively assessed the representativeness of stream flow and water temperature data from U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) gages throughout subregions of the conterminous United States, including the eastern U.S. In Chapter 2, I developed a model to predict river water temperatures under current conditions and future scenarios of climate and land use change. The final model included air temperature, landform attributes and forested land cover, and predicted mean daily water temperatures with good accuracy (root mean squared error ~ 1.9 \u00b0C) for training and validation datasets. In Chapter 3, I predicted Brook Trout occurrence probability based on water temperature predictions and selected landscape characteristics using a hierarchical logistic regression model that performed well at both training and validation datasets (area under the receiver operating curve ~ 0.78). In Chapter 4, I identified potential changes in thermal habitat and Brook Trout occurrence probability resulting from projected climate and land use change. The timing, magnitude and location of predicted changes in maximum 30 day mean river water temperature varied greatly among three downscaled climate models, with average increases ranging from 1.21 to 2.55 \u00b0C by 2087. As a result of warming, between 56,440 (42.7%) and 109,237 (82.6%) of potential Brook Trout habitat was predicted to be lost.

This work focuses on the stabilization of interfaces in biomimetic media formed from aqueous polymeric phases and amphiphiles. Polymeric phase systems are used to mimic the aqueous, crowded environment of the cytoplasm, and can also provide non-membranous phases used as compartments within living cells. Amphiphilic molecules can create membranous compartments where the membrane is the interface. Artificial vesicles assembled from amphiphiles are used to mimic the cell membrane and other biological membranes. Biological mimics composed of aqueous phases and vesicles are attractive to origin-of-life studies because of their self-assembly from dilute solution, and their underlying roles in contemporary life. Artificial creation of biological compartments and reaction conditions can be used to create microscale bioreactors that may be applied to research or production.\n\tChapter 2 analyzes an RNA enzyme bioreactor formed from stabilization of a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 8 kDa and dextran 10 kDa aqueous two-phase system. The bioreactors are formed in phase droplets that are stabilized by lipid vesicles. The emulsion is characterized in terms of droplet size, stabilization mechanism, and interfacial diffusion. Droplet size was found to correlate with nearly complete partitioning of vesicles to the interface, where they were observed to stabilize droplets by electrostatic forces. Nucleic acid probe molecules were found to diffuse across the stabilized interface. An RNA enzyme is partitioned to the interior of the bioreactor droplet, a substrate strand diffuses into the droplet, the substrate cleaves, and substrate products leave the dextran-rich phase bioreactor through partitioning. Poly(acrylamide) gel electrophoresis and confocal microscopy were used to monitor the reaction.\n\tIn Chapter 3, the forces that bring particles to the interface in aqueous phase systems are investigated in terms of depletion forces and interfacial tension. An oil-water interface was created and the water phase was crowded with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) 2.1 kDa. Silica particles in the aqueous solution changed in their adsorption behavior depending on PAA concentration, despite minimal change in interfacial tension. In a PEG and dextran ATPS, total polymer concentration is raised and particle adsorption is observed as well as the interfacial tension. Caboxylated latex particles were not observed to adsorb to the interface until a greater interfacial tension was present than predicted from standard interfacial tension models. Particles that are adsorbed to the interface still sterically stabilize with behavior expected from oil-water emulsions, including bridging.\n\tChapter 4 expands the electrostatic stabilization observed in Chapter 2. Vesicles without PEGylated surface chemistry are partitioned in a PEG and dextran ATPS as well as polyelectrolytes. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) are found to partition strongly to the dextran-rich phase, even at low ionic strength. Dextran sulfate and diethylaminoethyl dextran were partitioned to create interfacial potentials in a similar matter to the LUVs. Interfacial electrostatic potentials caused by asymmetric ion partitioning are observed to cause steric inhibition of coalescence. Changes in salt concentration led to changes in partitioning and ionic screening changes that altered phase droplet stabilization.\n\tThe interplay between coacervate phase system interfaces and amphiphilic membrane formation is investigated in Chapter 5 in relation to abiogenesis. Oleic acid vesicles were created and homogenized. Temperature-dependent vesicle formation was observed at ionic strength values relevant to that of an early ocean. PAA 2.1 kDa and poly(allyl ammine hydrochloride) (PAH) 58 kDa coacervates were developed that varied in surface charge depending on polyelectolyte ratio. Interaction between vesicles and coacervates depended on coacervate charge and on phosopholipid incorporation in vesicle membranes. Dioleoylphosphatidylcholine as an additive increases membrane stability and resulted in reduced LUV adsorption.\n\tThis dissertation describes work controlling amphiphilic membrane adsorption at interfaces in all-aqueous media. A bioreactor is developed from a stabilization mechanism assembled and investigated within the work, and other bioreactors and stabilized phase morphologies mimicking those found within cells may also be developed.

In order for nanoscale electronic devices to realize their full potential in certain applications, ohmic contacts are required. The present study focuses on the fabrication and characterization of electrical contacts to p- and n-type Si nanowires grown by the vapor-liquid-solid method with the objective of designing ohmic contacts with a low contact resistance. The actual contacts to these nanowires could exist in two possible geometries: firstly, as an integral part of the nanowires fabricated during growth of the nanowires, also referred to as nanowire heterojunction contacts, and secondly, in the form of lithographically defined metal pads overlapping the nanowires.\nCobalt silicide/Si and Au/Si heterojunction nanowires grown in anodized alumina templates with an average pore diameter of 200 nm were studied in the former geometry. An optimum amount of Au catalyst was deemed necessary for obtaining cobalt silicide/Si nanowires with good morphology. Investigations using transmission electron microscopy helped determine this amount to be approximately two-thirds of the average pore diameter of the templates in which the nanowires were grown. Subsequently, detailed scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed that even some of the nanowires with good morphology contained Au nanoparticles, more so near the interface of the Si segment with the silicide in the case of cobalt silicide/Si nanowires and with the Au in the case of Au/Si nanowires. Such Au nanoparticles were shown to cause discontinuities in some nanowires upon annealing at temperatures above the Au-Si eutectic point. Nanowires grown out the top of the membranes contained very few Au nanoparticles away from the Au/Si interface and were used for studying contacts in the metal-pad geometry.\nContacts in a two-point probe configuration based on Pd, Ti/Au and Co/Al metallizations were studied for heavily doped p-type Si nanowires of average diameter 80 nm that were grown out the top of membranes, and a Ti/Au metallization was studied for heavily doped n-type Si nanowires of similar diameter. Such studies revealed that for p-type nanowires, the Co/Al contacts were the least resistive under similar fabrication and annealing conditions. Annealing from 200 \u2013 300 \u00b0C in a N2 ambient was shown to be optimal for obtaining ohmic contacts and avoiding thermal degradation. For n-type nanowires, the Ti/Au contacts were also shown to form ohmic contacts readily upon annealing between 250 \u2013 300 \u00b0C under similar conditions. Field emission scanning electron microscopy was used to study some of the defective p- and n-type Si nanowire devices including contact electrodes.\nA multi-contact test structure was next fabricated, which made it possible to extract various contact parameters based on a nanowire transmission line model. Contacts based on Al, Co and Co/Al metallizations were fabricated on heavily doped p-type nanowires of average diameter 80 nm that were grown out the top of membranes and from Au thin films, and an Er/Al metallization was used for heavily doped n-type nanowires of similar diameter grown by similar methods. The specific contact resistance of as-deposited Al contacts was found to be within 1 x 10^-5 \u2013 4 x 10^-4 \u00d9-cm^2 when extracted at the origin of the device current-voltage (I-V) characteristics for p-type Si nanowires of resistivity 0.53 (\u00b10.48) \u00d9-cm. Cobalt contacts, upon annealing in N2 within 250 \u2013 300 \u00b0C in the multicontact fabrication, showed lower resistance and more linear current-voltage characteristics than the Al contacts but were more difficult to lift off at the required metallization thickness. A contact based on the Co/Al metallization was later fabricated that combined the ease of lift-off of the Al multicontacts with the low resistance of the annealed Co contacts. The specific contact resistance of ohmic contacts based on such a metallization was extracted at the origin of the device I-V characteristics and found to be within 6 x 10^-6 \u2013 6 x 10^-4 \u00d9-cm^2 in the as-deposited condition, and within 2 x 10^-6 \u2013 2 x 10^-4 \u00d9-cm^2 upon annealing in N2 at 200 \u2013 250 \u00b0C for p-type Si nanowires of resistivity 0.27 (\u00b10.18) \u00d9-cm. Ohmic contact formation for such devices was attributed to high doping of the Si nanowires. The formation of a cobalt silicide phase combined with an increase in the doping of the nanowires adjacent to the metallization upon annealing is proposed to have led to a decrease in the specific contact resistance of the contacts after annealing.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5932], "author_name_tesi": "Dey, Soham ", "last_name_ssi": "Dey", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soham", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "S Ashok"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member", "S Ashok, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aluminide", "silicide", "nanowire", "silicon", "ohmic", "contact", "vapor-liquid-solid growth"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "INJECTION AND BIPOLARONIC CHARGE SPECIES AT METAL-ORGANIC SEMICONDUCTOR CONTACT INTERFACES", "id": "14533rxd257", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14533", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Organic electronics have gained wide spread popularity due to their highly tunable electronic and optical properties while retaining relatively simple device fabrication, finding applications commonly in displays and lighting. Despite rapid commercialization we are limited by our understanding of the fundamental device properties that play a major role in charge injection at contacts, transport in the device and subsequent radiative recombination.\n\nThis first part of this thesis deals with an adaptation of internal photoemission (IPE), using surface plasmon polariton (SPP) modes, in order to selectively control absorption in the device allowing for up to 8x enhancement in injection from the desired contact.

We use charge modulation spectroscopy to reveal a bipolaron sheet density >10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ at the interface between an indium tin oxide anode and the common small molecule organic semiconductor. In our work we have been able to provide definite evidence in support of the origin of the magnetic response while for the first time demonstrating the presence of bipolaronic charge species in unipolar organic semiconducting devices. We find that the magnetocurrent response of hole-only devices correlates closely with changes in the bipolaron concentration, supporting the bipolaron model of unipolar organic magnetoresistance and suggesting that it may be more of an interface than a bulk phenomenon. These results are understood on the basis of a quantitative interface energy level alignment model, which indicates that bipolarons are generally expected to be significant near contacts in the Fermi level pinning regime and thus may be more prevalent in organic semiconductor devices than previously thought.

The main objective of this work is to study metal modified zeolite catalysts to selectively improve the yield of 2, 6-dimethylnaphthalene during the alkylation of naphthalenes and methylnaphthalenes isolated from the coal blends and by products from petroleum refining operations like Light Cycle Oil (LCO) from the catalytic cracking unit. The major task in this application is to focus on the methylation of methylnaphthalene to get a higher selectivity of 2, 6-dimethylnapthalene, an important feedstock for the 2, 6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, a precursor for the polymer polyethylene naphthalene (PEN). Since the key step is to achieve higher \u00a5\u00e2- selectivity during the alkylation, 2-methylnaphthalene (2-MN) was taken as the model feed for the methylation in this work.\nMedium pore zeolites were modified by the isomorphous substitution of Fe into the framework of the zeolites. The relative change in acidity based on the amount of Fe substitution in the zeolites was studied and its effect on the catalyst performance during the methylation reaction was studied. The changes in the catalyst properties after modification were studied using various characterization techniques. The reaction system was a fixed bed down flow reactor at 300\u00a8\u00acC at a WHSV of 6 h-1. Prior to the experiments, the catalysts were pretreated in-situ at 450\u00a8\u00acC for one hour at atmospheric pressure under a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL/min.\nSeveral conclusions were drawn based on the methylation experiments on various catalysts and their characterization studies. The medium pore zeolite was found to exhibit \u00a5\u00e2 selectivity for this reaction but the conversion of 2-MN was reported to be very low for the catalyst. Also, a lot of secondary isomerization as well as non selective surface reactions were being carried out. The catalyst acidity also played a significant role in the selective formation of 2, 6-DMN.  Based on the acidity studies using NH3-TPD and microcalorimetry, it was confirmed that the acidity of the catalysts was significantly lowered after modification. Based on the methylation reaction results, it was determined that the moderate acidity range gave the best 2, 6-DMN /2, 7-DMN ratio. Also it was found that the surface reactions were inhibited and this increased the overall 2, 6-DMN in the products. \nThe X-Ray diffraction studies revealed increase in the crystallinity of the modified samples confirming dealumination and a slight increase in the lattice parameters of the modified samples concurring with the Framework IR studies and 27Al MAS NMR studies. However, no significant pore size changes were observed during modification with Fe. Further study is recommended do determine the effects of slight pore size alteration on the shape selective formation of the 2, 6-DMN.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6397], "author_name_tesi": "Dhar, Vasudha Gudimella", "last_name_ssi": "Dhar", "middle_name_ssi": "Gudimella", "first_name_ssi": "Vasudha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Sarma V Pisupati", "Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Thesis Advisor", "Sarma V Pisupati, Thesis Advisor", "Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["zeolites", "Shape Selective catalysis", "naphthalene alkylation"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATION OF EFFECTS OF CULTURAL BACKGROUND OF USERS ON INTERFACE DESIGN AND USABILITY \n\n", "id": "9940", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "709", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past few decades, with an increase in technological innovation and world becoming a \u2018Global Village\u2019, a single interface or product may be used by individuals from varied nationalities.

The study was conducted for two cultures, namely, India and United States and user satisfaction as well efficiency of the users was measured during the experiment. No direct interactions were discovered between Nationality and Power Distance or Nationality and Uncertainty Avoidance. However, the difference in average time taken for a high Power Distance interface was found to be more than a low Power Distance interface irrespective of nationality.

The findings suggest a complex interaction between culture and interface elements whose comprehension needs further experimentation and analysis. Also, eight out of ten of the Indian subjects who worked with a low Uncertainty Avoidance interface said that they would have preferred a high Uncertainty Avoidance interface with more visual cues.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [703], "author_name_tesi": "Dhillon, Beant Kaur", "last_name_ssi": "Dhillon", "middle_name_ssi": "Kaur", "first_name_ssi": "Beant", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Donovan Koubek", "M Jeya Chandra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Donovan Koubek, Thesis Advisor", "M Jeya Chandra, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Usability", "Hofstede", "Interface Design", "Culture"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FILM COOLING CALCULATIONS WITH AN ITERATIVE CONJUGATE HEAT TRANSFER APPROACH USING EMPIRICAL HEAT TRANSFER COEFFICIENT CORRECTIONS \n\n\n", "id": "11214", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5815", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An iterative conjugate heat transfer technique was developed and automated to predict the temperatures on film cooled surfaces such as flat plates and turbine blades. Conventional approaches using a constant wall temperature to calculate heat transfer coefficient and applying it to solid as a boundary condition can result in errors of around 14% in internally cooled blades,as shown by previous research work. This indicates a need for conjugate heat transfer calculation techniques. However, full conjugate film cooling calculations also suffer from inability to correctly predict heat transfer coefficients in the near field of film cooling holes and require high computational cost making them impractical for component design in industrial applications. Iterative Conjugate Heat Transfer (ICHT) analysis is a compromise between these two techniques where the external flow convection and internal blade conduction are loosely coupled. The solution obtained from solving one domain is used as boundary condition for the other. This process is iterated until convergence. Flow and heat transfer over a film cooled blade is not solved directly, instead convective heat transfer coefficients resulting from external convection on a similar blade without film cooling and under the same flow conditions are corrected by use of experimental data to incorporate the effect of film cooling in the heat transfer coefficients. The effect of conjugate heat transfer is taken into account by using this iterative technique. Unlike full Conjugate Heat Transfer (CHT), the ICHT analysis doesn\u2019t require solving a large number of linear algebraic equations at once. It uses two separate meshes for external convection and blade conduction and thus problem can be solved in lesser time using less computational resources.\n\nA demonstration of this technique using a commercial CFD solver FLUENT is presented for simulations of film cooling on flat plates and C3X turbine blade.  Results are presented in form of film cooling heat transfer coefficients and surface temperature distribution which are compared with results obtained from conventional approach where in which heat transfer data is usually obtained on test surface maintained at a constant temperature or heat flux condition.\n\nFor uncooled surfaces, the deviations were as high as 3.5% between conjugate and conventional technique results for the wall temperature. For film cooling simulations on a flat plate using the ICHT approach showed deviations up to 10% in surface temperature compared to constant wall temperature technique for a high temperature difference case and 3% for a low temperature difference case, since surface temperature is not constant over the surface when conjugate heat transfer is considered. In case of 2D full conjugate heat transfer simulation performed on a non film cooled C3X vane reasonable agreement to experimental data was observed for mid-span wall temperature distribution. Average deviations of around 6% on the pressure side and 7% on the suction side from experimental data were obtained.\nFilm cooling calculations performed on the C3X blade using the ICHT technique predicted wall temperature distribution in excellent agreement with the data. Temperature distribution obtained using ICHT were within 2 to 3 % of the experimental data i.e. well within the experimental uncertainty, while conventional technique predicted the same within 6 to 8% of the data. In all, for wall temperature distribution, an overall improvement of around 7% on the pressure side and 10% on the suction side over conventional technique was obtained using ICHT.\n\nResults thus show that the ICHT technique is an effective tool for performing accurate film cooling calculations which reduces computational cost and complexity involved in meshing discrete film cooling holes. Moreover, it is physically more appropriate than conventional technique since it considers the effect of blade metal conduction.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5811], "author_name_tesi": "Dhiman, Sushant ", "last_name_ssi": "Dhiman", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sushant", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Savas Yavuzkurt", "Savas Yavuzkurt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Savas Yavuzkurt, Thesis Advisor", "Savas Yavuzkurt, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Conjugate Heat transfer", "Film Cooling", "Gas Turbine", "CFD"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Effect of Grid Block Size and Heterogeneity on Miscible Residual Oil Saturation", "id": "19228", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8211", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Compositional simulators almost always predict excessive vaporization of oil near the injector (nearly 100% recovery). Such high recovery may be possible for multi-contact PVT experiments or in a slim-tube displacement but not at the scale of a simulator grid block, where oil is bypassed by injected gas. Bypassed oil will not be vaporized and the amount of oil bypassed will be affected by the heterogeneity of the reservoir as gas will tend to flow through high permeability channels. This bypassed oil is one part of the oil that is quantified as miscible residual oil saturation or Sorm. The other part of Sorm is heavy hydrocarbon components that are not vaporized even after contacted by a significant volume of gas.\n\t Accurate prediction of Sorm is important to forecast recovery from a reservoir. Large grid blocks are often used in gas flooding simulations. Numbers of hydrocarbon components are also upscaled to very few components in these simulations. All these assumptions lead to inaccurate recovery predictions considering that Sorm can be as large as 10% of oil saturation depending on the oil gravity. If small grid blocks are used in compositional simulation with many hydrocarbon components representing the fluid then Sorm would be very small or negligible. \n\tIn order to avoid excessive vaporization of the oil, simulators can specify residual oil in grid blocks during gas injection processes. There are several methods available for predicting Sorm. Most of these methods do not consider spatial and temporal variation of Sorm. This thesis focuses on studying how Sorm changes with distance from the injection well based on upscaling the reservoir to larger grid blocks. The effect of different scaling groups based on fluid and reservoir properties on Sorm has also been studied. \n\tUpscaling is often used in the simulation of gas injection processes to save computational time. Permeability upscaling causes a change in the heterogeneity of the reservoir. The amount of mixing between solvent and reservoir oil changes with upscaling. However, mixing is ignored while performing upscaling in compositional simulators even though mixing has a significant effect on oil recovery. In this research we discuss the importance of mixing in oil recovery predictions and on miscible residual oil saturation. \n\tWe present an efficient way of calculating Sorm, which is based on permeability upscaling. We simulate first contact miscible flooding and concentrations in grid-blocks have been averaged locally and globally in order to calculate Sorm.

About 90% of its 21 million people lived in rural areas in 1996 (CBS/Nepal, 1997).  Expansion of mass schooling remains a high priority on Nepal's development agenda. \nSince the conception of first scientific education plan in 1952, the Nepalese government has attempted to address the problem of low literacy by expanding access to primary and lower secondary education with various incentives to families.  Despite these efforts a large majority of primary and lower secondary school age children are not enrolled in school.\nThe primary objective of this study is to assess whether the collective human and social capital of a household might facilitate the educational enrollment of the children in a household.  The data collected for the Chitwan Valley Family Study (CVFS) project were used.  Out of the total 1668 households included in the CVFS study, a total of 849 (50.9%) households were selected for primary school enrollment analysis and 605 (36.3%) households were selected for lower secondary school enrollment analysis.  Logistic regression models were run to assess the likelihood of school enrollment of both primary and lower secondary school age children in a household.\nSignificant relationships were found between children\u2019s age and caste on school enrollment of primary school age children.  For primary school age children, age of children (older children) and caste (upper caste Hindu household) increased the likelihood that children in the household would be enrolled.  Human capital in the form of parental or other household adult\u2019s education had no effect with caste and religion controlled.  However, household social capital in the form of intra-household relationships (help received by parents from non-resident children) and mother\u2019s attitudes towards daughter\u2019s education significantly increased the likelihood of primary school enrollment.  Community ties (increased parental participation in youth clubs) showed positive influence on primary school enrollment when demographic, financial and household education were controlled.\nFor lower secondary school age children, while presence of greater number of school age children in households other than lower secondary age group decreased the likelihood of school enrollment, children from Hindu as well as upper caste Hindu households increased the likelihood of children being enrolled in school.  Similarly, educated fathers as well other adults in a household influenced school enrollment of lower secondary school age children positively.  Household social capital in the form of migration (recently migrated household), intra-household relationship (parents received help from non-resident children), parental residence (more years of parental presence with lower secondary school age children) and mother\u2019s positive attitude towards daughter\u2019s education) increased the likelihood of children\u2019s school enrollment significantly.\nPolicy planners frequently blame caste and religion for non-enrollments and school dropouts.  The results of this study support that theory but add more information by focusing on human and social capital at the household level.  The results suggest that educational programs that help foster congenial relationships within and outside family/households and cultivate positive attitudes towards daughter\u2019s education could enhance primary as well as lower secondary school children\u2019s enrollment. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4973], "author_name_tesi": "Dhital, Purandhar ", "last_name_ssi": "Dhital", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Purandhar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joan S Thomson", "Constance A Flanagan", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Gordon F De Jong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joan S Thomson, Committee Chair", "Constance A Flanagan, Committee Chair", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Gordon F De Jong, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Household human capital", "household social capital", "primary school enrollment", "lower secondary school enrollment"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Model For The Analysis Of Carryover Effects In A Three-period,three-treatment Crossover Trial For Asthma Patients", "id": "19005", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9117", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\nBackground: A crossover trial design is a repeated measures assignment such that every subject is assigned different treatments in different time periods. This design is more efficient as each subject acts as his own control and one major criticism of this trial is a carryover effect. A carryover effect is defined as the effect of the treatment from the previous time period on the response at the current time period. A crossover trial design is appropriate when the carryover effect can be assumed to be negligible or the trial has incorporated a sufficient duration of washout period to reduce any carryover bias. This study evaluates the presence of a carryover effect as well as the difference in residual effects for different treatments in a three x three crossover trial with a pseudo-washout period. The trial extended over forty-eight weeks with sixteen weeks in each treatment arm. The first four weeks of each sixteen week period was considered as washout.\nObjectives: This study develops a model to analyze the carryover effect and its decay in a three-period crossover trial comparing the responses of asthmatic kids to three add-on therapies (BADGER trial). The primary source of data for this analysis was the daily diary maintained by the subjects in the trial. The study attempts to distinguish the decay pattern for the various therapies to establish the need/appropriateness of the washout period.\n\nMethods: The analysis utilizes data collected for the BADGER trial. The BADGER trial recruited patients, 6 to 17 years of age between March 2007 and July 2008, at Childhood Asthma Research and Education (CARE) Network centers. Analysis of Variance comparing summated outcomes for drug sequences was used for a preliminary test of carryover. Non-parametric and semi-parametric survival analysis was used to compare the carryover effects for different combinations of current and previous treatments. The primary outcome variables used included asthma control days (ACD), symptom free days (SFD), rescue free days (RFD), % change in FEV levels, and proportion of differential responders.\n\nResults: A preliminary analysis to check for carryover was not significant (p-value =0.30). A Kaplan-Meier analysis for ACD during the washout period showed a significant carryover for LABA (p-value = 0.02) when it was followed by ICS and for LTRA (p-value = 0.02) when it was followed by LABA. Both of these are true under the assumption that in the first period a subject does not have a residual effect of any previous treatment. As expected, the change in FEV from the baseline to the end of the washout for the various groups was not significant for ICS(p-value = 0.0845), or LABA(p-value = 0.8404), or LTRA (p-value=0.7263). The proportional of responders favorable to LABA as compared to either ICS or LTRA was significant for both the 12 and 16 week intervals.\n\nConclusion: The trial did not show a strong evidence for a carryover effect, though we have some statistical evidence to show that the carryover to the next period also depends on the treatment in the next period. Since, there is no carryover, the washout period data can be used for analysis with appropriate consideration for the risk of carryover bias.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8943], "author_name_tesi": "Dholakia, Ruchita ", "last_name_ssi": "Dholakia", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ruchita", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Theodore Mauger", "Jeffrey David Yanosky", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Theodore Mauger, Thesis Advisor", "Jeffrey David Yanosky, Thesis Advisor", "Vernon Michael Chinchilli, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["crossover trial", "carryover", "Kaplan-meier", "washout"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "the spatial-temporal relationship between meteorological variables and seasonal influenza", "id": "18851", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8949", "abstract_tesi": "Influenza has taken many human lives and stirred global panic. Most people are quite familiar with its symptom, transmission, and its distinct annual cycles. However, some aspects of influenza remain mysterious. One intriguing question is related to the influenza's temporal pattern and its association with meteorological variables. In academic studies, previous studies have found relationship between season influenza and meteorological variables such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation, rainfall, or even some global climatic variables, but no consensus has been made. Scale is an influential factor of many natural phenomena. Previous studies, however, largely ignored this factor. \n\nThis thesis addresses several shortcomings of previous studies, and analyzes this research question from a geographic perspective, hypothesizing that the relationship between meteorological variables and seasonal influenza is dependent on the temporal scale. At different scales, meteorological variables would be expected to affect influenza transmission differently. Another question is about the spatial synchronization. We often observe that influenza outbreaks in different regions have some degree of synchronization. What is the spatial pattern of this synchronization? What factors impact synchronization? \n\nThe thesis delves into the spatial synchronization of influenza as well as its relationship with distance and other social factors, such as human interactivity, using various methods from time domain analysis and frequency domain analysis. \n\nThe results reveal that: 1. According to both time domain analysis and frequency domain analysis, in the long term, there is a strong causal relationship between seasonal influenza and solar radiation. In the short term, absolute humidity is the meteorological driver of seasonal influenza. 2. Absolute humidity anomaly contributes to influenza outbreak; and when absolute humidity returns to normal, influenza also diminishes. 3. Spatial synchronization, which is measured as the Pearson correlation of influenza activities between different places, has a negative correlation with distance between those two places. In addition to distance, spatial synchronization of influenza is also affected by human interactivity and meteorological variables. This thesis concludes that the relationship between meteorological variables and seasonal influenza is indeed dependent on temporal scale. Solar radiation and absolute humidity are influenza's long-term and short-term meteorological drivers respectively. In addition, spatial synchronization of influenza activity is a quantifiable fact, which is influenced by multiple factors.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8787], "author_name_tesi": "Di, Qian ", "last_name_ssi": "Di", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Qian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donna Jean Peuquet"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donna Jean Peuquet, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["seasonal influenza", "meteorological variables", "spatial-temporal pattern", "scale"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Perceived Rejection of Masculinity as a Predictor of Backlash", "id": "15241", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "886", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of the present research was to examine links between peoples\u2019 perceptions of the degree that individuals endorse normative masculine ideology and the tendency to engage in backlash against gender counter-stereotypic individuals. \u201cBacklash\u201d refers to the phenomenon of levying social and economic sanctions against those who violate gender stereotypes.

Little is known, however, about how to positively influence exercise motivation and behavior of pregnant women with and without other children.  Thus, the purpose of this dissertation was to: (1) examine how changes in exercise attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, intention, and behavior from the first to second and the second to third pregnancy trimesters varied by motherhood status; and understand the impact of selected external factors on the TPB variables and exercise behavior across motherhood status groups; and (2) prospectively examine the moderating influence of motherhood status on the associations between: a) intention and perceived behavioral control (PBC) for predicting exercise behavior, and b) attitude, subjective norm, and PBC for predicting intention from the first to the second and the second to the third pregnancy trimester.  Pregnant women (N = 166; M age = 30 years; 47% with no children; 53% with one or more children) were recruited in the first pregnancy trimester.  Participants completed self-reported measures of exercise attitude, subjective norm, PBC, intention, and behavior mailed to them at 12-, 22-, and 32-weeks gestation.  On the 12-week survey, participants were also asked to report demographic information (e.g., age, race, and motherhood status [i.e., pregnant women with vs. pregnant women without children]), depressive symptoms, pre-pregnancy body mass index, and pre-pregnancy exercise behavior.  The study findings for the first purpose indicated that there were no motherhood status differences in the changes in attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, intention, or exercise behavior from the first to the second or the second to the third trimesters.  However, for all participants, attitude, subjective norm, and PBC increased from the first to the second trimester, while all constructs significantly decreased from the second to the third trimester.  With respect to the second study purpose, motherhood status moderated the PBC-intention and PBC-behavior associations such that first trimester PBC influenced second trimester exercise behavior and intention and third trimester intention to a greater extent for pregnant women with children compared to those women without children.  Also, second trimester intention emerged as the sole predictor of third trimester exercise behavior.  This dissertation is the first to examine how the motivational determinants of exercise behavior vary among pregnant women with and without children using the TPB as a theoretical framework.  The study findings illustrate the significant impact of PBC on women\u2019s exercise behavior and intention, particularly for women with children.  Future studies can use these findings to inform the design and implementation of pregnancy-related exercise interventions so that researchers and clinicians can more effectively promote exercise behavior during this transitional, yet defining, time point in women\u2019s lives.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2844], "author_name_tesi": "DiNallo, Jennifer Marie", "last_name_ssi": "DiNallo", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Danielle Symons Downs", "Danielle Symons Downs", "Leann L Birch", "J Douglas Coatsworth, Ph D", "Steriani Elavsky"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Danielle Symons Downs, Dissertation Advisor", "Danielle Symons Downs, Committee Chair", "Leann L Birch, Committee Member", "J Douglas Coatsworth, Ph D, Committee Member", "Steriani Elavsky, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pregnancy", "motherhood", "exercise"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in tumor cell phenotype", "id": "11597", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "637", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor widely associated with its function in xenobiotic metabolism and its ability to bind environmental pollutants in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon family such as benzo[a]pyrene and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.  Upon ligand binding, the AHR translocates to the nucleus, exchanges its chaperone complex for its heterodimerization partner, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator, and binds to dioxin response elements (DREs) in the promoter of target genes, driving transcription.  However, researchers have tied the AHR to a variety of cellular processes in addition to xenobiotic metabolism, not all of which occur through DRE binding and direct transcriptional activation.  The studies presented here build upon the finding that combinatorial treatment with exogenous AHR ligands and IL1B leads to synergistic IL6 expression in some typically non-responsive tumor cell lines.  The overall hypothesis was that the AHR plays a molecular role in IL6 transcription and represents a viable point of treatment to mediate tumor cell signaling.  Analysis of the mechanism by which these two signals mediate IL6 induction revealed that the liganded AHR binds to DREs far upstream from the IL6 promoter, yet plays a role in the de-repression of the chromatin of the proximal promoter through dismissal of co-repressor complexes.  Following this, IL1B-induced NFkB activity is able to positively affect transcription of the IL6 gene.  Subsequently, the role played by the AHR in the relatively high basal and readily inducible cytokine expression of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines was assessed.  Multiple HNSCC cell lines derived from various loco-regional tumors showed a similar state of IL6 de-repression with AHR occupancy of the promoter in the absence of exogenous ligand.  This promoter configuration could be reversed and transcription repressed through treatment of cells with an AHR antagonist and the resultant decrease in receptor occupancy of the IL6 promoter.  Next, the hypothesis was tested that basal AHR occupancy of the IL6 promoter in HNSCC cell lines is indicative of a constitutive level of receptor activity, and that the role of the AHR in various cellular processes that enhance tumor cell phenotype were similarly occurring.  Treatment of HNSCC cell lines with AHR antagonists decreased tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasive ability, and prevented the increase of an integral protein for a chemotherapy efflux pump.  The significance of the results presented in these studies reflects on both the field of AHR biology and the potential for AHR-targeted treatment in cancer, including HNSCC.  Uncovering a mechanism whereby AHR activation is one of two signals required for gene regulation opens a new field of research into combinatorial effects of the receptor and points to previously undocumented genes as being AHR targets with or without DREs in the proximal promoter.  Finally, AHR antagonist treatment is a viable method to counter constitutive AHR activity in some tumor cell types and diminishes their aggressive phenotype.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [633], "author_name_tesi": "DiNatale, Brett C", "last_name_ssi": "DiNatale", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Brett", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary H Perdew", "Gary H Perdew", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Craig Richard Baumrucker", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary H Perdew, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Chair", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Member", "Craig Richard Baumrucker, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ahr", "aryl hydrocarbon receptor", "cancer"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "False Discovery Rates when the Statistics are Discrete", "id": "12650", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2452", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While a lot of work has gone into the study of Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) and False Discovery Rate (FDR) when the test statistics are continuous, not much work has gone into the study of FDR control arising from discrete test statistics. This thesis addresses three problems with regards to high dimensional discrete tests. \nThe first problem that we will address is the estimation of the proportion of null hypotheses when the test statistics are discrete.\nWhen the test statistics are continuous, the distribution of the p-values under the null distribution is Uniform(0,1). This has made it relatively easy to estimate the proportion of true nulls ($pi_{0}$). When the test statistics are continuous and independent, the Benjamini and Hochberg's (1995) FDR cite{BH1995} controlling procedure which utilizes a p-value algorithm controls FDR exactly at the rate of $pi_{0}q_{FDR}$ where $q_{FDR}$ is the FDR error rate.  Estimation of $pi_0$ is critical since it is an input in other forms of FDR such as the local FDR (\textit{l}FDR). When the test statistics are discrete, the distribution of the p-values from these tests is quite \textit{erratic} and results in difficulty in estimating $pi_{0}$. \nSecondly, the FDR controlling procedures developed in the past have focused on continuous test statistics. Categorical data from high throughput experiments are becoming more common. Gilbert in 2005 cite{Gilbert2005} developed a method for FDR control for discrete test statistics. In this thesis we introduce an adaptive version of Gilbert's method and discuss its advantages. \\\nFinally, we address the problem of finding the local FDR (\textit{l}FDR) when the test statistics are discrete. The local FDR of the $i^{th}$ hypothesis is defined as:\n\begin{equation}\nlFDR_{i} = frac{pi_{0}f_{0i}}{pi_{0}f_{0i} + pi_{1}f_{1i}}\nend{equation}\n where $f_{0i}$ and $f_{1i}$ are the densities under the null and alternative respectively for the test statistic of the $i^{th}$ hypothesis. In addition, $pi_{1} = 1 - pi_{0}$ is the proportion of truly non-null hypotheses.\nEfron in 2005 cite{Efron2005} pioneered work in the case where the test statistics are continuous. However, one of the drawbacks of his method is that it relies on a density estimate for $f =pi_{0}f_{0} + pi_{1}f_{1}$. This method works well only in the case when $pi_{0}$ is large. We propose rewriting equation for the \textit{l}FDR as\n\begin{equation}\nmathit{l}FDR_{i} = frac{1}{ 1 + frac{pi_{1}}{pi_{0}}frac{f_{1i}}{f_{0i}}}\nend{equation}\nand using the likelihood ratio estimator $widehat{frac{f_{1i}}{f_{0i}}}$  to estimate  $frac{f_{1i}}{f_{0i}}$ . We first show that this  estimator gives reasonable results for the continuous case. Thereafter, we show how this method can be extended to discrete data.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2435], "author_name_tesi": "Dialsingh, Isaac ", "last_name_ssi": "Dialsingh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Isaac", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Statistics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Naomi S Altman", "Naomi S Altman", "Debashis Ghosh", "James Landis Rosenberger", "Bruce G Lindsay", "Claude Walker Depamphilis", "Runzi Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Naomi S Altman, Dissertation Advisor", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Chair", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member", "Bruce G Lindsay, Committee Member", "Claude Walker Depamphilis, Committee Member", "Runzi Li, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["false discovery rate", "discrete test statistics"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Mechanistic Study of myo-Inositol Oxygenase\n", "id": "11803", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6751", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The enzyme myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX) catalyzes conversion of myo-inositol (cyclohexan-1,2,3,5/4,6-hexa-ol or MI) to D-glucuronate (DG), initiating the only known pathway in humans for catabolism of the carbon skeleton of cell-signaling inositol (poly)phosphates and phosphoinositides.

All three essays study empirical applications of open economy environments with heterogeneous firms who make decisions over time.\n\nThe first essay studies trade policy and the dynamics of the solar photovoltaic manufacturing industry in the U.S. In it I develop a computable, continuous-time dynamic model of the industry where domestic firms engage in price competition against each other and an importing sector to sell solar panels to domestic consumers. Firms can attain cost reductions through learning by doing and R&D investments. I use the model to estimate its main parameters using firm-level survey data from the Department of Energy and then simulate the application of countervailing duties to imports of solar panels, analyzing the implications for the evolution of the industry and welfare. In a scenario where a 30% duty is applied to imports, domestic firms respond by increasing R&D expenditures, therefore increasing productivity and setting lower prices, even when concentration increases as high productivity domestic firms gain market share.\n\nThe second essay is on the dynamics of the textiles and garments industry in Bangladesh. First, it shows that, in contrast to the standard description of entry into foreign markets, Bangladeshi exporters are fully committed to foreign markets, exporting most of their output abroad; they start big, not small, and show high survival rates once they start exporting. They are born to export firms who operate in orphan industries, with essentially missing domestic demand for their products. In addition to the usual fixed and sunk costs of exporting, they must face presumably higher costs of starting up new businesses. Then it compares these patterns with those of China, Colombia and Taiwan, and find similar but less-striking patterns for China. These features seem to be missing in Taiwan and Colombia, which accord with other typical cases described in the literature. Finally, it adapts a search and learning model of export dynamics to show how the presence of high sunk costs of establishing a new business and the absence of a domestic market can generate export trajectories similar to the ones we observe in Bangladesh. \n\nThe third essay focuses on the links between productivity and exporting. The trade literature has identified three relationships. First, that productivity causes exporting, so that there is selection into exporting by more productive firms. Second, that exporting generates productivity growth through, for example, learning-by-exporting. Third, that firms make choices that make them more productive in preparation to export. The essay shows that patterns of Chinese exporters are consistent with all three hypotheses. Exporters are more productive than non-exporters, which is consistent with selection. For successful exporters, most of the productivity growth during the period occurred after entering export markets, rather than before. For unsuccessful exporters, on the other hand, this pattern is reversed. Average annual productivity growth, however, is higher prior to entry for both groups. Finally, new exporters increase sales expenditures and earn higher revenue from new products than other firms before they start exporting. This is true when compared to both non-exporters and continuous exporters.

This model-data comparison is applied using both time and spatial statistical analysis for two different periods: June through December 2007 and the 2007 growing season.  The comparison shows that the model tends to predict 10 to 15 ppm higher mid-summer or growing season concentrations at three sites located in the \u201ccorn belt\u201d.  Carbon Tracker tends to be highly correlated to the observations for the period of June through December (&#8805; 0.8), but this correlation is lower for the growing season period (&#8804; 0.8).  Residuals are not Gaussian, raising questions regarding the assumption of Gaussian residuals typically used in atmospheric inversions.  The time scale for autocorrelation of the residuals is 30 to 80 days, the result of Carbon Tracker\u2019s persistent overestimate of the growing season mixing ratio.  Spatial correlations are largest between sites that are closer and share the same type of vegetation, but some other high spatial correlations diagnosed are not explained by these factors.  The residuals do not show any clear correlations with synoptic weather.  Overall, the model results for all sites are more inconsistent with the observations during the growing season, with the \u201ccorn belt\u201d sites showing the least skill of all.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3897], "author_name_tesi": "Diaz Isaac, Liza Ivelisse", "last_name_ssi": "Diaz Isaac", "middle_name_ssi": "Ivelisse", "first_name_ssi": "Liza", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis", "Kenneth James Davis", "Natasha Lynn Miles"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis, Thesis Advisor", "Kenneth James Davis, Thesis Advisor", "Natasha Lynn Miles, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["atmospheric inversion", "carbon cycle", "carbon dioxide", "MCI field campaign"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EVALUATION OF ATMOSPHERIC TRANSPORT AND ITS IMPACT ON CO2 MIXING RATIOS", "id": "13837lzd120", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13837", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Atmospheric inversions are used to assess biosphere-atmosphere CO2 surface exchanges at various scales. Recently, higher resolution inversions were performed using mesoscale models to improve the spatial and temporal resolution of these inversions, but variability among inverse flux estimates remains significant. One of the main contributors to these uncertainties is the atmospheric transport model errors. Past studies have used ensembles to understand these transport model uncertainties, but have some limitations including the small number of measurements, coarse resolution of the models, small number of members, centered only in the variation of Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) schemes and no assessment was performed to test whether the spread of the ensemble represents the true uncertainty.\nFor this work, I evaluate and quantify the transport model errors with a large set of simulations generated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale model. The large ensemble of 45-members was constructed using different physics parameterizations (i.e., land surface models (LSMs), planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes, cumulus parameterizations and microphysics parameterizations) and initial/boundary conditions. All the different models were coupled to CO2 fluxes and lateral boundary conditions from CarbonTracker to simulate CO2 mole fractions. I evaluate the atmospheric transport errors over a highly instrumented area, the Mid-Continental Intensive (MCI) region, for 2008 summer period. Both modeled meteorological variables (i.e., wind speed, wind direction and PBL height) and CO2 mixing ratios are compared to observations to evaluate the performance of the different models and the ensemble.\nIn Chapter 2, I performed statistical analyses to evaluate the impact of both physics parameterizations and the meteorological dataset on CO2 mixing ratios and meteorological variables. The different model configurations show varying performances across the region that impede the selection of an optimal solution or least biased simulation for all the meteorological variables except for PBL height (PBLH). In general, physical parameterizations contribute equally to the model-to-model variability in atmospheric CO2 and meteorological variables, with the microphysics parameterization being the exception. It was also found that daily variations in CO2 mole fractions across the region are correlated primarily with errors in the PBLH. In Chapter 3, I introduce two calibrations (or down-selection) methodologies using Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic Algorithm (GA) over 2008 summer.  I applied the calibration process to the multi-physics/multi-analysis ensemble of 45-members to select the optimal ensemble using the flatness of the rank histogram as the main criteria. The calibrated ensemble representing the model errors is based on all three meteorological variables. Using multiple model configurations (i.e. 45 configurations of varying physics), I show that a reduced number of simulations (less than 10 members) is sufficient to characterize the transport errors, reproducing the statistics of the model-data differences while minimizing the size of the ensemble. The CO2 error correlations of the calibrated ensembles were compared to the large ensemble to identify any impact of the calibration. Compared to the initial error structures, the calibrated ensembles revealed sampling noise across the region which indicates that additional filtering or modeling of the errors would be required to construct the error covariance matrix for regional CO2 inversion.\nUsing the multi-physics and multi-analysis ensemble, I showed the importance that other physics parameterization besides the PBL schemes has on the atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio errors. In addition, the challenges that future atmospheric inversions still need to confront including correction of systematic biases and representation of errors, to avoid the propagation of these errors into inverse fluxes.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14515], "author_name_tesi": "Diaz Isaac, Liza Ivelisse", "last_name_ssi": "Diaz Isaac", "middle_name_ssi": "Ivelisse", "first_name_ssi": "Liza", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth J.

Looking at mysticism in relation to science permits a fresh exploration of why science finds itself struggling with mystical concepts, such as wholeness, vastness, transcendence, hierarchy, or infinity. Likewise, looking at how science develops and systematizes scalar descriptions permits a reworking of these mystical concepts in a manner that retains a clearer reference to empirical practices, while not remaining strictly within a material conception of the cosmos. The question of scale permits the project to mix together readings of scientific and cultural icons, philosophical considerations, and rhetorical analysis, all centered on trying to understand how we think and talk about significant shifts in size.

The modeling framework and variables developed in this thesis will aid forest managers in prediction of advance regeneration composition and abundance and guide future advance regeneration modeling in the northeastern United States as relevant data becomes available in those states.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8733], "author_name_tesi": "Dicarlo, Michael John", "last_name_ssi": "Dicarlo", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marc Mc Dill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marc Mc Dill, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Advance regeneration", "modeling", "Pennsylvania", "hardwood forest"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Boundary Conditions of Backlash for Black Women: When Black Women Escape Backlash for Agentic and Dominant Behavior in the Workplace", "id": "8695ecd5091", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "8695", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "When vying for leadership roles, women who act in stereotypically masculine ways are considered less likable and less hireable compared to similarly behaving men, furthering the gender disparity in leadership roles (Rudman, 1998).

Although Black women\u2019s race and gender are incongruent with leadership prototypes, Black women may escape backlash for dominant behavior because of their nonprototypicality as Blacks and as women (Hall et al., 2014; Livingston et al., 2012) and because of stereotypes about their assertiveness and strength. Informed by an intersectional perspective, three studies explore when Black women experience backlash. Study 1 analyzed prescriptive and proscriptive stereotypes about agency and dominance and found that Black men and women were prescribed agency and proscribed dominance in similar ways. Overall, it was considered more ideal for Black women and men to posses agentic and dominant traits compared to White women, but less ideal compared to White men. Study 2 examined whether dominance or agency descriptions in an employee review would influence promoting intentions, but found that Black women and men received more favorable reviews compared to White women and men, regardless of how they were described.

In this paper, I argue that perceiving an angry target as competent depends on who is expressing the emotion, and that race and gender stereotypes intersect to influence perceptions of black women\u2019s anger. Using an intersectional framework, I propose two competing hypotheses about the perception of black women\u2019s anger in the workplace, relative to the perception of white women\u2019s anger: 1) Given race and gender stereotypes about black women\u2019s aggressiveness, angry black women may be seen as hostile and therefore less competent, or 2) given race and gender stereotypes about black women\u2019s assertiveness and directness, angry black women may be perceived strong and therefore as more competent. To test these predictions, participants (N = 312), recruited through Mechanical Turk, read a vignette depicting a black female, a white female, or a white male target, who expressed either anger or sadness in a work context. The black female target was perceived as significantly more competent, and also as more hostile than the white female target in the anger condition.  In the sad condition, the white female target was more competent than the black female target, and previous findings that white men\u2019s anger conveys more competence than white women\u2019s anger was not replicated.  This suggests that intersecting gender and race stereotypes differentially impact white women and black women.  I conclude that testing these competing hypotheses is a crucial step in moving forward theory about stereotyping and perceptions of emotion.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8596], "author_name_tesi": "Dicicco, Elaine Claire", "last_name_ssi": "Dicicco", "middle_name_ssi": "Claire", "first_name_ssi": "Elaine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephanie A Shields"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephanie A Shields, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["gender stereotypes", "race stereotypes", "emotion"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A New Metric to Predict Listener Envelopment Based On Spherical Microphone Array Measurements and Higher Order Ambisonic Reproductions", "id": "14882dad325", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14882", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The objective of this work was to create a new metric to predict listener envelopment (LEV), the sense of being surrounded by the sound field, based on 32-channel spherical microphone array measurements taken in a number of venues and a series of listening tests. A spherical microphone array was used to investigate LEV because it can be used for a) high resolution spatial analysis of the sound field in full 3D via beamforming techniques, and b) subjective listening tests using 3D reproductions of the sound fields over a loudspeaker array via Ambisonics. This work is comprised of three separate studies: a first study validating the spherical microphone array measurement system, a second study investigating LEV in a 2,000-seat concert hall, and a third study in which a new metric is proposed to predict LEV based on listening tests using measurements obtained in seven additional halls.\nA study was conducted to validate the spherical microphone array measurement system. Spatial room impulse response (IR) measurements were taken in a 2500-seat auditorium to determine how room acoustic metrics measured with a spherical microphone array compare to those measured with the traditional microphone setup (an omnidirectional and figure-8 microphone pair). Measurements were obtained at six receiver locations with three repetitions each to evaluate repeatability. The metrics considered in this study were: reverberation time (T30), early decay time (EDT), clarity index (C80\u00ac), strength (G), lateral energy fraction (JLF) and late lateral energy level (LJ). For the spherical array measurements, the omnidirectional (monopole) and figure-8 (dipole) patterns were extracted via spherical harmonic beamforming. The measurements were found to be consistent both across repetition and microphone configuration. The results from this study indicate that spherical microphone arrays can be used to both measure existing LEV metrics, and to develop a new metric to predict LEV.\nAn LEV study was conducted using spherical microphone array IRs obtained in a 2,000-seat concert hall in several receiver locations and hall absorption settings. The IRs were analyzed using a 3rd order plane wave decomposition (PWD) beamformer. Additionally, the IRs were convolved with anechoic music and processed for 3rd order Ambisonic reproductions and presented to subjects over a 30-loudspeaker array. Instances were found in which the energy in the late sound field did not correlate with LEV ratings as well as energy in a 70 to 100 ms time window. Follow-up listening tests were conducted with hybrid IRs containing portions of a highly enveloping IR and a highly unenveloping IR with crossover times ranging from 40-140 ms. Additional hybrid IRs were studied wherein portions of the spatial IRs were collapsed into all frontal energy with crossover times ranging from 40-120 ms. The tests confirmed that much of the important LEV information exists in the early portion of these IRs.\nIn a final LEV study, spherical microphone array IRs were obtained in seven additional halls of various sizes and shapes. The IRs were used for listening tests that included stimuli that were presented as-measured, which included level differences, stimuli that were equalized for level differences, and hybrid stimuli generated by combining portions of enveloping IRs and unenveloping IRs. A new metric was developed named mid-late spatial energy, J_S, by integrating energy from a 3rd order PWD of the room IRs as a function of frequency, azimuthal angle, elevation angle, and time, and adjusting the integration limits to maximize correlation between integrated energy and LEV ratings. The difference in overall level between halls was found to be highly correlated with the perception of LEV, but for level-equalized stimuli the correlation was maximized by integrating energy from 60 ms to 400 ms, rejecting sound from the front \u00b120\u00b0 in azimuth and rejecting sound from \u00b170\u00b0 in azimuth behind the listener. This new metric has a higher correlation with LEV ratings than the currently used metric of late lateral energy level, L_J.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15978], "author_name_tesi": "Dick, David Avi", "last_name_ssi": "Dick", "middle_name_ssi": "Avi", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michelle Celine Vigeant", "Michelle Celine Vigeant", "Daniel Allen Russell", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "John F Doherty", "Bill Rabinowitz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michelle Celine Vigeant, Dissertation Advisor", "Michelle Celine Vigeant, Committee Chair", "Daniel Allen Russell, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member", "John F Doherty, Outside Member", "Bill Rabinowitz, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Concert hall acoustics", "Architectural acoustics", "Ambisonics", "Spherical microphone array", "Loudspeaker array", "Listener envelopment"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A promising anti-cancer agent that functions as a dual target inhibitor of SphK1 and microtubule dynamics", "id": "29574", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12664", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An extensive amount of data points to sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and aberrant regulation of sphingolipids as important components of tumorigenesis. We previously developed SKI-178 as a novel small molecule, SphK1-selective inhibitor that is cytotoxic toward a broad panel of cancer cell lines. Nonetheless, the mechanism underlying SKI-178 induced apoptotic cell death had not yet been elucidated. Therefore, the overarching goal of this research study was to uncover the detailed mechanism-of-action (MOA) of SKI-178 induced apoptosis. Using human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines as a model, we present evidence that SKI-178 induces prolonged mitosis followed by apoptotic cell death through the intrinsic apoptotic cascade. We further demonstrate that the sustained activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) during SKI-178 mediated prolonged mitosis leads to the simultaneous phosphorylation of pro-survival Bcl-2 family members, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, as well as the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of Mcl-1. Based on evidence in the literature suggesting a link between SphK1 activity and mitotic arrest, we originally attributed much of the MOA to SphK1 inhibition. However, in light of recent reports claiming that SphK1 inhibition alone is not sufficient to induce apoptotic cell death; we considered the possibility that SKI-178 may have additional targets that contribute to its cytotoxicity. Based on the striking similarly between the MOA of SKI-178 and various agents that disrupt microtubules, we considered the possibility that SKI-178, in addition to being a SphK1 selective inhibitor, also affects normal microtubule dynamics. We hypothesize that SKI-178 mediated apoptosis is due to its ability to work as a microtubule targeting agent (MTA), and that its concomitant inhibition of SphK1 sensitizes cells to this effect. Herein we present evidence that SKI-178 does indeed function as MTA, preventing the polymerization of the microtubule network. Furthermore, we demonstrate that independent of SKI-178, inhibition of SphK1 alone sensitizes cells to vincristine, a MTA known for its ability to disrupt microtubule polymerization. We also definitively confirm that in cells, SKI-178 is able to directly target engage both SphK1 and tubulin proteins at concentrations known to induce apoptotic cell death in a panel of cancer cell lines. Moreover, multi-drug resistance, mediated by multidrug resistant protein-1 and/or pro-survival Bcl-2 family member over-expression, did not affect the sensitivity of cells to SKI-178. Together, these results establish SKI-178 as a dual target inhibitor with promising chemotherapeutic potential for a wide variety of cancer types including those know to be multi-drug resistant.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11954], "author_name_tesi": "Dick, Taryn Eve", "last_name_ssi": "Dick", "middle_name_ssi": "Eve", "first_name_ssi": "Taryn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Toxicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jong Kak Yun", "Jong Kak Yun", "Victor J Ruiz Velasco", "Shantu G Amin", "Dhimant Desai", "Richard Robert Young", "Jeremy Andrew Hengst"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jong Kak Yun, Dissertation Advisor", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Chair", "Victor J Ruiz Velasco, Committee Member", "Shantu G Amin, Committee Member", "Dhimant Desai, Committee Member", "Richard Robert Young, Committee Member", "Jeremy Andrew Hengst, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sphingosine Kinase", "Cyclin-dependent kinase 1", "cell cycle arrest", "mitotic arrest", "mitotic cell death", "microtubules"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The influence of silvicultural management on forest structure", "id": "12443", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6730", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The loss of biodiversity and human-induced climate change are both contemporary global issues that are intimately linked to forest structure (Working Group III of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007; Jenkins, 2003). This dissertation examines effects of land management on forest structure at both the stand and landscape scales. Specifically, it investigates the effect of five types of silvicultural cutting (clear-cut, improvement thinning, diameter-limited thinning from the top, diameter-limited thinning from below, and the initial cut of a shelterwood system) on forest structural diversity and carbon storage in mixed oak hardwood forests of Pennsylvania. Furthermore, it develops LiDAR (Light Detecting and Ranging) techniques to quantify forest structural diversity at a landscape level to examine forest structure, with comparisons between eco-provinces and management types. \n\nAt the stand scale, it was found that structural resilience to silvicultural disturbances was greater than compositional resilience, resulting in forests that appeared to recover quickly from disturbance but were compositionally altered. More intense disturbances caused greater changes in forest structure and composition, requiring longer to return to near pre-disturbance conditions; however, the forest strata disturbed also influenced the disturbance severity and therefore the forest's response. This study demonstrated that silvicultural cutting may be used to increase structural diversity at the stand level (e.g., establishment cut of a shelterwood system); however, this comes at the cost of an increase in shade-tolerant regeneration to the detriment of economically and ecologically valuable mid-successional species. The long-term outcomes of partial cuts were complex and context specific, and this complexity may be useful for maintaining or increasing structural complexity at the landscape level. A variety of silvicultural techniques should be implemented to achieve management objectives of increased forest structural diversity. \n\nIn terms of carbon storage at the stand scale, although the clearcutting treatment had the highest carbon periodic annual increment (cPAI) in the first 15 years post harvest, it was projected to store considerably less carbon in the long term (over 100-years) than the other treatments. The projected low carbon storage in this treatment is likely due to a shift in species composition to early successional species that store less carbon per tree. Amongst the partial cutting methods, the improvement thin was the best option with moderate timber harvest rates, moderately high cPAI in the first 15 years post-harvest and relatively high carbon storage in the long-term; however, refraining from cutting remains the best option for carbon storage if the forest is in the aggradation phase. Poor silvicultural decisions may lead to reduced carbon storage of forest stands in the long-term, reducing the effectiveness of these forest carbon sinks for climate change mitigation. \n\nTo explore forest structure at the landscape level, a method to map forest canopy structure over large areas was developed using low-density topographic Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and orthographic photography collected for Pennsylvania as part of PAMAP (Pennsylvania Map Program). K-means clustering of LiDAR statistics on a grid basis was used in conjunction with multinomial logistic regression to develop a LiDAR Canopy Structure Topology (LCST). The fourteen resulting LCST types reflect vegetation top height and canopy structural complexity with a correct classification rate of 96%. This LCST provides cost-effective forest structure information by relying on remote sensing data freely available for the entire state of Pennsylvania and that could be widely utilized for forest, wildlife and landscape planning. Furthermore, the methods developed here may be adapted to map forest structure in other contexts with different LiDAR data sets. \n\nThis LCST was then mapped over 20 large landscapes within Pennsylvania, and these contrasting landscapes analyzed to investigate the influence of both site and four differing land management types (non-government, Bureau of Forestry, Bureau of State Parks and Pennsylvania Game Commission) on forest structure. It was found that at the local scale both topography and land management type had significant influences over forest structure; however, combined they only explained 32% of the variation in forest structure. At the landscape scale, there were significant differences in forest landscape structure between both Bailey's eco-provinces and management types. Specifically, non-government forests showed evidence of forest structure fragmentation. These non-government forested lands contained a higher proportion of short vegetation types, higher patch density, and greater heterogeneity of neighboring patches. This within-forest fragmentation is likely to have implications for both biodiversity and ecosystem services. \n\nTogether, the studies presented in this dissertation show that management has a great impact on forest structure and carbon storage at both the stand and landscape levels. Management modifies the underlying influence of the environment, resulting in the realized forest structure patterns on the landscape. Therefore managers need to consciously incorporate these considerations into their management decisions at both the stand and landscape levels. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6725], "author_name_tesi": "Dickinson, Yvette ", "last_name_ssi": "Dickinson", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yvette", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Assoc Prof Eric Zenner", "Eric Zenner", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye", "Douglas Alan Miller", "Kim C Steiner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Assoc Prof Eric Zenner, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Zenner, Committee Chair", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye, Committee Member", "Douglas Alan Miller, Committee Member", "Kim C Steiner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["LiDAR", "Forest Structure", "Silviculture", "Carbon Storage", "Landscape ecology"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF HEAT RESISTANT MILK CHOCOLATES\n\n\n", "id": "8981", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "944", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conventionally heat resistance has been inferred as the fat phase melting point of the chocolate sample. The multitude of patents and literature proposing heat resistant chocolate samples, do not always change the melting point of the fat phase but instead induce heat resistance by affecting its structure. Hence heat resistance has to be measured as a multi-dimensional attribute. Although there are many methods of making heat resistant chocolate, there is no uniform method for measuring heat resistance. The overall goal of this research was to develop methods to characterize and differentiate the heat resistance of milk chocolate. A classification with different levels of heat resistance has also been proposed. \nOne standard milk chocolate and six heat resistant milk chocolates were made, based on techniques published in patents and articles, to represent samples with a wide range of heat resistance. All samples were submitted to a descriptive sensory panel, which evaluated tactile attributes (firmness to touch, stickiness to fingers and snap) and oral attributes (abrasiveness, hardness with incisors, fracturability, cohesiveness of mass, time to melt, firmness with tongue, adhesiveness to teeth, number of particles, oily mouthcoating and chocolate messiness) related to the texture of milk chocolates at 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F), 29 \u00b0C (85 \u00b0F), and 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F). \nInstrumental techniques were used to measure physical and textural properties at these temperatures, which were correlated with the sensory results. Physical properties measured were particle size by laser diffraction, moisture content by Karl Fischer method, fat content by OICC method, thermal analysis measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and a melting collapse test using a dynamic mechanical analysis instrument. The parameters measured by the melting collapse test were onset of collapse, inflection point and % collapsed. Textural properties were measured using textural profile analysis (TPA) and a three point bending test (3PB). The instrumental parameters measured were: TPA hardness, TPA adhesiveness, TPA cohesiveness, TPA springiness, TPA resilience, TPA gumminess, TPA chewiness, 3PB hardness and 3PB work. \nAn analysis of variance of the sensory results was performed.  The main effects of sample, panelist and temperature and their interactions were considered in the model. The interaction between sample and panelist, was significant for five attributes: Stickiness to finger, cohesiveness of mass, adhesiveness to teeth, number of particles and oily mouthcoating. The interaction between sample and temperature was significant for eight attributes: Firmness to touch, stickiness to finger, snap, abrasiveness, hardness with incisors, fracturability, firmness with tongue and oily mouth coating. The interaction between panelist and temperature was significant for ten attributes: Firmness to touch, stickiness to finger, snap, hardness with incisors, fracturability, cohesiveness of mass, time to melt, firmness with tongue, number of particles, oily mouthcoating and chocolate messiness. \nAn analysis of variance was also performed on the textural parameters measure by TPA and 3PB. The main effects of sample and temperature and their interactions were considered in the model. The interaction between sample and temperature was significant for seven parameters: TPA hardness, TPA adhesiveness, TPA cohesiveness, TPA resilience, TPA gumminess, 3PB hardness and 3PB work. The main effects were only taken into consideration for two attributes: TPA springiness and TPA chewiness. The main effect temperature was significant for both attributes, meaning that these parameters were affected by change in temperature. The main effect sample was only significant for TPA springiness.\nLinear correlations and principal component analysis were performed in order to explore the relationship between sensorial attributes and instrumental measurements. A method of ranking of heat resistance was proposed. When the samples were ranked at each temperature based on the sensory attributes and instrumental measurements, most of the heat resistant variants showed an improvement as compared to standard chocolate.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [936], "author_name_tesi": "Dicolla, Carolina Bottignon", "last_name_ssi": "Dicolla", "middle_name_ssi": "Bottignon", "first_name_ssi": "Carolina", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran", "B Douglas Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Thesis Advisor", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Thesis Advisor", "B Douglas Brown, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["confectionery", "sensory analysis", "textural analysis", "heat resistant", "chocolate", "texture profile analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Teaching Visual Media Literacy: An Examination of High School Students in Rural Vermont - Visual Imagery and Filmmaking", "id": "13380lmd313", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13380", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this study of the work and experiences of high school students as they develop 21st century learning skills, I, as teacher-researcher, interpret and analyze digital imagery produced and analyzed by the students in my courses during the 2015-2016 school year.

Variable within each of these constructs were tested in order to determine which contribute to two dependent variables: giving (a dichotomous variable) and amount of giving (a continuous variable). \nBoth logistic and ordinary least squares regression analyses were employed to determine which factors are related to giving. Of the demographic variables, gender and family income influenced the decision to make a gift but not the amount of giving and year of graduation was significant in four of the five models. Of the academic and social integration variables, number of student activities, grade-point average, and academic college, were predictive of both giving and the amount of giving. Amount of loan debt, the single capacity to give variable, was not predictive of either giving or the amount of giving. \nWithin the motivation to give construct, the primary variables of interest were scholarship receipt and scholarship amount. Scholarship receipt was found to impact the decision to make a gift but not the size of the gift. The amount of scholarships received impacts both giving and the amount of giving. Alumni Association membership, the third motivation to give variable, was the most predictive of all of the variables in the study, impacting both giving and the amount of giving. \nFurther analysis is recommended in order to develop a comprehensive portrait of aid receipt as a predictor of alumni giving, to determine if particular types of aid receipt result in giving to particular areas within the university, to determine whether the conceptual model\u2019s predictive ability could be improved with the addition or subtraction of variables, and to determine if the relationship between aid receipt and giving differs based on college or university characteristics.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [122], "author_name_tesi": "Diehl, Abigail G.", "last_name_ssi": "Diehl", "middle_name_ssi": "G.", "first_name_ssi": "Abigail", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson", "Donald Heller", "Lisa Lattuca", "Jon F Nussbaum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson, Committee Chair", "Donald Heller, Committee Chair", "Lisa Lattuca, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["scholarships", "giving", "alumni", "university"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Preparation and characterization of lignin-protein covalent linkages", "id": "21093", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10033", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-02-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Lignin is a natural aromatic polymer that is bio-synthesized in the cell walls of almost all land plants. Great strides have been made in understanding lignin\u2019s biological origins and chemical and physical properties. However, many unanswered questions remain.

In order to help address this question, the preparation and characterization of lignin-protein covalent linkages is reported here for the first time. Chapter 1 provides a more detailed introduction, justification, and literature review.\nChapter 2 focuses on the preparation of low molecular weight lignin-protein model compounds. The compounds were not prepared under biomimetic conditions. Instead, the primary focus of this study was on the characterization of the model compounds, leading to the identification of diagnostic lignin-protein NMR chemical shifts.\nChapter 3 describes the characterization of lignin-protein linkages prepared under biomimetic conditions of lignin DHP formation. NMR showed that cysteine and tyrosine containing peptides covalently crosslink with lignin, while other amino acids do not. IR and EDS were useful for showing the general incorporation of protein into the lignin, but were incapable of distinguishing covalent and non-covalent interactions.\nChapter 4 describes the interaction between lignin and gelatin protein. It was found, using EDS and IR, that gelatin was incorporated into lignin DHP. However, a lack of diagnostic NMR signatures revealed that the crosslinking was likely dominated by non-covalent interactions such as physical entanglement. This seems likely, as gelatin is lacking in both cysteine and tyrosine residues, which were shown to be the only reactive amino acids towards lignin.\nChapter 5 details attempts at identifying lignin-protein linkages in wild type Arabidopsis.

The next finding, ongoing transformations, examined the student\u2019s emerging change in perception, how they went from hating math to liking it, and the enjoyment that the adult developmental learners found in the class.  The third finding focused on the shared connections the adult developmental learners were developing with each other while the fourth finding discussed the enhanced independence that the adult developmental learners were acquiring.

Wedemeyer (1911-1999) was one of the first to develop theory for, and to give direction to, the growing and newly professionalized field which has become known as open and distance education. Through his leadership at influential institutions such as The University of Wisconsin, The National University Extension Association, and the International Council for Open and Distance Education, he developed a global network of colleagues and collaborators. His views on open education, Independent Study and Independent Learning became renown worldwide. Wedemeyer put theory into practice through the creation of the ground-breaking experimental Articulated Instructional Media (AIM) program at the University of Wisconsin, and as the First Kellogg Fellow at Oxford University and consultant during the formative years at the Open University of the United Kingdom, he imparted the concepts of a revolutionary pedagogical approach based on system theory which combined various technologies and media in distance education. In the 1970s, these concepts were disseminated world-wide resulting in the establishment of scores of Open Universities which have provided opportunities for millions of students to garner an education.  \nIn his 1981 book Learning at the Back Door: Reflections on Non-Traditional Learning in the Lifespan, Charles A. Wedemeyer identified Open or Independent learning as \"a single great new development in education\" (p. 60) that would be a vehicle for a new era in higher education. During his career at the University of Wisconsin from the 1940s through the 1970s, Wedemeyer\u2019s contributions to the foundations of distance education built upon the democratic education ideals of the Wisconsin Idea and led to today's international open education movement.  \nWhile scholars have identified Wedemeyer as playing a significant role in the evolution of open and distance education, to date there has been minimal substantive support or analysis of Wedemeyer\u2019s contributions. \nThrough an examination of archival data at The University of Wisconsin, The University of South Africa, The U.S. Navy, and The Open University of the United Kingdom, this study provides a greater understanding of the evolution of open and distance education and how Wedemeyer\u2019s contributions and innovative design of educational systems shaped the field. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6491], "author_name_tesi": "Diehl, William C", "last_name_ssi": "Diehl", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Grahame Moore", "Michael Grahame Moore", "Gary Kuhne", "Melody M Thompson", "Lawrence Christopher Ragan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Grahame Moore, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Grahame Moore, Committee Chair", "Gary Kuhne, Committee Chair", "Melody M Thompson, Committee Member", "Lawrence Christopher Ragan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["open education", "open learning", "distance education", "distance learning", "correspondence education", "distance education history", "independent learning", "ODL"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A FOOT IN TWO WORLDS: A NARRATIVE INQUIRY OF THE EXPERIENCES OF WORKING CLASS WOMEN MANAGERS\n", "id": "9367", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3501", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This qualitative study used narrative inquiry to explore the experiences of nine working class women managers.

The expression of specific genes at the transcriptional level is often tightly regulated to ensure that these genes are turned on or off only at the proper time and in the appropriate cell type. One of the most well studied cases of such regulation in eukaryotes is the GAL gene switch found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The GAL genes are necessary for the metabolism of galactose and their transcription is activated by a DNA-binding transcriptional activator, Gal4, in the presence of galactose. However, without galactose the activity of Gal4 is inhibited by its interaction with Gal80. A key regulatory component in activation of the GAL gene switch is the Gal3 protein. Gal3 senses the presence of intracellular galactose and binds to Gal80, relieving the Gal80-inhibition of Gal4. Although Gal3 interaction with Gal80 leads to Gal4-mediated activation of the GAL genes, there is a major gap of knowledge in how Gal3 itself is activated by galactose and ATP, and it is not known which amino acids of Gal3 are important for interaction with Gal80. In this thesis work, I addressed the mechanism in which Gal3 is activated by its ligands and also identified the surface and amino acids that are necessary for interaction with Gal80.\n\nIntragenic suppression analyses were performed for GAL3C mutants that confer a constitutive GAL gene activation and a galactose-independent interaction with Gal80. Of the five GAL3C alleles analyzed, four were suppressed by the second-site suppressor (GAL3SOC-D68S), while one allele (GAL3C-D368V) was not suppressed. On the Gal3 homology model, the suppressed GAL3C alleles co-localized with the second-site suppressor to the \u201chinge\u201d region consisting of &#946;-sheets s-C, -H and &#945;-helices h-K, -O, whereas the non-suppressed allele localized to the opposite side of the \u201chinge\u201d region at &#945;-helix h-J. The GAL3C-D368V allele had previously been shown to suppress a GAL80S-G323R interaction mutation. Crosslinking results of Gal3 and Gal80 are consistent with the notion that they interact by surfaces that include Gal3-D368 and Gal80-G323. This is further supported by the localization of gal3 interaction mutants surrounding Gal3-D368 on the homology model. The data suggest that a local conformational change occurs within the \u201chinge\u201d region to activate Gal3, while the interaction interface encompassing D368 plays a direct role in the binding to Gal80. Furthermore, based on considerations of E. coli galactokinase and previous attempts to isolate Gal3 interaction peptides, I conclude that the Gal80-binding surface of Gal3 is a composite of noncontiguous elements.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1106], "author_name_tesi": "Diep, Cuong Quoc", "last_name_ssi": "Diep", "middle_name_ssi": "Quoc", "first_name_ssi": "Cuong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James E Hopper", "Anita Klein Hopper", "Sergei A Grigoryev", "George Makhatadze", "Vincent Chau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James E Hopper, Committee Chair", "Anita Klein Hopper, Committee Member", "Sergei A Grigoryev, Committee Member", "George Makhatadze, Committee Member", "Vincent Chau, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["GAL gene switch", "transcription regulation", "GAL3"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Role of Probabilistic Cues in L2 Processing: Verb bias in Spanish and English", "id": "21537", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9688", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The majority of sentence processing research has focused on monolingual populations, but in today\u2019s global society bilinguals are ubiquitous. In light of this, it is important to investigate sentence processing in bilinguals, and especially what factors might lead to high proficiency in a bilingual\u2019s second language. One measure of this is how a bilingual achieves fully native-like performance in a bilingual\u2019s second language. Verb subcategorization bias is one probabilistic cue shown to be used in monolingual sentence processing. Previous research with Spanish-English bilinguals has pointed towards the importance of immersion in the L2 for developing target performance with experience-based cues such as verb bias, but in populations immersed in their L1, transfer of L1 verb bias information has not been observed, even when highly activated cognate verbs are present in the stimuli. This raises the question: Is it the case that probabilistic cues like verb bias are not subject to L1 transfer during L2 processing, in contrast with what has been observed for lexical and grammatical properties? Or is there information missing from the assumptions about verb bias in the two languages in previous studies?  To answer these questions, the studies in this dissertation had two principal goals: 1) To conduct a corpus study of complement-taking verbs in Spanish and English to determine the subcategorization biases of those verbs, as well as the linguistic contexts which co-occur with them; and 2) To use the information derived from the corpus study to inform and provide materials for an eye-tracking study which investigates how bilinguals use L1 and L2 verb bias information during online sentence parsing. Given that verb bias is one of many experience-based sources of information found to be useful during processing, bilingual groups immersed in their L1 and their L2 were included to examine how L2 immersion modulates the use of L1 and L2 information during processing in the L2.\nThis dissertation is significant for a number of reasons. First, to my knowledge, this is the first large-scale corpus study investigating verb bias in Spanish. Through its design, this dissertation contributes a body of verb bias information in Spanish comparable to the existing information in English, thus paving the way for additional future verb bias research in other contexts when one of the languages studied is Spanish. In addition, this dissertation further strengthens and expands what is known about verb bias in English and cross-linguistically by developing among the first known multivariate models of verb bias in English and Spanish. The comparison of verb bias across corpora and cross-linguistically finds that while verb bias can differ from one language to another, the level of concordance across languages is actually quite high, and the level of concordance across corpora even higher, supporting a view that the structural features of verb bias are, to some extent, semantically driven. \nThis dissertation is also among the first efforts to employ naturally occurring sentences selected from a corpus as stimuli in a lab-based processing study, thereby helping to close the perceived gap between laboratory results and what speakers do when processing naturally-occurring language. Twice, eye-tracking data from monolingual English speakers in this dissertation, using both laboratory-created and corpus-extract stimuli, replicated processing patterns found in previous experimental studies of verb bias and demonstrated that native speakers are sensitive to frequency-based cues to structure during online processing. Moreover, evidence from bilingual groups finds that with enough proficiency and immersion experience, second language learners are able to make use of those same cues in their target language. However, when bilinguals are exposed repeatedly to cognates which share form and meaning across languages, even the most proficient among them fall prey to L1 transfer effects encouraged by the heightened parallel activation of shared lexical items. In contrast, bilinguals who are highly proficient but have not been immersed in their second language long-term, resort to simplicity heuristics. From a theoretical standpoint, the comparison of processing patterns for sentences containing cognates and non-cognates informs models of second language processing and test the limits of L1 transfer as an L2 parsing strategy. The results herein provide evidence that \u2018shallow structures\u2019 are a likely a developmental phase, but not a permanent state of L2 learning which can be supplemented or even overcome through extensive language experience. It furthermore provides evidence of a usage-based approach to grammar and processing.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9445], "author_name_tesi": "Dietrich, Amelia Jane", "last_name_ssi": "Dietrich", "middle_name_ssi": "Jane", "first_name_ssi": "Amelia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Carrie Neal Jackson", "Rena Torres Cacoullos", "John Lipski", "Karen Lynn Miller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paola Eulalia Dussias, Dissertation Advisor", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Committee Chair", "Carrie Neal Jackson, Committee Member", "Rena Torres Cacoullos, Committee Member", "John Lipski, Committee Member", "Karen Lynn Miller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sentence processing", "bilingualism", "corpus linguistics", "verb bias", "psycholinguistics", "Spanish"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MANAGING WATER RESOURCES UNDER CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CHANGE:  PERSPECTIVES OF COMMUNITIES IN THE AFRAM PLAINS, GHANA\n", "id": "8449", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3313", "abstract_tesi": "Climate variability and change alter the amount and timing of water resources available for rural communities in the Afram Plains district, Ghana.

Participatory scenario building is one envisioning tool that brings together facilitators and participants to merge local experiential knowledge with exogenous knowledge to explore uncertainty. Yet, in practice, we do not sufficiently understand scenario building as a tool for climate change adaptation. This dissertation assesses a participatory scenario building activity for climate change adaptation with rural communities in Ghana. Using participatory observation, textual analysis, and interviews, this assessment tracks the scenario building activity from the development of the method by American and Ghanaian researchers and Ghanaian non-governmental organization facilitators through the implementation of a series of iterative activities in four communities. I organize my analysis using three concepts from scholarship on participatory action research: space, learning, and resources. First, I identify the material and discursive characteristics of spaces in the case study scenario building activity to understand the processes of learning and envisioning. I use the notion of space to explore the characteristics and processes that enable learning and envisioning in the spaces of the case study activity. Second, I describe the cycles of action and reflection that constitute learning during the development and implementation of the scenario building activity. I document the iterative, multi-level learning across the groups of actors involved in the activity and identify what enables learning for climate change adaptation when applying a scenario building approach.

This dissertation provides an answer to this important question by examining the causal relationship between donor decision-making and outcomes. While the conventional study of\naid e\u000bffectiveness focuses on what happens to the aid in the recipient country, this study focuses on the role of donor governments. At the heart of the theory is the decision-calculus of donors whose goal is to maximize aid success in the recipient country. Specifi\fcally, I focus on donor decisions about how to deliver aid, and how\nthese decisions aff\u000bect poverty in the recipient country. Donors use diff\u000berent tactics to deliver their bilateral assistance, including government-to-government and non-state development channels (e.g. NGOs, multilaterals, and private contractors). My central argument posits that donor expectations about the likelihood of aid capture in the recipient country induce systematic donor decisions about the selection of aid delivery mechanisms. What informs donor expectations about aid capture is the quality of recipient institutions. Badly governed institutions signal a high probability of aid capture, leading to low levels of donor \nconfidence. In such environments, outcome-oriented donors will take actions to decrease their aid's sensitivity to aid capture ex ante by insulating the aid from government intervention.\nThey bypass weak and corrupt government structures and channel the aid through alternative channels of development. By integrating the strengths and weaknesses of the recipient country's governance systems into the design of aid delivery mechanisms, donors are more likely to reduce poverty, as measured by infant health. I illustrate donor decision-making through interview evidence gathered from 22 face-to-face discussions with senior officials from major donor governments (U.S., France, United Kingdom, Germany) and their implementing\nagencies. I test my argument using quantitative methods. I fi\fnd that donors systematically condition delivery mechanisms on the quality of recipient governance, all else equal. I also show that the (endogenous) donor bypass decision reduces infant mortality in poorly governed countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5773], "author_name_tesi": "Dietrich, Simone ", "last_name_ssi": "Dietrich", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Simone", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas William Lemke", "Douglas William Lemke", "Christopher Jon Zorn", "Joseph Wright", "Michael Bernhard", "Mark Sebastian Anner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas William Lemke, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas William Lemke, Committee Chair", "Christopher Jon Zorn, Committee Member", "Joseph Wright, Committee Member", "Michael Bernhard, Committee Member", "Mark Sebastian Anner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["foreign aid", "donor decision-making", "poverty", "institutions"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Contact Activation of Blood-Plasma Coagulation\n\n", "id": "8834", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6216", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Initiation of the coagulation cascade ultimately leads to thrombus (clot) formation.  This phenomenon impedes the production of hemocompatible biomaterials.  Adverse reactions at the interface of a biomaterial in contact with the biological system, in this instance blood, start the contact activation mechanism.  Upon initiation, blood-plasma coagulation proceeds through a sequence of zymogen-enzyme conversions; the complexity of this succession can quickly amplify into thrombus formation.  Therefore, future innovation of cardiovascular biomaterials insists on additional information regarding blood-biomaterial interactions.  In-vitro plasma coagulation assays, chromogenic assays and contact activation experiments establish dose-response relationships seeking to relate thrombogenicity to material properties.  This thesis work utilizes these assays in attempt to better understand surface mediated bio-interactions.  FXII is initially an inactive enzyme, also called a zymogen, activated in the contact activation mechanism by contact with a surface.  The subsequent activation of FXIIa and/or FXIIf are two possible outcomes following contact activation.  Results from this thesis proves contact activation yield at hydrophobic surfaces in neat FXII solution was greater than hydrophilic surfaces in neat FXII solution by plasma coagulation assay and by chromogenic assay.  Additionally, this thesis provides evidence that FXIIf has procoagulant activity as well as amidolytic activity that can activate the intrinsic pathway.  Prior research suggests autohydrolysis is a significant reaction in the FXIIa chromogenic assay.  This thesis confirms the same results; however, results reported herein confirm that authohydrolysis is not a significant reaction in the FXIIf chromogenic assay.  Additionally, plasma coagulation assays show that FXIIf is 2.6 times weaker procoagulant than FXIIa on a molar basis.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6207], "author_name_tesi": "Diggs, Tanisha ", "last_name_ssi": "Diggs", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tanisha", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Erwin A Vogler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Erwin A Vogler, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["plasma", "coagulation", "FXII", "FXIIa", "FXIIf", "contact activation", "blood", "hemocompatible biomaterials"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A Hybrid Stochastic Motion Planning Algorithm for Safe and Efficient, Close Proximity, Autonomous Spacecraft Missions", "id": "23602", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10869", "abstract_tesi": "As the International Space Station and Earth orbiting satellites age well past their originally planned operational lifespan, improved monitoring of these spacecraft\u2019s integrity will be critical to the safety of any crew on board and continued functionality.

The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary algorithm is used as a local optimizer which directs search to low cost solutions. Finally, the Hill-Clohessy-Wiltshire equations are used to find dynamically feasible trajectories through the search space.\n\tSimulations are performed for flights around a simple model resembling the International Space Station, with several start and goal points, and several combinations of algorithm parameters.

The hybrid algorithm on average is able to find trajectories which require less propellant and less flight time, however the hybrid algorithm tends to require more computation time. In addition, planned trajectories that do not require impingement prevention require less propellant and shorter flight times. As such, cold gas thrusters may prove to be more appropriate for close proximity spacecraft missions, despite their lower efficiency as compared to their counterparts which utilize more volatile propellants.

These converging influences are currently challenging the central grid model and encouraging customers to consider DG investment.  Historically prospective customers are unwilling to invest without a favorable return on investment (ROI).  At the present time DG implementation is limited to the industrial sector.\n This thesis investigates the operation of a hybrid system (HMG = hybrid microgrid) comprised of combined heat and power (CHP), solar photovoltaic array (PV), and electrical storage on two commercial loads and a 150 unit multi-residential load served by the California utility Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E).

Weeds can reduce alfalfa yield and changes in forage composition from weeds can have significant effects on feed quality.  Although several herbicides are currently labeled for weed control in alfalfa, many have limitations.  Glyphosate-resistant alfalfa permits the use of glyphosate for broad-spectrum weed control.  Four experiments were initiated at two locations in Pennsylvania to address several management questions concerning glyphosate-resistant alfalfa.  For the first objective, the critical period for weed control in alfalfa was quantified.  At high weed density, the critical period began at 0.5 and ended at 7 alfalfa trifoliate, but varied by weed density, location, and year.  For the second objective, glyphosate and other herbicides were evaluated for weed control in glyphosate-resistant alfalfa and their effects on forage yield and quality were determined.  In this study, glyphosate provided similar or better weed control than other herbicides, while yield response depended on weed severity.  Forage quality was highest where weed content was lowest.  Most differences from weed control occurred during the first harvest of the establishment year and dissipated in subsequent harvests and years.  The third objective was to evaluate the potential use of glyphosate in glyphosate-resistant alfalfa mixed with orchardgrass.  Orchardgrass was seeded with alfalfa or delayed 4 or 5 weeks; glyphosate was applied 4 weeks after alfalfa planting.  At first harvest, glyphosate increased alfalfa, reduced weeds, and reduced or did not affect orchardgrass yield.  By the third harvest, orchardgrass in glyphosate treated plots remained higher than in those without glyphosate and similar to simultaneous seeding without glyphosate.  Longer-term results suggest that compositional differences at establishment dissipate during the second year.  The final objective was to evaluate control of glyphosate-resistant alfalfa prior to no-till corn planting.  Glyphosate-resistant and conventional alfalfa responded similarly and were controlled by 2,4-D and dicamba, either alone or in combination.  Control after alfalfa harvest prior to no-till corn with 2,4-D and dicamba was also possible, although higher rates were necessary, especially when alfalfa regrowth was limited.  These results will better inform Pennsylvania farmers about glyphosate-resistant alfalfa and general alfalfa weed management.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [712], "author_name_tesi": "Dillehay, Bryan Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Dillehay", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Bryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Curran", "Marvin H Hall", "David A Mortensen", "Barbara White Pennypacker", "Jeffrey Hyde"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Curran, Committee Chair", "Marvin H Hall, Committee Member", "David A Mortensen, Committee Member", "Barbara White Pennypacker, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Hyde, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["forage", "weed management", "glyphosate-resistant", "alfalfa", "critical period"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SELF-ASSEMBLY AND CONTROLLED ASSEMBLY OF NANOPARTICLES\n", "id": "8288", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3808", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThis thesis describes an exploration of interactions between metal nanoparticles and new techniques for their assembly.  In Chapter 2, the self-assembly of 300-nm diameter Au, Ag and bimetallic Au-Ag nanowires was studied.  Upon deposition onto a glass substrate from suspension in water, the wires self-assembled into densely packed well-ordered arrays.  Electrostatic repulsion between the wires was necessary to prevent their aggregation.  However, van der Waals forces were a major driving force behind the assembly.  This was especially apparent in the assembly of the bimetallic Au-Ag nanowires, which showed a slight non-random preference for orientational ordering. The theoretical simulations of wire assembly at different temperatures strongly indicated that the orientational ordering was driven by the difference in van der Waals attraction between the metals.\n\tChapter 3 describes the temperature-programmed assembly of DNA:Au nanoparticle bioconjugates.  In this work, the temperature of the system was manipulated in order to take advantage of temperature-dependent melting properties of the DNA.  Despite a 24% loss of DNA from the nanoparticle conjugates and a 14% exchange of DNA sequences between the conjugates when heated, significant control over the order in time of the assembly of multiple DNA:Au conjugate types is demonstrated.  This assembly was performed using both sandwich style hybridization systems, in which a half of linking oligonucleotide is hybridized with a DNA sequence on one conjugate type and the other half is hybridized with a sequence on a second conjugate type, as well as with directly complementary hybridization systems.  The conjugate types in the resulting assemblies were characterized both by gel electrophoresis and by monitoring the visible absorbance of the conjugate suspensions upon the addition of oligonucleotides complementary to those on the conjugates.\n\tIn Chapter 4, initial experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility of an on-wire lithography method to fabricate Au nanowires with functionally distinct sides.  Conditions for the selective etching of Ni and Ag were determined.  The addition of two thiolated DNA sequences, as well as the use of two different DNA attachment chemistries, was explored.  Silica-coated Au nanowires with one exposed Au end were synthesized, and Au nanoparticles were electrostatically assembled on the Au end of these wires.\n\tThe Appendix describes the development of three desktop laboratory experiments for an undergraduate transition metal chemistry course.

There are limitations to the practice, and there is a need for more innovative methods to accomplish this task. There is also a lack of innovative equipment to further expand the use of cover crops. Current cover crop equipment allows only for either planting cover crops after harvest or spreading the seeds on the soil surface late in the growing season. The issue with waiting until after the harvest is that it is usually too late to establish a cover crop. The issue with the option of broadcasting is that placement of the seeds on the soil surface is usually inconsistent. Cultivating early in the season and broadcasting seed has been another option, but this is difficult in no-till, high residue fields. Both of these approaches involve a separate trip across the field, increasing the cost of cover crop establishment. \nThe objective of this research was to develop a machine to no-till an interseeded cover crop at the V5-V8 growth stage of corn and apply N fertilizer and a post-emergent directed herbicide at the same time, if desired.

The machine includes an herbicide applicator and fertilizer applicator. This approach has several advantages: multiple trips across the field can be combined, reducing the cost of cover crop seeding; good seed-to-soil contact is achieved with the potential for reducing cover crop seeding rates; and the N and herbicide applications can be directed to maximize efficiency.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10921], "author_name_tesi": "Dillon, Corey ", "last_name_ssi": "Dillon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Corey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agronomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Curran", "Gregory Wayne Roth", "Jayson Kennedy Harper"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Curran, Thesis Advisor", "Gregory Wayne Roth, Thesis Advisor", "Jayson Kennedy Harper, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cover crops", "interseeder", "interseeding", "residual herbicides", "sustainable farming"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Hijacking host metabolism with Lactobacillus\u2014understanding the implications of bile salt hydrolase diversity", "id": "29587", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12690", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     The tremendous bacterial community which inhabits the human gastrointestinal tract is a newly appreciated intermediary for nutrient uptake and processing.  Compositional variations in this bacterial community are associated with obesity, and recent evidence suggests that bacterial modification of bile acids secreted in the small intestine contributes to the regulation of fat storage.  Bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity against the bile acid tauro-beta-muricholic acid (T-\u03b2-MCA) in particular has been suggested as a critical mediator of host bile acid, glucose, and lipid homeostasis via the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) signaling pathway.  Lactobacillus species are key players in this feedback loop, and their history of use as probiotic bacteria for promoting gastrointestinal health in humans makes them ideally suited for applications that exploit the bile acid regulatory feedback mechanism to control metabolism.  BSH activity is widely associated with Lactobacillus species, but BSH substrate specificity for T-\u03b2-MCA had not been characterized in Lactobacillus prior to this work. \n     Here, a strain of L. johnsonii with robust BSH activity against T-\u03b2-MCA in vitro was identified from the mouse gut microbiota.  A screening assay performed on a collection of 14 probiotic strains from nine species of Lactobacillus identified BSH substrate specificity for T-\u03b2-MCA only in two of three L. johnsonii strains.  Genomic analysis of these L. johnsonii strains revealed the presence of three bsh genes which are homologous to bsh genes in the human associated strain L. johnsonii NCC533.  Further analysis revealed broad differences in substrate specificity even among the closely related bsh homologs, and suggests that the phylogeny of these enzymes does not closely correlate with substrate specificity.  Predictive modeling was able to explain the difference in BSH activity for T-\u03b2-MCA in these homologs, and may be a useful tool for identifying additional BSHs from within the gut microbial community with the potential to affect host metabolism.  \n     This research also demonstrated the capability of transgenic BSH active bacteria to alter bile acid composition and affect FXR signaling in monocolonized germ free mice.  However, these changes did not affect weight gain in the host, indicating the need for future research to understand the factors governing FXR mediated metabolic control.  Additionally, studies of Lactobacillus administration to conventional and germ free mice revealed a disconnect between in vitro BSH activity and the ability of a probiotic to affect host bile acid composition.  In particular, colonization of germ free mice with a strain of L. johnsonii did not result in reduced cecal T-\u03b2-MCA concentrations.  Moreover, background BSH activity endogenous to the gut microbiota of conventional mice was found to almost completely reduce intestinal concentrations of T-\u03b2-MCA at baseline, leaving little potential for probiotic intervention.  Follow up studies focusing on how BSH active probiotics affect the total BSH capacity of the gut microbiota are therefore needed.\n     Finally, the biological role of BSHs in Lactobacillus is not entirely clear.  BSH activity has been associated with increased colonization and intestinal persistence in several bacterial species, and is thought to provide some protection against bile acid toxicity.  However, several studies have suggested BSHs comprise part of a global response to bile and acid stress, which may not be entirely consistent among strains.  Isotopic Radio Outlier Analysis\u2122 (IROA) was used to study the metabolic response of several probiotic Lactobacillus strains to bile acid stress.  This approach improves metabolite identification from background noise compared to traditional metabolomics methods.  Comparison of L. acidophilus NCFM, L. plantarum WCFS1, L. johnsonii LB1, and L. johnsonii NCK88 revealed differences in bile acid response among the strains, and suggests a role for amino acid metabolism in L. acidophilus NCFM.  Further optimization of the IROA experimental design may uncover new roles for BSHs in Lactobacillus, and will inform improved probiotic strain selection.\n     Ultimately this research discovered a strain of Lactobacillus autochthonous to the mouse intestine which exhibits clear BSH activity against T-\u03b2-MCA and offers promise for controlling host metabolism as a probiotic.  These findings will guide ongoing efforts to optimize next generation probiotics for weight control in humans and agricultural animals.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11922], "author_name_tesi": "Dimarzio, Michael John", "last_name_ssi": "Dimarzio", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward G Dudley", "Edward G Dudley", "Joshua D Lambert", "Andrew David Patterson", "Robert F Roberts"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward G Dudley, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward G Dudley, Committee Chair", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member", "Andrew David Patterson, Committee Member", "Robert F Roberts, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Lactobacillus", "gut microbiota", "bile salt hydrolase", "obesity", "farnesoid X receptor", "bile acids", "probiotics", "metabolomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Comparison of Semantic Space Models for Neuroimaging with Abstract and Concrete Words", "id": "14458dpd5260", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14458", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Psycholinguists have long noted a distinction between abstract and concrete words, especially in measures of performance thereof in lexical tasks. In addition, neuroscientists discovered differences in the localization of abstract and concrete word processing and in behavioral responses regarding abstract and concrete words from people with brain injury or impairment. Various psycho- and neurolinguistic theories have been put forward to explain these differences, including the Different Representational Frameworks (DRF) hypothesis, which states that abstract words are represented more paradigmatically and concrete words are represented more syntagmatically. Meanwhile, computational models are becoming increasingly attractive in neuroscience; in particular, previous researchers (Mitchell et al., 2008) have investigated the ability of a type of semantic space model to predict neuroimaging data from corpus data. The present study expands the previous research by applying the methods to both abstract and concrete words within different semantic space models in a 2 \u00d7 2 design of word type and model type to test the DRF hypothesis. Additionally, a third model type inspired by latent semantic indexing was developed and included in the analysis. The present study found that 3 out of 3 model types predicted stimuli significantly better than chance with abstract words, and that 2 out of 3 model types predicted stimuli significantly worse than chance with concrete words; however, these prediction accuracies deviated only slightly from chance. Furthermore, analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no significant effect of word type, model type, or interaction between the two. The present thesis discusses possible limitations to the methodology, considerations of deviations from previous research, and suggested trajectories for future study. Improvements to the models are highly desired as semantic space modeling represents a promising avenue of research for improving neuroscientific understanding, language-processing technologies, and speech therapies.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15288], "author_name_tesi": "Dimercurio, Dominick ", "last_name_ssi": "Dimercurio", "first_name_ssi": "Dominick", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chaleece Sandberg", "Ping Li", "Diane Williams"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chaleece Sandberg, Thesis Advisor", "Ping Li, Committee Member", "Diane Williams, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["semantic space models", "semantic processing", "neuroimaging", "concreteness effect", "abstract words", "concrete words", "concreteness", "Different Representational Frameworks hypothesis", "computational modeling", "neurolinguistics", "neuroscience", "psycholinguistics", "predictive models"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Evaluation of a Computable Phenotype for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis", "id": "28913", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12303", "abstract_tesi": "Introduction: The electronic medical record (EMR) is a common source of data for clinical research. However, the quality of EMR-based research depends on the validity of computable phenotypes, defined as computerized queries to an EMR system or clinical data repository to identify individuals with a clinical condition. Computable phenotyping is especially of interest with rare diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Our objective was to evaluate a computable phenotype for the identification of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\nMethods: A computable phenotype was adapted from previously published algorithms, which identified patients in our health system if they had at least one ICD-9 code of 516.3 (idiopathic interstitial pneumonia) or 516.31 (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) in the past three years associated with inpatient or outpatient visits, excluding emergency department and lab encounters.  Patients were excluded if an ICD-9 code for connective tissue disorders was present.\nGold standard diagnosis was determined by chart review by at least two reviewers using a standardized procedure.  In cases of disagreement, charts were reviewed collectively until agreement was reached.  \nResults: The computable phenotype identified 157 individuals with IPF.  After gold standard chart review, 74 patients (47%) were classified as having IPF based on a narrow definition and 89 (57%) were classified as having IPF based on a broad definition.\nConclusion: Our computable phenotype yielded a positive predictive value of 47% using a narrow definition of IPF.  True positives were older (p=0.0003) than false positives.  Studies depending on computable phenotypes for identifying patients with IPF will be limited by false positives.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11683], "author_name_tesi": "Dimmock, Anne Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Dimmock", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Anne", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia H Chuang", "Wenke Hwang", "Herbert Y Reynolds", "Junjia Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia H Chuang, Thesis Advisor", "Wenke Hwang, Thesis Advisor", "Herbert Y Reynolds, Thesis Advisor", "Junjia Zhu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis", "computable phenotype", "electronic health record", "rare disease"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE URBAN EDIBLE SCHOOLYARD: CASE STUDY EVALUATIONS IN PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA\n", "id": "11957", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3617", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Schoolyard vegetable gardens are springing up on school grounds across the nation.  The many benefits cultivated by schoolchildren in edible schoolyards are widely accepted by parents, teachers, and administrators.  The gardens, however, have the potential to reach beyond the classroom and into the community.  Through garden volunteer programs, gardening, workshops, and successful displays of nearby schoolyard gardens, community members can be encouraged to participate in growing and harvesting fresh local produce.\nSome of the many potential benefits to the community include increased food security, healthier diets, greater physical activity, more convivial community interactions, enhanced neighborhood beautification, and the sense of individual and collective pride that comes with these achievements.  The location and physical design of the garden plays an important role in how well it relates to the community and the extent of its use.  While there are several universal principles to designing these outdoor classrooms, different localities bring different challenges, even within the same school district.  Understanding the site and the neighborhood context informs the garden design to maximize the benefits to both the students and the community.\nThis case study research examines four edible schoolyards sponsored by the non-profit group Grow Pittsburgh in the Pittsburgh Public Schools district.  Each school represents a distinct neighborhood demographic within the urban environment.  Site inventories and analyses are made to understand the context and makeup of the gardens.  Key informant interviews with a representative from Grow Pittsburgh, teachers, parents and custodians give further insight into the successes and challenges from an insider\u2019s view of issues pertaining to the physical design of the gardens.  A literature review aids in establishing a broader understanding of schoolyard gardening and neighborhood participation.  \nThis study is ultimately designed to reveal the extent to which schoolyard gardens and surrounding communities interact.  It is also intended to assist in the understanding and articulation of design and management principles that could be applied to these specific gardens and others with similar contexts.  Finally, this research provides a protocol to approaching and understanding opportunities in other existing or proposed schoolyard gardens to more fully relate to the community and fulfill their full potential.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3597], "author_name_tesi": "Dimond, Kirk W", "last_name_ssi": "Dimond", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Kirk", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Landscape Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Tamminga", "Kenneth Tamminga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Tamminga, Thesis Advisor", "Kenneth Tamminga, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["community involvement", "environments for children", "Pittsburgh schools", "urban agriculture", "schoolyard gardens", "Edible schoolyards", "catalytic landscape design"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "TEACHERS\u2019 AND STUDENTS\u2019 PERCEPTION OF WORK ETHICS: \nA LOOK AT PENNSYLVANIA\u2019S COMMUNITY COLLEGES\n\n\n", "id": "10501", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3956", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The volume of literature for research on work ethics is extensive but most involves workers on the job or looking for employment (Petty & Hill, 2005).  A gap in the literature exists for research of work ethics among students and instructors involved in Career and Technical Education.  Using the Employability Skills Assessment (ESA) authored by Roger Hill (whose work ethics research is extensive) this study of students and instructors from Pennsylvania community colleges was completed to determine if the self-perceived work ethics of students and their instructors was different.  This study further investigated the relationship of demographic data (gender, age, race, marital status, veteran status, GPA, years of teaching experience, and number of semesters enrolled) to the work ethic of Pennsylvania community college students and their instructors.  The following is a summation of the research findings derived from the research questions prepared for this study.\nSeveral significant relationships were found among the variables of this study however in contrast to the research question; to what extent is there a significant difference in the occupational work ethics of career and technical students enrolled in two year programs in the Community Colleges of Pennsylvania and their instructors? Data analysis indicated there was no significant difference between the self-reported work ethic of community college students and instructors from Pennsylvania community colleges.  Data analysis through multiple regression however produced statistical evidence that the second research question; to what extent is there a statistically significant relationship between the work ethic of community college students based on the demographic data collected; gender, age, race, GPA, program area, veteran status, marital status, semesters enrolled? Indicated no significant relationship existed between demographic characters and the self-reported work ethics for students.  Gender however was shown to be marginally significant with females indicating a slightly higher initiative than males.  Multiple regression analysis also produced statistical evidence that research question three; to what extent is there a statistically significant relationship between the work ethics of community college instructors based on the demographic data collected; gender, age, race, program area, veteran status, marital status, and years of teaching? was supported showing a significant difference for the self-reported work ethic of instructors for the following demographic characters; program area of hospitality and health sciences  reported scores that were significantly higher than other program areas for the subscale dependability, initiative and interpersonal skills scores were significant for gender with females instructors reporting higher scores, the subscales dependability and initiative  were found to be significantly higher for married instructors.  \nThe overall model showed differences in interpersonal skills to be insignificant while differences in dependability and initiative were found to be significant.  Therefore when using this model dependability and initiative are predictable among instructors.\nThe self-reported higher scores by female participants are consistent with the literature and post-hoc analysis through a one-way analysis of variance for gender showed significantly higher scores were reported between groups by all female respondents (students and instructors) compared to male respondents.   \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3929], "author_name_tesi": "Dincher, Michael Anthony", "last_name_ssi": "Dincher", "middle_name_ssi": "Anthony", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edgar I Farmer Sr.", "Edgar I Farmer Sr.", "Kenneth Carter Gray", "Judith Ann Kolb", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edgar I Farmer Sr., Dissertation Advisor", "Edgar I Farmer Sr., Committee Chair", "Kenneth Carter Gray, Committee Member", "Judith Ann Kolb, Committee Chair", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Occupational work ethic inventory", "work", "work ethic", "hidden curriculum"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Designing a Mobile Application for Evaluating Manufacturability of Parts Using Additive Manufacturing", "id": "14468sjd5520", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14468", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Additive Manufacturing has seen a rapid growth in the last few years, with industries considering it as a viable manufacturing process that is redefining product design and supply chain. The recent increase in public awareness and interest in additive manufacturing has been a great boost for material extrusion systems for 3D printing, with such systems becoming readily affordable and easy to use, promoting hands-on experience with polymer printing. Material extrusion has progressed from being a novel process with expensive machinery to a cheap, easy and relatively fast method for 3D printing. This has helped it transition from a cumbersome process to one for teaching additive manufacturing and prototyping at very low costs and lead times. However, the ease of material extrusion may also cause it to become the go-to manufacturing process for the user in every case. This necessitates the user to be aware that material extrusion may not be the ideal process in every case, and more importantly understand how one can make the selection of the appropriate additive manufacturing process.\nThis thesis focuses on the design and implementation of software algorithms and a mobile application to help users evaluate the feasibility of fabricating parts using material extrusion. The algorithm uses novel voxel-based manufacturability analyses, which takes the desired STL file as input and generates a voxelized model with supports. Using the voxelized model and specified machine parameters, the software estimates build time, weight of material required for the part and supports, and the cost of 3D printing the part, allowing users to make an informed decision on process selection. Additionally, the visuals generated by the algorithm also allow the user to determine the appropriate build\niv\norientation. Experimental benchmarking was performed on the algorithm, where after careful selection of experimental parts to be printed, the algorithm\u2019s predictions are compared to experimental results for validation. The final version of the algorithm and code serves as the backbone for a mobile application, built with an easy to use interface for rapid visual evaluation of parts in terms of orientation, build time, and cost of printing. Ongoing and future work along with potential uses are also discussed, with the final goal of making the application ready to be downloaded and utilized by any user.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15377], "author_name_tesi": "Dinda, Shantanab ", "last_name_ssi": "Dinda", "first_name_ssi": "Shantanab", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson", "Nicholas Alexander Meisel", "Janis P Terpenny"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson, Thesis Advisor", "Nicholas Alexander Meisel, Committee Member", "Janis P Terpenny, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["3D printing", "Additive Manufacturing", "Mobile Application", "Manufacturability Analysis", "Voxel-based Models", "Voxelization", "Build Time Estimation", "Cost Estimation"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PREDICTORS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES OF MEDICATION NON-ADHERENCE ACROSS MULTIPLE THERAPEUTIC CLASSES AMONG ELDERLY\n\n", "id": "11450", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3266", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Elderly are at high risk of medication non-adherence due to the likelihood of multiple chronic conditions for which medications are available and prescribed. Nearly all prior studies focused on examination adherence of a single therapeutic class. To gain a better understanding of the extent of medication non-adherence and it\u2019s sequelae in elderly populations, it is important to evaluate adherence in natural settings which can reflect the situation in the real world. \nThe main purposes of the studies were to 1) describe the status of medication use and the prevalence of medication adherence/non-adherence of multiple widely used chronic therapeutic classes; 2) evaluate the association between predictors and medication adherence across multiple therapeutic classes; and 3) evaluate the relationship between medication adherence and health outcomes in a multiple therapeutic class setting in an elderly population. Two studies were conducted to fulfill the study objectives. In the first study, medication use status, medication adherence and medication taking pattern of 15 popular chronic therapeutic classes were described; and the effects of potential predictors on medication non-adherence across multiple therapeutic classes were assessed. In the second study, a cross-sectional study and a cohort study were conducted respectively to investigate the effects of medication non-adherence on hospitalization and mortality in a multiple therapeutic class setting. \nResults of study 1 showed that the adherence rates for the 15 therapeutic classes ranged from 68% to 88% and the persistence rates ranged from 75% to 95%. The adherence rates for users of thyroid agents, calcium-channel blockers, and ARB/ACE medications were higher than those for other therapeutic classes. The adherence rates for users of oral antidiabetic drugs and other cardiovascular drugs fell in a second tier, followed by statins, Alzheimer\u2019s treatments, antidepressants, and proton pump inhibitors. The adherence rates were the lowest for osteoporosis medications, overactive bladder medications, and diuretics. African Americans were most likely to be non-adherent; the longer an older adult uses a medication, the more adherent the person is; females and married persons generally had a higher persistence rate. Results of study 2 suggested that lower adherence levels (measured by proportion of days covered, PDC) were positively associated with hospitalization and hospitalization days for persistent users. There was significant relationship between non-persistence and all-cause mortality for ARB/ACE medications, &#946;-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, overactive bladder drugs and thyroid agents. The results also indicated a significant relationship between low PDC levels and mortality for &#946;-blockers and cardiac glycosides. This study identified several predictors for general medication non-adherence and demonstrated independent effects of medication non-adherence for each therapeutic class on health outcomes. These findings can help design interventions to improve medication adherence in elderly population.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3253], "author_name_tesi": "Ding, Jian ", "last_name_ssi": "Ding", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Frank Martin Ahern", "Frank Martin Ahern", "Debra Ann Heller", "Jan Ulbrecht", "Linda Ann Wray", "William L Harkness"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Frank Martin Ahern, Dissertation Advisor", "Frank Martin Ahern, Committee Chair", "Debra Ann Heller, Committee Member", "Jan Ulbrecht, Committee Member", "Linda Ann Wray, Committee Member", "William L Harkness, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Health outcomes", "Predictors", "Medication adherence", "Multiple therapeutic classes", "Elderly", "Claims data"]}]
