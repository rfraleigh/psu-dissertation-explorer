The limitation has been primarily due to paucity of experimental data. This investigation aimed at providing benchmark data for studying the cyclic response of concrete beams reinforced with steel bars having nominal yield strengths of 97 ksi.\nSeven beams were subjected to large transverse displacement reversals: three beams were reinforced longitudinally with conventional steel bars (Grade 60) and four with ultrahigh strength steel bars (Grade 97). All transverse reinforcement was Grade 60. Other experimental variables were spacing of transverse reinforcement (d/4 or d/2), volume fraction of steel-hooked fibers (0 or 1.5%), and ratio of compression-to-tension longitudinal reinforcement (&#961;\u2019/&#961; = 0.5 or 1.0).\nThe beams reinforced with ultrahigh strength steel bars had drift ratio capacities in excess of 10%, comparable to the deformation capacities of similar beams reinforced with conventional steel bars. Numerical models were developed for the calculation of the moment-curvature relationship and the load-displacement response of the tested beams. The calculated values show good correlation with the measured data.\nFor beams with nearly identical strength, the measured yield displacement of beams reinforced with Grade 97 bars was about 25% greater than in beams reinforced with Grade 60 bars, which led to a reduction of the area inside the load-deformation hysteresis loops. However, nonlinear seismic analyses of single-degree-of-freedom systems indicate that the displacement calculated for systems representing the beams with Grade 97 bars are, on average, less than 10% larger than the displacement calculated for systems representing the beams with Grade 60 bars. \nThe evidence presented suggests that ultrahigh strength steel bars (Grade 97) are a viable option for the longitudinal reinforcement of beams in earthquake-resistant structures.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2398], "author_name_tesi": "Tavallali, Hooman ", "last_name_ssi": "Tavallali", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hooman", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Andres Lepage", "Andres Lepage", "Ali M Memari", "M Kevin Parfitt", "Maria Lopez De Murphy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Andres Lepage, Dissertation Advisor", "Andres Lepage, Committee Chair", "Ali M Memari, Committee Member", "M Kevin Parfitt, Committee Member", "Maria Lopez De Murphy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Concrete", "Structures", "Ultrahigh Strength Steel", "Cyclic Response", "Fiber Reinforced Concrete", "Deformation Capacity"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Non-Destructive Characterization of Asphalt Concrete Mixtures through Resonant Column Testing", "id": "dz010q056", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13143", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Asphalt concrete is a multiphase viscoelastic composite material; hence its mechanical properties change with frequency of the applied loads and the temperature. In many of the design tools such as the Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG), changes in dynamic modulus as a function of the loading frequency is the primary input. There are very limited testing devices that can directly measure the shear modulus of asphalt concrete. Most of the available devices for asphalt concrete testing are limited to a maximum loading frequency of 33 Hz. However, devices that are capable of exerting loads at higher frequencies are generally limited with respect to the maximum attainable strains. Treating an asphaltic mix as a thermo-rheologically simple material makes it possible to extrapolate its viscoelastic behavior from the low frequency to the high frequency ends through a modulus master-curve. However, such extrapolations are not always accurate and can result in significant errors in pavement design and performance prediction. In this dissertation, a conventional soils testing Resonant Column (RC) apparatus is retrofitted to test stiffer materials such as asphalt concrete at a range of temperatures and strains. Through the proposed RC test, the frequency dependent modulus of asphalt concrete at frequencies considerably higher than those attainable by the available devices, i.e. up to 300 Hz, and at strain levels comparable to the conventional modulus tests (about 100 microstrains) were measured. A set of dynamic modulus (DM) tests were performed on both the full-size and the proposed small-size specimens. It was confirmed that the small specimens exhibit the same properties as the full-size specimens. Non-destructiveness of the RC testing of asphalt concrete was also confirmed by investigating the repeatability of RC tests at each temperature, the reproducibility of the same results after one complete set of temperature-frequency sweep tests, and the modulus changes from Impact Resonance (IR) tests. Thus, the same specimen can be used for conducting multiple tests at different temperatures. \nFinally, RC technique was successfully used to characterize a wide range of asphalt concrete technologies including: conventional Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA), Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA), high Reclaimed Asphalt Pavements (RAP) content, and high Recycled Asphalt Shingles (RAS) mixes. Results indicate that the conventional modulus master curve underpredicts the actual modulus at higher frequencies. Therefore, the proposed power-form modulus-frequency functions are recommended in this dissertation to be used along with a variable Poisson\u2019s ratio to achieve a better prediction, when an indirect calculation of shear modulus of asphalt concrete is needed. It was concluded that RC test can non-destructively characterize different asphalt concrete technologies at a wide range of temperatures.

Residents were forcibly removed from the area for decades by colonial and apartheid-era governments.  After being declared a Nature Reserve in 1978, locals were fenced out, losing all access to natural resources.  Although the communities won a land-claim battle in 2001, the current management of the reserve still reflects a \u201cfortress conservation\u201d model, where local people are prohibited from harvesting natural resources, including indigenous vegetables. Remarkably, the knowledge associated with these foods endures, primarily through the stories, actions, and resistance of local women.  \n\nUsing a feminist political ecology framework to illustrate the gendered power dynamics that mediate the knowledge, valuation, and use of indigenous vegetables, (known locally as imifino), this study describes how women\u2019s everyday practices, traditions, and resistance strategies are being deployed to promote indigenous vegetable (imifino) consumption from both the protected area site as well as in homestead gardens. Analyzing how these local struggles are connected to the wider political discourse on biodiversity conservation sheds light on how formal management rules and regulations interplay with, and are negotiated on a daily basis by protected area community members. Results of the study indicate that a co-management structure that takes women\u2019s knowledge into account could encourage the sustainable use of these resources and consequently, help maintain the indigenous knowledge associated with indigenous vegetables (imifino). \n\nA mixed methods approach was taken to gather a holistic picture of the knowledge and practices surrounding these indigenous vegetables. A  variety of qualitative and visual methods including participant observation, key informant interviews, facilitated group discussions, free-listing of species, forest walks, community history mapping, and participatory photography were chosen to gain in-depth understanding of indigenous knowledge, community challenges, and everyday strategies of adaptation and resistance to current reserve management. A household survey of 80 homesteads in Southern Hobeni Village was used to provide information on the different varieties of imifino grown in homestead gardens (igadi) as well as intra-household data on the gendered labor dynamics for cultivating these varieties. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13683], "author_name_tesi": "Tavenner, Kathleen Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Tavenner", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr. Carolyn Sachs", "Dr. Carolyn Sachs", "Dr. Ann Tickamyer", "Dr. A.E.

The first \nconcerns the semiclassical limit in loop quantum cosmology\nvia the use of so-called effective equations.  In loop quantum cosmology the quantum dynamics is well understood.  We can approximate\nthe full quantum dynamics in the infinite dimensional Hilbert space by projecting it \non a finite dimensional submanifold thereof, spanned by suitably chosen semiclassical \nstates.  This submanifold is isomorphic with the classical phase space and the \nprojected dynamical flow provides effective equations incorporating the leading \nquantum corrections to the classical equations of motion.  \nNumerical work has been done in the full theory using quantum states which are semiclassical at late times.\nThese states follow the classical trajectory until the density is on the order of 1\\% of the\nPlanck density then deviate strongly from the classical trajectory.  The effective\nequations we obtain reproduce this behavior to surprising accuracy.\n\nThe second issue concerns generalizations of the classical action which is the starting point for\nloop quantum gravity.  In loop quantum gravity one begins with the Einstein-Hilbert action, \nmodified by the addition of the so-called Holst term. Classically, this term does not \naffect the equations of motion, but it leads to a well-known quantization ambiguity in \nthe quantum theory parametrized by the Barbero--Immirzi parameter, which rescales the eigenvalues of the area and volume operators. We consider\nthe theory obtained by promoting the Barbero--Immirzi parameter to a field. The resulting theory, \ncalled Modified Holst Gravity,is equivalent to General Relativity coupled to a \npseudo-scalar field. However, this theory turns out to have an unconventional kinetic \nterm for the Barbero-Immirzi field and a rather unnatural coupling with fermions. We then propose \na further generalization of the Holst action, which we call Modified Nieh--Yan Gravity, which \nyields a theory of gravity and matter with a more natural \ncoupling to the Barbero--Immirzi field.  We conclude by commenting on possible implications \nfor cosmology, induced by the existence of this new pseudo-scalar field. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6416], "author_name_tesi": "Taveras, Victor Manuel", "last_name_ssi": "Taveras", "middle_name_ssi": "Manuel", "first_name_ssi": "Victor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Abhay Vasant Ashtekar", "Abhay Vasant Ashtekar", "Martin Bojowald", "Lee S Finn", "Nigel David Higson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Abhay Vasant Ashtekar, Dissertation Advisor", "Abhay Vasant Ashtekar, Committee Chair", "Martin Bojowald, Committee Member", "Lee S Finn, Committee Member", "Nigel David Higson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Holst action", "loop quantum cosmology", "cosmology"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Techno-economic Assessment of Industrial Co2 Storage in Depleted Shale Gas Reservoirs", "id": "23551", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10498", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research suggests two categories of carbon management methods to help control and reduce net CO2 emissions: increasing the efficiency of energy processes to reduce CO2 production and utilizing processes after CO2 production to reduce the amount of emission.\nSecond chapter analyzes the use of remotely controllable household water heaters as a technique that can reduce the variability cost of wind power in the system. Produced wind power is variable and integrating large scale wind power with power system needs backup facility to keep the system reliable. Thus, variability of wind power imposes cost on the system which is called variability cost. Using a computational model, this research simulates a system of three elements: wind farm, household water heaters and grid (as power system) and suggests that using controllable water heaters as demand side management policy can help reducing variability cost of entire system. This chapter analyzes and compares three scenarios to show the effect of distributed thermal storage on variability of wind power. Third chapter develops a techno-economic model for assessment of industrial CO2 storage in Shale gas reservoirs. CO2 storage in underground deep formations can be a long-term efficient way for carbon management. In this method, CO2 needs to be captured from emitter (industrial plant), pressurized, transported with pipeline and then injected to the reservoir. CO2 sequestration for Enhanced Gas Recovery is technically feasible but its economic feasibility depends on many factors. This research has developed a techno-economic model, integrated with a reservoir simulation tool (SRM), to analyze costs associated with CO2 sequestration in Shale gas. Cost structure in techno-economic model has four parts (modules): Transportation, Injection, Production, and Post-Injection Site Care. Each module generates individual results and also contributes with other modules in producing overall results. Various scenarios defined and tested with the model to give a better understanding about sensitivity and importance of input parameters.\nFourth chapter utilizes the upgraded version of techno-economic model to run stochastic, uncertainty, and sensitivity analysis. This chapter also studies the production and injection timing under uncertainty to find more efficient results. In addition to results in third chapter, subsurface and economic parameters have substantial impact on costs and revenue. Reservoir properties along with well characteristics determine CH4 production, CO2 injection, storage capacity, possible CO2 breakthrough in production and so on.

We hypothesize that this spatial distribution of lung injury mirrors an analogous distribution of O<sub>3</sub> dose delivered to different tissue sites in the respiratory tract. The purposes of this study were: 1) to predict the local uptake of O<sub>3</sub> using three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD); and 2) to investigate the effects of flow rate, airway structure and chemical reaction in the respiratory tract lining fluid (RTLF) on O<sub>3</sub> uptake.  These objectives were achieved by using the commercial CFD package FLUENT (ANSYS Inc., Lebanon, NH) to numerically solve the three-dimensional continuity, Navier-Stokes, and convection-diffusion equations in single idealized airway bifurcations as well as an anatomically accurate airway geometry. \n<p>To investigate the effect of flow rate on O<sub>3</sub> uptake, steady inspiratory and expiratory flow simulations in an idealized symmetric bifurcation with a branching angle of 90\u00b0 were performed at Reynolds numbers based on the parent branch radius (Re) ranging from 100 to 500.  The reaction of O<sub>3</sub> in the RTLF was assumed to be so rapid that O<sub>3</sub> concentration was negligible along the entire surface of the bifurcation wall.  The total rate of O<sub>3</sub> uptake was found to increase with increasing flow rate during both inspiration and expiration.  Hot spots of O<sub>3</sub> flux appeared at the carina of the bifurcation for virtually all inspiratory and expiratory Re considered in the simulations.  At the lowest expiratory Re, however, the location of the maximum flux was shifted to the outer wall of the daughter branch.  For expiratory flow, additional hot spots of flux were found on the parent branch wall just downstream of the branching region. \n<p>To investigate the effects of airway structure, steady inspiratory and expiratory flow simulations were conducted in single idealized airway bifurcations at Re = 300, also assuming an infinitely fast reaction in the RTLF.    The effect of branching angle was studied in three idealized symmetric single airway bifurcations with branching angles of 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and 135\u00b0.  The average dimensionless flux < N > (dimensionless uptake rate normalized by dimensionless surface area) increased with increasing branching angle during both inspiratory and expiratory flows.  The effect of the mode of branching was studied by comparing simulations in an idealized symmetric 90\u00b0 bifurcation to those conducted in an idealized monopodial 90\u00b0 bifurcation.  The overall < N > in the symmetric 90\u00b0 bifurcation was higher than in the monopodial bifurcation during inspiratory and expiratory flow.    During inspiratory flow, the minor daughter branch of the monopodial bifurcation had the highest < N >  of all the regions in both geometries.\n<p>Before incorporating a finite RTLF reaction into the CFD model, two RTLF reaction models were compared, both modeling the interaction between O<sub>3</sub> and endogenous substrates in the RTLF as quasi-steady lateral diffusion with homogeneous chemical reaction.  The first reaction model assumed a reaction rate that was pseudo-first order with respect to of O<sub>3</sub> concentration, while the second assumed a reaction rate that was first order with respect to both the O<sub>3</sub> 3 and substrate concentrations and second order overall.  The of O<sub>3</sub> concentration profiles within the RTLF as well as the flux of of O<sub>3</sub> into the RTLF and tissue were virtually identical in the two models.  Because of its greater simplicity, the pseudo-first order reaction model was selected for incorporation into the CFD simulations investigating the effects of RTLF reaction-diffusion parameters on O<sub>3</sub>  uptake distribution.\n<p>To study the effect of RTLF thickness on O<sub>3</sub> uptake into the RTLF and underlying tissue, the pseudo-first order reaction rate constant was characterized by defining a dimensionless Damkohler number, based on the parent  branch radius (Da<sub>R</sub>).  Steady inspiratory flow simulations at Re=300 were carried out at Da<sub>R</sub> = 1.7x10<sup>7</sup>  and Da<sub>R</sub> = 1.7x10<sup>10</sup>  on idealized symmetric 90\u00b0 bifurcations with RTLF thicknesses ranging from 0.014% to 0.282% of the parent branch radius.  The rate of uptake in the RTLF was generally insensitive to the thickness of the RTLF layer, except at the lower Da<sub>R</sub>  at which the RTLF uptake rate increased markedly as the ELF thickness was reduced below about 0.07% of the airway radius.  At the lower Da<sub>R</sub>, the tissue uptake rates were more sensitive to RTLF thickness than were the RTLF uptake rates, but at the higher Da<sub>R</sub>, no O<sub>3</sub> reached the tissue, regardless of RTLF thickness.\nThe effect of the reaction rate constant, characterized by the Damkohler number based on the RTLF thickness (Da), was investigated by simulating flow and O<sub>3</sub> uptake in the idealized 90\u00b0 symmetric and 90\u00b0 monopodial bifurcations at Re of 10, 100, and also at Re = 1000 in the symmetric bifurcation, for Da  ranging from 1 to 10<sub>6</sub>.  An increase in   led to an increased rate of O<sub>3</sub> uptake into the RTLF but a reduced uptake rate in the underlying tissue. The sensitivity of both uptake rates to flow rate became more pronounced as the reaction rate constant was increased.\n<p>In the final study, two steady inspiratory flow simulations at Re = 152  in an anatomically accurate geometry representative of the first three generations of the airways of a rhesus monkey beginning at the trachea was constructed.  Steady inspiratory flow simulations were conducted, one assuming an instantaneous reaction at the bifurcation walls and the other assuming a pseudo first order RTLF reaction at an intermediate Da of 1000.  In both simulations, hot spots of flux were located at all three carinas of the geometry, similar to what was found in the idealized single airway bifurcations.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [34, 35, 36], "author_name_tesi": "Taylor, Adekemi Bisola", "last_name_ssi": "Taylor", "middle_name_ssi": "Bisola", "first_name_ssi": "Adekemi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James S Ultman", "Ali Borhan", "Abdellaziz Ben Jebria", "John Michael Cimbala"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James S Ultman, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Chair", "Abdellaziz Ben Jebria, Committee Member", "John Michael Cimbala, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["airway bifurcation", "computational fluid dynamics", "mass transport", "lower respiratory tract", "dosimetry modeling", "ozone"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivators that Attract and Retain Part-time Online Teaching Faculty at Penn State", "id": "13781atb3", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13781", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the attraction of a given type of adjunct faculty to teach online via Penn State World Campus and extrinsic and intrinsic motivators, as well as the relationship between a given type of adjunct faculty\u2019s decision to continue teaching online via Penn State World Campus and extrinsic and intrinsic motivators.

ARFs induce robust scattering and migration when expressed in epithelia cells.   Recent evidence suggests that cytohesins are required for HGF induced epithelial cell migration by acting upstream of ARF6 GTPase. These cytohesins promote spreading and migration by activating ARF6 following recruitment to membrane surfaces.  In addition, cytohesin-2/ARNO and cytohesin-3/Grp1 can undergo alternative splicing of a single three-nucleotide exon in their PH domain, resulting in isoforms that contain either a diglycine (2G) or triglycine (3G) motif in the mature proteins. We have determined that the number of glycine residues in the PH domain is the sole determinant of cytohesins effect on cell migration. Expression of the 3G isoforms led to robust scattering, migration, and increased adhesion whereas the 2G isoforms did not. We hypothesized that the 3G isoforms of cytohesin-2/ARNO and cytohesin-3/Grp1 are up regulated following activation of the c-MET receptor by active HGF in MDCK cells.  We found that cytohesin-3/Grp1 transcriptional expression is significantly up-regulated following treatment with HGF while cytohesin-2/ARNO is not.  Moreover, High Resolution Melting Analysis suggested that the 3G isoforms of cytohesin-3/Grp1 is significantly up regulated while the 2G isoforms is not.

These data supports our previous evidence that the number of glycine residues in the PH domain is important in their effects on cell migration.

This study examines strategies principals use to manage their time so as to maintain a focus on instruction when time is in short supply, priorities compete, and there are multiple expectations. Specifically, the researcher was interested in discovering how principals maintain a focus on instruction while mediating multiple expectations. A review of three categories of representative literature was made: the principal\u2019s evolving role in instruction, conceptions of time, and the instructional leader acting in the best interest of learning and the learner.\n\nPrior to the carrying out of the research, a conceptual framework was designed based on the literature review. The framework was amended after the research was conducted. The initial conceptual framework portrayed time in a linear fashion and intersecting with perceptions of instructional leadership, which were impacted by three influences: personal, school and community, and policy and mandates. The revised conceptual framework portrays time moving in a linear fashion and intersecting with principals\u2019 perceptions of and role as instructional leader, which were impacted by four factors: personal attributes, professional influences, human interactions, and instructional context.\n\nQualitative data collection methods allowed for rich and in-depth illustration of principals\u2019 perceptions about time usage in support of instructional leadership. Semistructured, open-ended interviews were conducted to encourage participants to share their own stories, ideas, and observations; the interviews provided rich, descriptive examples of respondents\u2019 perspectives. Data were collected from 22 principals working in public elementary schools across Pennsylvania.\n\nThe first research question investigated the ways Pennsylvania elementary public school principals think about and speak of time. Time in the principalship is spent in meetings, discussions with teachers, dealing with students with special needs, observations, students\u2019 arrival and dismissal, and announcements as well as on budget areas, discipline issues, environment checks, classroom visits, paperwork, parent organizations, assessment results, unexpected situations, and e-mail. Principals\u2019 view of time has changed based on experience as a principal, change in position, No Child Left Behind legislation, and not having enough time. Principals defined time by using metaphors, a clock, and body time perspective, as well as in geometric terms. The second research question looked at strategies principals employed to manage their time. Principals managed their time by using a calendar or scheduled events, prioritization, their secretary, extra hours put in, technology, lists and notes, color coding, paperwork management, delegation of responsibilities, and literature. The third research question looked at what principals considered the most important and least important uses of their time. The most important uses of time involved people, curriculum and instruction, and having a presence in the school. The least important uses of time involved dealing with parents, paperwork, meetings, and e-mail.\n\nThe fourth research question looked at how principals define instructional leadership and how the context of accountability changed the definition. Principals defined instructional leadership based on the learner, learning, and professional development. Based on literature and feedback from participants in research study, a definition of instructional leadership was developed. An instructional leader serves the best interests of the learner and learning, of professional development, and of instructional decision making. Serving the best interest of the learner, an instructional leader focuses on teaching and learning, involved in curriculum development that promotes an instructional program conducive to successful learning by all students. Serving the best interest of learning, an instructional leader considers learning a central role of schooling; encourages instruction to follow academic standards; promotes instructional technology, teaching skills, differentiated instruction, and inclusionary practices; does scheduling to provide maximum time for learning; locates resources to support learning; observes teachers to ensure that curricula are being implemented; and provides feedback for improvement of instruction. Serving the best interest of professional development, an instructional leader creates a school culture of continuous learning for all adults (self, faculty and staff, parents) that is tied to student learning and other school goals. This adult learning culture emphasizes study of teaching and learning, collaboration and coaching relationships, program redesign, and action research. Serving the best interest of instructional decision making, an instructional leader uses multiple sources of data as diagnostic tools to assess, identify, and apply instructional improvement.\n\nThe fifth and sixth research questions looked at the extent to which and the ways principals perceived the availability or absence of time as having an impact on their professional practices as an instructional leader and the contextual forces and influences facilitating or hindering their use of time specific to instruction, student learning, and achievement. Half of the principals were impacted by the absence of time, but the other half of the principals\u2019 role as instructional leader was not impacted by the availability or absence of time. Forces hindering time usage included meetings and people. However, principals who were not impacted by the availability or absence of time felt they controlled their own time and that instructional leadership was important. When discussing time for curriculum, principals mentioned being knowledgeable about the reading, writing, and mathematics curricula and having information, being aware of concerns, supporting teaching, and making decisions. When discussing time specific to student achievement, principals discussed results of the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment (PSSA), improving student outcomes on the PSSA, and pressures, tensions, and stress.\n\nFindings from this study show there are specific implications for practice and future research within the areas of time, instructional leadership, and leadership. Related to time, future research might examine how ethnicity or geographic location affects an individual\u2019s definition and use of time. Related to instructional leadership, future research needs to confirm the instructional leadership definition developed through review of the literature and research. The study provides practitioners with a list of 10 areas of advice for new principals and 10 time management strategies for practicing administrators.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [974], "author_name_tesi": "Taylor, Catherine Freiday", "last_name_ssi": "Taylor", "middle_name_ssi": "Freiday", "first_name_ssi": "Catherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul T Begley, Professor Of Education", "Susan C Faircloth", "James F Nolan Jr.", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul T Begley, Professor Of Education, Committee Chair", "Susan C Faircloth, Committee Member", "James F Nolan Jr., Committee Member", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Pennsylvania", "No Child Left Behind legislation", "New principals", "Leadership in education", "Instructional leadership", "Instruction", "Expectations", "Email", "Elementary schools", "Elementary principal", "Education", "Decision making", "Curriculum and instruction", "Conceptions of time", "Best interests", "Availability or absence of time", "Assessment results", "Administration of schools", "Achievement", "Accountability in education", "Pennsylvania System of School Assessment", "Principal", "Priorities", "Qualitative research", "Rural schools", "Students", "Student learning", "Suburban schools", "Technology", "Time", "Time management", "Teachers", "Theories and principles", "Urban schools"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE DEVELOPMENT OF A THREE-DIMENSIONAL\nNUCLEAR REACTOR KINETICS METHODOLOGY\nBASED ON THE METHOD OF CHARACTERISTICS\n\n\n", "id": "8054", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2576", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The topic of this work is to develop the theoretical and practical foundations for a time-dependent method of characteristics, for use as an alternative to diffusion theory in a three-dimensional nuclear reactor kinetics computation.  As a time-dependent method of characteristics has not been previously attempted, the goal is to demonstrate \u2013 affirmatively or negatively \u2013 the feasibility of such an approach and identify topics for future investigation.  An explicit three-dimensional ray tracing methodology has been developed as a prerequisite task, combining various techniques that have been previously implemented into steady-state lattice physics code packages.  In a reactor kinetics computation the problem geometry can be simplified beyond what would be appropriate for an assembly transport calculation, yielding a more efficient set of three-dimensional ray tracing procedures for the method of characteristics than has been previously achievable.  Assessment of these spatial techniques is pursued via application to a series of steady state test problems that includes the OECD/NEA Neutron Transport Benchmark Problem.  Results demonstrate that practical implementation of a three-dimensional method of characteristics will require a fine spatial discretization, which subsequently leads to longer computational runtimes.\n\nHaving successfully demonstrated the feasibility of a steady state method of characteristics in three-dimensional space, the primary task of this work is pursued: derivation and implementation of the fundamental equations for a time-dependent method of characteristics.  Solutions to the time-dependent characteristic equation are sought initially via introduction of simple backward and forward time-differencing approximations and assessment is pursued via application to the two-dimensional TWIGL seed/blanket problem.  Exorbitant runtimes preclude a complete analysis, however, and instead preliminary results have been generated for special cases of this problem.  These results demonstrate that numerical instabilities are inherent to a time-differenced method of characteristics and, moreover, that one particular type of instability is unique to a Lagrangian transport formulation.  While this observation suggests that a time-dependent method of characteristics may not be feasible, a more successful formulation could be pursued via examination of alternative time-discretization methods.  The problem of long runtimes, which limits applicability of the methods here described, could be resolved with the eventual introduction of computational acceleration and parallelization techniques.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2556], "author_name_tesi": "Taylor, James Bryce", "last_name_ssi": "Taylor", "middle_name_ssi": "Bryce", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Baratta", "Yousry Y Azmy", "David G Knott", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Jesse Louis Barlow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Baratta, Committee Chair", "Yousry Y Azmy, Committee Chair", "David G Knott, Committee Member", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Jesse Louis Barlow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["method of characteristics", "time-dependent neutron transport", "nuclear reactor kinetics", "3D ray tracing"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "LEARNING SIGNALS IN GENOMIC SEQUENCE ALIGNMENTS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF FUNCTIONAL ELEMENTS", "id": "7221", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2944", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-07-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The structure of genomes, how they encode function, and how they evolve is still quite mysterious. Even the best understood functional elements \u2013 regions that code for proteins \u2013 are far from exhaustively annotated. Other functional elements, such as the cis-regulatory modules that control gene transcription, are even more poorly understood. Comparisons between the genomes of different species can be a useful tool to understand the structure of these elements and improve our ability to identify them. However, such comparisons also raise new questions as we observe regions with distinctly atypical evolutionary patterns but no clear relationship to any known function. Other sequence signals, such as base composition and specific motifs, are also useful for identifying functional regions, but the specific signals to use for identifying a given class of elements are not always obvious. When training data for a class of functional elements is available, applying a machine learning method to learn the relevant sequence and evolutionary patterns has the potential to better identify functional elements. In this work we describe a computational method, called ESPERR (Evolutionary and Sequence Pattern Extraction through Reduced Representations), which uses training examples to learn encodings of multi-genome alignments into a reduced form for predicting a chosen class of functional elements.

The first study identifies predictors of children\u2019s psychotropic treatment by examining adherence to medication and attendance to medication management visits. The second study examines whether treatment improves children\u2019s behavioral outcomes. The third study examines the effect of treatment on children\u2019s utilization and expenditures of mental health services.\nThe objective of the first study was to examine predictors of psychotropic medication adherence and quarterly medication management among Medicaid children. TennCare claims data were used in combination with survey data and data from the Area Resource File. Claims-based measures of adherence and the receipt of medication management services were used. Descriptive analysis included examining characteristics of the sample and correlation between the dependent variables. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine which factors influenced the likelihood of a child being adherent or receiving medication management quarterly.\nThe results of this study suggest that the quality of children\u2019s psychotropic treatment in the TennCare program was suboptimal. While approximately one-quarter of children did not receive quarterly medication management, adherence to medication was particularly poor; only one-third of children were adherent. Logistic regression results indicated a child\u2019s prior medication management service use, race, diagnosis, and parental education were significant predictors of adherence. The number of classes of medication a child was prescribed during the study period was the only significant predictor of the likelihood of quarterly medication management receipt.\nThe objective of the second study was to examine the effect of adherence and receiving quarterly medication management on children\u2019s behavioral outcomes. TennCare claims and charge data were used in combination with survey data and data from the Area Resource File. The outcome was measured as the change in a child\u2019s total Child Behavior Check List (CBCL) score from baseline to the end of the study (duration of 18 months). Propensity score analysis was used to control for confounders in estimating the treatment effect of receiving appropriate psychotropic treatment on children\u2019s behavior.\nThe results from study 2 indicated that children who received medication management within three months of a medication claim had better outcomes than children who did not, though not at conventional levels of significance (P=0.07). No relationship was found between adherence to medication and behavioral outcomes. These results indicate the benefit of quarterly monitoring and raise the issue of whether lower doses of medication may be equally effective in the psychotropic treatment of children.\nThe objective of the third study was to examine the treatment effect of receiving quarterly medication management and being adherent on children\u2019s mental health service utilization and expenditures. A retrospective pre-post analysis of children\u2019s interview and administrative Medicaid claims data was conducted. The outcomes were measured as the logged sum of a child\u2019s total mental health-related Medicaid service use and charges. Propensity score analysis was used to control for confounders in estimating the treatment effect of receiving appropriate psychotropic treatment.\nThe results from study 3 indicate that quarterly receipt of medication management resulted in higher utilization of mental health services and charges in the post-study period. While no relationship was found between adherence and utilization of mental health services, adherence was positively related to charges but not at conventional levels of significance (P=0.06). The provision of quarterly medication management visits resulted in moderately higher mental health services utilization and charges. As a result, the potential benefits of improved outcomes may outweigh the additional cost of increasing the frequency of follow-up; previous analyses suggested that quarterly medication management visits resulted in better behavioral outcomes. Optimizing dosing through frequent medication management visits may enable providers to achieve better patient outcomes at lower dosing, and ultimately produce cost savings.\nIn conclusion, the contribution of this research to the literature was to address questions regarding children\u2019s psychotropic treatment that were previously unanswered. The financial burden of covering costly psychotropic drugs to treat children\u2019s mental illness is a threat to the long-term viability of the Medicaid program. As a result, Medicaid policy makers and providers will continue to be challenged to provide quality services in a cost-effective manner. These results emphasize that better outcomes can be achieved at moderately higher costs.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2795], "author_name_tesi": "Taylor, Jessica Pohl", "last_name_ssi": "Taylor", "middle_name_ssi": "Pohl", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr E Michael Foster", "Karen Linn Bierman", "Peter Kemper", "Dennis Patrick Scanlon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr E Michael Foster, Committee Chair", "Karen Linn Bierman, Committee Member", "Peter Kemper, Committee Member", "Dennis Patrick Scanlon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Psychotropics", "adherence", "medication management", "predictors", "outcomes", "Medicaid"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Secondary School Physics Teachers' Conceptions of Scientific Evidence:\nA Collective Case Study\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "5865", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2555", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Engaging secondary school students in inquiry-oriented tasks similar to the scholarly activities of scientists has been recommended as a way to improve scientific literacy.  Two frequently recommended tasks are students\u2019 design of original experiments and students\u2019 evaluation of scientific evidence and conclusions.  Science education scholars have suggested that teachers must possess well-developed conceptions of scientific evidence to guide students as they engage in these tasks.  Yet, little is known about teachers\u2019 conceptions of scientific evidence.  \n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nThe principal aim of this study, therefore, is to describe the nature of one prospective and two practicing physics teachers\u2019 conceptions of scientific evidence.  More specifically, the following research questions guided this study:  (1) What types of issues related to the measurement reliability and experimental validity of scientific evidence do the participant-teachers think about when designing experiments?  (2) When presented with hypothetical scenarios that describe unsound experimental procedures or poorly supported conclusions (or both), what concerns will the teacher-participants raise?  And (3) When the teacher-participants\u2019 responses to parallel research prompts are compared across protocols, what similarities and differences exist?\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nThe nature of the teacher-participants\u2019 conceptions was derived from an analysis of data collected from research prompts such as interviews and hand written artifacts.  In these research prompts, the teachers \u201cthought aloud\u201d while designing experiments and evaluating student\u2013collected evidence presented in hypothetical classroom scenarios.  The data from this study suggest that the three teachers, while contemplating the reliability and validity of scientific evidence, frequently used their conceptions of evidence in conjunction with specific subject matter conceptions.  The data also indicates that the relationship between subject matter knowledge and conceptions of evidence was more pronounced for some conceptions of evidence (e.g., measurement validity, controlled experimentation, statistical significance) than for others.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\nSuggestions for future research included conducting similar studies in other physics content areas as well as other scientific disciplines.  Implications for science teacher education suggest that science and science methods courses encourage teachers to conduct original research and to construct and present evidence-based arguments from this research for peer review and critique. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2535], "author_name_tesi": "Taylor, Joseph A", "last_name_ssi": "Taylor", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Renata S Engel", "Thomas M Dana", "Vincent Norman Lunetta", "Carla Zembal Saul"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Renata S Engel, Committee Member", "Thomas M Dana, Committee Chair", "Vincent Norman Lunetta, Committee Member", "Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Teacher Education", "Science Teacher Education", "Physics Teacher Education", "Physics Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Toward a Computational Model for Macroscopic Predictions of Device-induced Thrombosis", "id": "27396", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11932", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The efficacy of blood-contacting devices has improved significantly over the years; yet, thrombosis remains a concern with current device technology. A primary contributor to device-induced thrombosis is disturbed flow through the device; specifically, regions of high shear stress cause platelet activation and regions of low wall shear stress (WSS) promote thrombus deposition. In an effort to aid medical device developers, a mathematical model of device-induced thrombosis is developed to predict the entire thrombotic process, encompassing platelet activation, platelet adhesion, and thrombus growth. The mathematical model represents a significant reduction of the full thrombotic network and assumes the fluid mechanics of the system is the primary determinant of device-induced thrombosis.\nThe single-scale thrombosis model considers bulk concentrations of platelets (non-activated, activated, and surface adherent) and adenosine diphoshpate (a chemical activator of platelets). A power law model predicts platelet activation based on the local shear stress, and a non-linear weighting function predicts thrombus deposition and growth based on the local WSS. A modified Brinkman term, used to simulate flow through porous media, acts as a momentum sink in the Navier-Stokes equations and is a function of the local aggregation intensity. The thrombosis model is developed with the use of in vitro thrombus size data collected in a backward-facing step geometry with magnetic resonance imaging, and it is implemented using the open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) toolbox OpenFOAM.\nThe model is initially tested in a two-dimensional asymmetric sudden expansion, where growth is compared to the in vitro size data. After which, the model is implemented in a rotating disc system, where the governing equation for surface adherent platelets is developed using published in vitro platelet adhesion data. Finally, the thrombosis model governing equations are solved in a three-dimensional asymmetric sudden expansion, which represents the first application of a thrombosis model to a three-dimensional geometry on time scales necessary to observe macroscopic thrombus growth. Overall, a model capable of providing macroscopic predictions of thrombosis is developed and presented with the goal of simplifying and expediting the medical device design process.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11377], "author_name_tesi": "Taylor, Joshua Ollen", "last_name_ssi": "Taylor", "middle_name_ssi": "Ollen", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Keefe B Manning", "Richard Scott Meyer", "Thomas Neuberger", "Dr Brent Craven", "Peter J Butler", "Donna Hope Korzick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Keefe B Manning, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Scott Meyer, Committee Member", "Thomas Neuberger, Committee Member", "Dr Brent Craven, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Donna Hope Korzick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["thrombosis", "computational fluid dynamics", "medical device", "platelet adhesion", "magnetic resonance imaging", "LDV"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "AN EXAMINATION OF MEDIA ACCOUNTS OF CHILD \nABDUCTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "11053", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2899", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The media tends to portray a distorted image of crime to the public, and child abduction incidents are no exception.  Though abduction incidents perpetrated by nonfamily members (nonfamily abductions) and strangers (stereotypical kidnappings) are the rarest type of abduction offenses, they receive the most media attention.  Consequently, a moral panic has resulted in which society believes that children are routinely abducted by individuals unrelated or unknown to them.  Lawmakers have responded to this fear by enacting legislation that addresses these types of incidents, but they have largely ignored the most common type of abduction: the family abduction.  Additionally, it has been argued that certain demographics (i.e., age and gender) play a role in whether or not a child abduction incident receives media attention.  This has possible ramifications because widespread publicity is usually necessary to recover a missing child.  To examine disparities between media depictions and actual incidences of child abductions, a content analysis of newspapers drawn from LexisNexis was compared to data from the Second National Incidence Studies of Missing, Abducted, Runaway, and Thrownaway Children (NISMART-2).  It was concluded that the media was more likely to report on incidents in which children were abducted by nonfamily members (nonfamily abductions) and strangers (stereotypical kidnappings).  In addition, the media dedicated more words to female victims than male victims and over-reported on the abduction of younger children (aged 11 and under) than older children (aged 12 and over) when they were the victims of a nonfamily abduction.  In all other areas, however, the media was reporting a relatively accurate picture of child abduction offenses.

I employed qualitative and quantitative measures in order to gain a detailed and in-depth understanding of the outcomes of this program. Individual interviews and pre-tests and post-tests were used with youth participants\u2019 in order to understand their views on the peace education program, and how they could use the knowledge and skills from this program in aspects of their day to day lives. After analyzing the interviews, I found two emerging themes, peace education as personal change and peace education as something new. The pre-tests and post-tests showed that participants did increase their sense of empowerment and problem solving skills, but that the female participants made greater gains than the male participants. Based on these findings, three key things can be implied about the program, and more broadly, about the field of peace education. First, gender must be considered when planning and implementing a peace education program. This is rarely addressed in the literature and given the findings from this and other studies, this issue demands further attention. Second, the utility of English as a foreign language in peace education is considered given the overwhelmingly positive response of participants to the use of English in this program. This is linked to the literature which discusses a need for peace education in areas of intractable conflict where I argue that EFL can play a role as a language that does not link into identity politics and collective narratives that fuel intractable conflicts. Third, this study points to the importance of evaluation for peace education efforts.

One area with great potential to reduce operating costs is the beneficial use of WTR, defined here as an alternative to conventional disposal methods (e.g., landfilling, discharge to sanitary sewers).  WTR have been shown to reduce the soluble P content in amended soils and reduce dissolved P in runoff water and leachate.  Whereas the majority of research investigating the P-binding capacity of WTR has focused on the co-application of WTR and biosolids, limited research has been completed on the effects of blending and conditioning WTR and biosolids prior to dewatering (hereafter referred to as coprocessing).  Moreover, of the coprocessing studies that have been completed, minimal attention has been given to the effects of coprocessing on the soluble-P content of the resulting biosolids.      \nThe purpose of this research was therefore to investigate coprocessing as an additional strategy for managing residuals produced in water and wastewater treatment under evolving nutrient management policies.  The effects on sludge dewaterability and P concentrations in water generated during dewatering (reject water) were investigated. A unique aspect of this effort was a quantitative evaluation of how coprocessing influences the environmental lability of P in biosolids land application. Laboratory experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of coprocessing on: (1) biosolids dewaterability and polymer dose, (2) the water extractable P (WEP) concentration in dewatered biosolids, and (3) the total P concentration in reject water from dewatering operations. Results were then validated through a case study involving full-scale water and wastewater treatment facilities.   \n\tLaboratory studies investigated dewaterability (using capillary suction time, CST) of combined alum residuals (Al-WTR) and anaerobically digested biosolids at various blending ratios (BR), defined as the mass ratio of WTR to biosolids on a dry solids basis.  Without polymer addition, the CST was 160 s for a BR of 0.75 compared to 355 s for the biosolids alone.  The operational polymer dose (OPD), defined as the polymer dose yielding CST of 20 s, was reduced from 20.6 g kg-1 dry solids for the biosolids alone to 16.3 and 12.6 g kg-1 when BR was 0.75 and 1.5, respectively.  Precipitated Al hydrous oxides in the WTR likely caused flocculation of the biosolids particles through heterocoagulation or charge neutralization. The solids contents of the blended materials and biosolids at their respective OPDs were not statistically different (\u03b1 = 0.05) following dewatering by a belt-filter press (BFP). It was concluded that coprocessing with Al-WTR improved biosolids dewaterability and reduced polymer dosage.  \n\tThe impact of coprocessing on the partitioning of P during dewatering and the environmental lability of biosolids-P as measured by water extractable P (WEP) were also evaluated in lab-scale studies.  The reject water total P (TP) content from dewatering biosolids alone (250 mg L-1) was progressively reduced with increasing BR reaching 60 mg L-1 for a BR = 1.5.  The dewatered cake (~20% solids) WEP varied inversely with BR, dropping from 7.6 g kg-1 (biosolids only) to ~0.2 g kg-1 for BR = 1.5.  Polymer addition resulted in lower reject liquid TP for all conditions tested, indicating the cationic polyelectrolyte contributed to P binding.  \nA case study was completed at the Media, PA, wastewater treatment plant in an attempt to validate findings from the laboratory experiments. Al-WTR were coprocessed with digested anaerobic biosolids at BR = 1.3.  The solids content of the BFP cake was increased from 19.4% to 22.0% and the polymer dosage was reduced from 19.3 to 14.1 g kg-1.  Biosolids WEP was reduced from 0.1 to 0.01 mg kg-1, illustrating the great potential of coprocessing to reduce WEP in biosolids.  Total P in the BFP filtrate was reduced from 32.36 to 6.34 mg L-1. Because the filtrate is recycled to the headworks, coprocessing results in a net reduction in P loading to the WWTP.  Phytoavailable P (measured as Mehlich-3 P) was not reduced by application of the coprocessed material. Trace element content in the WTR is comparable to, or less than, the trace element content in the biosolids, therefore coprocessing will not prohibit land application or beneficial use with respect to trace metal concentrations.  Aluminum (Al) in coprocessed cake was shown to be highly insoluble, therefore land application should not induce Al phytotoxicity or enhance Al movement to surface or ground waters. For this facility, coprocessing was established as a viable method for processing WTR and biosolids with several distinct benefits. \nThe potential for using WTR for P control applications appears promising and the demand for a product with this capability is steadily increasing as concerns about surface water degradation and P-based nutrient management continue to receive intense focus. In practice, the extent of these benefits may be limited by factors such as: variability in the chemical and physical properties of WTR and biosolids, (2) infrastructure and economic considerations, and (3) quantities of WTR produced relative to the amount of biosolids generated by a municipality. Nonetheless the results of this study indicate that coprocessing provides an additional strategy for managing residuals produced in water and wastewater treatment under evolving nutrient management policies. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8225], "author_name_tesi": "Taylor, Malcolm ", "last_name_ssi": "Taylor", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Malcolm", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott", "Herschel Adams Elliott", "Brian Dempsey", "Robert David Shannon", "James Michael Hamlett"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott, Dissertation Advisor", "Herschel Adams Elliott, Committee Chair", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "Robert David Shannon, Committee Member", "James Michael Hamlett, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Water Treatment Residuals", "Biosolids", "Phosphorus"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Technological Aspects of Corrosion Control in Metallic Systems", "id": "16279", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8128", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Three corrosion control technologies were investigated, including the effect of nitrogen on the passivity of chromium in sulfate solutions, possible issues associated with the use of amines in steam turbine environments and the microstructure of naval advanced amorphous coatings.\n\tNitrogen (N) is a minor alloying element commonly used to increase the strength of steels by stabilizing the austenite phase.  Nitrogen has been found to improve the corrosion-resistance of stainless steels, although the mechanism which confers this protection is under debate.  An atomistic model is proposed which explains the incorporation of nitrogen into the passive films of chromium-based alloys and predicts the effects of such incorporation on the passive film behavior.  The model is conceptualized through a novel use of the Hume-Rothery rules of solid solution, for which only one possible substitution of N into the Cr2O3 lattice was found to be compatible with all four \u201crules\u201d; coordination number, electronegativity, ionic radius mismatch and valency.  Four crystallographic defect reactions are proposed; one at the metal/film interface, where N(3-) occupies an oxygen vacancy and three subsequent reactions with H+ at the film/solution interface where the nitrogen defect evolves into ammonia.  Rate constants are derived and reported for the reactions using the method of partial charge transfer.  Using the Solute Vacancy Interaction Model as a guide, it is proposed that the negatively charged nitrogen defects would have electrostatic interactions with the positively charged oxygen vacancies and metal interstitials, and the resulting complexes should reduce the transport of these defects.  Consequently, the Point Defect Model rate constants are affected, correctly predicting that N defects should reduce both the passive film thickness, and the steady state current density, as has been observed in nitrogen-bearing alloys and nitrided stainless steels.  Physical vapor deposited chromium + nitrogen (0, 6.8 and 8.9 at.%N) coatings were investigated as a model system, to test the model.  Because Cr passive films have been observed to be generally n-type semiconductors, an impedance function containing a n-type Faradaic impedance was constructed and optimized to electrochemical impedance spectra for the model system at pH 4,7 and 10 1M sulfate solution at 30\u00b0C.  An apparent deviation from theory was observed, however.  The n-type model predicted steady state currents which were independent of potential, while the observed current densities had a positive correlation with potential.  Mott-Schottky analysis revealed that the test potentials were within the n-p transition and p-type potential range, which resolves the apparent deviation.  Despite this difficulty, however, the impedance model produced reasonably accurate results, calculating current densities to within one order of magnitude of the measured steady state currents where anodic currents were available and passive film thicknesses on the order of 1-2 nm.\n\tVarious amines are commonly used to inhibit corrosion in thermal power generation systems, including steam turbines, by increasing the pH.  However, during the shutdown phase of the power plant, it is possible for these inhibitors to concentrate and cause corrosion of the turbine rotor.  The effect of two ammine inhibitors (monoethanolamine and dimethylamine) on the passivity of ASTM A470/471 steel is investigated in a simulated turbine environment at pH 7, and temperatures of 95\u00b0C and at 175\u00b0C.  Potentiodynamic scans and potentiostatic measurements revealed that the steel depassivated with high (0.1M) concentrations of monoethanolamine, in combination with acetate.  Because the steel depassivated at low potentials and at neutral pH, it is unlikely to be acid or transpassive depassivation.  The proposed mechanism for this depassivation is resistive depassivation, whereby the potential drop incurred by the precipitated outer-layer robs the barrier layer of the passive film of the potential required to maintain a finite film thickness.  This effect was observed at both 95\u00b0C and 175\u00b0C and was found to destroy the metal at an alarming rate.  This observation was made in tandem with modeling of the amine concentrations found in steam turbines during operation and shutdown.  Monoethanolamine has a lower vapor pressure than water during turbine dryout conditions, meaning that it will tend to concentrate, along with acetate, while dimethylamine evaporates.  Because the monoethanolamine concentrations during operation were three orders of magnitude lower than the least concentrated experiment in this work, but equal to the most concentrated conditions in this work during shutdown, it is likely that the corrosion damage attributed to this mechanism occurs only during shutdown.  It is recommended that monoethanolamine be evaluated for exclusion from use as an inhibitor in thermal power systems containing ASTM A470/471 steel.\n\tHigh velocity oxy-fuel (HFOV) coatings are employed in maritime environments to protect against corrosion and wear.  The performance of such coatings is dominated by flaws in the microstructure, such as porosity, delamination and secondary phases.  A nondestructive evaluation technique that is capable of determining the quality of a HVOF coating was developed, based on electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).  The EIS measurement was correlated to the microstructure observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  Because a transmission line model was unable to provide discriminatory information, a convenient mathematical impedance function was constructed, with two separated time constants defined by constant phase elements, with time constants for a \u201cfast\u201d and a \u201cslow\u201d process.  When the parameters of this model is optimized to the impedance data, a microstructure-time constant relationship emerges.  It was found that for the \u201cfast\u201d time constant, all values below 0.15s belonged to delaminated specimens, while all values above 0.30 belonged to hermitic samples.  For samples with \u201cfast\u201d time constants between 0.15 and 0.30, a measure of the microstructure can be comparatively inferred, with lower values for both the \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d time constant corresponding to higher porosity.\n\tEnabling the impedance studies above is a new software package for fitting complicated impedance functions of up to 50 parameters to complex impedance data, developed specifically for this work.  The curve-fitting software utilizes differential evolution, an evolutionary algorithm which is relatively new to the field of impedance modeling, enabling the operator to obtain high quality fits without the need for excellent starting guesses, taking trial and error out of the curve-fitting process and vastly improving the man-hour efficiency involved in optimizing complicated impedance functions such as the Faradaic impedance of the Point Defect Model.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8070], "author_name_tesi": "Taylor, Matthew Logan", "last_name_ssi": "Taylor", "middle_name_ssi": "Logan", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald", "James Hansell Adair", "Michael Anthony Hickner", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald", "Bernard Normand", "Damien Feron"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Digby D Macdonald, Dissertation Advisor", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Member", "Bernard Normand, Special Member", "Damien Feron, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy", "EIS", "HVOF", "NAAC", "Point Defect Model", "Corrosion", "Passivity", "Modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Terrain Classification for Conditioned Based Maintenance", "id": "23600", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10575", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reducing the total cost of owning and operating equipment is an important goal for both the U.S. military and private industry. Key goals for logistics support equipment are increasing fuel efficiency and reducing maintenance costs. This research addresses techniques to classify terrain in order to better predict maintenance schedules, reduce subsystem damage and improve fuel efficiency in ground vehicles.\nThe United States Army Material Systems Analysis Activity (AMSAA) has developed a measurement and processing approach algorithm for Terrain Regime Identification and Classification (TRIC) that classifies the harshness of the vehicle\u2019s operating conditions based on the roughness (z-axis motion), bumpiness (magnitudes of vehicle pitch and roll), steepness of the terrain, and the vehicle\u2019s speed. The terrain classification can contribute to maintenance prediction algorithms, as rates of damage to the various sub-systems of the vehicle should be correlated to the harshness of terrain traversed. The algorithm uses inputs from sensors measuring vehicle pitch and roll mounted on the vehicle body, vertical acceleration from a sensor mounted on the axle, vehicle speed, and position (via GPS). Spectra from a z-axis accelerometer mounted in the body of the vehicle have been compared to spectra from a z-axis accelerometer mounted on the axle of the vehicle to see if the same information regarding the roughness can be extracted in both cases, or if a translation model can be developed to produce comparable results, and potentially reduce instrumentation costs.\nThe TRIC algorithm has been reproduced in MATLAB to see what additional information and uses can be obtained. The classifications from TRIC were compared to vehicle operating mode classifications previously developed by the Applied Research Laboratory (ARL) at Penn State based on vehicle operating data such as engine speed, vehicle speed and accelerator position. Color-coded classifications overlaid on maps of the test courses show operating modes as a function of the vehicle\u2019s path.

Many of these structures were constructed in the early part of the 20th century and are in need of repair and modernization.  Construction on these facilities could further impact darter reproduction through habitat destruction and siltation.  Life history data shows that some darters are particularly vulnerable to siltation.  The main objective of this thesis was to determine if darters spawn in the main stem of the Ohio River and if they are potentially at risk.  A minimum of 12 species of darters (Etheostoma, Percina) spawn throughout the study area (E. blenniodes, E. caeruleum, E. camurum, E. flabellare, E. nigrum, E. tippecanoe, E. zonale, P. caprodes, P. copelandi, P. evides, P. macrocephela and P. shumardi).  Etheostoma camurum, E. tippecanoe, and P. evides are listed as threatened species in Pennsylvania.  These species were found to be using the base of the dams for reproduction by observation and statistical modeling using logistic regression.  Logistic regression showed that the base of the dams was statistically significant for darter reproduction.  Island back channels were not found to be different from the dam bases.  Tributaries were not found to be statistically significant contributors to darter recruitment.  Since reproduction is occurring in the main stem and at the base of the dams in particular, darter reproduction is at risk to both habitat destruction and siltation from facility improvements.  It has been shown that darters can migrate many kilometers to spawn.  It is believed that this occurs for many of the darters in the Ohio River.  Evidence that this migration occurs in the late winter and the adults and young disperse by summer was found during this study.  Construction scheduled around this migration could reduce the potential risk to recruitment, however, some species were found almost exclusively at the base of the dams; Etheostoma camurum, Etheostoma tippecanoe, Percina evides, and Percina macrocephela.  There are signs that habitat improvements could influence reproduction in a positive way.  Percina shumardi was found to have recently colonized PA as water quality has improved.  Some darters were found on sandbars formed by tributaries created adjacent to the dredged channels.  There are island back channels particularly suited to habitat improvements.  The two islands in the upper New Cumberland Pool of the Ohio River have already been set aside as wildlife refuges.

However, devolatilization reactions of solid fuels at high heating rate, high temperature and high pressure are not completely understood. The complexity of the reactions in these conditions becomes significant when two fuels of dissimilar properties such as coal and biomass are to be converted together.\nThe synergy between the two fuels is among other relevant topics pertaining to the conversion of coal and biomass blends. This topic is in the middle of a controversy in the scientific community, on one side there experiments that show strong synergy meanwhile there are experiments exhibiting no sign of synergy on the other side. Extensive review on this topic shows that the catalytic effects of alkali and alkaline earth metals (AAEM) elements in biomass are responsible for the synergistic effects observed by some authors. A non-catalytic theory is also invoked and asserts that free radicals formation and hydrogen transfer from biomass to coal is responsible for the synergy. Published data show that the hydrogen transfer theory is only possible if the formation rate of the radicals from biomass matches that of the radical fragments from coal at first. Furthermore, both radicals must be close enough spatially to react with each other, because the reaction rates among the radicals are much faster than the transport rate of the radicals. This theory is therefore temperature dependent as the resonance between the release of radicals from coal and biomass can only happen at lower temperatures under slow heating rates. The catalytic theory also suffers a temperature dependence since at higher temperature (above 1573 K) the inorganics in biomass become deactivated.\nAs an initial state to understand the high temperature conversion of solid fuels, a thermodynamic modeling of coal and biomass co-gasification has been conducted. Results show that high temperature enhances formation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide while carbon dioxide, water and methane are predominant at lower temperatures. However, there is an optimum temperature where any further increase in temperature becomes detrimental, resulting in a decrease of the gross calorific value as well as the cold gas efficiency. Increasing the pressure has a similar effect as decreasing the temperature; by reducing carbon monoxide and hydrogen while increasing carbon dioxide, water and especially methane. Nonetheless, this effect of pressure is suppressed when the temperature is sufficiently high.\nDesigning a feed system to satisfactorily deliver coal and unprocessed biomass remains a challenge for laboratory scale reactors used to study the thermal conversion of solid fuels. The selection of heating elements and refractory insulation materials is an important step in the reactor design process. The performance and longevity of heating elements are high dependent on the operating environment, the maximum temperature attained by the heating elements as well as the cycling between high and low temperatures. Compared to other materials, molybdenum dissilicide material is found to the most suitable in both oxidizing and reducing environments. Alumina based refractory insulation materials are convenient by reason of their high temperature operability. However their thermal conductivities are somewhat high compared to other insulation materials. For this reason, a thermal barrier coating of yttrium-stabilized zirconia has been applied to the inner side of the reactor as well as on the anchors welded to the inner side of the reactor. Further cooling is provided to keep the reactor shell temperature below 60 \u00b0C.\nThe characterization of pyrolysis chars shows a sharp decrease of the specific surface area for chars produced at 1773 K due to pore coalescence. Despite this reduced specific surface area, the reactivities of chars produced at 1673 K and 1773 K are similar. This phenomenon is attributed to thermal annealing which is observed to occur > 1573 K. All Chars produced at 1573 K exhibit the same shape even though their magnitudes are sometimes different. Their rate of conversion is high right at the beginning of the TGA analysis. Whereas for chars produced at 1673 K and 1773 K, the conversion is slow at the beginning and gradually increases to reach a plateau. We can undoubtedly say that the conversion graphs for chars produced at 1673 and 1773 K are S-shaped while those produced at 1573 K are logarithmic-shaped. Higher temperature chars have undergone a stronger severity, causing most of the weak bonds to break down, leaving a very stable char. However, the bond stability of these chars is confine in a narrow interval compared to the chars generated at 1573 K.  Therefore, under TGA analysis, conversion at the initial stage is low for high temperature chars as less bonds are being broken. \nCarbon conversion during pyrolysis decreases as the pyrolysis pressure increases. The shape of biomass chars tends to change from a spike like/elongated appearance to a rounded/oblong appearance. The SEM images of chars show that pressurized operation causes agglomeration of particles. Rapid change of pressure taking place in the coal metaplast during devolatilization creates cavities where the pressure is relatively low and filled with gas bubbles. The structure of the coal chars observed by SEM reveals that it belongs to group I chars characterized by a high porosity (> 70%), small wall thickness (< 5 \u00b5m), spherical to sub-spherical shape and typical swelling ratio higher than 1.3. Observation of SEM images of char from experiments conducted at 10 bars reveals coal particles encapsulated into molten biomass slags. The phenomenon is enhanced as the temperature in high. The exposed surface area of the coal char is critically reduced. The consequence could be a significant decrease of the char reactivity as the gasifying agent could not easily penetrate into the pores of the coal char trapped in the molten slag from biomass.\nAbout a hundred of compounds have been identified in the tars collected during pyrolysis; 21 of them represent 90 % of the mass of tar in the temperature range of 1573 to 1773 K. There is a decrease of the single and two aromatic ring aromatic hydrocarbons (including their derivatives) with respect to the temperature. Meanwhile the 3-, 4- and 5 aromatic ring hydrocarbons increase, which is in accordance with the pathway to soot formation. The largest PAHs identified are benzo[e]pyrene, cyclopenta[cd]pyrene and benzo[ghi]fluoranthene. No PAHs having more than five aromatic rings have been identified by the GC-MS. While cyclopenta[cd]pyrene and benzo[ghi]fluoranthene have been identified at all the temperatures studied, benzo[e]pyrene appears only at 1773 K.\nKinetic data for high temperature devolatilization is highly unreliable unless there is a provision to take into account the rapid homogeneous secondary reaction taking place. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14500], "author_name_tesi": "Tchapda, Aim\u00e9 Hilaire  Ngongang", "last_name_ssi": "Tchapda", "middle_name_ssi": "Ngongang", "first_name_ssi": "Aim\u00e9 Hilaire ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarma V.

One example that is relevant to the workplace can be seen in feedback interventions. According to the social functional perspective, emotions expressed by the feedback provider are likely to add to a recipient\u2019s understanding of the feedback message.  The Emotions as Social Information (EASI) model is consistent with this perspective and states that expressed emotions influence observer behavior through two pathways: performance inferences and affective reactions (e.g. liking of the feedback provider). Recent work with the EASI model suggests that angry feedback can have beneficial effects on performance, and the current study expands these findings by investigating whether technology-mediated communication influences how recipients respond to angry feedback.  Drawing on media richness theory, I proposed that angry feedback would be perceived as more intense in richer media and that this would have an indirect effect on individuals\u2019 behavior on subsequent task performance through effect of the two EASI pathways. Participants were assigned to one of three computer\u2014mediated angry feedback conditions (i.e., video, audio, text) in response to a divergent thinking task, then were asked to complete a variation of the same task. Media richness in technology-mediated communication modalities was found to act as a catalyst, where richer media increased the perceived intensity of expressed emotions. In general, these differences in perceived intensity of groups manifested in differences across groups for the EASI mechanisms, in that participants in the richer media conditions reported lower performance inferences and less liking of the feedback provider, as well as greater felt anger and anxiety. However, analyses for the indirect effect of intensity of anger on subsequent performance through the EASI pathways were largely unsupportive. Trending results suggest that liking has a non-linear (inverted-U) effect on originality, such that participants who reported moderate levels of liking generated more original responses to the task.

Although legacy effects are largely unknown, wetland function, stratigraphic integrity, and appearance were undoubtedly affected by mowing and grazing.  Wetland management through ditching, burning, diking, and irrigating would also have had impacts.  Identifying the lingering influence of such activities is especially relevant for the United States where the remaining half of original wetland acreage is highly valued for ecosystem services.  This dissertation used archival texts (court minutes, tax rolls, probate records, journals), maps and property surveys, and proxy records (pollen, macrofossils, phytoliths, fungal spores, charcoal) to document wetland agriculture within the relatively understudied Dutch colony of New Netherland.  Of specific interest are written references to the timing and frequency of disturbances like mowing and grazing.  A regional-scale narrative of wetland use and management is developed based on results for New Netherland combined with what is known for French and English settlement groups.   Because wetlands in the Northeast were similarly managed by different settlement groups, ecologists and historians working in this region may be able to carefully assume land-use histories based on wetland type and location.

Resiliency, though, is a character of complex adaptive systems and resilient design should incorporate complexity thinking to provide sound and effective solutions. Studying complex urban landscapes requires understanding the aggregated interactions of many factors/agents in small/micro scales that shape a bigger picture in large/macro scale, a bottom-up process that acknowledges the role of citizens in shaping urban landscapes and applies a rule-based approach to ecological design.  At the same time, landscape architecture as a profession lacks framework and tools to incorporate this way of thinking into the design process. In today\u2019s ever-increasing reliance of design fields on digital design tools, the available CAD tools and the way the discipline uses them, do not reflect the participatory, dynamic process of shaping urban landscapes.\nThis research aims to provide a framework for participatory resilient landscape design, which combine benefits of computational rule-based design, social networks and collective intelligence systems into a platform for co-designing landscapes as coupled human-nature systems. The focus of this co-design tool is on urban planting design with the concentration on small-scale landscapes such as rain gardens and edible landscapes. Although, these small-scale landscapes have tremendous potentials for combating climate change, the high cost of accessing experts\u2019 knowledge, tools and materials and lack of motivation prevent many citizens to utilize these potentials. \nMy research proposes first, a conceptual map/framework of participatory resilient urban planting for a generic scenario. Second, it prototypes an app that provides lay users a platform to: 1) find potential sites, 2) design and evaluate landscapes and 3) share their knowledge, experiences and materials. The app evaluates citizen-designed planting schemes based on ecological resiliency rules and shows different scenarios under extreme environmental events. Through informing users by means of visualized data related to their resources and performance and social mechanisms such as peer pressure built into the platform, the app facilitates citizen engagement in the design process for reaching neighborhood resiliency goal.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11872], "author_name_tesi": "Tebyanian, Nastaran ", "last_name_ssi": "Tebyanian", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nastaran", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Landscape Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mallika Bose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mallika Bose, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Collective Intelligence Systems", "Resilience", "Urban Landscape", "Expert System"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Differential Sensitivity of ImPACT and VR Testing Modalities in Assessment of Concussion: An EEG Study ", "id": "18235", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8769", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\t While concussions are defined as a pathophysiological injury, clinical paradigms for concussion management focus solely on the resulting functional deficits and ignore the underlying physiology.

Specifically, this study sought to assess Turkish parents\u2019: (1) motivational beliefs, including their role activity and self-efficacy beliefs about involvement, (2) perceptions of invitations, including general school and teacher-specific, to be involved, and (3) perceptions of life context variables, including personal knowledge and skills and personal time and energy for involvement activities. This study also explored the impact of demographic characteristics on the psychological factors of parent involvement. The demographic variables in this study included parents\u2019 age and gender, parents\u2019 income and education levels, parents\u2019 marital and employment status, and number of children. The investigator used quantitative research techniques to address the topic.\nParticipants were 374 Turkish parents who had young children. Parents\u2019 beliefs and perceptions about their involvement were measured by using the adapted Turkish version of the related Level 1 scales from the Hoover-Dempsey and Sandler parent involvement model. The researcher ensured the validity and reliability of the measures prior to their use in the main study. The related scales used as the first instrument in this study were based on parents\u2019 self-report, and included: (1) Parental Role Activity Beliefs for Involvement in Children\u2019s Education, (2) Parental Self-Efficacy Beliefs for Helping the Child Succeed in School, (3) Parental Perceptions of General Invitations for Involvement from the School, (4) Parental Perceptions of Specific Invitations for Involvement from the Child\u2019s Teacher, (5) Parental Perceptions of Personal Knowledge and Skills for Involvement Activities, and (6) Parental Perceptions of Personal Time and Energy for Involvement Activities. A total of 44 items were included in this instrument. Moreover, a demographic survey that contained seven questions about participants\u2019 age and gender, marital and employment status, education and income levels, and number of children, was developed and used as the second instrument in this study.\nThe investigator used both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques to analyze the data. The results of descriptive statistics suggested that Turkish parents as a group tend to have positive beliefs and perceptions about their involvement in their young children\u2019s education. Multiple linear regression analysis (MLRA) was also deployed to understand the relationship between these beliefs and perceptions and demographic characteristics. The results revealed that parents\u2019 monthly family income is the strongest predictor of their beliefs and perceptions about their involvement in their young children\u2019s education. Parents with higher incomes tend to have more positive beliefs and perceptions about involvement than the lower-income parents. It was also found that parents\u2019 educational backgrounds influence their self-efficacy beliefs about helping their children succeed in school. Parents with higher education levels are more likely to have stronger self-efficacy beliefs than the parents with lower educational backgrounds.\nSeveral recommendations were made based on the results.

This design focus, however, neglects the critical issue of communications security inherent in wireless systems that present a channel that is very easy for people of criminal intent to tap. Existing approaches leave this important issue to the higher layers of the protocol hierarchies, yet the need to deal with it in lower layers is imminent as the security of many cryptographic algorithms is hard to evaluate and has caused disappointment in the past. In addition, there is rising interest in large networks of low-complexity transmitters such as sensor nodes and RF-ID tags that do not have room for complicated and computationally intensive cryptographic algorithms.  Historically, communication secrecy has been evaluated using one of two approaches: information theory or computational complexity.  Throughout this thesis, we look at the information theoretic measures of secrecy to find provable secure communication schemes, and try to bring a joint approach to improve both security and throughput.\n\nWe start by examining the Gaussian Multiple-Access Wire-Tap Channel (GMAC-WT), and an eavesdropper who has access to a degraded version of the legitimate receiver's signal.  For this scenario, we first define two suitable secrecy measures, called ``collective\" and ``individual\" secrecy measures.  We first look at coding schemes to achieve a given amount of secrecy in the presence of this eavesdropper.  We find achievable secrecy rate regions for each constraint, and show that we can achieve the secrecy sum-capacity for this scenario. We then look at a more general scenario where the eavesdropper does not necessarily have a degraded version of the receiver's signal.  In this more general case, we consider the ``collective\" constraints, as this constraint allows the system to achieve a larger rate region by placing trust on all users; and the ``perfect secrecy\" case, since this is in general a more appropriate constraint for practical purposes.  We find an achievable secrecy rate region, and the power allocations that maximize the achievable perfect secrecy sum-rate.  We also introduce a novel scheme, which we call ``cooperative jamming\", where users whose signals are vulnerable to decoding by the eavesdropper jam the eavesdropper, achieving higher secrecy rates for the remaining users.  We also find an outer bound on the achievable secrecy sum-rate, which is shown to coincide with the achievable secrecy sum-rate for the degraded scenario.\n\nNext, we consider the Gaussian Two-Way Wire-Tap Channel (GTW-WT) and the Binary Additive Two-Way Wire-Tap Channel (BATW-WT).  For these channels, we find achievable secrecy regions, and show that utilizing the same channel, in addition to the transmitters knowing their own self-interference, allows for higher secrecy sum-rates than the GMAC-WT.  We also investigate cooperative jamming and find the optimum transmit/jam powers for the two users.\n\nFinally, we examine the ergodic block-fading case for the two user GMAC-WT.  We find the secrecy sum-rate maximizing power allocations under a long-term power constraint, and see that unlike the standard GMAC where it is optimal for only one user to be transmitting at any given time, in some cases it is better for both users to be transmitting.  We also consider cooperative jamming for this scenario, and give numerical results showing the improvement achievable for the secrecy sum-rate.\n\nThis thesis is among the first to point out the advantages that the wireless medium brings to securing information transfer at the physical layer. In particular, the multiple access nature of the communication models considered reveals that allowing confidence in the secrecy of other users, it is possible to achieve secrecy as long as we can put the overall system at an advantage compared to the eavesdropper, rather than needing each user to achieve secrecy for itself.  In addition, for certain channels such as the two-way wire-tap channel, each user's transmission can act as a key, providing an additional advantage over the eavesdropper and allowing improvements over the achievable single-user secrecy rates.  Furthermore fading, together with cooperative jamming, provides another dimension to exploit when trying to create an advantage over the eavesdropper.  In short, multiple-access nature of the wireless environment becomes a resource for security purposes.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1912], "author_name_tesi": "Tekin, Ender ", "last_name_ssi": "Tekin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ender", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aylin Yener", "David Jonathan Miller", "John F Doherty", "Guohong Cao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aylin Yener, Committee Chair", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Member", "John F Doherty, Committee Member", "Guohong Cao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["wire-tap channel", "secrecy capacity", "wireless communications", "information theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "TURKISH MOTHERS\u2019 ATTITUDES TOWARD CHILDREARING PRACTICES\n", "id": "8947", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2156", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to learn about Turkish mothers\u2019 parental attitudes toward childrearing practices.

In addition to the dopaminergic structures, PD pathology is also observed in areas of other neurotransmitter systems. One of the most significant of these systems, and the main topic of this dissertation, is the noradrenergic system. Dopamine and norepinephrine are synthesized by enzymes that are found in the catecholamine biosynthesis pathway. Specifically, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catalyzes the conversion of the amino acid tyrosine to levodopa (L-DOPA), which is the rate-limiting step in catecholamine biosynthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine (DA), which is then converted to norepinephrine (NE) by dopamine beta hydroxylase (DBH). It is interesting that both of these neurotransmitters are important in PD and they share common steps in their synthetic pathways. \nA common polymorphism in TH has been shown to be associated with more severe freezing of gait (FOG) in PD patients. FOG is a symptom that usually occurs in the later stages of the disease. In subjects that are homozygous for the V81M single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), the FOG is more severe. Heterozygous subjects are unaffected, which is in agreement with observations from TH knockout animals. When transgenic mice contain one intact copy of TH, they are able to synthesize catecholamine levels equal to those of the wild type animals. The conversion of valine to methionine causes an increase in the Michaelis-Menten constant of TH for its substrate tyrosine, when assayed in vitro. This may result in a decrease in catecholamine synthesis as the rate-limiting enzyme will be less efficient. This finding supports the previously reported role of NE in the development of FOG. PD patients with FOG have lowered NE and in certain cases, FOG can be resolved by administration of NE mimetics.\nIn addition to its role in FOG, NE has also been implicated in PD pathology. Noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) also show increased neurodegeneration and accumulation of alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy Bodies (LB), which are present in dopaminergic neurons. Animal studies have suggested that NE can be neuroprotective against dopaminergic neurodegeneration. In line with these data, a rare SNP (R549C) in the enzyme DBH was observed significantly more in PD subjects compared to controls. The expression of DBH in sera obtained from heterozygous subjects was less than WT sera. There is also a possible effect of R549C on the oligomerization of the enzyme; however, this requires further investigation. Heterozygous R549C sera have increased conversion of tyramine to octopamine as measured by spectrophotometry. This may be interpreted as increased DBH activity in heterozygous subject sera; however, this assay is not DBH-specific. These results can be interpreted in several ways: the decreased expression of DBH results in compensatory changes increasing enzyme activity or this observation is merely an artifact or there is significant increase in DBH activity in CNS of patients with this SNP. The clinical observation in which DBH R549C is associated with PD may be due to a decrease in NE neuroprotection or reduced DA levels due to increased DBH activity.\nIn summary, genetic changes in the catecholaminergic pathway and the resulting alterations in the regulation of this system may underlie PD pathology and characteristics. Elucidation of genetic changes in PD endophenotypes will illuminate different pathological contributors to the disease. In a complex disorder such as PD, dissecting the molecular pathways and their roles is key to understanding disease pathology, which will lead to more successful disease management and generation of improved therapies.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11587], "author_name_tesi": "Tekin, Izel ", "last_name_ssi": "Tekin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Izel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kent Eugene Vrana", "Kent Eugene Vrana", "Richard Bernard Mailman", "Xuemei Huang", "Willard M Freeman", "Carla Jean Gallagher"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kent Eugene Vrana, Dissertation Advisor", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Chair", "Richard Bernard Mailman, Committee Member", "Xuemei Huang, Committee Member", "Willard M Freeman, Committee Member", "Carla Jean Gallagher, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Parkinson's disease", "SNP", "Catecholamine", "Genetics", "Next Generation Sequencing"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "NATURAL BIOACTIVE PRODUCTS AS RUMEN FERMENTATION MODIFIERS \n", "id": "10656", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2558", "abstract_tesi": "In experiment 1 medicinal herbs and essential oils were evaluated in a batch culture in vitro screening experiment as potential anti-methanogenic additives for ruminant diets.

Incubation was conducted in serum bottles containing 1 g of a feed mixture (0.7 g alfalfa hay, 0.2 g corn starch, and 0.1 g solvent-extracted soybean meal), 1 ml of essential oils (10, 50, and 100 mg/L, final media concentration), 19 ml of McDougall\u00a1\u00a6s buffer with 5 g/L glucose and 2.5 g/L acid-hydrolyzed casein, and 20 ml of ruminal inoculum. Bottles were then flushed with CO2 and incubated at 39\u201eaC for 6 h. Corresponding 50 ml tubes were incubated for 24 h for NDF degradability analysis. Herbs were tested using the same procedure except a portion of the alfalfa hay was replaced with 12.5, 50, 100, and 200 mg of herbs (air-dry basis), and NDF was tested using the DAISY apparatus. Blanks and monensin (5 mg/L, final media concentration) were also incubated. At the end of the incubations, total gas and methane production, VFA and ammonia concentration, and NDF degradability were measured. Treatment by application level interactions were not significant for any of the essential oil treatments. Two of the essential oils increased acetate production, 12 increased propionate production, 10 increased butyrate production, 3 reduced methane production (by 20 to 30%), and 2 decreased ammonia production. With the herbs, 1 increased acetate production, 2 increased propionate production, 1 decreased methane production (by 30%), and 1 decreased ammonia production. Eight of the herbs increased NDF degradability at various inclusion levels.

Average DMI was 27 kg/d (\u00a1\u00d3 0.59 SD) and did not differ between treatments (P=0.31). Apparent total tract digestibly of DM, OM, NDF, ADF, crude protein, and total nonstructural carbohydrates were similar between treatments (P = 0.16 to 0.90). Rumen pH and concentration of total VFA, acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate, A:P ratio, polysaccharide-degrading activities, and total free amino acid concentration were not affected by treatment (P= 0.15 to 0.97). Isobutyrate (1.12 vs. 0.94 mmol/L; P < 0.0001), isovalerate (1.76 vs. 1.51 mmol/L; P = 0.002), and ammonia concentration (5.4 vs. 3.3 mmol/L; P = 0.0003) were increased by EO compared with the control. Methane concentration was decreased in cows fed the EO diet (38,542 versus 27,975 mg/m3; P = 0.03). Methane production per hour and day and manure emissions of ammonia, methane, and carbon dioxide were not affected by treatment (P= 0.21 to 0.81). Blood glucose concentration was not affected by treatment, while blood urea nitrogen was increased by EO compared with the control (13.37 vs. 11.00 mg/dl; P <0.0001). Average milk yield, fat corrected milk yield, and milk fat, protein, and lactose concentrations were unaffected by diet (P= 0.17 to 0.73). Milk urea nitrogen concentration was greater for EO cows compared with the control (9.55 vs. 8.31 mg/dl; P <0.001). Microbial N flow, urine N%, and urea N were all increased in cows receiving the EO diet (P= to 0.02 to 0.0001). Trial two used 120 primiparious and multiparious Holstein cows grouped in pens of 20 cows/pen (n=3) in a 10 week experiment to study production effects of EO. Cows were blocked by DIM at the beginning of the trial. Dry matter intake (28.5 kg \u00a1\u00d3 0.55), milk yield (35.6 kg \u00a1\u00d31.00), components (2.56 kg\u00a1\u00d30.02), MUN (11.31 mg/dl\u00a1\u00d30.02), feed efficiency (1.26 \u00a1\u00d30.04), and fat corrected milk (34.59 kg\u00a1\u00d31.02) were similar among diets (P= 0.13 to 0.97).  Results from these studies indicate that supplementing dairy cows with 525 mg/d of Xtract did not improve digestibility of nutrients or milk production and composition under the current experimental conditions.\nIn experiment 3 a lactating cow trial was conducted to study the effects of dietary addition of oregano (Origanum vulgare L.; 0, control vs. 500 g/d, OV) on ruminal fermentation, total tract digestibility, manure emissions, N metabolism, milk taste, and dairy cow performance. Eight primiparious and multiparious Holstein cows (6 of which were ruminally cannulated) were used in a switch over design with 2, 21-d periods. Cows were fed once daily. The OV material was top-dressed on to the TMR. Cows averaged 41 \u00a1\u00d3 3.3 SEM kg/d milk yield and 80 \u00a1\u00d3 12.5 DIM. Intake of DM averaged 26 \u00a1\u00d3 0.83 SEM kg/d and did not differ between treatments. Apparent total tract digestibly of DM, OM, NDF, ADF, CP, and TNC did not differ between treatments. Rumen pH and concentration of total and individual VFA, acetate:propionate ratio, and total free amino acid concentration were also not affected by treatment. Ruminal ammonia concentration was increased by OV compared with the control (5.3 vs. 4.3 mmol/L; P < 0.001). Blood urea N and glucose concentrations were not affected by treatment. Average milk yield, milk fat, protein, and lactose concentrations, MUN, and SCC were unaffected by diet. Milk sensory parameters were also not affected by treatment. Fat-corrected (3.5%) milk yield and 3.5% FCM feed efficiency were increased (P = 0.03 and < 0.001) for OV compared with the control (42.2 vs. 40.7 kg/d and 1.63 vs. 1.53 kg/kg, respectively). Rumen methane production was reduced 40% in the OV treatment (P = 0.004). Ruminal microbial N flow, urinary and fecal N losses, and manure ammonia, methane, and carbon dioxide emissions were unaffected by treatment. Under the current experimental conditions, supplementation of dairy cow diets with 500 g/d of Origanum vulgare did not affect ruminal fermentation, nutrient digestibility, or manure gas emissions. Cow fed OV produced more FCM and had increased feed efficiency that may partially be explained by the decreased ruminal methane production. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2538], "author_name_tesi": "Tekippe, Jessica ", "last_name_ssi": "Tekippe", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jessica", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Garbiella Varga", "Gabriella Anne Varga"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Garbiella Varga, Thesis Advisor", "Gabriella Anne Varga, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["methane", "dairy cows", "rumen"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "The Politics of Public Confession: Expressivism and American Democracy", "id": "7107", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1634", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As a sustained study of the rhetorical assumptions and political consequences of public confession, The Politics of Public Confession: Expressivism and American Democracy engages histories of public confession in order to illuminate the political and rhetorical consequences of our contemporary confessive culture.

I argue that the gradual and relatively recent subsumption of public confession into a logic of expressivism has had deleterious political consequences. In particular, I argue that expressivism is a pernicious rhetorical practice because it naturalizes political actions and thereby allows confessants to elide the claims of justice. Part Two moves from theory to criticism and engages three widely disseminated public confessions. I examine first the 1956 confession in the pages of Look magazine to the murder of Emmett Till. In this chapter I chart the consequences of expressivism on American race relations. Second, I engage the nationally televised 1988 confession of Jimmy Swaggart and argue that Swaggart\u2019s expressivist confession functioned to shut down public debate and helped him evade accountability. Finally, I focus on the widely reported 2004 confessions of former New Jersey Governor James McGreevey and argue that, for McGreevey, expressivism naturalized and depoliticized citizenship. In each case study, I suggest that both rhetoric and democracy are impoverished to the degree that confession is subsumed within a rhetoric of expressivism.

Successful dispersal is dependent on context, especially in heterogeneous landscapes, because individuals can only survive, grow, and reproduce in suitable habitat. Context may be especially important for passively dispersed species, including plants, because individuals cannot \u2018choose\u2019 the habitat in which they settle. The phenotypic plasticity of dispersal traits may be advantageous in these species. However, despite its potential importance, not much is known about the phenotypic plasticity of dispersal traits in plants, or the ecological implications of plastic trait responses. \nHere, I examine the phenotypic plasticity of dispersal traits using both empirical and theoretical approaches. I begin in Chapter 1 by presenting an introduction to phenotypic plasticity and dispersal.  In Chapter 2, I show that dispersal phenotypic plasticity can maintain metapopulation growth rates in heterogeneous environments. This chapter also shows that highly dispersive species that are not phenotypically plastic may be especially vulnerable to population decline in the context of habitat degradation and destruction. In Chapters 3-5, I show that dispersal traits in the invasive thistle Carduus nutans (Asteraceae) plastically respond to drought, herbivore damage, and increases in temperature under experimental conditions. In each of these chapters, I use my empirical data in theoretical models of dispersal or spread to show how observed phenotypic plasticity in individuals can affect population-level outcomes. Finally, in Chapter 6, I shift my focus from plasticity to within-maternal capitulum variation, and show that differences among siblings can contribute to important differences in projections of spatial dynamics. \nMy research shows that phenotypically plastic dispersal traits, and differences between individual seeds from the same mother, can be important factors affecting movement across landscapes. This research thus represents a significant step forward for our ecological understanding of how passively dispersed species move. Since passively dispersed species often form the base of food webs, and may be affected by changes in their environment, this research also contributes to a better understanding of how species might respond to new challenges brought about by climate change.\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10186], "author_name_tesi": "Teller, Brittany J", "last_name_ssi": "Teller", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Brittany", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katriona Shea", "Ottar N Bjornstad", "David A Mortensen", "Andrew George Stephenson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katriona Shea, Dissertation Advisor", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Member", "David A Mortensen, Committee Member", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dispersal", "Population Ecology", "Invasive species", "Demography", "Integrodifference", "Population Spread"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Implications of Food Safety and Quality Standards: Insights from Turkish Tomato Exports", "id": "11620", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2461", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Global trade system is witnessing an unprecedented increase in food safety and quality standards. Changes in the structure of the world trade affect the welfare of farmers and consumers, destinations of exports, and the dynamics behind the exporters\u2019 compliance decisions with these non-tariff barriers to trade. This dissertation consists of three related essays.\n\tIn the first essay, a partial equilibrium model of tomato trade from Turkey to European Union countries is developed to examine the combined effects of quality and safety standards and price-dependent barriers to trade such as minimum import prices for imports. This essay also incorporates the heterogeneous preference structure of consumers in the EU, i.e., consumers are distinguished by their concern over the potential negative effects of their consumption of tomatoes. The results indicate that minimum entry price enforcement has a positive effect on producer welfare in the importing country, and negative effect on consumer welfare in the importing country and producer welfare in the exporting country if applied with non-tariff barriers.\n\tIn the second essay, a Markov Chain Analysis is used to examine changes in the destination markets of the Turkish tomato exports and whether these can be linked to trade standards. A Markov probability transition matrix is estimated and suggests that transition probabilities are higher from high standard to medium and low standard countries. On the other hand, there is almost zero probability of transition from low and medium standard groups to the high standard group in terms of food safety and quality.\n\tIn the third essay, exporters\u2019 decision on whether or not to comply with an importer\u2019s requirements is examined by focusing on a representative Turkish tomato exporter\u2019s decision problem in two different markets in terms of their enforcements of the safety and quality requirements: the EU and Russia. Two dynamic decision models are developed for two different markets. In the EU market, the exporter faces a discrete choice of either complying or non-complying with the existing standards; hence, a discrete model of compliance is used. In the Russian market, the application of standards is such that the exporter can choose the level of compliance, hence, a continuous model of compliance is used. Results suggest that Turkish tomato exporters who focus on EU markets are likely to be more cautious in terms of compliance than the ones who send their produce to the Russian Federation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2444], "author_name_tesi": "Tellioglu, Isin ", "last_name_ssi": "Tellioglu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Isin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Blandford", "David Blandford", "David Gerard Abler", "Edward C Jaenicke", "N Edward Coulson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Blandford, Dissertation Advisor", "David Blandford, Committee Chair", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Edward C Jaenicke, Committee Member", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["partial equilibrium", "Markov", "international trade", "food safety", "minimum import price", "non tariff barriers"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Understanding Heterogeneity in Non-suicidal Self-injury: A Latent Class Approach ", "id": "16402", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8112", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a dangerous and costly behavior that is highly prevalent in both clinical and non-clinical populations.

Participants in the current study were undergraduates who completed a newly constructed, broad-based measure of NSSI history and features, as well as measures of relevant clinical constructs including borderline personality features, trauma history and post-traumatic symptomatology, depression, anxiety, risk-taking, dissociation, affective lability, and affective intensity. Latent class analysis was used to identify subgroups of self-injurers, using a comprehensive set of NSSI features as indicators for the latent classes. This analysis yielded a four-class solution as the best-fitting model, and the classes were compared on the clinical variables. The between-class group analyses suggested that the groups varied significantly in terms of the severity of NSSI characteristics and psychiatric symptoms. These findings were consistent with the existing literature in this area but also highlighted additional characteristics that may distinguish latent subgroups of self-injurers.

There is no perfect solution for this problem and oil spills are a real threat to nature. As an alternative way of combating smaller scale oil spills, Exfoliated Graphite (EG) is being examined. Production temperature of Exfoliated Graphite is effective in the oil capturing capacity and it is covered by results gathered from tests. The higher the exfoliation temperature, the more surface area Exfoliated Graphite gains, so this large surface area makes it possible to capture petroleum products and hold it. To see the capturing efficiency of Exfoliated Graphite, motor oil, gasoline and diesel fuel mixture, Texas crude oil and Pennsylvania crude oil were used in the experiments. Also, the material was tried in fresh water and sea water.\nAdditionally, a product is designed for real life application purposes which consists of Exfoliated Graphite and an envelope made from Spun Polyolefin (PO, cap). Other envelope materials were also used (fiberglass, tulle, ribbon, artificial silk). In addition to the tests that Exfoliated Graphite was tried in, pumps were put in a water tank and surface of water was agitated to see how the product would act in such quiescent and turbulent conditions. These tests consisted of 20 cycles and each cycle consisted of 10 minute dipping, then squeezing, weighing, and again dipping. In an attempt to mimic similar conditions in a quiescent area, such as a harbor, 5-second dripping readings were noted, once the pouch was taken out of the water tank with oil in it, the pouch was left to drip for 5 seconds. These tests with Exfoliated Graphite enveloped in Spun Polyolefin pouches gave 37 g gasoline and diesel fuel mixture (50-50 by volume) / g pouch; 54 g Texas crude oil / g pouch; and 59 g motor oil / g pouch. When these data were further analyzed, individual contributions of Spun Polyolefin and Exfoliated Graphite were calculated. So, for motor oil capturing, 35 g oil / g Spun Polyolefin was achieved and 115 g oil / g Exfoliated Graphite efficiency was attained.\nExperiment data also showed us that when Exfoliated Graphite is enveloped within Spun Polyolefin, the envelope material, Spun Polyolefin, rebounded with 97% of its first-cycle oil retention capacity, while the Exfoliated Graphite rebounded with 65% of its first-cycle oil retention capacity in motor oil capturing tests.\nBy the end of 20 cycles of motor oil loading and squeezing, the caps had captured 1,105 g oil in total and pouches had captured 1,698 g oil in total giving 395 g oil / g PO and 606 g oil / g EG+PO efficiency values, respectively. For 50-50 by volume gasoline and diesel fuel mixture tests, 875 g oil was captured by EG+PO pouches at the end of 20 cycles (364 g oil / g EG+PO) and 622 g oil was captured by PO alone (259 g oil / g PO). In the Texas crude oil tests, the pouch removed 1105 g crude oil (790 g oil / g EG+PO) and PO removed 1,131 g crude oil (808 g oil / g PO) after 20 cycles of 5-second dripping readings.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9687], "author_name_tesi": "Temiz, Fatih ", "last_name_ssi": "Temiz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fatih", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fred Scott Cannon, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["exfoliated graphite", "spun polyolefin", "oil spill clean up"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Teacher and the Anti-Bullying Policy: Teachers' Attitudes and Beliefs Toward Bullying\n", "id": "10029", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1691", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This paper employs mixed-methods to explore teachers\u2019 attitudes towards and definitions of bullying in a district with a comprehensive anti-bullying policy.

This dissertation aimed to (1) utilize latent class analysis to aggregate self-, teacher-, and peer-reported aggression and victimization into statistically derived and validated classifications of aggressors and victims; and (2) explore friendship dynamics among both LCA and cut-score identified aggressors and victims to test existing theory regarding friendship relations and aggression and victimization with an early elementary school population and expand theory to those who are both aggressive and are victimized.\n\nData were from 538 youth from 28 third- and fifth-grade classrooms in a highly urban state and a more rural state, assessed at three time-points over the course of a school year: early (September/October), winter (January/February) and spring (May/June).\n Latent class analyses revealed a five-class solution for aggression and victimization, with expected classes for uninvolved, aggressors, victims, and aggressive victims and an additional class for moderate aggressors. The LCA successfully aggregated the only moderately concordant data for self-ratings and peer-nominations into a valid aggregated class. The moderately aggressive class had moderate levels of all behaviors and contained more girls and more individuals from the more urban state.  Reasons for this finding are explored.\n\nModels testing friendship relations with aggression and victimization were mixed and often inconsistent with previous findings and sometimes inconsistent between LCA and cut-score identified classes. Having non-victimized friends was protective against victimization only for cut-score identified victims during the period between the early and winter assessments. Friendship was strongly protective for aggressive victims. Having victimized friends or aggressive friends did not increase risk for becoming victimized or engaging in aggression behavior. Being victimized and being aggressive both reduced numbers of incoming friendship ties.  Reasons for differences between these findings with younger youth and previous findings with older youth, differences between cut-score and LCA identified classes, and differences between earlier and later waves are all explored.\n\nOverall, this dissertation demonstrates the need to closely consider how aggressors and victims are identified and the need to expand research to test existing theories on friendship, aggression, and victimization on younger children and on those who are both aggressive and are victimized. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7430], "author_name_tesi": "Temkin, Deborah A", "last_name_ssi": "Temkin", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Deborah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott David Gest", "Scott David Gest", "Dana Lynn Mitra", "Mark T Greenberg", "Meg Leavy Small", "D Wayne Osgood"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott David Gest, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott David Gest, Committee Chair", "Dana Lynn Mitra, Committee Member", "Mark T Greenberg, Committee Member", "Meg Leavy Small, Committee Member", "D Wayne Osgood, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aggression", "victimization", "LCA", "friendship", "bullying"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FRIENDSHIP DYNAMICS AND VICTIMIZATION: TESTING THREE HYPOTHESES USING ACTOR-ORIENTED NETWORKING MODELS\n\n", "id": "10596", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13236", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Peer victimization among early adolescents is pervasive and detrimental to both concurrent and future social and emotional functioning. As part of youth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s social world, it is important to consider how friendship both affects and is affected by victimization. Three main hypotheses emerge from the literature regarding friendship dynamics and victimization. The Friendship Protection Hypothesis asserts that having friends protects individuals from victimization (Boulton et al., 1999; Malcolm et al., 2006). At the same time, the Self Preservation Hypothesis proposes that victimized youth lose friendships with non-victimized youth and that having a victimized friend puts individuals at risk for future victimization (Ellis & Zabartany, 2007; Pellegrini et al., 1999). Finally, the Common Predictor Hypothesis suggests that both victimization and lack of friends are predicted by low self-worth (Bollmer et al., 2005; Bukowski & Sippola, 2001; Crick & Ladd, 1993; Hodges et al., 1999).

This paper uses the actor-oriented networking modeling software, SIENA, to test these hypotheses in a single model while controlling for exogenous social network forces that influence friendship formation, and finds that components of all three hypotheses contribute to the dynamics between friendship and victimization.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12783], "author_name_tesi": "Temkin, Deborah A", "last_name_ssi": "Temkin", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Deborah", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott D.

EBV is transmitted between human hosts in saliva, and must cross the oral mucosal epithelium before infecting B lymphocytes where it establishes a life-long infection. While there are numerous model systems to study infection of B cells in vitro, our knowledge of infection of epithelial cells is limited due to the inability to readily infect epithelial cells in vitro or generate cell lines from EBV-infected epithelial tumors. Because epithelium exists in vivo as a stratified tissue, organotypic 'raft' cultures may serve as a better model for EBV in epithelial tissue than monolayer cultures. Using the raft culture system, we were able to study EBV infection and replication in stratified epithelium for the first time. Here, we demonstrate that EBV readily infects stratified epithelium, with infection limited to the non-replicating, terminally differentiating cells. Infection resulted in the spontaneous expression of lytic cycle proteins, amplification of the viral genome, and production of infectious viral particles. These de novo synthesized viral particles infected the adjacent epithelial cells, forming large foci of infection and generating the first multicycle growth curve for EBV. Blocking lytic replication inhibited dissemination of the virus. Although infected cells did express latency-associated proteins while concurrently expressing lytic proteins, a population of cells which exclusively expressed the latency-associated proteins could not be identified. Furthermore, infection did not induce cellular proliferation as it does in B cells, but resulted in cytopathic effects more commonly associated with productive viral replication. This is the first in vitro system in which infected cells bypass latency and immediately undergo productive replication. These data suggest infection of epithelial cells is an integral part of the viral lifecycle, which does not typically result in the immortalization or enhanced growth of the infected epithelial cells, but instead results in the production of high quantities of infectious viral particles.\nDespite the high prevalence of EBV in the human population, we still do not know the primary site of infection or where the virus replicates for dissemination to a new host. However, our observation that EBV infection in raft cultures results in high levels of virus production suggests the oral epithelium would be an ideal site to amplify virus during primary infection and again during viral egress. To refine our understanding of the role of epithelium in the EBV lifecycle, we investigated how infection can be initiated in stratified epithelium and assessed the tropism of virus produced by raft cultures. Stratified epithelium could only be infected through the apical surface, and not from the basal surface. In fact, basal epithelial cells consistently appeared to be refractory to infection. Consistent with previous observations, we determined that the cellular source of the virus strongly influenced viral tropism. The virus produced by stratified epithelium was highly infectious for B cells, but not for epithelial tissue. Instead, infection was most readily initiated in the raft cultures by virus-producing B cells or slightly less efficiently with B-cell-derived cell-free virus. Infection with epithelial-derived virus could be enhanced if the virus was pre-incubated with an anti-gp350 antibody or transferred by virus-producing epithelial cells. These data have practical implications for vaccine development, suggesting the vaccine-mediated immune response should target the oral epithelium rather than the peripheral B cells to successfully prevent infection.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10112], "author_name_tesi": "Temple, Rachel Mary", "last_name_ssi": "Temple", "middle_name_ssi": "Mary", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clare E Sample", "Clare E Sample", "Craig Matthew Meyers", "Todd Schell", "Jeffery Thomas Sample", "Laura Carrel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clare E Sample, Dissertation Advisor", "Clare E Sample, Committee Chair", "Craig Matthew Meyers, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "Jeffery Thomas Sample, Committee Member", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["organotypic raft culture", "stratified epithelium", "Epstein-Barr virus", "lytic replication"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Reciprocal Regulation of Epstein-barr virus Ebna1 Expression During Viral Persistance\n", "id": "27413", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10968", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latency I promoter Qp is regulated both positively and negatively through protein-binding sites surrounding the transcription start site.

Second, we asked if the activation of Qp via the positive regulatory element QRE-2 is essential for Qp activity in the context of the EBV genome and for the establishment of latency. Using recombinant viruses, we found that, unlike in reporter-based assays, high expression of EBNA1 regulates Qp activity in latently infected cells transcriptionally rather than post-transcriptionally. Also, the positive regulatory element QRE-2 is necessary to support latency I but not the latency III program of EBV gene expression necessary for B cell immortalization.

In the wreckage left behind by the collapse, American writers, especially those involved in reform movements, struggled to reaffirm faith in the rationality and comprehensibility of the credit-based market and the possibilities for individual self-possession and permanent value. This dissertation explores four such recuperative sites of fantasy that were prevalent in the literature of the post-Panic years: the home, the spirit-world, the temperance meeting, and the post-1848 West.  While these discourses attempted to serve as reassurances for the possibilities of success amidst widespread failure, this project analyzes the ways in which for many authors affected by the Panic, working within these very discourses, this fantasy of recuperation was bound to end in failure.  From this failure, however, emerge ways of living and relating to others that run against the grain or question the desirability of the values associated with economic success.

The idea behind the MC3 method is to approximate an unknown density with a discrete distribution that has a finite number of support points. From a modeling perspective, MC3 represents a finite mixture model where the mixture components are equally weighted. An efficient slice sampling algorithm is provided to implement the MC3 method. Simulation results show that these two methods produce comparable predictive densities. Differences between the DPM and MC3 from modeling and computation aspects are discussed.

The density that reproduces the observed option price is called the risk-neutral or state price density and is used for a variety of important activities in finance, including providing an arbitrage-free tool for pricing complex and less liquid securities. The importance of understanding this density with respect to asset pricing and risk management has led to a competing number of approaches for making inference about the state price density. Unlike the option prices, Greeks can not be observed in the market and have to be calculated. As Greeks are important for measuring and managing risk as well as executing dynamic trading strategies, developing methods to calculate them efficiently and accurately is of critical importance both in theory and in practice (Broadie and Glasserman, 1996).\n\n\nWe start by proposing a finite-dimensional model for the state price density in a Bayesian framework. This modeling approach can be viewed as a Bayesian Quadrature model, where the locations and weights of support points in the finite-dimensional representation of the risk-neutral density are random variables.  This modeling approach allows a 'prior' reference distribution which can be a parametric distribution (e.g. the lognormal density) or which can be uniform and completely non-informative, and it also provides a posterior distribution of the state price density that is consistent with the observed option prices.  We asses the performance of the proposed model using simulation studies based on synthetic data and then by contrasting the method with a number of competing methods using S&P 500 index option data.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to European options, American options can be exercised anytime prior to maturity. We show how our Bayesian Quadrature approach can be extended to make inference for American options. To tackle this problem, we propose a Bayesian implied random tree model as an extension of the Bayesian Quadrature approach by building a unique binomial tree similar to Rubinstein (1994). The benefits of our approach are demonstrated via simulation study and empirical studies using S&P 100 index option data.\n\n\n\nAlthough finite-difference methods are commonly used to calculate Greeks, these estimates can often be biased and suffer from erratic behavior when the payoff function is discontinuous. We provide new and simple mathematical formulas that overcome these problems and that are applicable to a wide range of complicated options and underlying processes. Moreover, we provide an innovative Bayesian approach to calculate Greeks using observed option prices without any parametric assumptions on the underlying process, so that the proposed method avoids the model misspecification problem.

Currently, habitat loss is the leading factor contributing to global biodiversity loss. Noise created by human activities is nearly ubiquitous in terrestrial and marine systems, and causes acoustic habitat loss by interfering with species\u2019 abilities to freely send and receive critical acoustic biological information. My dissertation investigates how novel sounds from human activities affect ecological and evolutionary processes in space and time in marine and terrestrial systems, and how species may cope with this emerging novel pressure.\n\tUsing species from both marine and terrestrial systems, I present results from a theoretical investigation, and four acoustic playback experiments combining laboratory studies and field trials, that reveal a range of eco-evolutionary consequences of noise-induced acoustic habitat loss. First, I use sound propagation modeling to assess how marine shipping noise reduces communication space between mother-calf pairs of North Atlantic right whales (Eubalaena glacialis), an important unit of an endangered species. I show that shipping noise poses significant challenges for mother-calf pairs, but that vocal compensation strategies can substantially improve communication space. Next, in a series of acoustic playback experiments I show that road traffic noise impairs breeding migration behavior and physiology of wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus). This work reveals the first evidence that traffic noise elicits a physiological stress response and suppresses production of antimicrobial peptides (a component of the innate immune response) in anurans.  Further, wood frogs from populations with a history of inhabiting noisy sites mounted reduced physiological stress responses to continuous traffic noise exposure. This research using wood frogs suggests that chronic traffic noise exposure has negative physiological consequences, and that populations have adapted over short time-scales to minimize the detrimental impacts of this novel pressure. Finally, I present results from a field acoustic playback experiment that show that noise from the invasive Cuban treefrog (Osteopilus septentrionalis) differentially affects the vocal behavior of native anurans, with those with more similar calls being disproportionally more affected. Green treefrogs (Hyla cinerea) shortened their calls, called louder, and maintained call spacing (e.g. continued actively calling) during noise stimuli whereas pine woods treefrogs (H. femoralis) did not modify vocal behavior in response to any noise stimuli.\n\tCollectively, the results of these investigations (1) provide insight into the extent of noise-induced acoustic habitat loss in space and time, (2) reveal fitness-relevant individual- and population-level consequences of this form of habitat loss, and (3) show resiliency within ecological systems through the individual- and population-level responses to this novel pressure over short time-scales.  These findings advance the field by illustrating how the spatiotemporal extent of anthropogenic noise impacts important ecological processes, and by demonstrating the resiliency of some species in responding rapidly to novel pressures.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10680], "author_name_tesi": "Tennessen, Jennifer Beissinger", "last_name_ssi": "Tennessen", "middle_name_ssi": "Beissinger", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Tracy Lee Langkilde", "Eric S Post", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "Michael John Sheriff", "Susan Parks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Tracy Lee Langkilde, Dissertation Advisor", "Tracy Lee Langkilde, Committee Chair", "Eric S Post, Committee Member", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Member", "Michael John Sheriff, Committee Member", "Susan Parks, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Noise", "habitat loss", "competition", "stress", "corticosterone", "masking", "North Atlantic right whale", "Cuban treefrog", "wood frog"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Bitter: Understanding how Protein, Lipids, and Oil-in-water Emulsions Influence Perception", "id": "28798", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12372", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Drugs often have a bitter taste which can be unpleasant and aversive. The risk is greatest for pediatric patients who are more sensitive to bitter yet require liquid drug delivery systems. Removal of the bioactive ingredients that are the source of the bitter taste would cause loss of biological function of the medication. Suppression of the bitter taste has therefore become a goal of medication development. For pediatric formulations this currently involves the use of sweeteners and flavors to mask bitterness. This approach is not fully effective in suppressing bitterness, and the large amounts of sugar may be nutritionally undesirable. Additionally, foods with added phytochemicals are also rather bitter, and development of more palatable functional foods has been a challenge. One under-utilized approach to flavor masking is encapsulation\u2014using physical means to prevent interaction between the tastant and receptor. \n\nIt has been asserted in the literature that tastants must diffuse through the aqueous saliva to be perceived, and thus, the freely available aqueous phase will determine bitterness perception. Utilizing the characteristics of ingredients such as protein binding behavior and lipid phase volume would prevent bitterant interaction with taste receptors and, theoretically, prevent perception. The majority of published studies regarding bitterness-masking have been limited by their focus on single bitter compounds in poorly defined food matrices, and by a lack of either adequate analytical measurements or adequate sensory measurements. Addressing those weaknesses, the goal of this study is to investigate (i) the binding and partitioning of bitterants (quinine and caffeine) by whey protein isolate (WPI) and lipids respectively and (ii) the suppression of bitterness by proteins and o/w emulsions. I hypothesize that the degree of binding will differ for quinine and caffeine and that the perceived bitterness will depend on the unbound, aqueous concentration rather than total bitterant concentration. \n\nProtein binding was assessed for a WPI solution of either caffeine or quinine followed by filtration and collection of supernatant. Partitioning (Log Kow) was measured for caffeine and quinine using vegetable oil and water in a shake flask method. Bitterant concentration was measured by HPLC. Consumer sensory tests (n\u2265100) were used to measure scaled sample bitterness.\n\nThe first study investigated the effect of protein binding on bitterness of caffeine and quinine. WPI binding curves (0-4.5%) were established for both bitterants. Caffeine was largely unaffected by the presence of WPI while quinine was mostly bound. A sensory test was conducted for WPI at 0% and 1% with three levels of caffeine (1.8, 5.7, 18 mM) and quinine (0.056, 0.10, 0.18 mM). There was no significant effect from the WPI on caffeine bitterness, but WPI did decrease the bitterness of quinine with significant differences at the low and medium bitterant levels. This is consistent with the hypothesis that higher binding results in lower bitterness, but the magnitude of bitterness reduction was not large. Additionally, the aqueous concentration does not seem to determine the bitterness perception indicating that something else is happening in the mouth that was previously not taken into account. Mucin, a salivary protein, was investigated as an explanation for this discrepancy as a possible competitive binding protein. Binding curves were constructed just as with the WPI testing for caffeine and quinine, and the results were similar to the WPI on a per unit mass of protein basis. This indicates that mucin does not have an unusually high affinity to quinine, but the interaction suggests the oral environment may somehow change the distribution of the bitterant.\n\nThe second study investigated the effect of oil partitioning on bitterness of caffeine and quinine through an o/w emulsion. Caffeine and quinine had Log Kow values of -1.32 and 2.97 respectively, establishing quinine as a hydrophobic bitterant.  Fat was assessed in an o/w emulsion with WPI (at a constant 0.125%) as the emulsifier. An increase in fat from 0.5% to 2% had no effect on the perceived bitterness of caffeine (18 mM) and caused a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in bitterness perception of quinine (0.1 mM). The emulsion sensory results correlate with aqueous concentration of bitterant in the formulations, though the bitterness decrease was modest. The complete phase separation of saliva and oil in the emulsion may be why the aqueous concentration in this test was indicative of bitterness perception as opposed to the protein test. However, the modest suppression indicates that this solution may have to be used with other suppression techniques for practical success.\n\nIn conclusion, partitioning of bitter compounds by oil reduces the perceived bitterness at a level indicative of aqueous concentration decreases, but protein binding does not. This finding has implications for the formulations of oral pediatric medications and foods enhanced with phytochemicals. More research needs to be completed in order to determine how saliva influences the system once in the mouth and more accurately defines the binding interactions. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11745], "author_name_tesi": "Tenney, Kelsey Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Tenney", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Kelsey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Neil Coupland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Neil Coupland, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sensory", "bitter", "food science", "emulsion", "partitioning", "protein binding", "caffeine", "quinine"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Secure Acquisition of Digital Evidence from VMware ESXi Hypervisors", "id": "24944", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11183", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The use of computer virtualization technologies has rapidly grown since the early 2000\u2019s.

Technology in the form of improved seed varieties, chemical inputs, and mechanization all serve to mitigate to varying degrees the deleterious effects of climate-induced stress on crops. In the U.S. this 'technology signal' is evident in the most widely grown cereal crops, particularly corn (Zea mays), where yields have increased by two bushels per year on average since 1950. Despite the overall increasing yield trend, crops are still vulnerable to climatic variability and extreme events such as drought and heat stress, which will reduce yields below the expected amount. The response of crops to an increase in these extreme events is uncertain because of the co-mingling effects of technology and climate that is manifest in the observed yield trend. In addition, while there is high confidence that mean temperatures will increase in response to rising greenhouse gasses, our limited knowledge and imperfect ability to model the climate system results in large uncertainties about how the more agriculturally-relevant tails of the temperature distribution will change. This dissertation develops probabilistic projections of the potential effects of anthropogenic climate change on corn yields. Three research objectives are developed that improve our understanding of the climate change-yield relationship: (1) identify and evaluate the portions of the temperature distribution that drive yield variability notwithstanding the technological signal, (2) develop projections of how these agro-climate variables could change in the future while accounting for uncertainty, and (3) develop projections of the expected effects on crop yields given these changes in the agro-climate. These objectives are addressed in three research articles. The first article is an evaluation of recent changes in three agro-climate indices (frost days, thermal time, and heat stress index) in North America and the ability of general circulation models (GCMs) to reproduce the observed patterns and trends. The next article uses bootstrapping and a statistical method known as Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to develop probabilistic projections of the three agro-climate indices. The method accounts for important structural uncertainties between climate models that are often neglected or minimized in many impact studies. The final article uses the bootstrapping and BMA methods described in the second article, as well as an empirical climate-yield damage function, to develop probabilistic projections of corn yields in the 21st century in the eastern U.S. for a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario. Two different sources of uncertainty in the projections are quantified: structural uncertainty between GCMs, and parametric uncertainty in the damage function due to spatial dependence between observations. The results show that severe corn yield damages are possible by the end of the 21st century if the current emissions trajectory is maintained over the entire interval. After accounting for both GCM and damage function uncertainty, the full 95% projection interval shows potential yield declines of between 16% and 77% by 2100, relative to current average yields. These results suggest that substantial adaptation and mitigation will have to occur if the concomitant impacts on global food security are to be avoided without also causing further environmental degradation.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7069], "author_name_tesi": "Terando, Adam James", "last_name_ssi": "Terando", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Ewart Easterling Iii", "Petra Tschakert", "Denice Heller Wardrop", "Klaus Keller"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Ewart Easterling Iii, Dissertation Advisor", "Petra Tschakert, Committee Member", "Denice Heller Wardrop, Committee Member", "Klaus Keller, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["climate change", "crop yields", "agro-climate indices", "uncertainty"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "SCLABLE HYBRID SPARSE LINEAR SOLVERS", "id": "6438", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3607", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-08-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In many large-scale simulations that depend on parallel processing to solve problems of scientific interest, the application time can be dominated by the time for the underlying sparse linear system solution.  This thesis concerns the development of effective sparse solvers for distributed memory multiprocessors using a hybrid of direct and iterative sparse solution methods. More specifically, we accelerate the convergence of an iterative solution method, namely the \nmethod of Conjugate Gradients (CG) using an incomplete Cholesky preconditioner.\nThe latter is an approximation to the sparse matrix factor used in a direct method. Our parallel incomplete factorization scheme can support a range of fill-in to provide flexible preconditioning that can meet the requirements\nof a variety of applications. We have also developed special techniques that allow the effective application of such preconditioners on distributed memory multiprocessors; the relatively large latencies of interprocessor communication on such parallel computers make conventional schemes\nusing parallel substitution extremely inefficient.\n                                                                                \nThe first part of the dissertation focuses on the design of a parallel tree-based left-looking  drop-threshold incomplete Cholesky factorization scheme using extensions of techniques from direct methods.

Meanwhile, young people who do reside in rural places struggle to negotiate the parts of their identity that are connected to place and their gender, race, and sexuality, which can often seem at odds with the norms of their community.  Sociologists have shown that these societal patterns help create and reinforce economic, educational, and class-based inequalities among rural and urban places.  Feminist theorists have developed the concept of intersectionality to better understand how the multiple identities that people embody can obscure the ways gender, race, sexuality, class, and other forms of identity contribute to inequalities. In my dissertation, I apply an intersectional approach to the experiences of young, college-educated people in rural places to understand if and how they are able to reconcile their identities in order to create a sense of belonging and how this affects their physical and social mobility and participation in their communities. I argue that sexism, racism, and heterosexism alienate young people from communities but that negotiating the intersections of identity creates space for belonging and engagement between young people and place.\n\tI use a theoretical framework based in both sociological understandings of education, mobility, and community and feminist understandings of identity and power to ask three research questions: 1. In what ways do young people negotiate a sense of belonging in rural places through the intersection of their identity and place? 2. How are these experiences of identity and belonging relevant to young people\u2019s mobility? 3. In the context of belonging and mobility, how are young people oriented toward rural places and communities? In order to answer these questions, I used a combination of qualitative data in the form of focus groups and semi-structured interviews with current college students and recent college graduates living in West Virginia as well as quantitative migration data from the American Community Survey. I also apply an intersectional approach to the methodology of this project in order to \u201ccenter\u201d the experiences of marginalized people and to circumvent the \u201cinsider/outsider\u201d dichotomy present in much of the literature about the relationships of people to place. In all, I conducted seven focus groups with a total of 65 current college students active in student groups among three universities in West Virginia and 27 individual interviews with college graduates under age 40 living in the state.\n\tI divide the dissertation findings into three chapters. The first two chapters are an analysis of the intersectional experiences of young adults across gender, race, sexuality, class, and place. In the third chapter, I apply this intersectional analysis specifically to the tensions between mobility and community for young people in rural communities. In the first findings chapter, I analyze qualitative data from the focus groups and interviews to examine the ways youth negotiate multiple aspects of their identity in order to find a sense of belonging. The analysis from this chapter yields evidence of a \u201cdialectic of belonging\u201d and confirms that many young people do feel alienated toward place through sexism, racism, and homophobia, but also that the intersection of place and identity can be an avenue to belonging for young men and women, youth of color, and LGBT youth. In the second findings chapter, I analyze these qualitative data in the context of class. The prominence of class as a relevant identity for college-educated youth was an unanticipated finding, and I show that intersections of gender, race, and sexuality with class and place can lead to reconstructions of identity and alliances across class. In the third findings chapter, I use a combination of quantitative and qualitative data to examine the physical and social mobility of young people as well as the roles that college-educated youth take on as community leaders despite their high mobility. This final chapter places the experiences of the young adults in my sample in the broader context of rural youth out-migration and community sustainability. \n\tThe title of my dissertation refers to \u201chillbilly women, Affrilachians, and queer mountaineers,\u201d all of which are terms that reappropriate and reconcile the sometimes mutually exclusive identities of gender, race, sexuality, class, and place. The dissertation findings reveal the extent to which these intersectional identities are accessible and the way these intersections impact the role of young people in rural communities. This research contributes important information about the struggles and perseverance of young people in marginalized places who have the potential to help create a more sustainable and just future. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9936], "author_name_tesi": "Terman, Anna Rachel", "last_name_ssi": "Terman", "middle_name_ssi": "Rachel", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs", "Diane Krantz Mclaughlin", "Kai Arthur Schafft", "Ann Rachel Tickamyer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carolyn Elizabeth Sachs, Dissertation Advisor", "Diane Krantz Mclaughlin, Committee Member", "Kai Arthur Schafft, Committee Member", "Ann Rachel Tickamyer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Appalachia", "intersectionality", "rural sociology", "women's studies", "youth", "community", "belonging", "class", "mobility"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "UNDERSTANDING 911 DISPATCH TEAMS ACROSS CONTEXT: IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND PRACTICE", "id": "6988", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2449", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The research plan presented in this study sought to assess and evaluate the decision making procedures, communication activities, and human-computer interactions that facilitate teamwork in 911 dispatch teams.  Due to the variability in emergency allocation procedures among 911 dispatch teams across differing contexts, dispatch groups located within two diverse geographical and demographical contexts were evaluated.  Data from in situ observations and cognitive task analyses with 911 dispatchers was analyzed according to the principles and implications of three extant theories of teamwork: distributed cognition, transactive memory, and Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) making.  Each theory was evaluated to determine its applications and shortcomings to the characteristics of 911 dispatch group contexts. Additionally, the current research evaluated the application of information technology to support teamwork, team decision making, and the formation of team mental models in 911 dispatch teams within the various contexts of the dispatch teams. The results suggest that geographical and demographical context can affect the nature of teamwork in regards to team decision making procedures, communications, utilization of information technology, and formation of team mental models.  The results also revealed fifteen key characteristics or attributes of 911 dispatch teams concerning team decision making, communication, and utilization of information technology.  Application of extant theory to the attributes of 911 dispatch teams suggests that distributed cognition theory is more applicable to the study of 911 dispatch teams than transactive memory theory and RPD. Transactive memory was found to be more applicable to the study of 911 dispatch teams than RPD.

Due to their prevalence and long lifetimes, these diminutive stars play an outsize role in several fields of astronomical study. In particular, it is now known that they commonly host planetary systems, and may be the most common hosts of Earth-size, rocky planets in the habitable zone. A comprehensive understanding of M dwarfs is crucial for understanding the origins and conditions of their planetary systems, including their potential habitability. Such an understanding depends on methods for precisely and accurately measuring their properties. These tools have broader applicability as well, underlying the use of M dwarfs as fossils of Galactic evolution, and helping to constrain the structures and interiors of these stars.\n\nThe measurement of the fundamental parameters of M dwarfs is encumbered by their spectral complexity. Unlike stars of spectral type F, G, or K that are similar to our G type Sun, whose spectra are dominated by continuum emission and atomic features, the cool atmospheres of M dwarfs are dominated by complex molecular absorption. Another challenge for studies of M dwarfs is that these stars are optically faint, emitting much of their radiation in the near-infrared (NIR). The availability and performance of NIR spectrographs have lagged behind those of optical spectrographs due to the challenges of producing low-noise, high-sensitivity NIR detector arrays, which have only recently become available.\n\nThis thesis discusses two related lines of work that address these challenges, motivated by the development of the Habitable Zone Planet Finder (HPF), a NIR radial velocity (RV) spectrograph under development at Penn State that will search for and confirm planets around nearby M dwarfs. This work includes the development and application of new NIR spectroscopic techniques for characterizing M dwarfs, and the development and optimization of new NIR instrumentation for HPF.\n\nThe first line of work is centered on a large NIR spectroscopic survey of nearby M dwarfs, undertaken to characterize potential targets for HPF. This survey, and new techniques for measuring M dwarf metallicity, are the subject of Chapter 2. These data will provide crucial information to assess planetary composition, and the stellar metallicities will help us understand the process of planet formation around M dwarfs. These techniques have also enabled strong tests of low-mass stellar models in the benchmark eclipsing binary system CM Draconis, and have helped identify potential directions for improvement in the models, as presented in Chapter 3. The development of new spectroscopic indices for measuring M dwarf luminosity, radius, and potentially \u03b1-element abundance is discussed in Chapter 4. Finally, Chapter 5 presents a synthesis of these M dwarf characterization techniques and radial velocity (RV) measurements from the SDSS-III APOGEE spectrograph, which we applied to confirm and characterize the first M dwarfs in the nearby Coma Berenices cluster.\n\nThe second line of work relates to the optimization of HPF. By targeting M dwarfs, HPF will take advantage of the large signal induced by an Earth-mass planet orbiting an M dwarf compared to the same planet orbiting an FGK star. Chapter 6 discusses a number of design trades and parameter optimizations undertaken in order to ensure the best sensitivity to Earth-mass planets. These subtopics include the optimization of the HPF resolution, bandpass, operating temperature, and vacuum phase holographic cross-disperser, as well as prediction of anticipated HPF performance, and the development of an HPF software simulator tool.\n\nIn carrying out NIR detector tests for HPF, we have also tested an optical filter that selectively blocks long-wavelength thermal background radiation. This type of contamination is a perennial source of noise for NIR instruments, and typically forces these instruments to operate fully cryogenically. The complexity and cost of this approach may be avoided: for instruments operating in the H-band or bluer, the thermal background can be optically filtered, freeing the instrument to operate at warmer temperatures. Chapter 7 details our characterization and application of an interference filter that effectively blocks thermal background when used with a 1.7\u03bcm-cutoff HAWAII-2RG NIR detector array. By effectively filtering the thermal background with a single coated optic, this filter offers the potential for simple, cost-effective, warm-pupil NIR astronomical instruments, which can take advantage of the increasing availability of low-noise, high-efficiency NIR detectors.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11436], "author_name_tesi": "Terrien, Ryan Carl", "last_name_ssi": "Terrien", "middle_name_ssi": "Carl", "first_name_ssi": "Ryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suvrath Mahadevan", "James Kasting", "Lawrence William Ramsey", "Abraham David Falcone", "Jason Thomas Wright"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suvrath Mahadevan, Dissertation Advisor", "James Kasting, Committee Member", "Lawrence William Ramsey, Committee Member", "Abraham David Falcone, Committee Member", "Jason Thomas Wright, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["astronomy", "m dwarfs", "near-infrared spectroscopy", "stellar abundances", "radial velocity", "exoplanets"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Carryover on Electricity Production and Cellulose Degradation in Microbial Fuel Cells\n", "id": "8812", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2577", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Due to environmental concerns associated with fossil fuel mitigation and political volatility of oil-producing countries, and more recently with the advent of rising fuel costs, biomass energy sources have become of great interest.  One of the newest ways in which to harness the energy in biomass is through the use of a microbial fuel cell (MFC).  MFCs are a new technology with promising application in the field of wastewater treatment amongst many others.  MFC research has focused primarily on the treatment of easily degradable soluble carbon sources, but biomass is known for its recalcitrance, and MFC treatment of particulate substrates should be explored more in depth for the best method of treatment.\nIn previous testing of cellulose conversion to electricity in an MFC, hydrolytic and fermentative bacteria have been found to predominately reside near the suspended cellulose that they are degrading, and not on the anode of the MFC.  Therefore, one of the methods to keep those organisms within a batch-fed system would be to carry over some of the substrate from the previous cycle into the next.  In this study, air-cathode single-chamber bottle MFCs were used to evaluate the ability of both sludge and binary (Geobacter sulfurreducens and Clostridium cellulolyticum) inocula to degrade cellulose, remove COD, and generate power, comparing for each inoculum a system that had carryover from the previous cycle and a system with no carryover.\nThe sludge-inoculated MFCs proved to be superior in the generation of maximum power (41.4 mW/m2 and 39.0 mW/m2 without and with carryover, respectively) to the binary-inoculated MFCs (19.4 mW/m2 and 13.7 mW/m2 without and with carryover, respectively). Higher transient values were seen in the earlier cycles (62 mW/m2 and 44 mW/m2 for sludge-inoculated MFCs without and with carryover, respectively and 28 mW/m2 and 19 mW/m2 for binary MFCs without and with carryover, respectively), but the performance generally appeared to be more stable at the later cycles.  Gas composition for the sludge MFCs was monitored and methane was discovered in the headspace of only the system with carryover.  For both inocula, the MFCs with carryover demonstrated the highest removal of cellulose (95% for the sludge-inoculated MFC and 90% for the binary MFC).  Although carryover did promote higher fermentation rates, this operational strategy also created a system with acidity issues, needing the pH adjusted almost every other day to obtain pH > 6.  The highest coulombic efficiency (CE) was observed in the binary MFC with no carryover (11.4%).  The rest of the MFCs had CEs of ~ 3%.  Acetate was found in abundance in the binary MFC with carryover both before (1.7 mM) and after (10.1 mM) the analyzed run, but not in any other MFCs.  This residual acetate concentration suggests that the G. sulfurreducens population was not able to keep up with the fermenters.  Real-time PCR with samples from the binary reactors showed that carryover was effective at retaining many more fermentative organisms than the MFC without carryover, showing an accumulation over time of these fermenters in the binary MFC with carryover.  Although there appeared to be a trade-off between power density and cellulose conversion in the binary reactors, this trend was less evident in the sludge-inoculated reactors.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2557], "author_name_tesi": "Terrill, Jennine Barbara", "last_name_ssi": "Terrill", "middle_name_ssi": "Barbara", "first_name_ssi": "Jennine", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Michael Regan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cellulose", "Microbial Fuel Cell", "Bioenergy", "MFC"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Storytelling and Reflexivity on Team Mental Models and Performance in Distributed Decision-Making Teams\n", "id": "11812", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5271", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the increasing number of virtual teams in the workforce, it is imperative to determine how to facilitate their performance (Cascio & Aguinis, 2008; Martins, Gilson, & Maynard, 2004).

Although trauma and clinical PTSD literatures are replete with references concerning the potential impact that traumatic and/or uncontrollable stressor(s) may have on cognitive schemata and their role in negative posttraumatic adjustment, little empirical research exists that delineates potentially important differences in the nature and quality of core belief systems for which both trauma and PTSD history are controlled.  \n\tUnique aspects of the present study include: 1) the inclusion of two domains of core belief measures (i.e., early maladaptive schemas via the Schema Questionnaire as proposed by Young (1994) and the three basic personal belief systems as measured by the World Assumptions Scale (WAS) that have been posited by Janoff-Bulman (1985) as centrally related to traumatization experiences; 2) the examination of these broad ranging core belief systems in relation to other factors that have been found or proposed to be significantly related to PTSD development and/or maintenance, including aspects of the traumatic event(s), dissociation, and related areas of clinical symptomatology; and 3) the use of four specific study groups that controlled for both level of traumatization and PTSD symptomatology (no trauma; trauma without past or current PTSD; PTSD in remission; and PTSD current) to enhance conclusions regarding the most potent predictors of PTSD symptomatology by analyzing these factors simultaneously across progressive (i.e., continuous) levels of PTSD symptomatology, as well as between the discrete diagnostic groups.  \n\tThree main overarching hypotheses were generated in this study, and related to: 1) the detection of general between-group differences between the four study groups on important indices of PTSD se verity, core beliefs, and measures of clinical symptomatology; 2) specific core beliefs that would predict PTSD symptomatology to a equal or greater extent than other important factors that have been related to posttraumatic adjustment, irrespective of depression status; and 3) cognitive specificity of core belief systems between major domains of clinical symptomatology (i.e., anxiety and depression) as well as within specific clinical domains (i.e., within types of anxiety).  \n\tThe results largely supported these hypotheses, where specific subtypes of core beliefs were strongly associated with posttraumatic outcome.  In particular, the core belief of vulnerability demonstrated a highly consistent relationship with PTSD severity, as well as all domains of anxiety assessed within the study (i.e., state anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and worry).  This finding is consistent with Beck\u2019s (1967) hypothesis that vulnerability schemata underlie the anxiety disorders. Furthermore, evidence was found both for the specificity of core cognitive beliefs between major domains of clinical symptomatology (i.e., anxiety, depression, dissociation) as well as within a given domain (i.e., between qualitatively different types of anxiety measured in the present study).  Collectively, the results offer additional support for the further delineation and direct targeting of both traumacentric and broader underlying core beliefs in etiological models of PTSD, as well as anxiety and depression more generally.  Further, preliminary results offer support for disorder and domain specific cognitive schemata that may reflect particularly salient domains for prevention and/or therapeutic intervention programs in both at-risk and general populations.  \n \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5707], "author_name_tesi": "Testa, Sandra ", "last_name_ssi": "Testa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sandra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Thomas D Borkovec", "William Ray", "Louis Georges Castonguay", "Dennis Edward Heitzmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Thomas D Borkovec, Committee Chair", "William Ray, Committee Member", "Louis Georges Castonguay, Committee Member", "Dennis Edward Heitzmann, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["vulnerability schemas", "vulnerability factors", "cognitive schemas", "core beliefs", "PTSD anxiety depression", "posttraumatic adjustment"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Microbial Approaches to Support Andean Quinoa Production", "id": "16130", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8058", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Quinoa, Chenopodium quinoa, is an Amaranthaceous seed crop, grown as a staple food and high-value export of the Andean region of South America.  Research into quinoa production has increased due to the crop\u2019s ability to produce a highly nutritious seed under adverse environmental conditions.  Quinoa production has increased greatly in South America in order to meet North American and European consumer demand.  Increased production has led to the conversion of marginal land into quinoa fields and a subsequent decrease in sustainable production practices.  Therefore, it is necessary to research sustainable methods of quinoa production.  There has been substantial research into certain production methods, such as irrigation and improved quinoa lines, but there is little research into the use of microbes to enhance quinoa production.\n  \nPlant growth promoting Bacillus species were examined for their ability to colonize quinoa and to promote quinoa growth, but neither Bolivian isolates nor commercially available isolates were shown to enhance quinoa growth.  Root colonization by Bacillus strains could only be reliably measured through the use of spontaneously generated rifampicin resistant mutants.  \n\nA subset of plant growth promoting bacteria, the phosphate solubilizing bacteria, were examined to determine if the tricalcium phosphate solubilizing phenotype was specific to certain Bacillus species.  Bacillus populations isolated from Pennsylvanian Chenopodium album, Ecuadorean C. quinoa, and Bolivian C. quinoa were screened for the ability to solubilize tricalcium phosphate and this phenotype was paired with 16S sequence data to determine if there were species based patterns of tricalcium phosphate solubilization.  Nearly all isolates of B. megaterium (100% of isolates) and B. subtilis (99%) groups were capable of tricalcium phosphate solubilization, whereas members of the B. simplex (51%) and B. cereus (39%) groups varied greatly in their ability to solubilize tricalcium phosphate.  This indicates the tricalcium phosphate solubilizing phenotype is ubiquitous in certain Bacillus species and these species could be targeted in screens for plant growth promoting bacteria.  However, in assays in which the effects of a phosphate solubilizing B. megaterium were compared to a non-solubilizing B. simplex isolate, no differences were observed in plant growth or plant phosphorus content, so the role of the tricalcium phosphate solubilizing phenotype is still unclear.  \n\nThe key disease of quinoa is downy mildew caused by Peronospora variabilis (formerly Peronospora farinosa f. sp. chenopodii).  Seed-based detection methods using sequencing and PCR with specific primers were developed to detect seedborne oospores of P. variabilis.  Thirty-two lots of imported, consumable quinoa seeds were screened using these methods and the pathogen was detected in 25 lots using the sequencing based method and 23 lots using the PCR with specific primers method.  Therefore, seedborne oospores likely play a significant role in the spread of quinoa downy mildew and it is critical to develop management methods for seedborne oospores.  Seedborne oospores are the likely source of initial inoculum for the introduction of P. variabilis to Pennsylvania.  Phylogenetic analyses of the quinoa downy mildew pathogen from Ecuadorean and Bolivian quinoa samples showed that the pathogen that infects weedy Chenopodium species in Ecuador is P. variabilis (based on ITS sequences).  Therefore, weedy Chenopodium species could harbor P. variabilis and further studies are required to determine if weedy Chenopodium can act as green bridges for P. variabilis between and during quinoa growing seasons.  \nTo combine Bacillus and P. variabilis research together, biological control assays were performed to determine if Bacillus could reduce the severity of quinoa downy mildew infections.  Both Bacillus mycoides BmJ and Bacillus pumilus GB34 appeared to reduce sporulation of P. variabilis compared to an uninoculated control in two studies, but these results were non-significant.  \n\nResults of all these studies, along with protocols, were prepared for Ecuadorean and Bolivian collaborators, so that this research can be applied in key quinoa producing areas of South America.  By identifying which Bacillus species groups solubilize tricalcium phosphate, collaborators can focus research efforts on these species groups in quinoa growth assays for plant growth promotion.  Protocols for isolating and screening Bacillus isolates for plant growth promoting phenotypes, such as IAA and chitinase production, were developed to allow for consistent results amongst collaborators in the United States, Ecuador and Bolivia.  Three new diseases of quinoa were reported in the United States, and through this research, simple, reliable methods for working with each pathogen were developed and shared with collaborators.  Molecular methods to detect P. variabilis in quinoa seeds and plant tissue highlighted how quinoa seeds could potentially serve as sources of inoculum for P. variabilis.  Finally, an extension program for rural Andean farmers in Tiraque Province, Bolivia was developed to teach farmers about integrated pest management of quinoa downy mildew.  \n\nQuinoa production could benefit greatly from research into how to manage both beneficial and pathogenic microbes.  Incorporating beneficial microbes could help promote plant growth and reduce disease.  Identifying sources of inoculum for P. variabilis and being able to rapidly detect P. variabilis in seeds and plant tissues will aid in development of integrated strategies to manage quinoa downy mildew.  These microbial approaches could help support Andean quinoa production in years to come.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8003], "author_name_tesi": "Testen, Anna Louise", "last_name_ssi": "Testen", "middle_name_ssi": "Louise", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Anthony Backman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Anthony Backman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["quinoa", "international agriculture", "seedborne diseases", "downy mildew", "phosphate solubilizing bacteria", "Ecuador", "Bolivia", "PGPR"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "AFRICAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS' COLLEGE TRANSITION TRAJECTORY: AN EXAMINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF HIGH SCHOOL COMPOSITION AND EXPECTATIONS ON DEGREE ATTAINMENT \n", "id": "8084", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6233", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation identifies an important limitation within the literature on degree attainment and access to higher education.

Antigenic pMHC-I can be generated from two spatially distinct sources.  The direct presentation pathway involves generation of peptide from protein substrate synthesized within the cell that is presenting the pMHC-I. When direct presentation is blocked, the cross-presentation pathway, in which antigen is transferred from donor cells to uninfected pAPC, is thought to compensate and allow the generation of effector TCD8+.  The mechanisms by which cross presentation of exogenous antigens occur in vivo remain controversial. The objective of this thesis, therefore, has been to expand our knowledge of the mechanisms of cross presentation in vivo for subsequent TCD8+ activation.  The C-type lectin, Scavenger Receptor-A (SR-A), has been implicated in a number of potential cross presentation pathways, including the presentation of peptide bound to heat shock proteins and the transfer of pMHC-I from donor cells to pAPC.  We demonstrate that initiation of TCD8+ responses is normal in mice lacking SR-A, and that the redundancy of ligand binding exhibited by the SR family is likely an important mechanism that ensures cross presentation in vivo.  These observations emphasize the requirement to target multiple receptors and antigen processing pathways during the rational design of vaccines aimed at eliciting protective TCD8+.  Further, we demonstrate that late Vaccinia virus (VACV) antigens do not enter the cross-presentation pathway, even when identical antigens driven by early promoters access this pathway efficiently.  The mechanism mediating this novel means of viral modulation of antigen presentation involves the sequestration of late antigens within virus factories.  Early antigens and cellular antigens are cross-presented from virus-infected cells, as are late antigens that are targeted to compartments outside of the virus factories.  This virus-mediated blockade specifically targets the cross-presentation pathway, as late antigen that is not cross-presented efficiently enters the MHC Class II pathway.  VACV, therefore, has evolved a mechanism to specifically inhibit the cross-presentation pathway within pAPCs following internalization of exogenous VACV late promoter-driven antigen.  Thus, we have demonstrated for the first time pathogen-mediated modulation of the cross-presentation pathway.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1749], "author_name_tesi": "Tewalt , Eric Franklin", "last_name_ssi": "Tewalt ", "middle_name_ssi": "Franklin", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Charles Norbury", "Christopher Charles Norbury", "Avery August", "Todd Schell", "Neil David Christensen", "Ralph Lauren Keil"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Charles Norbury, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Charles Norbury, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Scavenger Receptor", "Cross-presentation", "Vaccinia Virus", "T cells", "gp96", "Dendritic Cell"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "PRIOR KNOWLEDGE BASED IDENTIFICATION OF TAKAGI-SUGENO-KANG FUZZY MODELS FOR STATIC NONLINEAR SYSTEMS\n\n\n\n", "id": "9172", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "555", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Data-driven model of a physical system is a mathematical model that has been built solely using historically available input-output pairs. In such type of models we usually try to identify the mapping function (linear or nonlinear) that transforms inputs from a multivariate space to a univariate output space (Multiple-Input-Single-Output/MISO systems). The data-driven models are especially needed when constructing a physical model (based on first principles) of a process is difficult due to the lack of understanding of the underlying physical phenomenon/phenomena. Although quite popular, majority of the data-driven models have a noticeable disadvantage in terms of their poor interpretability. In other words, although such models may correctly estimate the system outputs for a given set of inputs, the manner in which the outputs are generated does not have any physical interpretation. For this reason, data-driven models are sometimes referred as black-box models. Neuro-fuzzy models are a class of data-driven models that partly alleviates the above mentioned problem of poor interpretability. These hybrid models consist of two components. The Artificial-Neural-Network (ANN) component that enables learning from historical data and Fuzzy Logic component which tries to emulate the process of human reasoning. These models are specially desired in situations when a process output can be explained by a domain expert/experts in terms of linguistic statements. In this thesis, a type of neuro-fuzzy models called Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) models are studied as a tool for static nonlinear system modeling.  \n\nIn general, identification of any data-driven model involves two important steps 1) the structure identification and 2) the parameter identification. In the 1st step, a parameterized model is constructed either using the prior knowledge or a historical dataset or a combination of both. Thereafter, in the 2nd step of parameter identification the optimal values of the model parameters are estimated. The process of parameter estimation is called training and the dataset for this purpose is referred as training dataset. The general approach of parameter estimation can be summarized as follows. An error measure is defined using the training dataset and subsequently minimized with respect to the unknown model parameters. Therefore, the parameter estimation is merely an nonlinear optimization problem. In this thesis, the focus is only on the parameters estimation of TSK models under the assumption that their structure has been fixed a priori. \n\nIn order to have consistent and near optimal parameter estimates, a sufficiently large noise-free training dataset is required. However, if we have more parameters than what can be correctly estimated from a training dataset then the performance of the trained model becomes questionable. The input-output datasets generated by majority of real world systems usually have low signal to noise ratio, which further reduces their estimation capability. Hence, it becomes imperative to devise robust parameter estimation techniques that are not significantly affected by the noise in training datasets. There is a group of estimation techniques known as regularization techniques that are commonly used for the identification of over-parameterized models from low quality datasets. The basic idea behind regularization is to impose certain restriction on the parameter values, so that the variance in estimated parameter values can be minimized.\n\nContemporary regularization techniques used for the identification of neuro-fuzzy systems are similar to the ones used for the black-box models such as ANNs. To the knowledge of the author, none of these techniques explicitly uses the qualitative knowledge that can be readily obtained from a domain expert. It is certainly counterintuitive not to use existing knowledge to regularize the parameters values of neuro-fuzzy models. In an attempt to address the aforementioned problem, a regularization technique is proposed which works by incorporating prior knowledge during the parameter estimation of TSK models. The resulting TSK models are named as A-Priori Knowledge-based Fuzzy Models (APKFMs). The foundation of APKFMs is a hypothetical function called knowledge function, which is responsible for keeping a model\u2019s parameters consistent with the domain knowledge. The proposed approach has a two fold regularization effect on the TSK models. Firstly, the incorporation of knowledge function ensures that the parameters do not take physically infeasible values during their estimation. Secondly, the use of knowledge function considerably reduces the number of unknown parameters. Therefore, less number of parameters are needed to be estimated from the available training data leading to consistent parameter estimates. \n\nThe effectiveness of the APKFMs is shown using two examples of static systems. In the first example, a 2-dimensional nonlinear toy function is constructed and subsequently approximated by an APKFM. In the second example, a real world problem pertaining to the maintenance cost estimation of electricity distribution networks is taken up. In both the examples, the performance of APKFMs is benchmarked against neuro-fuzzy models identified using the three commonly used techniques namely, Global least square estimate, Local least square estimate and Ridge regression. The former is an unregularized parameter estimation technique while the other two represent the state of the art regularization techniques for TSK fuzzy models. The performance of all fuzzy models are evaluated and compared based on their robustness towards the noise present in the training datasets. Different training datasets of varying quality are constructed by controlling the two variables viz. the training dataset size and the signal to noise ratio.  Rigorous statistical tests confirm that on an average the robustness of APKFM is superior compared to contemporary neuro-fuzzy models.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [552], "author_name_tesi": "Tewari, Ashutosh ", "last_name_ssi": "Tewari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ashutosh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Mirna Urquidi Macdonald", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald", "Joseph Paul Cusumano", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Dissertation Advisor", "Mirna Urquidi Macdonald, Committee Chair", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member", "Akhlesh Lakhtakia, Committee Member", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Knowledge-based systems", "Data driven models", "Neuro-fuzzy models", "TSK fuzzy models", "Artificial Intelligence"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "INTERFACIAL  EFFECTS  IN  OXIDE-POLYMER  LAMINAR  COMPOSITE  THIN  FILM  DIELECTRICS  FOR  CAPACITOR  APPLICATIONS\n\n", "id": "9714", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4979", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Continuous increase in the density of active components on microelectronic chip/circuit board requires development of new capacitors with smaller size, weight and cost. Miniaturization in the size of capacitors demands development of high energy density dielectric materials, which are the core of parallel plate capacitors. Nano composite dielectrics comprising high polarizibility oxide fillers randomly dispersed in high breakdown strength polymer matrix are considered as a potential high energy density materials for capacitor applications. Large interfacial volume, generated due to introduction of nano fillers in polymer matrix, might have significant positive contribution towards energy storage in nano composites. However, percolation issues associated with nano fillers and generation of large interfacial volume in nano composites, where complex electric field distribution overlaps with interfacialy modified polymer lead to unclear understanding of polymer-filler interfacial interactions in nano composites.  Hence, in the current work laminar composite double layered dielectric structures, which provide relatively simple local field distribution at the interface and ideal series connectivity between oxide and polymer, are used as a model system to understand polymer-oxide interfacial interactions. Interfacial effects are reported for both low permittivity (SiO2-Parylene C) and medium permittivity (ZrO2\u2013P(VDF-TrFE)) laminar composite dielectrics.\n\tPyrolytic vapor decomposition polymerization process was used to grow Parylene C thin films on gold and thermally grown SiO2 surfaces. Enhancement in crystallite dimension with post deposition annealing treatments of Parylene C thin films was found to reduce dielectric loss tangent and hence enhance its dielectric properties. Electric field and temperature dependant leakage current analysis suggested hopping as dominant conduction mechanism in Parylene C thin films. Parylene C thin films in laminar composites showed enhanced segmental chain mobility or reduced degree of co-operative chain motion in comparison to Parylene C itself. These effects were found to be more pronounced for Parylene C in the vicinity of SiO2.\n\tAC electric field dependant impedance spectroscopy analysis of SiO2-Parylene C laminar composites showed gradual reduction in segmental chain motion relaxation rate in Parylene C with an increase in AC oscillation amplitude. Reduced segmental chain motion relaxation rate at a fixed temperature, suggesting higher stability of glassy phase at high AC oscillation amplitude, was explained based on its similar dependence on external pressure, previously shown for polyisoprene and PMMA. Lesser effect of AC oscillation amplitude on interfacial polymer segmental chain motion relaxation rate in comparison to bulk polymer was found to be consistent with reported higher activation energy for segmental chain motion for thicker film in comparison to thinner. With an increase in AC oscillation amplitude a new sub-ohmic AC conduction mechanism associated with minority carrier injection was found to be dominant at lower frequency. The relaxation associated minority carrier injection was found to be strongly coupled with AC electric field amplitude.\nThermally stimulated depolarization current measurements (TSDC) of SiO2-Parylene C laminar composites revealed the presence of interfacial dipolar energy state with activation energy in the range of 1.05 to 1.30 eV. Surface functionalization of thermally grown SiO2 with various organosilane was carried out to control the polarity of SiO2 surface and modify interfacial characteristics of laminar composites. Shift in TSDC interfacial peak maxima, signifying presence of deeper interfacial state, with surface functionalization was found to be directly related to surface polarity of functionalized SiO2. Overall increase in polarizibility of SiO2-Parylene C laminar composite dielectric with surface functionalization was found to be controlled by surface polarity of functionalized SiO2 surface and interfacial surface tension between functionalized SiO2 and Parylene C. Impedance spectroscopy measurements of laminar composites with functionalized SiO2 surface suggested a coupling between interfacial dipole and interfacial charge transportation mechanism.\n\tElectrical properties of medium permittivity composite comprising, solution cast P(VDF-TrFE) film on sputtered ZrO2 thin films, were found to be controlled by P(VDF-TrFE) in high frequency region and by ZrO2 thin film in low frequency region. Impedance spectroscopy and equivalent circuit modeling showed that additional polarization in ZrO2-P(VDF-TrFE) composites, shown as a difference in experimentally measured and theoretically calculated real part of permittivity using series mixing rule, was primarily due to large scale structural modification of interfacial P(VDF-TrFE) grown on ZrO2 thin films. Presence of additional polarization mechanism in ZrO2-P(VDF-TrFE) laminar composite was found to be consistent with enhanced polarization observed in ZrO2-fuloropolymer particulate composites.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4956], "author_name_tesi": "Tewari, Pratyush ", "last_name_ssi": "Tewari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pratyush", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan", "Michael T Lanagan", "Osama O Awadelkarim", "Mark William Horn", "Qing Wang", "Eugene Furman", "Ramakrishnan Rajagopalan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael T Lanagan, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Chair", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member", "Eugene Furman, Committee Member", "Ramakrishnan Rajagopalan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Composite dielectrics", "Interfacial effects", "Energy density", "Polymer"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "\u2018EMPIRE\u2019 RECORDS:  A STUDY OF RESISTANCE AND THE POLITICS OF CULTURAL PRODUCTION IN THE NETWORK AGE\n\n\n", "id": "10463", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1402", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-09-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores the way in which the cultural politics of popular music function as a strategy of governance by examining two case studies:  Rage Against the Machine and M.I.A.  The shape of musical media using a politics of resistance has fundamentally changed in recent years due to the massive influence of the rise of the network society and digital distribution.  Yet this resistance, I argue, is responding to an equal change in the way that dominant institutions exert their influence through these same means.  In both cases, it is the new uses of media that shift the locus of power to the everyday lives of global citizens. I use Michel Foucault\u2019s concept of biopolitical production as the primary strategy through which power is exercised as a mode of postmodern governance.  Yet as the scope of this power expands to a global scale, this strategy appears to increasingly be supplanting traditional means of exercising power.  Furthermore, I argue these strategies of governance have been the primary strategy of the global neoliberal project, particularly in its utilization of mediated cultural forms as a central conduit to populations.\n\tThe place of music in this arrangement is as a unique and vital site of power negotiations of these relationships.  I argue that there has been a real and fundamental change in the way in which these cultural forms are politicized in the era following the introduction of digital distribution networks. Following an introductory chapter, the next three chapters of this dissertation provide a theoretical and analytical background on the ordering of power, resistance, and the global music industry, dealing respectively with the rise of globalization and global capital structures, contemporary strategies of governance, and the political economy of the global music industry.  Chapter Five uses as a case study the fascinating and problematic Rage Against the Machine, perhaps the most notable musical artist representing anti cultural resistance the pre-network 1990s.  Chapter Six studies M.I.A., daughter of a notable Sri Lanka resistance fighter, as an artist whose music symbolizes the cultural politics of resistance representative of the various conceptualizations of postmodern power relations in the network age.  Chapter Seven provides an in-depth conclusion to this dissertation by comparing and contrasting the structure, order, and exercise of power during these two eras.  I find that new uses of global media represent an understated but great threat to human freedom as cultural forms become increasing politicized, yet at the same time offer great promise if certain strategies of popular resistance can be cultivated.  In either case, popular music serves as a media form with great influence on a global scale for the articulation of the public\u2019s values, beliefs, actions, and discourses, making it all the more important to consider as object of study in the network age.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1391], "author_name_tesi": "Tewksbury, Douglas G", "last_name_ssi": "Tewksbury", "middle_name_ssi": "G", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Elavsky", "John Spicer Nichols", "Michael Elavsky", "Matt Jordan", "John Philip Christman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Elavsky, Dissertation Advisor", "John Spicer Nichols, Committee Chair", "Michael Elavsky, Committee Chair", "Matt Jordan, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cultural Studies", "Culture", "Music", "Production", "Musical", "Networks", "Music Industry", "Music Business", "Political Economy", "Politics", "Mass", "Commmunication"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE NOVEL MECHANISTIC ROLE OF PIGN IN LEUKEMIA PROGRESSION  ", "id": "14718ekt114", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14718", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Genomic instability plays a pivotal role in the leukemia progression of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, the precise genetic cause and the underlying mechanisms of MDS leukemia progression or transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain elusive. Moreover, the current approach to MDS progression risk-stratification using the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) or WHO Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) is limited and fails to address the dynamic nature of the disease. This presents a need for the identification of novel prognostic markers and a better understanding of the mechanisms involved.\n\tIn this study, phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis, class N (PIGN), a gene encoding an enzyme participating in the final steps of the glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored protein (GPI-AP) biosynthesis pathway and a cancer chromosomal instability (CIN) suppressor, was highly ranked as a predictor of the risk of MDS leukemia progression. We also observed the progressive loss of PIGN during MDS progression to AML. Moreover, PIGN gene expression aberrations (i.e. increased gene expression but diminished to no protein production) were observed in a subset of high-risk MDS and AML patients with myelodysplasia-related changes. PIGN gene expression aberrations were associated with increased frequency of GPI-AP deficiency in leukemic cells and correlated with the elevation of genomic instability that was independent of the TP53 regulatory pathway. PIGN gene expression aberrations were attributed to novel partial intron retentions between exons 14 and 15 resulting in frameshifts and premature termination. Interestingly, in an MDS leukemia progression model, this mutation was identified in the leukemia stage (i.e. MDS-L) cells but was absent in the MDS stage (i.e. MDS92) cells.\n\tTransient suppression or ablation of PIGN induced DNA damage response which was rescued following PIGN restoration. We also observed an increase in the frequency of CIN with PIGN loss. Moreover, PIGN physically interacted with and/or regulated the spindle assembly checkpoint via MAD1, MAD2, MPS1, and BUBR1. Thus, PIGN is crucial in the regulation of mitotic integrity for the maintenance of chromosomal stability and ultimately prevents leukemic transformation/progression.\n\tThis study for the first time identified PIGN as a prognostic marker of MDS transformation and revealed the link between PIGN gene expression aberration, genomic instability, and MDS progression/leukemia transformation. PIGN gene expression aberration is associated with genomic instability and leukemogenesis and could serve as a basis for improved risk-stratification of MDS patients.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15668], "author_name_tesi": "Teye, Emmanuel Kwame", "last_name_ssi": "Teye", "middle_name_ssi": "Kwame", "first_name_ssi": "Emmanuel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey J Pu", "Jong Kak Yun", "Hong-Gang Wang", "Douglas B Stairs", "Gregory Steven Yochum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey J Pu, Dissertation Advisor", "Jong Kak Yun, Committee Chair", "Hong-Gang Wang, Committee Member", "Douglas B Stairs, Committee Member", "Gregory Steven Yochum, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["myelodysplastic syndrome", "acute myeloid leukemia", "PIGN", "chromosomal instability", "risk-stratification", "biomarker", "spindle assembly checkpoint", "leukemia", "mitotic exit", "GPI anchor biosynthesis", "cancer", "cell cycle", "mitosis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Decentralized algorithms for search and routing in large-scale networks", "id": "8079", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2247", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "During the past decade, advances in technology and science have led to many large-scale distributed systems which can be characterized\nas networks. Some examples include the World Wide Web, the Internet, the power grid, wireless sensor networks, and military (net-centric)\nlogistics. The scale of the size of these networks is substantially different from the networks considered in traditional graph theory.\nFurther, these networks do not have any pre-specified structure/order or any design principles. Hence, the problems posed in such networks are very novel. Recent years has witnessed an explosion of interest across different disciplines, in understanding and characterizing such large-scale networks, which led to development of a new field called ``Network science'. This activity was mainly triggered by significant findings in real-world\nnetworks which led to a revival of network modeling and gave rise to many path breaking results. Until now, a major part of this research\nwas focused on modeling and characterizing the behavior of the networks. However, the ultimate goal of modeling these networks is to understand and optimize the dynamical processes taking place in the network.\n\nSearch and routing is one of the most important and prevalent process in many real-world networks. Many times one needs to transport raw material/computer files/messages from one node to\nanother using the edges of the network. In traditional graph theory, there do exist abundant number of algorithms that can compute the optimal paths in the network. However, these algorithms assume that global information of the network is available, i.e. how each and every node is connected in the network is known. But in some scenarios, it is not possible to have access to global information of the network and we need to have decentralized algorithms that can\nnavigate through the network by using only local information. In this dissertation, we address an important process of search and routing in large-scale networks. This forms the core problem of this thesis. Examples include routing of sensor data in wireless sensor networks, locating data files in peer-to-peer networks, connecting \nrelief workers in a disaster scenario, and finding information in distributed databases. Decentralized search and routing in networks\nis broadly classified into two types of networks, namely, non-spatial networks and spatial networks.\n\nIn non-spatial networks, we study trade-offs presented by local search algorithms in networks which are heterogeneous in edge weights and node degree. We demonstrate that search based on a\nnetwork measure, local betweenness centrality (LBC), utilizes the heterogeneity of both node degrees and edge weights to perform the best in scale-free weighted networks. We show that the performance of LBC search is similar to BC search, which utilizes the maximum information about a neighbor. Further, we demonstrate that the search based on LBC is universal and performs well in a large class of complex networks. We also test the algorithms on the peer-to-peer network, Gnutella, and discuss the results obtained.\n\nIn spatial networks, we consider a family of parameterized spatial network models that are heterogenous in node degree. We investigate\nseveral algorithms and illustrate that some of these algorithms exploit the heterogeneity in the network to find short paths by using only local information. In addition, we demonstrate that the spatial network model belongs to a class of searchable networks for a wide range of parameter space. Further, we test these algorithms on the U.S. airline network which belongs to this class of networks and demonstrate that searchability is a generic\nproperty of the U.S. airline network. These results provide insights on designing the structure of distributed networks that need\neffective decentralized search algorithms.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2228], "author_name_tesi": "Thadakamalla, Hari Prasad", "last_name_ssi": "Thadakamalla", "middle_name_ssi": "Prasad", "first_name_ssi": "Hari", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Reka Z Albert", "M Jeya Chandra", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "Arvind Rangaswamy", "Leonid N Vaserstein"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Chair", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Chair", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Member", "Arvind Rangaswamy, Committee Member", "Leonid N Vaserstein, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["decentralized search", "localized algorithms", "complex networks", "networks", "local search", "algorithms"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Neurophysiological underpinnings of attention biases: An Erp Study", "id": "23313", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10521", "abstract_tesi": "The attention system of individuals with anxiety disorders may be biased toward threat-related stimuli. Indeed, this threat bias may play a causal role in the emergence of anxiety. Evidence for this assertion is drawn from a computerized training paradigm known as Attention Bias Modification (ABM) where attention is manipulated to bias away from threat. While anxiety is a developmental disorder with the majority of diagnoses first emerging in childhood, few studies have examined the role attention bias and ABM may play in children. Less is known concerning the neural correlates of attention bias and ABM, which have only been investigated in the adult literature. The goal of the current study is to further our understanding of the neural processes underlying attention bias and attention training from a developmental perspective, with a specific focus on children at temperamental risk for anxiety due to high levels of behavioral inhibition. ABM was shown to decrease N1 and N2 components. Levels of inhibition were shown to moderate the relation between P2 and social phobia as well as N2 and social phobia. That is, low behavioral inhibition interacts with low P2 and high N2 to predict high social phobia. No behavioral differences in threat bias were observed before and after ABM or Placebo training.

With the recent recommendation by bilateral agencies and the United Nations, collaboration has become a widely utilized strategy to address the problem of human trafficking. Although collaboration is growing rapidly, little is known about why collaboration is valued as a strategy to plan and implement anti-trafficking interventions. Other questions of interest include how collaboration is formed, what factors are significant in enabling an effective collaborative process, how collaborative outcomes are measured as successful, and what the key ethical dilemmas of collaboration that should be considered in the anti-trafficking interventions are. Answers to these questions are crucial to assist policy makers and anti-trafficking actors to understand the values of their collaboration and develop better strategies to effectively respond to the problem.

The primary research objectives are: 1) to establish a unified theoretical/numerical framework to predict the chemical erosion of nozzle material by utilizing advances in chemical kinetics, turbulence modeling, and numerical algorithm, 2) to identify key physiochemical mechanisms and parameters that dictate nozzle erosion and 3) to investigate different ways to help minimize the nozzle material erosion with emphasis on the technique called nozzle boundary-layer control system (NBLCS). \nThe formulation takes into account detailed thermofluid dynamics for a multi-component reacting flow, heterogeneous reactions at the nozzle surface, condensed-phase energy transport, and nozzle material properties. Both metallized and non-metallized AP/HTPB (ammonium perchlorate/hydroxyl-terminated ploy butadiene) composite propellants are treated. Many restrictive assumptions and approximations made in the previous models have been relaxed. A two-layer k-&#949; turbulence model was implemented, as it performs well for transpiration and accelerating flows. The governing equations and the associated boundary conditions are solved using a density-based, finite-volume approach and explicit time marching by means of a four-step Runge-Kutta scheme. The code is parallelized using the domain decomposition technique and message passing interface (MPI). The theoretical formulation and numerical scheme was validated with three test cases including turbulent flow over a flat plat, heat transfer in convergent-divergent nozzles, and two-dimensional oblique shock \nThe different nozzle materials considered were graphite/carbon-carbon and such refractory metals as tungsten, molybdenum, and rhenium. The predicted nozzle surface recession rates compare well with different sets of available experimental data. The erosion rate follows the trend exhibited by the heat-flux distribution, and is most severe in the throat region. H2O proved to be the most detrimental oxidizing species in dictating nozzle erosion. The erosion rate increases almost linearly with chamber pressure, mainly due to higher convective heat transfer and enhanced heterogeneous surface reactions. For non-metallized propellants, the graphite recession rate is dictated by heterogeneous chemical kinetics since the nozzle surface temperature is relatively low. For metallized propellants, however, the process is diffusion controlled due to the high surface temperature. The erosion rate decreases with increasing aluminum content, a phenomenon resulting from reduced concentrations of oxidizing species H2O, OH, and CO2. The tungsten nozzle erodes much slower than graphite, but at a rate comparable to that of rhenium. The molybdenum nozzle exhibits the least erosion but its low melting temperature (2896 K) is a serious limitation.\nThe analysis was extended to include NBLCS. The strategy involves injection of relatively low-temperature species, obtained from reactions of an ablative material SA/PVA (succinic acid/poly-vinyl acetate) and a small amount of propellant combustion gases, to a location slightly upstream of the nozzle. The effect of NBLCS injection on the near-surface physiochemistry is investigated in detail. Various fundamental mechanisms dictating the effectiveness of NBLCS are identified and quantified. The calculated erosion rates with NBLCS are negligible, even at ultra-high pressures. The mitigation of nozzle erosion is attributed primarily to the low temperature of the injected fluid, and secondarily to the reduced concentrations of oxidizing species, H2O, CO2, and OH, near the nozzle surface\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4892], "author_name_tesi": "Thakre, Piyush K", "last_name_ssi": "Thakre", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Piyush", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vigor Yang", "Kenneth K Kuo", "Richard A Yetter", "Stefan Thynell", "Michael Matthew Micci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vigor Yang, Committee Chair", "Kenneth K Kuo, Committee Member", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Stefan Thynell, Committee Member", "Michael Matthew Micci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["refractory metal nozzles", "solid-propellant rocket motors", "erosion mitigation", "graphite/carbon-carbon nozzles", "nozzle erosion"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Efficient detection of UV light by quantum dots sensitized silicon detector", "id": "22367", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9948", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Historically, light coming from the sun has been our prime source of light energy.

The dielectric theory suggests that weakly-coupled and strongly-dipolar polymers have the potential to realize a high dielectric constant. The high dipole moment functional groups and amorphous structure provides strong scattering to the charge carriers, resulting in low losses even at high electric fields.  These polymers also possess a high glass transition temperature which makes them suitable for high temperature operation. In this dissertation, the fundamental understanding has been carried forward to design and develop next generation of capacitors based on nanostructured materials for compact, light-weight, and reliable electric power systems to address the commercial, consumer, and military requirements.\nWe show through combined theoretical and experimental investigations that nanostructure engineering of a weakly-coupled and strongly-dipolar polymer can result in a high-energy density polymer with low loss and high operating temperature. Our studies reveal that disorder in dipolar polymers creates a significantly larger free volume at temperatures far below the glass transition (Tg), enabling easier reorientation of dipoles in response to an electric field. The net result is a substantial enhancement in the dielectric constant while preserving low dielectric loss and very high breakdown field. It is the free volume effect that leads to a high dielectric constant (K > 5.6) at temperatures below Tg (> 200\u00b0C) in meta-phenylene polyurea (meta-PU). It possesses very low loss (high charge/discharge efficiency) even at high electric fields (> 600 MV/m).  \nTo extend the idea of free volume, we propose a blending approach where two glassy state dipolar polymers, poly(arylene ether urea) (PEEU, K=4.7) and an aromatic polythiourea (ArPTU, K=4.4), are combined. The resulting blend exhibits a very high dielectric constant(K=7.5) while maintaining low dielectric loss (< 1%). The experimental and simulation results demonstrate that blending these dissimilar dipolar polymers causes a slight increase in the interchain spacing of the blend in its glassy state. This reduces the barriers for the reorientation of dipoles in the polymer chains and generates a much higher dielectric response than the neat polymers.\nIn addition to designing new dielectric materials with excellent dielectric properties, it is crucial that we continue to improve the electrical properties of the state-of-the-art materials. This allows us to utilize the existential large-scale manufacturing facilities of these polymers. Polyetherimide (PEI), a high glass transition amorphous polymer, is seen as the material of choice for high temperature capacitors. But it possesses a moderate dielectric constant of 3.2, which limits its energy density. We present a nanocomposite approach, where addition of small amounts of inorganic nanoparticles in PEI can improve the dielectric constant by 60% while maintaining the breakdown strength, thereby increasing the discharged energy density by 50%. This is a very promising approach and a breakthrough experimental discovery for engineering nanostructures by introducing low volume content of nanofillers with dielectric constant similar to that of the matrix, to achieve markedly enhanced dielectric response. The results are extremely intriguing and eliminate many undesirable features, primarily being low breakdown strength of traditional dielectric nanocomposites containing high dielectric constant fillers, which have been a focal point of study for the past 20 years in this area of research.\nFor practical applications, it is critical that the dielectric material possesses low loss, especially the conduction loss, which could become significant at high temperatures and high electric fields. In this pursuit, we developed a strongly dipolar polymer, poly (ether methyl ether urea) (PEMEU) that exhibits a dielectric constant of 4 and is thermally stable up to 150\u00b0C. The experimental results show that the ether units are effective in softening the rigid polymer and making it thermally processable, while the high dipole moment of urea units and glass structure of the polymer leads to a low dielectric loss and low conduction loss. As a result, PEMEU high quality thin films exhibit exceptionally high breakdown field of >1.5 GV/m, and a low conduction loss at fields leading up to the breakdown. Consequently, the PEMEU films exhibit a high charge\u2013discharge efficiency of 90% and a high discharged energy density of 36 J/cm3.\n\tAnother key aspect is mitigating losses in available dielectric materials that show promise for scalability and are attractive for high energy density capacitors. The conduction at high fields and high temperatures of a semi-crystalline poly(tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene-vinylidene fluoride) terpolymer was investigated. Experimental results show that the insulating nanofillers are very effective in reducing the conduction current, i.e., more than two orders of magnitude reduction in conduction can be achieved with less than 1 wt.% (<0.5 vol.%) of Al2O3 nanofillers. Experimental measurements are compared with multiscale simulations, which provide insights into the dominant conduction mechanism, i.e., the carrier hopping in the polymer. The conduction is markedly reduced owing to a large decrease in the mobile carrier concentrations and increased trap depth, caused by the nanofillers.\n\tIn summary, this dissertation focusses on the development of next generation capacitors by innovation in materials which possess high dielectric constant, low loss, high breakdown strength, and high temperature thermal stability. We believe that the insightful results and approaches shown by the introduction of localized free volume and low volume content of nanoparticles may unravel new directions for future research in advanced dielectrics. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14812], "author_name_tesi": "Thakur, Yash ", "last_name_ssi": "Thakur", "first_name_ssi": "Yash", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang", "Qiming Zhang", "Jerzy Ruzyllo", "Noel Chris Giebink", "James Runt", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Qiming Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Chair", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member", "Noel Chris Giebink, Committee Member", "James Runt, Outside Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dielectrics", "capacitors", "nanoparticles", "energy storage", "polymers"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "POROSITY, MORPHOLOGY, AND STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATIONS OF BITUMINOUS COAL CHAR CONVERSION UNDER A PORE DIFFUSION CONTROLLED REGIME: A COMPARISON OF CO2 GASIFICATION CONVERSION AND BURNOUT IN OXY-FUEL COMBUSTION", "id": "f7623c56g", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12855", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Gasification and oxy-fuel combustion technologies are a promising approach for electricity generation with improved readiness for CO2 capture and for subsequent geologic storage. Owning to limited oxy-fuel combustion knowledge, comparative evaluations on the same coal char under the pore diffusion regime studies can be useful to transfer knowledge. The comparative evaluations on reactivity, porosity transformations, morphology changes, crystallinity development, particle size distributions, and fragmentation extents of Pittsburgh no. 8 coal char during CO2 gasification conversion and char burnout in oxy-fuel combustion (21% O2/79% CO2 v/v) under the pore diffusion controlled regime were performed in a horizontal tube furnace. The initial coal char was created in an entrained-flow gasifier at 1500 \u00b0C. By using the same coal char, the behavioral differences are mostly influenced by the reactant gases. The initial char was mostly thick-walled cenospheres (>80% of particles). The relative reactivities of oxy-fuel combustion/CO2 gasification were 23 times in the early conversion stage (~10% gasification-, burnout-induced conversion (daf)) and 62 times in the later stage (~60% gasification-, burnout-induced conversion (daf)). The reactivity of the char-CO2 gasification was partially impacted by annealing due to increasing degree of ordering identified by the increasing crystalline width (La) and the increasing relative amount of large aromatic rings (\u22656 rings). The crystalline width increased from 2.56 to 2.94 nm in the CO2 gasification while it decreased from 2.56 to 2.41 nm in the oxy-fuel combustion. The relative amount of large aromatic rings increased 35% for the CO2 gasification and 14% for the oxy-fuel combustion, which influenced the reactivity particularly in the CO2 gasification-induced conversions. Pore size distributions were widely developed from microporosity to macroporosity in the CO2 gasification while the oxy-fuel combustion preferentially developed macroporosity. As expected due to the different porosity development, particle fragmentation extents also differed. These were more pronounced in the CO2 gasification 6 to 12% than in the oxy-fuel combustion 1.9 to 2.5% of particles. The char fragmentation in terms of size and shape, determined through an image processing technique on SEM micrographs. The aspect ratio can distinguish between particles (<1.43) and fragments (>1.43) for this coal under these conversions.

The functional role of cytosine 75 (C75) has been established as that of a general acid based on kinetic assays, mutagenic assays, Raman spectroscopy, and x ray crystallographic studies. Recent biochemical, crystallographic, and computational studies have identified a catalytic metal ion at the active site and indicate the functional role of the metal ion in the mechanism. The most recent crystal structure of the ribozyme implicated the metal ion in multiple interactions at the active site, including interactions with the scissile phosphate. The disorder at the active site required the scissile phosphate to be modeled in from the active site of the hammerhead ribozyme, thereby raising questions about the existence and the nature of the interactions in solution. In this thesis, the focus is on the various interactions of the catalytic metal ion, the scissile phosphate, and C75 at the active site. In addition to investigating and identifying the interactions, the thesis also focuses on the catalytic mechanism, and the effect of metal ions on the reaction pathway. \n\tThe focus of Chapter 2 is the interactions of the scissile phosphate at the active site. In particular, the interactions of the non-bridging (pro-RP and pro-SP) oxygen atoms are discussed. The assays utilized for the study include phosphorothioate substitution followed by metal ion rescue with thiophilic metal ion. The replacement of the pro-SP oxygen atom with sulfur was found to have no effect on the rate, whereas the replacement of the pro-RP oxygen atom with sulfur was found to decrease the rate considerably (~1000-fold, for the slower phase), in comparison to the wild-type oxo substrate. The subsequent metal ion rescue with Cd2+ was found to be stereospecific for the RP substrate, implicating a direct interaction between the metal ion and the pro-RP oxygen. The study also investigated the interaction between the pro-RP oxygen and C75, and found that the interaction may be redundant in the presence of multitude of interactions at the active site. This work is not only a fundamental biochemical study relating structure-function in ribozymes, but also an example of the significance of complementing crystallographic data with biochemical studies to obtain a comprehensive picture of intricate reaction mechanisms. \nThe focus of Chapter 3 is determining the mechanistic pathway of the HDV ribozyme catalysis using theoretical calculations (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics- QM/MM) complemented by biochemical assays. QM/MM simulations showed unique pathways in the presence of monovalent (Na+) ions alone versus divalent metal (Mg2+) ions, which agree well with earlier experimental findings from our lab. The energy barrier obtained in the presence of Na+ was found to be lower than that in the presence of Mg2+, which contradicted experimental observations. Thus, further experimental studies were conducted in an effort to resolve the discrepancy in the theoretically calculated energy barriers. The biochemical experiments were designed to compare the pKa of 2\u2019OH in RNA in the presence of monovalent and divalent metal ions, since the energetic contribution of 2\u2019OH deprotonation was not accounted for in the theoretical calculations. The pKa of the 2\u2019OH was determined using two different approaches: kinetic and NMR, and both showed that divalent metal ions lower the pKa of 2\u2019OH to favor deprotonation as compared to monovalent metal ions. \nThe focus of Chapter 4 is utilizing inverse thio effects as a general mechanistic diagnostic in ribozyme catalyzed reactions. As mentioned before, QM/MM simulations have shown that the HDV ribozyme reaction goes via a sequential mechanism through a phosphorane intermediate in the presence of Na+, and a concerted mechanism through a transition state in the presence of Mg2+. In addition, preliminary studies conducted in the presence of Na+, showed a normal thio effect for the RP substrate, but an inverse thio effect for the SP substrate. The inverse thio effect was a unique stereospecific feature, and further studies were conducted to understand the origin of the effect. In the presence of both monovalent and divalent metal ions in group I and IIA, larger diffuse metal ions were found to show an inverse thio effect (Na+: 5-fold, K+: 6-fold, Ba2+: 3-fold). To probe the possible link between the inverse thio effect and sequential mechanistic pathway (scenario 1), a model oligonucleotide cleavage assay was used that is known to go via a sequential mechanism. Inverse thio effects were observed for the model oligonucleotide albeit the effects were subtle (2-fold), and hence the results were not able to provide conclusive evidence. In addition, classical molecular dynamics (MD) studies were also performed to investigate a new inhibitory interaction between the 2\u2019OH and the pro-SP oxygen atom (scenario 2). The interaction was found to exist only in the presence of Na+. Thus, the loss of the inhibitory interaction between the 2\u2019OH and the pro-SP atom in the case of the SP substrate may give rise to the inverse thio effect in the presence of Na+. To distinguish and identify the scenario that results in the inverse thio effect, future experiments and calculations are also discussed. Overall the work presented in this thesis, provides evidence for certain key interactions involving the scissile phosphate and attempts to provide a general diagnostic for the mechanistic pathway in ribozymes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10201], "author_name_tesi": "Thaplyal, Pallavi ", "last_name_ssi": "Thaplyal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Pallavi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

In this study, a compositional dual-porosity, dual-permeability CBM simulator has been developed. The CBM reservoir is treated as a dual-porosity, dual-permeability system consisting of coal matrix and fracture network. The development of the proposed numerical model incorporates the effects of water presence in the coal matrix and those of coal shrinkage and swelling. The transport of gas follows a multi-mechanistic flow mechanism, which is triggered by pressure and concentration gradients. The proposed simulator was successfully validated against a dual-porosity, single-permeability CBM model (PSU-COALCOMP) and a single-porosity, single-permeability model (GEM). The proposed simulator was also tested against the existing commercial and research CBM simulators for CO2-enhanced CBM recovery process. The simulator was also used in parametric sensitivity studies to investigate the validity of the flow mechanism, the effects of water in the coal matrix and coal shrinkage and swelling conditions. History matching was performed on pure CO2 injection and flue gas injection tests using the actual field data. \n\nThe governing flow equations of the proposed simulation model were further used in deriving a material balance equation and a dimensionless form of the transport equation for CBM reservoirs exhibiting homogeneous and isotropic properties. The developed material balance equation was successfully tested and implemented in predicting the reservoir size, production performance and average reservoir pressure using the simulated production data. Lastly, the developed dimensionless production rates and dimensionless time were used in the production type curves application for reservoir characterization. A series of production type curves were generated using the proposed simulator. Several sets of type-curve matching exercises were successfully performed to predict reservoir properties on different systems exhibiting a variety of reservoir and fluid properties.

Unlike in the case of mainstream industries where new product categories draw on schemas of existing products to gain acceptance and legitimacy from social groups, drawing on the schemas of existing stigmatized products can lead to stigma transfer and compound legitimacy problems. This observation forms the motivation behind my research question: How do new product categories emerge within stigmatized industries? To address this question, I studied the emergence of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) as a new product category in the stigmatized US tobacco cigarette industry. Using a microhistory case study design, and guided by a technology entrepreneurship inquiry frame, I examined the actions of various social groups over critical events that have shaped the category\u2019s emergence. I also considered the role of materiality by examining the material-discursive possibilities that emerged as social groups interacted with one another and with the product\u2019s materiality.\nMy findings show that emergence of new product categories in stigmatized industries is a contested process implicating the participation of multiple social groups who constituted different possibilities for the category based on their own frames of reference. By qualifying the category using their own evaluative considerations, social groups engaged in categorical work, which led to either sanitization or stigmatization of the emerging product category. More provocatively, I found that entrepreneurial initiatives to sanitize the product in turn activated forces that re-stigmatized. Overall the new product category emerged through a dialectical tension between forces of sanitization and forces of stigmatization. The findings from this study contributes to the existing literature on categories, stigmatized industries and technology entrepreneurship. Speaking to the categories literature, this study surfaces a dialectical model of new category emergence in a stigmatized industry setting. To the literature on stigmatized industries, this study offers a material-discursive perspective to reveal the contested nature of destigmatization initiatives. The study also contributes to the technology entrepreneurship literature by highlighting not only the distributed nature of entrepreneurship, but also surfacing temporal issues, such as the dynamic shifts that can occur in the meaning and scope of opportunities over time.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15024], "author_name_tesi": "Tharchen, Thinley ", "last_name_ssi": "Tharchen", "first_name_ssi": "Thinley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raghu B Garud", "Raghu B Garud", "Wenpin Tsai", "Glen Kreiner", "Meredith Christine Doran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raghu B Garud, Dissertation Advisor", "Raghu B Garud, Committee Chair", "Wenpin Tsai, Committee Member", "Glen Kreiner, Committee Member", "Meredith Christine Doran, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Categories", "Stigmatized industries", "Technology entrepreneurship", "Process", "Sanitization", "Stigmatization", "Dialectical tension"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Physics, Fabrication And Characterization Of Iii-v Multi-gate Fets For Low Power Electronics", "id": "26417", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11797", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With transistor technology close to its limits for power constrained scaling and the simultaneous emergence of mobile devices as the dominant driver for new scaling, a pathway to significant reduction in transistor operating voltage to 0.5V or lower is urgently sought.

III-V compound semiconductors hold great promise in this regard due to their vastly superior electron transport properties making them prime candidates to replace Silicon in the n-channel transistor. Among the plethora of binary and ternary compounds available in the III-V space, InxGa1-xAs alloys have attracted significant interest due to their excellent electron mobility, ideally placed bandgap and mature growth technology.

The mainstream schooling system in India disregards the students\u2019 individual needs, abilities, and talents. My experience of schooling in a mainstream school in India was marked by a sense of monotony, boredom, disengagement, and drudgery. The search for a pedagogical site where the students\u2019 experiences differ from mine motivates this research. During the pilot studies I conducted in India, in 2014, I worked with a non-profit organization called Grammangal. I found Grammangal\u2019s school in Pune, the Learning Home as a pedagogical site, recognizes, respects, nurtures, and celebrates every child. In contrast with mainstream schools, the Learning Home is a place of learning where education is conceived of as a life-long pursuit rather than reproduction of standardized content. This dissertation attempts to examine the experiences of individuals at this pedagogical site in order to understand the curriculum, place, and design at the Learning Home. By examining the experiences of the educators, facilitators, and children, I hoped to understand what constitutes their experience of the Learning Home, and how this understanding might inform other pedagogical settings. \nI visited India in 2015 to conduct my ethnographic case-study of the Learning Home. My primary sources of data are fieldwork observations, interviews, and analysis of Grammangal documents. I used a detailed and intensive data analytical approach to examine the participants\u2019 lived experiences. From the analysis of my data, I came to the conclusion that the most dominant aspects of my participants\u2019 experiences of the Learning Home are engaged relationships and a sense of personal growth. Based on these findings I propose the curriculum at the Learning Home can be understood as engaged curriculum. \nThe central finding of this study suggests the curricular experiences of educators, facilitators, and children are enriching and empowering when curriculum is understood as a creative endeavor. Additionally, engaged curriculum, or curriculum designed as a response to the individuals and the pedagogical site, creates a meaningful experience for the children and facilitators. I argue that facilitators or teachers and children or students can recognize and respond to the curricular potential of objects, place, people, and entities around them when they are empowered by creative agency.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13978], "author_name_tesi": "Thatte, Asavari ", "last_name_ssi": "Thatte", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Asavari", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Art Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["B.

This global environmental change has numerous direct and indirect effects on species that can exert novel pressures. In some cases organisms must adapt to these changes or face extirpation or extinction. Understanding the diversity and extent of these effects of global change, and the processes by which species adapt to it, is critical to future conservation and can provide important insights into ecological and evolutionary processes. \nMy dissertation addresses questions about the effects imposed by invasive species on native species and how native species adapt to associated novel pressures by using a system of native fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) subject to differing levels of exposure to an invasive predatory fire ant (Solenopsis invicta). In the southeastern United States, fence lizard populations have adapted to this novel predator via an increase in anti-ant behaviors, including twitching and fleeing which promote escape from and removal of attacking ants; longer hind limbs which support this behavior; and a heightened stress response.\nNovel pressures induced by invasive species may include lethal (e.g. predation, injury) and sublethal (e.g. altered energy or habitat availability) effects. The nature of these effects may vary with characteristics of an organism (e.g., sex, age, size) and history of exposure to the invader.  I explored how the effects of fire ants on fence lizards varied with life stage of the lizard and their evolutionary exposure (adaptation) to the ants. \nI first investigated the effects of fire ants on the vulnerable life history stage of fence lizard eggs by creating artificial nests in the field and monitoring them daily. I found that fire ants do prey on fence lizard eggs in the field and may predate up to 60% of fence lizard nests in fire ant-invaded areas. Eggs from lizards from fire ant-invaded and -uninvaded sites were equally susceptible to predation, suggesting a lack of adaptation to this threat. I next quantified the effects of fire ants on juvenile and adult lizards from fire ant-invaded and -uninvaded sites by placing them in large field enclosures with natural and reduced densities of fire ants for two weeks. Fire ants reduced survival of adult but not juvenile lizards, regardless of their evolutionary history with fire ants. Juvenile lizards grew less in enclosures with fire ants than in fire ant-free enclosures, but there was no effect of fire ant density on adult growth. This research shows that fire ants have both lethal and sublethal effects on lizards, and that these vary with lizard life stage.\nI conducted field surveys and manipulations to examine the consequences of behavioral adaptations of fence lizards to fire ants. I exposed lizards from fire ant-invaded and -uninvaded sites to encounters with predatory fire ants and non-threatening native ants, and to simulated attacks by a native predator (a taxidermied American Kestrel). While lizards responded similarly to the native predator, lizards from fire ant-invaded sites showed a generalized increase in responsiveness to all ants. While this behavior is adaptive against fire ants, it may also attract attention from native predators as evidenced by my findings of higher injury rates of lizards at fire ant-invaded sites.  At a geographic scale, I found that the presence of fire ants reverses natural latitudinal gradients in behavior, stress responsiveness, and morphology of fence lizards. This implies that fire ants are driving these traits away from historical values that evolved under fire ant-free conditions and suggests potential costs to adapting to fire ants. \nAs a whole, this work shows that invasive species can have broad impacts on native taxa, and that these impacts may vary with the life stage of affected native species and the degree to which they have adapted to the invader. Adaptive responses by native species may be strong enough to reverse pre-existing latitudinal clines in relevant traits over large portions of an affected species\u2019 range. However, while native species can adapt to novel invaders, these adaptations may incur also costs that should be considered when assessing population persistence and management in the face of these increasing perturbations.

More importantly however, this growth is enhanced by the increasing needs of security and control systems used in heavily trafficked areas such as airports, transportation hubs and public buildings. Human face detection in real-time video is one of the most important applications in the field. Performed mostly in software so far, it has not been applied in real-time video frame rates. With today\u2019s technology however, we are capable of designing hardware platforms to perform face detection in real-time video and allow for deployment of multiple cameras to be used for detection. Multi-camera face detection offers significant cost cutting solutions for deploying a surveillance mechanism consisting of multiple cameras and a single high-speed platform. Such a platform, however, must provide reliable data transmission from each camera to the base station; as such, an error correction mechanism which achieves excellent block performance (capable of detecting and correcting large chunks of data) and operates at high-throughput is necessary.\nThis thesis presents a framework for an embedded face detection platform for digital surveillance systems, including reliable video transmission. Firstly, the design of a Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) Decoder is presented. The decoder architecture is suitable for providing a reliable and high-bandwidth communications channel between multiple cameras and the base station.  Next, this thesis focuses on explorations for hardware architectures for face detection algorithms. One of the most popular face detection algorithms is the AdaBoost classification technique, offering significant advantages in terms of speed and accuracy over other algorithms. Given the advantages of AdaBoost, this thesis presents the design of an architecture which performs face detection using AdaBoost, achieving high frame rates in conditions where the corresponding software approach slows significantly. The AdaBoost technique however demands a large number of hardware resources, hence an alternative method, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based face detection is investigated. The proposed architecture designed to implement ANN based face detection, processes 24 frames per second and is presented along with an FPGA prototype implementation. ANNs are also used in several other applications other than face detection, such as face recognition which usually follows face detection. As such, the design of an ANN architecture using Networks-On-Chip is presented next. The presented architecture can be used to perform face detection using ANNs, as well as several other ANN applications. All presented architectures achieve high frame rates, and maintain detection accuracy comparable to software implementations.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6167], "author_name_tesi": "Theocharides, Theocharis ", "last_name_ssi": "Theocharides", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Theocharis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Yuan Xie", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "Wayne Wolf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Chair", "Yuan Xie, Committee Member", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member", "Wayne Wolf, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["face detection", "embedded systems", "hardware implementations"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF LEARNING THE STRUCTURE STRATEGY VIA WEB-BASED TRAINING OR CLASSROOM TRAINING ON THE RECALL OF NEAR AND FAR TRANSFER TEXTS.\n", "id": "7252", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1860", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-09-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The study examined the effects of two methods for training college students in a reading strategy: web-based and traditional/classroom training.

The key questions that are addressed in this dissertation are: 1) does the LEOADS process promote peroxide generation and DBTO2 generation? (2) What is the possible sulfur removal pathway over TiO2-ZrO2 under light irradiation? and (3) what is the role of TiO2-ZrO2 in the LEOADS process? \n\tThe first part of this dissertation focuses on investigating the performance of the LEOADS process compared to the one-step adsorptive desulfurization and the multi-step photo-oxidative desulfurization. The LEOADS of DBT/diesel was carried out using a UV-Vis light together with air bubbling in the presence of TiO2-ZrO2 adsorbent. Under this process, the desulfurization performance increased to almost 9 fold greater than the conventional one-step adsorptive desulfurization, and increased by 1.4 fold compared to the two-step photo-oxidative desulfurization. Peroxide was found to be generated under light irradiation and play an important role in promoting the oxidation of DBT to DBTO2. Adding 20 mol% of Zr into TiO2 enhanced the LEAODS performance by 17 times larger than that using pure TiO2. \n\tIn the second part, the oxidation pathway of DBT on the surface of the TiO2-ZrO2 is discussed in conjunction with the LEOADS process. The study of the oxidation pathway of DBT suggests that the improved desulfurization performance of the LEAODS process can be attributed to the enhanced oxidation reaction of DBT to DBTO2 due to the peroxide in situ generated under light irradiation and the photooxidation of DBT on the surface of the TiO2-ZrO2.\n\tThe last part of this dissertation focuses on the characterization of the Ti1-xZrxO2 (x=0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 0.5, and 10.0) mixed oxides. The effects of Zr on the structure, band gap energies, and surface properties of the Ti1-xZrxO2 mixed oxides were determined by using XRD, NH3-TPD, UV-diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, XPS, SEM-EDX, and N2 adsorption desorption. The relationship between the characteristics of the Ti1-xZrxO2 and their desulfurization performance under the LEOADS and the two-step photo-oxidative desulfurization were examined. The results in this part revealed that the Ti0.9Zr0.1O2 provided the best performance per unit surface area under both the LEOADS and the two-step photo-oxidative desulfurization processes. The superior performance of the Ti0.9Zr0.1O2 was due to its high photocatalytic activity for DBT oxidation and the suitable adsorption sites for DBTO2. \n\tBased on the findings of this work, the following research is recommended for future study: 1) study the impact of the structure of alkyl aromatic on peroxide generation under light irradiation, 2) computational study of DBT oxidation on the surface of the TiO2-ZrO2 in the presence of peroxide and molecular oxygen, 3) study of the impact of light wavelength on peroxide generation and photooxidation of DBT using TiO2-ZrO2. These further studies can help designing a photocatalytic adsorbent and process that can drive the removal of refractory sulfur compounds in diesel fuel even faster. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11103], "author_name_tesi": "Thepwatee, Sukanya ", "last_name_ssi": "Thepwatee", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sukanya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Fuel Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Chunshan Song", "Randy Lee Vander Wal", "Xiaoxing Wang", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Dissertation Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Committee Chair", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Committee Member", "Xiaoxing Wang, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Desulfurization", "Diesel fuel", "Photooxidation", "Titanium dioxide", "Zirconium dioxide", "Adsorption", "Dibenzothiophene"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "TEACHING COMMUNICATIVE TURN TAKING USING THE IPAD\u00a9 TO PROMOTE SOCIAL INTERACTION FOR PRESCHOOL CHILDREN WITH CCN AND THEIR PEERS", "id": "13343mct168", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13343", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Positive interactions with peers impact future success in many domains, including language development and relationship development.  Children with complex communication needs (CCN), especially those with characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), confront many barriers to successful interactions with peers.  These include personal barriers, those specifically related to the individual child, and environmental barriers, or barriers related to the people and objects in the child\u2019s environment.  Proximity to children without disabilities alone seems to have little effect on peer interaction, which leaves children with CCN at risk for social isolation.  Intervention is needed to support children with CCN who have characteristics of ASD to participate in peer interaction.  In this study, a multiple probe across dyads research design was used to evaluate the effects of a peer interaction intervention on the frequency of symbolic communicative turns taken by children with CCN and characteristics of ASD in interactions with peers.  Percentage of total turns and joint engagement were also investigated to assess the quality of the interaction.  The multicomponent intervention included: (a) provision of a communication app on an iPad as augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) and (b) dyadic turn-taking training.  Four of the five participants with CCN met the criteria for completing training within 9 training sessions and increased communicative turn taking with peers in sessions without adult support. The fifth participant showed increased turn taking during training sessions, but this did not result in turn increases during independent sessions with peers.  The results from this study provide support for the use of AAC as an environmental support combined with dyadic turn-taking training to promote peer interaction for children with CCN and characteristics of ASD.

Instead of developing one product at a time, manufacturing companies are developing families of products to provide enough variety for the marketplace while keeping costs relatively low. Although the benefits of commonality are widely known, many companies are still not taking full advantage of it when developing new products or redesigning existing ones. One reason is the lack of appropriate methods and useful metrics to assess a product family based on commonality and diversity.  This research introduces the first systematic and consistent method to give recommendations during product family redesign using a new commonality index, the Comprehensive Metric for Commonality (CMC).  Unlike most of the research, in which the redesign of a product family proceeds in an ad hoc manner, the proposed method improves accuracy, repeatability and robustness of the results by minimizing user input.  Moreover, the assessment of the design of a product family using the proposed CMC helps designers  resolve the tradeoff between variety and commonality in a product family more thoroughly than with any other existing commonality indices.  To demonstrate and validate the usefulness of the proposed method for product family redesign, it is applied to two industry examples (staplers and valves).  The proposed research (1) provides a step toward achieving an understanding of the relationships between different platform leveraging strategies and the resulting degree of commonality within a product family, and (2) supplies a systematic and consistent method for product family redesign, including product family dissection and recommendations on the redesign.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2187], "author_name_tesi": "Thevenot, Henri Jehan", "last_name_ssi": "Thevenot", "middle_name_ssi": "Jehan", "first_name_ssi": "Henri", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "Robert Carl Voigt", "Madara M Ogot", "Gul Kremer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy William Simpson, Committee Chair", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Member", "Robert Carl Voigt, Committee Member", "Madara M Ogot, Committee Member", "Gul Kremer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Product Family Design", "Product Platform Design", "Commonality Index", "Product Redesign", "Genetic Algorithm", "Product Dissection"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "An Empirical Analysis of Insider Trading in Firms with Violation of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles", "id": "8490", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3946", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The increase in financial statement restatements in recent years has spurred attention from market participants, academics, and regulators. This thesis is motivated by this interest and investigates insider trading in firms with an accounting violation. In this setting, insiders have the choice to trade and realize a potential profit or abstain and limit their legal exposure. \nThe first essay examines the extent to which the ex ante risk of litigation affects insider trading behavior in a sample of firms restating earnings due to revenue recognition issues. Insider selling is decreasing in the estimated litigation, suggesting that insiders consider the legal risk in their trading decisions and forego trades to avoid future negative consequences. Interestingly, the results are driven by insiders of firms where no allegation of fraud emerges. However, insider trades do not seem to affect the probability of litigation ex post. \nThe second essay examines the interesting episodes surrounding a misstatement and its public disclosure and investigates how insider trading changes over the different time periods. My tests detect no abnormal insider trading before and during the misstatement. Starting with the discovery, insiders decrease net selling. This behavior continues well after the public disclosure of the misstatement. \nThese results should be useful to researchers and professionals who are interested in managers\u2019 behavior in firms with accounting problems and litigation as a factor that influences executives\u2019 actions.

In addition, chronic conditions and associated physical disability are increasing, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities. Although the role of psychosocial factors has been acknowledged in promoting development of physical disability, there is a dearth of research examining if chronic stress contributes to disparities. Therefore, three studies examined chronic stress-associated biobehavioral mechanisms that may explain higher rates of disability in black and Mexican American midlife and older adults compared to whites. Data used in these studies were drawn from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a longitudinal survey of a nationally representative sample of US adults over the age of 50.\n\nUsing data from the 2006 HRS wave of data collection, the first study examined differences in prevalence of eight chronic stressors by race/ethnicity and gender. Then, the relationship between number of chronic stressors and number of physical disabilities, measured as difficulty with functional limitations, activities of daily living (ADLs), and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), was tested. Differences in the chronic stress-disability relationship were assessed by race/ethnicity and gender. \n\nBecause unhealthy behaviors may be used as mechanisms to cope with stress, a second study using 2006 HRS data tested if unhealthy behavior-related risk factors\u2014including currently smoking, heavy drinking, and being obese\u2014moderated the relationship between chronic stress and physical disability. The contribution of unhealthy behaviors to racial/ethnic and gender disparities in physical disability outcomes, net of age, SES, and health status, was also assessed.\n\nLastly, a third study assessed if telomere length, a biomarker of cellular age that may shorten from exposure to stress, may be implicated in physical disability development. This study tested the relationship between telomere length measured in 2008 and change in number of physical disabilities across a 6-year study period.\n\nAnalytic results demonstrated that, on average, blacks and Mexican Americans reported more chronic stressors than whites. Overall, chronic stress was positively associated with physical disability. The gap in number of ADLs and IADLs between blacks and whites widened with increasing numbers of chronic stressors, while the number of these disabilities in Mexican Americans was less dependent upon chronic stress. Unhealthy behavioral risk factors moderated the chronic stress-disability relationship for ADLs and IADLs, such that increasing disability and number of chronic stressors were more pronounced in individuals with one or more unhealthy behavioral risks. Lastly, individuals with longer telomeres accumulated fewer disabilities over time. However, this relationship was found only in adults over 65, and did not depend on race/ethnicity or gender. \n\nResults from these three studies suggest that chronic stress may differentially increase risk for physical disability in blacks, and unhealthy behavioral risks may exacerbate disability development.

This model is validated\nwith DNS for a bimolecular reaction for unmixed initial conditions.\nA widely used PDF mixing model, Interaction by Exchange with Mean (Dopazo, Physics of Fluids,18, 1975) model fails even\nto qualitatively capture the product-reactant correlations, an essential\nstatistic for multi-step chemical reactions, while EDQNM, due to the fact that it retains\nspectral information, is able to do a better job at predicting this statistic.\nWork has been initiated  to include the effect of reaction into the\nmulti-scale mixing model described earlier.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6468], "author_name_tesi": "Thirunavukkarasu, Vaithianathan ", "last_name_ssi": "Thirunavukkarasu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vaithianathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lance R Collins", "Ali Borhan", "Michael F Modest", "Themis Matsoukas", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lance R Collins, Committee Chair", "Ali Borhan, Committee Chair", "Michael F Modest, Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["turbulence", "combustion", "mixing model", "PDF methods", "Turbulence-Radiation Interaction"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPING A FORMALISM FOR GIBSON\u2019S AFFORDANCES USING COLORED PETRI NETS\n\n", "id": "7901", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2413", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-01-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Gibson (1979/1986) proposed affordance theory to represent and model what the environment offers an animal for good or ill.

A Colored Petri Net (CPN)-based model is proposed as a suitable instrument for developing this formalism. A mathematical model, graphical representation and computational model for this CPN model is developed within the context of a driving problem. The affordances offered by this driving environment are analogous to those offered by a set of highway lanes. A formative analysis technique is also introduced along with an overall data analysis procedure to analyze the precision of the actualized actions and the niche of lane affordances that become available to the driver within the highway lane-driver system. \n\nAn empirical study was conducted using a team of two expert drivers to elicit various behaviors that would help resolve the precision of the CPN model. Four output metrics were defined that represent the deviation between the empirical human performance and model predicted data: lane position, turn direction of the subject driver\u2019s vehicle, time taken by the subject driver to move from the starting lane to the exit lane and the total utilization of the exit lane by the subject driver.

Research shows that the desire and tradition for reminiscing can be traced back to early civilizations where the elders of the community were responsible to know and share the history of their community (Butler, 1995; Cruikshank, 1990). However times have changed and the oral tradition of reminiscing has faded into an occasional telling of stories that are heard on special occasions. This points to a clear need for more opportunities to reminisce, and concepts from the field of Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) may help to re-enliven the customs of reminiscing about one\u2019s personal or shared histories. For example many sites allow individuals to share photos (Flickr, Facebook, Photobucket), movies (YouTube), and small details of their daily lives (Facebook, Twitter). However, none of these systems were developed specifically for the support of reminiscence activities, nor do any of them cater to this type of sharing. Previous research has explored systems that allow children and elders to develop oral histories (J. B. Ellis & Bruckman, 2001); that enable community members to construct an online community history (Carroll, Convertino, Farooq, & Rosson, 2011; Carroll, et al., 2009); and that support creation of biographies on DVDs to assist elders with declining memories (K. L. Smith, Crete-Nishihata, Damianakis, Baecker, & Marziali, 2009). However there is still relatively little known about whether and how older adults might want to reminisce in a digital environment, particularly in an era when Web 2.0 has greatly expanded options for content generation and authoring. It is in this context that this study looks at means for digital reminiscing.\nThis research is motivated by two complementary research elements: an interest in the human-computer interaction (HCI) needs and preferences for old adult individuals, and a design research interest in digital tools for reminiscing. To address the unique needs and preferences of this population, I followed a scenario-based design approach to analyze design requirements, develop design themes and corresponding prototypes; throughout I used claims analysis to evaluate the hypothetical impacts of key themes in the scenarios (Carroll, 2000, 2002).

The combination of land use and droughts has increased fire frequency, intensity, and extent in the region. Various plant traits can either limit or promote flammability, as demonstrated in many seasonally dry environments (e.g. Mediterranean shrublands), which are home to species that are adapted to frequent fire. However, little research has been done to associate flammability with the leaf traits of humid tropical forest species that are experiencing fire with greater frequency and severity than historically recorded. In this study, the leaf traits and consequent burning characteristics of seventeen species abundant in a transitional forest plot in Mato Grosso, Brazil were analyzed through controlled combustion experiments and trait measurements. Principal components analysis and linear regression were employed to compare leaf traits and their ability to predict flammability. The results reported herein show that these species demonstrate variability in flammability. Individual leaf surface area and leaf volume were found to be the most significant predictors of flammability among these species. The most flammable species were those with thin, lightweight leaves that become arranged in loosely packed, highly aerated fuelbeds and would be able to drive rapidly moving, high intensity fire across the forest floor, consuming a larger amount of fuel. The less flammable species were characterized by thick, heavy leaves that create dense fuelbeds, potentially inhibiting fire spread and the overall consumption of available fuels. Analyzing the dynamics between leaf traits and plant flammability with forest composition, successional trajectories and future fire behavior could lead to an examination of overall landscape effects in which certain species with fire-adaptive strategies could outcompete more fire-sensitive species, therefore influencing future fire regimes. Furthermore, given a scenario of increasing fire, this knowledge can lead to more effective conservation and land use policies in tropical regions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9686], "author_name_tesi": "Thissell, Amoreena Lynne", "last_name_ssi": "Thissell", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynne", "first_name_ssi": "Amoreena", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Balch"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Balch, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Amazonia", "Brazil", "fire ecology", "flammability", "combustion experiments", "tropical forests", "forest fragmentation"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Effects of symbol arrangement and background color cues on reaction time and accuracy: Implications for AAC design for young children", "id": "22381", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10027", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Children who are unable to use spoken language to meet their communication needs often benefit from aided augmentative and alternative communication (AAC).  The design of the visual display may influence the ability of the child to communicate effectively.  A display that supports efficient visual processing may facilitate success, whereas a display that is not optimal may create unintended barriers to success.  However, there is limited evidence guiding clinical decision-making regarding visual display design.  This is especially true regarding clinical practices targeted at supporting syntactically correct multi-symbol constructions.  Clinicians often arrange symbols in groupings by part of speech as well as color-code the symbol background.  In order to address this research to practice gap, the current study implemented a 2 x 2 factorial design to investigate the influence of symbol arrangement and background color on response time and task accuracy.  The experiment measured the response time and accuracy of children with typical development, ages 3 \u00bd to 7 years as they used symbols to repeat spoken sentences.  Participants received an auditory-visual stimulus (e.g., spoken sentence matching a photograph) and then touched the symbols within a 4 x 4 array that represented the stimuli.  The participants completed the task across four conditions that varied the presence and absence of symbol arrangement and background color.   A grammaticality judgment task assessed participants\u2019 metalinguistic awareness to determine if this skill moderated the relationship between the features and outcome measures.  Symbol arrangement influenced responding, in the participants under age 5.  These participants were faster and more accurate when using displays that had symbol arrangement than when using displays that did not have symbol arrangement.  Additionally, individual level analyses illustrated the younger participants (under age 5) were on average 4.3 seconds faster when using displays with symbol arrangement as opposed to no symbol arrangement.  As a group, younger participants demonstrated greater accuracy when symbols had a white background compared to colored background.  Children over 5 years old demonstrated no effects of symbol arrangement or background color.

It has been recognized that efforts to address only one part of a systemic problem by neglecting other inherently inter-linked aspects may not lead to desirable and sustainable outcomes. The objective of this paper is to analyze the cross impact of one on the other. The influence of electricity prices and water prices on the electricity and water consumption are observed and it is seen that there is a noticeable decrease in the demand level as price increases. A supply chain network perspective has been developed and the behavior of various decision-makers such as fuel suppliers, power generators, distributors, transmitters and the consumers were considered. In this paper, we consider dairy industry as an instance of demand market. A spreadsheet tool using goal programming technique, calculates the electricity consumption and fuel consumption using dairy demand data as the input. It also calculates the corresponding water consumption in the PJM (Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland) area. The variations in demand in the dairy industry are reflected in the water consumption. Furthermore, a distribution network is designed where distribution centers for fluid milk products are strategically positioned and the corresponding shipping costs and greenhouse gas emissions are calculated. Variations in the shipping cost and greenhouse gas emissions based on the number of distribution centers are studied. It is seen that increasing the number of distribution centers, increases the total cost, but decreases the shipping cost and the greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand decreasing the greenhouse gas emissions, increases the total cost to almost the same extent and reduces the shipping cost.

Nanotechnology continually emerges as a plausible area of research in which these demands can be met.  Specifically, the role of magnetic nanoparticles in new sensors, biomedical, materials and separations technologies has seen extraordinary growth over the past 15 years.  \n   With this growth has also emerged new expectations of the control necessary to form these advanced materials and the challenges faced with their syntheses.  For magnetic nanoparticles these challenges exist in the realm of particle surface chemistry and functionalization.  The field as a whole has given enormous attention to the shape, size and monodispersity of magnetic nanomaterials while leaving their surface functionality comparatively untouched.  The following chapters seek to address the development of new general surface chemistries for monolayer protected nanoparticles while envisioning their eventual adaptation to magnetic nanoparticles.  \n   In this regard, Au nanoparticles are used as a model system with which to develop general organic transformations on monolayer protected nanoparticles.  Au nanoparticles are ideal for this purpose owing to the fact that a large volume of literature exists detailing the particles physical and reactive properties.  In addition, unlike magnetic nanoparticles, NMR spectroscopy may be used to directly investigate products still bound to the nanoparticle surface.  Two new surface chemistries for Au nanoparticles, 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and Grignard reagent addition to Weinreb amides are introduced as general methods by which to append multiple functionalities to Au nanoparticles.\n   Chapter 2 describes uncatalyzed 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition as a mild general method by which to attach, electroactive, fluorescent, and solubilizing species to the surface of small (~ 2 nm) Au nanoparticles bearing mixed monolayers of decane thiol and 11-azido-&#969;-undecane thiol.  A modest reaction of the azide terminated Au nanoparticles with functional small molecules bearing an alkyl ketone moiety is observed in dioxane after a 60 h period at room temperature.  In addition detailed kinetic studies of the reaction are presented in chapter 3, establishing the kinetic trends of the cycloaddition on the surface of Au nanoparticles.  These studies revealed an analogous rate of reaction on the particle surface as compared to free reactants in solution.  Furthermore, the azide surface concentration was found to exert more control over the extent of reaction than the reactive termini's proximity to the thiol monolayer.\n   Addition of alkylmagnesium halides or Grignard reagents to Au nanoparticles bearing mixed monolayers of methyl and N-methoxy-N'-methyl amides (Weinreb amides) was investigated in chapter 4.  The reaction was found to produce excellent surface yields on short time scales.  Additionally, the effect of the organometallic species on the stability of the particles was assessed.  Small organometallic nucleophiles were found to bypass the monolayer causing significant particle decomposition while bulkier nucleophiles caused no decomposition with respect to controls.\n   In chapter 5, trifluoroethyl ester chemistry for surface functionalization of Au and FePt nanoparticles is adopted for the synthesis of pH sensitive magnetic nanoparticles using fluorescein amine.  A modification of the method of standard addition to quantitate the fluorescein amine surface concentration is presented.  Initial studies suggest that the particle fluorophore conjugate quantum yield remained unchanged with respect to the small molecule and that the pH sensitivity is reversible over a biologically relevant pH range. Finally, future goals for these studies are suggested and placed in the context of broader impacts.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1015], "author_name_tesi": "Thode, Christopher Jay", "last_name_ssi": "Thode", "middle_name_ssi": "Jay", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Scott T Phillips", "Richard W Ordway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams, Dissertation Advisor", "Mary Elizabeth Williams, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Scott T Phillips, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Grignard", "FT-IR", "Au nanoparticle", "click", "Monolayer"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Self-powered Fluorescence Assays in Paper-based Microfluidic Devices", "id": "15650", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7954", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Point-of-care (POC) diagnostics designed for use in resource-limited areas, such as developing regions of the world, are an important component for providing health care.

Fluorescence assays are a popular platform for assays, but they require a source of power, which adds limitations to their use in POC diagnostic assays in microfluidic devices. In this research, we hypothesized that by incorporating a galvanic cell into the layers of a paper-based microfluidic device, we could make an on-chip power source that meets the requirements for use in a resource-limited setting.

We demonstrated the key elements and determined the analytical parameters that are needed to design and build fluidic batteries (which is what we call them).
