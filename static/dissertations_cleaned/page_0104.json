This study conducts a spatial analysis of Philadelphia\u2019s charter schools with data from the 2007 school year.  It extends earlier charter school research by using advanced measures of exposure to examine spatial relationship of Philadelphia\u2019s charter schools\u2019 to the city\u2019s racial and social groups.  This spatial analysis answers three questions.  First, are charter schools spatially clustered or equally distributed across Philadelphia? Second, is exposure to charter schools associated with an area\u2019s racial, social, and ecological characteristics? And finally, do spatially advanced measures of exposure provide a better understanding of the locational behavior of charter schools in relation to neighborhood demographic characteristics?  Using a spatially informed measure of exposure, I find that charter schools are clustered across Philadelphia, particularly in the city\u2019s most disadvantaged areas.  Race-based associations to charter school exposure are mainly explained by socioeconomic factors with the exception of areas with concentrated white populations, which exhibit the lowest levels of exposure.  Additionally, newer residential areas have less exposure to charter schools.

Homeownership is emphasized because of its importance in establishing positive legacies crucial to social mobility of subsequent generations.  The dissertation addresses three questions related to immigrant homeownership.  First, how are immigrants and subsequent generations faring in the transition to first-time homeownership? Second, how does immigrant homeowner attainment differ in non-traditional settlement areas commonly described as \u201cnew destinations?\u201d  Lastly, how does immigrant homeownership influence immigrant children\u2019s educational attainment?\nThe dissertation consists of three substantive studies.  The first is a longitudinal analysis of the transition to first-time homeownership among a cohort of youths followed from 1979 to 2009 using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY, 1979).  In particular, it examines ethno-generational group differences in first-time homeownership over an observation period that spans thirty years while testing theories of straight-line and segmented assimilation.  The second study assesses patterns of immigrant homeownership in traditional and non-traditional settlement areas using data from the 2011 American Community Survey (ACS) to examine homeownership rates among foreign-born Mexicans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans.  The final study investigates whether homeownership influences social mobility among subsequent generations using data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS) to examine the educational attainment of a variety of immigrant groups from San Diego, California.  \nI find immigrant homeownership is shaped by a variety of factors beyond socioeconomic resources, including settlement area and life-course characteristics. In addition, racial and ethnic group variation in homeownership rates exists despite controlling for individual factors.  Furthermore, the inequalities in homeownership may influence the mobility of future generations as I found homeownership to have a positive influence on children\u2019s educational outcomes.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9067], "author_name_tesi": "Sanchez, Luis Alberto", "last_name_ssi": "Sanchez", "middle_name_ssi": "Alberto", "first_name_ssi": "Luis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ralph Salvador Oropesa", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa", "Barrett Alan Lee", "John Iceland", "Suet Ling Pong"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ralph Salvador Oropesa, Dissertation Advisor", "Ralph Salvador Oropesa, Committee Chair", "Barrett Alan Lee, Committee Member", "John Iceland, Committee Member", "Suet Ling Pong, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Immigrant Assimilation", "Homeownership", "Latinos", "Immigration"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Limit Design Of Reinforced Masonry Walls For \nearthquake-resistant Construction\n", "id": "15545", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7231", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A Limit Design methodology is presented for the design of Special Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls subjected to in-plane seismic forces.

Even though Hispanics are expected to live longer than non-Hispanic whites, they spend more years living with a disability. Elderly Hispanics are a socially vulnerable group that faces particular financial needs as they tend to have low educational attainment, high levels of poverty, and are more likely to lack health insurance. Understanding the socioeconomic factors associated with physical disability among Hispanics is critical in order to inform public policy to address the needs of this population. I use pooled data from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2008-2012 to examine differences in self-reported physical disability among Hispanic immigrants. First, I determine whether the burden of physical disability is evenly distributed among Hispanic immigrant subgroups, after accounting for demographic and socioeconomic factors. Secondly, I examine whether the relationship between duration of residence in the country and physical disability varies by Hispanic immigrant subgroup. Finally, I explore whether any association between duration of residence and physical limitations can be explained by demographic and socioeconomic differences among Hispanics. Multivariate logistic regressions indicated that there are significant differences among Hispanic immigrant subgroups with Cubans, Central Americans, Mexicans, and Dominicans being more disadvantaged than South Americans. The results indicate that there are little or no significant differences in physical disability among recent arrivals. However, among immigrants with longer residence in the country, Mexicans have higher odds of reporting physical disability than any other immigrant group. While socioeconomic factors, educational attainment, income-to-poverty ratio, occupation, race, and English ability differences reduce the association between length of residence and physical disability, these factors did not explain the observed associations. This study demonstrated that there are important differences among Hispanic immigrant subgroups in physical disability and in their health trajectories. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10085], "author_name_tesi": "Sanchez Quiros, Susana M", "last_name_ssi": "Sanchez Quiros", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Susana", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jennifer Lynne Van Hook", "Michelle Lynn Frisco", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jennifer Lynne Van Hook, Thesis Advisor", "Michelle Lynn Frisco, Thesis Advisor", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hispanic", "immigrants", "disability"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A CURRICULAR POLICY FORTY YEARS IN THE MAKING: \nTHE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY COURSE IN THE PHILADELPHIA SCHOOL DISTRICT\n", "id": "9545", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1947", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "African American students are among the lowest achieving minority groups in the United States public school system. Multicultural education literature argues that such a curriculum could help increase the academic achievement of Black students; however, there is very little evidence of this claim. In 2005, the Philadelphia School Reform Commission mandated that all high school students take a newly developed African American history (AAH) course as graduation requirement beginning with class of 2009, after 40 years of community request for such a course. Through a qualitative case study research approach, and using the theory of social construction of target populations (Schneider & Ingram, 1993) and a framework that explains common impediments to educational policy implementation (Shulman, 1983), this study seeks to examine why the District implemented the AAH course as a graduate requirement, how the District designed the course, and  how the course was implemented by social studies teachers. \nThe use of the theory of social construction of target populations provided a framework for understanding the decisions District administrators made in regards to requiring the course and how they designed the course. The findings from this portion of the study suggest that the District administrators\u2019 goals for requiring the course focused on their social construction of Black youth, but the design of the course focused on the perceptions of teachers\u2019 strengths and weaknesses. The administrators\u2019 assessment of teachers\u2019 capacities contributed to a disconnect between what teachers needed to teach the course and what they were provided. Lee Shulman\u2019s (1983) impediments to policy implementation provided a framework to examine and explain the challenges teachers experienced in implementing the curricular policy. This dissertation concludes that the Philadelphia community won a political victory in terms of the inclusion of the AAH course in the District\u2019s curriculum. However, as a result of the disconnect between the administrators and teachers, the course was implemented poorly and cannot be considered an educational victory. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1929], "author_name_tesi": "Sanders, Felicia Charron", "last_name_ssi": "Sanders", "middle_name_ssi": "Charron", "first_name_ssi": "Felicia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dana Lynn Mitra", "Dana Lynn Mitra", "David Alexander Gamson", "Kimberly Griffin", "Emilie Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dana Lynn Mitra, Dissertation Advisor", "Dana Lynn Mitra, Committee Chair", "David Alexander Gamson, Committee Member", "Kimberly Griffin, Committee Member", "Emilie Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["policy evaluation", "policy implementation", "multicultural education", "urban education"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Seizure Detection for Investigation of Cerebral Malaria as a Cause for Epilepsy", "id": "15693", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7304", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\n\nMalaria is a widespread problem in much of the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world, where in Africa it accounts for nearly half of health expenditures, and is the leading cause of death in children under 5 years of age [3]. Clinical studies have clearly linked cerebral malaria infections with seizure disorders in children, and malaria endemic regions see a higher incidence in children with epilepsy. Epilepsy is characterized by chronically reoccurring seizures. While these two disorders have been clearly linked statistically, no one to our knowledge has conducted an investigation using electrographic recordings to verify seizure occurrences in an animal model of post-malarial epilepsy. \nThe malaria parasite causes damage by parasitizing erythrocytes and causing them to adhere to other erythrocytes and the walls of microvasculature. The adherence of blood cells to each other and the vasculature causes blockages, reduced blood flow, hypoxia, and eventually neural necrosis. Many combinations of these symptoms can cause seizures. Due to the variance in where the blockages can occur, many patients can have neural damage in a wide range of locations, which makes it difficult to target seizure foci and even define consistent seizure traits across malaria patients.\nIn this thesis, we propose a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) based seizure detector for the analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) data in a rodent model investigation of cerebral malaria as a cause for epilepsy. LDA has been shown to be an effective classification tool for multivariate data such as EEG. This is ideal for our need to classify different seizure types with variable spectral dynamics due to the likely variance of seizure foci across animals. We also present the necessary preprocessing and signal analysis methods needed to optimally classify seizure data in this cerebral malaria-epilepsy investigation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7280], "author_name_tesi": "Sanders, Mario Frederick", "last_name_ssi": "Sanders", "middle_name_ssi": "Frederick", "first_name_ssi": "Mario", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Schiff", "Bruce Gluckman", "Patrick James Drew"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Schiff, Thesis Advisor", "Bruce Gluckman, Thesis Advisor", "Patrick James Drew, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Linear Discriminant Analysis", "Seizure Detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "MAKING A GOOD (BAD) IMPRESSION:\nAN EXAMINATION OF DISPOSITION THEORY\u2019S \nAND THE CONTINUUM MODEL\u2019S TENETS \nOF IMPRESSION FORMATION\n", "id": "7121", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4367", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": " Individuals are constantly faced with the need to form impressions of others they encounter.

There is reason to believe that viewers rely on information and form impressions of media characters in much the same way they do interpersonally.

For instance, the release rate of ions during dissolution is scaled to remove differences in the available surface area. Typically, BET or geometric surface area measurements are the convention to calculate surface area. However, these methods do not necessarily report on the reactive surface area of a mineral, which provides a chemically-sensitive measure of surface area. The reactive surface area of clay minerals can be particularly challenging to quantify as they have a layered structure with two distinct surfaces: edge sites and basal planes. The edge sites dissolve preferentially compared to basal planes. When clay minerals are weathered, the reactive surface area decreases as edge sites are depleted. \n\nThroughout this thesis, the objective was to develop and demonstrate that advanced experimental tools can be used to predict reactive surface area across spatial scales for clay minerals. To measure reactive surface area, the probe molecule (3,3,3-trifluoropropyl) dimethylchlorosilane (TFS) is attached to lone Q3Si hydroxyl sites and the 19F spins in the TFS-treated samples are then quantified using 19F magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The quantification of the number of reactive hydroxyl sites per gram of sample is proportional to the reactive surface area of each mineral, particularly the edge sites for clay minerals.\n\nBatch dissolution experiments of kaolinite were conducted at 21 \u00b0C and pH 3. During the course of three months, dissolution rate decreased over time. BET specific surface area measurements did not reflect changes in dissolution rate. However, the selective nature of TFS attachment has been utilized to demonstrate the changes in reactive surface area are tied to a concomitant decrease in the rates of Si and Al release into solution. Similar studies were conducted with bentonite, a montmorillonite-rich clay that contained an amorphous silica phase. The silica phase was identified to be opal-CT and was not observed to contribute the dissolution rate of bentonite. Similar results to the kaolinite experiments were obtained in which the decreasing dissolution rate was correlated with changes in reactive surface area. The quantity of reactive sites can be used to predict the dissolution rates of kaolinite and montmorillonite.\n\nDissolution rates in the field can be several orders of magnitude slower than rates for the same mineral when dissolved in the laboratory. Several factors including reactive surface area can account for the differences in dissolution rates. The solid-state NMR proxy for reactive surface area was used to determine how surface reactivity impacts the rates of mineral transformations at the Shale Hills catchment, a Critical Zone Observatory located in central Pennsylvania. The reactive surface area was quantified for a series of soils collected along a downslope planar transect at Shale Hills. Variables that were investigated to explain the changes in reactive surface area include soil mineralogy, particle size, pore formation, and soil location and depth. Surface reactivity to the TFS probe molecule was a function of the extent that the soils have been weathered rather than soil age. Surface reactivity increases as soils are weathered from parent mineral, as particle size decreases, and as extended pore networks are formed. \n\nDissolution rates of the soil samples were not a function of reactive surface area determined with TFS quantification. Rather dissolution rates for the clay minerals were all the same within error, suggesting that reactive surface area does not vary substantially over long time scales in field weathered shales. This conclusion signifies that while it is still important to quantify reactive surface area, it may be not be necessary to consider how reactive surface area changes for field weathered clays when accounting for discrepancies between laboratory and field dissolution rates. \n\nOur NMR proxy for reactive surface area has laid the groundwork for future studies using chemical methods to quantify reactive surface area, which will enable a more accurate prediction of laboratory and field dissolution. These studies indicate that the use of a chemical method to quantify reactive surface area can be successfully applied to simple system. However, the quantification of reactive surface area for multimineralic systems requires the quantification of both the quantity and reactivity of the reactive sites present. Future studies into the use of chemical probes for quantifying reactive surface area should emphasize a multifaceted approach to quantify the types and distribution of reactive sites and how the distribution of reactive sites evolves over time.

The design of the study utilizes a cyber ethnographic approach to examine the online sub-culture of women learners as they engage with the THG franchise and each other in virtual and physical spaces.  Data collection consists of in-depth interviews with 10 participants, online observations of fan activities, and review of 320+ relevant cultural documents and artifacts.  I employ a fantasy theme analysis of the data collected, along with conducting a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of the film adaptations of the THG series and THG fandom.\n\tThe findings of the fantasy theme analysis, detailed in Chapter Four, identify four main themes: a) a central legend/myth is key to a shared vision among fans; b) the hero\u2019s journey becomes internalized by fans as they advocate for causes important to them; c) the fight for justice transcends a focus on the individual and moves to desire for collective change; and d) revolution is a moral, political, and immediate game for fans, with very real consequences for themselves and society.  These fantasy themes coalesce into a larger rhetorical vision shared among fan activists, as they work for a more just and equal world.  \n\tThe CDA yields four additional themes, providing added understanding to the main fantasy themes.  The CDA themes, detailed in Chapter Five, include: a) both the films and fan activists transform the person/character of Katniss Everdeen into a legend and myth; b) the films create a shared currency consisting of symbol, salute, and song, which fans exchange in support of one another; c) both District citizens in the films and women fan activists personalize the risk and reward of rebellion; and d) in the reel and real spaces, fan activists hack THG narrative and use media to create a hunger for justice among the larger population.  The study ends with implications of the findings for theory and practice, as well as outlines the limitations of the study and makes suggestions for future research.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13849], "author_name_tesi": "Sandoe, Kathryn Jeanne", "last_name_ssi": "Sandoe", "middle_name_ssi": "Jeanne", "first_name_ssi": "Kathryn", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robin Redmon Wright", "Robin Redmon Wright", "Elizabeth J.

Fire scars were identified and recorded for each sample, and fire return intervals were calculated for the time periods before and during active fire suppression.  Mean fire return intervals prior to active fire suppression activities (1935) ranged from 5.5 to 23 years for each stand and increased to 9 to 67 years during active fire suppression.  Fire wounding occurred primarily in the dormant season of late autumn to early spring.  Tree diameter at time of fire wounding ranged from 1.5 to 101 cm for all fire events, with most averages ranging from 7.1 to 29.7 cm, suggesting most trees survived fire-scarring at relatively small diameters.  Superposed epoch analysis (SEA) showed that mean Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) departure values were significantly lower one year prior to the fire years.\nAnnual growth rings were cross-dated, measured, and master chronologies were constructed from detrended annual radial growth for the dominant species in each stand.  Northern pin oak yielded the highest annual growth followed by white pine, red oak, and red pine.  Percent growth change determined for five years before and five years after fire events showed that species exhibiting a 25% increase in growth following fire occurred entirely in the nineteenth century, while percent growth change in the twentieth century did not increase beyond this threshold, possibly due to differences in stand structure.\nCircular nested vegetation plots were placed in 14 stands in order to analyze forest composition, structure and regeneration.  Importance values show 8 of 14 stands were dominated by white pine, while red oak and red maple (Acer rubrum) each ranked highest in importance value in two stands.  Red maple was often recorded as having the highest density of trees sampled per stand.  Sapling and seedling layers both consisted primarily of red maple and sugar maple (Acer saccharum).  This study suggests that fire was an important factor in the perpetuation of pine and oak species which are dominant throughout Menominee County.  As a result of fire suppression activities, forest composition is shifting from species such as pine and oak that thrive in pyrogenic environments, to fire-sensitive species such as maple, beech (Fagus grandifolia), basswood (Tilia Americana), and birch (Betula spp.).  Such changes in forest composition could result in decreased flammability of forest fuels and eventually a complete change in the historical fire regime of pine and oak forests of Menominee County. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [622], "author_name_tesi": "Sands, Benjamin Allen", "last_name_ssi": "Sands", "middle_name_ssi": "Allen", "first_name_ssi": "Benjamin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marc David Abrams", "Marc David Abrams"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marc David Abrams, Thesis Advisor", "Marc David Abrams, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["radial growth", "fire history", "forest ecology"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Product Resynthesis: An Optimal End-of-life Strategy for Closed-loop Supply Chains", "id": "18931", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9019", "abstract_tesi": "Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the largest waste streams in the world because it is environmentally hazardous, chemically complex and economically expensive to treat. There is a general lack of governmental legislation or enforcement surrounding e-waste since it is difficult to hold a single entity accountable. A contributing factor in e-waste generation can be attributed to the shorter lifespans of products today and the lack of sustainable/economically viable End of Life (EOL) strategies. The average lifespan of computers in developed countries has dropped from six years in 1997 to just two in 2005, while mobile phones have a lifecycle of less than 2 years.  Environmental protection legislation, consumer interest in \u201cgreen\u201d products and a trend toward corporate responsibility has resulted in increased interest in product take-back. However, this also means that companies engaging in product take-back are doing so, with the objective of brand enhancement and are not primarily driven by profit.  The trend of increasing waste and comparatively low growth of waste treatment methodologies has created the need for better utilization of the products we deem unfit for use. While traditional forward logistics focuses on the flow of products from factory to consumer, reverse logistics refers to the processes associated with returning products, components, and materials from the final consumer. A closed-loop supply chain is a combination of forward and revers logistics. Within a closed-loop supply chain network, the options currently available for utilizing these returned EOL products are restricted to reusing, recycling, remanufacturing and permanent disposal. Through recycling, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are establishing closed-loop supply chains from which they can obtain raw material for production, delivering payback through environmental benefits and reduced supply chain carbon footprint. At the same time, a refurbished product strategy helps retailers introduce refurbished variants of products to the market which can provide additional economic benefits and extenuate environmental impact challenges. However, refurbishing is limited to an existing product market, possibly a subset of the existing market, and thus fails to commercialize/target new markets. Refurbishing also does not involve OEMs since the returned products are refurbished by third party firms and sold/distributed by retailers. Also, recycling has proven to be an economically and environmentally inferior strategy compared to the other EOL options. The current closed-loop supply chain networks, thus, do not give OEMs the opportunity to improve their profit margins and gain economic benefits through reverse logistics. In this thesis, a new EOL option called \u201cresynthesis\u201d is introduced that utilizes existing waste from EOL products in a novel way through the synthesis of products/components across multiple domains (i.e. consumer electronics, health care, automotive, etc.). A product resynthesis driven closed-loop supply chain methodology is proposed that leads to higher economic benefits and allows OEMs to participate directly in closed-loop supply chains and thus enhance their profit margins. A case study involving the resynthesis of two products; a computer mouse, belonging to the domain of computer accessories, and a white-board eraser, belonging to the domain of office supplies, is presented. These two products are resynthesized to create an ergonomically shaped eraser that would be incorporated into a closed-loop supply chain.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8854], "author_name_tesi": "Sane, Chinmay Girish", "last_name_ssi": "Sane", "middle_name_ssi": "Girish", "first_name_ssi": "Chinmay", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Conrad S Tucker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Conrad S Tucker, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sustainability", "closed-loop supply chains", "Remanufacturing", "recycling", "end-of-life decision making"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "MAKING CHANGES THAT LAST: EXAMINING THE SUSTAINABILITY OF AN EVIDENCE-BASED PRESCHOOL CURRICULUM\n", "id": "8583", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5285", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past decade or so, the need for evidence-based programs has intensified from both research and policy perspectives. While much effort has been put into developing educational interventions and demonstrating their effectiveness, little work has been done to promote the sustained use of such evidence-based programs over time. Thus, this study examined the sustainability of Head Start REDI (Research-based, Developmentally Informed), an evidence-based preschool curriculum which combines pre-literacy components with a social-emotional learning (SEL) curriculum, by following the intervention teachers (N=21) for the first two years after the formal REDI randomized trial ended. A mixed methods framework that included qualitative interviews, teacher surveys, and classroom observations was used to explore the extent to which the components of the REDI curriculum are sustained and to identify the factors that facilitate and hinder sustainability.\n\nResults indicated that the REDI curriculum was sustained over time. PATHS, the SEL component, was sustained at the highest level with almost all teachers sustaining, while the pre-literacy components (Dialogic Reading, Sound Games and Alphabet Center) demonstrated somewhat lower rates of sustainability (approximately two-thirds of teachers). Barriers to sustainability of REDI included competition from other Head Start requirements, lack of time and teacher perceptions that REDI was not developmentally appropriate. Factors which facilitated sustainability included teacher perceptions of benefits to children, administrative mandates requiring REDI and teacher perceptions that the REDI approach matched her teaching style. Few pre-test factors were found to be associated with sustained use of REDI (e.g. teacher education and years experience or teacher characteristics). However, pre-REDI teaching quality was related to sustainability, as was implementation quality prior to the sustainability years.\n\nThat REDI was sustained at all for the two years following the intervention year is encouraging given that sustained use of the curriculum was not one of the original goals of the Head Start REDI project. The discussion focuses on the implications of the findings for informing future efforts at fostering sustainability of evidence-based preschool curriculums, including the possibility that an administrative mandate may be needed to ensure sustainability.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5262], "author_name_tesi": "Sanford DeRousie, Rebecca M", "last_name_ssi": "Sanford DeRousie", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark T Greenberg", "Scott David Gest", "Edward A Smith", "Karen Linn Bierman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark T Greenberg, Committee Chair", "Scott David Gest, Committee Member", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member", "Karen Linn Bierman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["preschool curriculum", "Head Start teachers", "sustainability"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A Numerical Analysis of the Shear Key Cracking Problem in Adjacent Box Beam Bridges\n\n", "id": "11283", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6980", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This objective of this thesis is to evaluate the potential of selected shear key modifications in reducing tensile stress in the shear key region of adjacent box beam using numerical analysis.

Since the projected change is expected to affect the agricultural sector, especially in the tropical climate zones, it is important to examine possible changes in crop yields and their bio-physiological responses to future climate conditions in these areas. This study employed a climate impact assessment to evaluate potential cassava root crop production in marginal areas of Northeast Thailand, using climate change projected by the CSIRO-Mk3 model for 2009\u20132038. The EPIC (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator) crop model was then used to simulate cassava yield according to four scenarios based on combinations of CO2 fertilization effects scenarios (current CO2 level and 1% per year increase) and agricultural practice scenarios (with current practices and assumed future practices). Future practices are the result of assumed advances in agronomic technology that are likely to occur irrespective of climate change. They are not prompted by climate change per se, but rather by the broader demand for higher production levels.  This thesis illustrates the potential impact on cassava production due to climate change, and the use of advanced technologies in agricultural practices that will probably occur in the future.\nGenerally, crop losses stem from higher mean temperatures. However, there are also benefits from elevated CO2 concentrations. Depending on the climate change scenario without a CO2 fertilization effect, the average annual yield for cassava is projected to decrease from current production by 28%. CO2 fertilization effect cannot fully overcome these negative results. A positive increase in yield of about 35% is also projected in light of future adjustments in agricultural technology. Future cassava production in Northeast Thailand will be significantly affected by the climate change projected there, but detrimental effects may be mitigated by utilizing CO2 enrichment which promotes crop survival in marginal areas.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5351], "author_name_tesi": "Sangpenchan, Ratchanok  ", "last_name_ssi": "Sangpenchan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ratchanok ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brenton Yarnal", "Amy Glasmeier", "William Ewart Easterling Iii"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brenton Yarnal, Thesis Advisor", "Amy Glasmeier, Thesis Advisor", "William Ewart Easterling Iii, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thailand", "climate change impacts", "Cassava"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "VULNERABILITY OF THAI RICE PRODUCTION TO SIMULTANEOUS CLIMATE AND SOCIOECONOMIC CHANGE: A DOUBLE EXPOSURE ANALYSIS\n", "id": "12186", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13278", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores the vulnerability of Thai rice production to simultaneous exposure by climate and socioeconomic change \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201c so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153double exposure.\u00e2\u20ac\u009d Both processes influence Thailand\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s rice production system, but the vulnerabilities associated with their interactions are unknown. To understand this double exposure, the research adopts a mixed-method, qualitative-quantitative analytical approach consisting of three phases of analysis involving (in order) a Vulnerability Scoping Diagram, a Principal Component Analysis, and the EPIC crop model. Using proxy datasets collected from secondary data sources at the provincial level, the first and second phases together identify the key variables representing each of the three dimensions of vulnerability \u00e2\u20ac\u201c\u00e2\u20ac\u201c exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Results show that the greatest vulnerability in the rice production system occurs in households and areas with high exposure to climate change, high sensitivity to climate and socioeconomic stress, and low adaptive capacity. The results also show the geographical distribution of vulnerability across the country and locate four provinces with low vulnerability to the double exposure. In the third phase, for each of these four provinces, the EPIC crop model simulates rice yields associated with future climate change as projected by two downscaled global climate models. Climate change-only scenarios demonstrate that yields are expected to decrease 10% from the current productivity during 2016-2025 and 30% during 2045-2054 under projected changes in climate and rising CO2 levels. Scenarios applying both climate change and improved technology and management practices show that a 50% increase in rice production is possible, but requires strong collaboration between sectors to advance agricultural research and technology. Moreover, disseminating these advancements requires the strong adaptive capacity in the rice production system characterized by well-developed social capital, social networks, financial capacity, and infrastructure and household mobility at the local scale. The vulnerability assessment and climate and crop adaptation simulations used here provide useful information to decision makers developing vulnerability reduction plans in the face of concurrent climate and socioeconomic change.

To this end, a corpus of 104 research articles (i.e. articles reporting on empirical research) from the two languages and disciplines were analyzed quantitatively with the help of corpus linguistic method. The findings of the study revealed that overall English research articles were more tentative than Indonesian articles, indicated by the more frequent use of hedges found in the former set of articles and the more frequent use of boosters found in the latter set of articles.

Of the total coal produced in the U.S that year, about 45% was bituminous coal. Typically, this coal will require washing prior to utilization, which is carried out using density- and/or surface-based separation processes. After washing, the dewatered clean coal is sent to the power plant, while the coarse and fine refuse are often sent to impoundment areas. Every year, millions of gallons of coal refuse slurry is generated and stored in these impoundments, which potentially can lead to environmental problems such as acidic water, siltation of streams, land property devaluation and in extreme cases, dam failures. Refuse slurry could also get mixed with the local waterways by slow erosion of the berm surrounding abandoned ponds. Therefore, an alternative approach to slurry impoundments could reduce the overall environmental impact of coal processing. One method of reducing, if not eliminating, the need for slurry impoundments is to implement pressure filtration, a solid-liquid separation process, which provides a concentrated solid stream (cake) and liquid stream (filtrate) as products.\nPressure filtration of coal refuse has the potential to improve water conservation, minimize environmental impact, reduce area requirements for disposal and provide a safer operation. This research is an attempt to evaluate, model, and scale-up pressure filtration to provide information that will help to better manage coal waste, thereby reducing the environmental impacts of coal mining and utilization. Evaluation with statistical experimental design and modeling with artificial neural network and linear regression were performed to study the pressure filtration of coal refuse slurry using bench and lab-scale filters for two refuse materials. \nBench-scale testing was used to evaluate the effects of pressure, pH, solids concentration, temperature, fines fraction of solids, and filtration time. Results indicated an increase in cumulative filtrate flux, defined as the volume of filtrate per unit time per unit filter area, with increase in pressure and temperature while a decrease in flux was observed with increase in fines fraction, pH, filtration time, and solids concentration. Based on the experimental data, a 6-9-1 artificial neural network (ANN) model, with R2 values of 0.93 and 0.98 for the training and testing datasets, respectively, was developed to model filtrate flux as a function of pressure, slurry pH, feed solids concentration, fines fraction of solids in the slurry, filtration time, and temperature. The model was used as a tool for performing a novel method of sensitivity analysis on pressure filtration using Lek\u2019s profile method. Results from the sensitivity analysis showed filtration time and pH to be the most significant variables influencing filtrate flux.\nAnalysis of process scale-up in terms of filtrate flux was performed based on the tests conducted with the same test matrix on the bench- and lab-scale units. A linear scale-up pattern was observed with respect to the number of discharge ports for flux values less than 30 L/hr/m2, with the flux of the lab-scale unit being twice the flux of the bench-scale unit. For higher values of flux, the scale-up relationship transformed to a logarithmic function. An overall logarithmic model, with an R2 value of 0.85, was developed to fit the fluxes from the bench-scale unit with the lab-scale unit.\nThe variation in cake moisture, defined as the residual moisture content in the solid stream, as a function of time was shown to follow the compressional rheology model of compaction and consolidation. Results from a fractional factorial design on the lab-scale unit showed that the cake moisture at pH ~3 was about half of what was observed at pH ~12, indicating that pH had a significant effect on the final cake moisture. The zeta potential at acidic pH had values greater than -15 mV, which indicated the presence of agglomeration resulting in improved filtration performance at pH ~3. An inverse relationship between feed solids concentration and final cake moisture was established as test results showed that a concentrated feed provided a drier cake. Testing with a Box-Behnken design showed a drop in cake moisture by 13% with an increase in filtration time from 40 minutes to 50 minutes. The response surface design also showed a 30% reduction in cake moisture for a test with 10 minutes of air-blow after 30 minutes of filtration time compared to a test with 40 minutes of filtration time. A regression model for the response surface with respect to filtration time, air-blow time, and pH had an R2 value of about 0.99 with almost all the main effects, their square terms, and the interaction effects statistically significant. \nThe ANOVA analysis based on a split-plot design to study the effects of cake thickness and pressure showed that both factors significantly affected the cake moisture. A regression model was developed with an R2 value of about 0.99 to relate cake thickness, the single largest statistically significant factor, with the weight of solids in the cake. For a product specification of 25% cake moisture, it was observed that the thinnest cake had the highest unit capacity in terms of the solids deposited per unit time and the amount of filtrate recovered per unit filter volume. Filtrate flux values increased with increase in cake thickness, and the flux values corrected for cake thickness were similar for cakes with thickness between 30 and 40 mm. A full-factorial design to study the effect of temperature showed that at about 50 minutes, the cake moisture for a test at 43 oC was about half as much as the cake moisture obtained for the test conducted at 10 oC, thereby establishing temperature as a variable of significance. \nTo analyze the effects of pressure, pH, temperature, solids concentration, filtration time, air-blow time, and cake thickness on cake moisture, a 9-factor regression model based on an exhaustive search algorithm and a 7-6-1 ANN based on a resilient backpropagation algorithm were developed with R2 values of 0.84 and 0.94, respectively. Relative importance of each input variable was analyzed using novel methods such as added-variable plots based on the regression model and Olden\u2019s method based on the ANN model. Results from both methods established a negative correlation for pressure, solids concentration, filtration time, temperature, and air-blow time and a positive correlation for cake thickness and pH. Even though both models served as good interpretable models, it was shown that the ANN model outperformed the regression model in terms of predictive capability, with an R2 value of 0.965 compared with the regression model\u2019s 0.750 for a test dataset. \nAn attempt was made to use zeolite-based additives to capture and retain metals leaching from refuse stream at acidic pH. The additives were shown to have minimal effect on the filtration performance, while adsorbing as high as 80% of iron. The adsorption was not significantly affected by slight variations in initial metal concentration. The treatment was shown to retain most of the metals when the treated cakes were exposed to a water with a pH ~5, comparable to that of rain.\nIn summary, this study evaluated the effects of fines fraction, pressure, slurry pH, solids concentration, temperature, cake thickness, filtration time, and air-blow time on pressure filtration of coal refuse slurry using statistically designed experiments. Bench-scale testing indicated that filtration performance, measured in terms of cumulative filtrate flux, increased with pressure and temperature and decreased with fines fraction, pH, solids concentration, and time. Experimental results and statistical analyses indicated improved filtration performance, measured in terms of cake moisture, in the lab-scale unit with increase in pressure, solids concentration, temperature, filtration time, and air-blow time, while the performance decreased with increase in pH and cake thickness. Modeling was performed based on the experimental data using linear regression and ANN. The ANN model was shown to have a better predictive performance compared to the regression model. Based on the experimental data and the sensitivity analyses performed using the models, pH was identified as a major factor that influenced the filtration performance. Also, zeolite-based additives were shown to reduce iron leaching out of refuse at lower pH values when mixed with the slurry prior to pressure filtration.

Within this spectrum of studies, however, there is a gap at the level of observation-action coupling and joint action.  The current study was designed to fill this gap. It did so by making use of a finding in motor control, the grasp height effect (GHE), wherein people take hold of a vertically oriented cylinder high when they plan to bring the cylinder to a low position and low when they plan to bring the cylinder to a high position (Cohen & Rosenbaum, 2004). The experiments make use of a variation of the original GHE study, adding an explicit cue about target location with an implicit cue of grasp height embedded in that explicit cue.  The explicit cue related to target height, while the implicit cue was a modeled grasp height that was not related to satisfying the demands of the task but that was related to satisfying the demands of the GHE.  Experiment 1 established that the mere cuing of a location on a plunger did not significantly influence the GHE.  Experiments 2-4 showed that increasing amounts of observational information significantly affected the GHE, resulting in an attenuation of that effect that increased with the amount of observational information available.  Experiment 5 used a simpler version of the experiment that could later be used to assess other potential variables of interest, with the result that individuals were sensitive to modeled grasp-heights.  Experiment 5 has promising extensions both in the fields of motor control and social psychology.  Briefly discussed are the possibilities for investigating actor-observer differences, such as the role of prejudice and empathy in the action-observation system.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2936], "author_name_tesi": "Santamaria, Joseph Philip", "last_name_ssi": "Santamaria", "middle_name_ssi": "Philip", "first_name_ssi": "Joseph", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A.

The suppliers bidding for the contract are usually the current supplier (the incumbent) and a group of potential new suppliers (the entrants). Since the buyer has an ongoing relationship with the incumbent, he needs to adjust the bids of the entrants to include non-price attributes. The buyer can run a scoring auction, in which suppliers compete on the adjusted bids or scores, or, he can run a buyer-determined auction, in which suppliers compete on the price, and the buyer adjusts the bids with the non-price attributes after the auction to determine the winner. In the second chapter I study the bidding strategies in a buyer-determined auction in which an incumbent and a group of suppliers compete for a contract.\n\nWhen different types of suppliers compete (for example domestic and foreign suppliers), practitioners have observed that domestic suppliers stop bidding after observing a low bid from the foreign competitors, even though the domestic suppliers dominate their foreign competitors in non-price dimensions. To mitigate this anticompetitive behavior, the feedback given to suppliers in the auction changed from the bid price to the bid rank. In the third chapter, I study the bidding strategies when two suppliers of different type compete in a reverse auction with rank feedback.\n\nFinally, in the fourth chapter, I study the bidding strategies in sealed-bid combinatorial auctions. Combinatorial auctions are auctions of multiple heterogeneous objects that allow bids on subsets of the objects, giving bidders the flexibility to express if the objects in a set are more valuable together than separate. This added flexibility makes it possible for the bidders to express a variety of preferences, but also complicates the problem they need to solve to find their bidding strategies. I present the problem a bidder has to solve in a combinatorial auction of two objects, in which bidders submit mutually exclusive bids once and winners pay their bids.

The students answered questions relating to their perceptions about learning English as a second language under colonial conditions in Puerto Rico. Participants also analyzed, discussed, challenged and constructed their own meanings concerning the images and content in the stories contained within U.S. made textbooks utilized in their English class. Moreover, they had the opportunity to discuss, analyze, and contest images of themselves and their countrymen as portrayed in English stories written by both Puerto Rican and non-Puerto Rican authors.\nBy utilizing the Case Study research method, I was able to explore, in depth, how this group of children perceived the learning of the English language and its didactic material, i.e. textbooks under colonial conditions, and how perceptions were related to their own culture and national identity. This research method encouraged the inclusion of the researcher\u2019s personal perspective into the interpretation; allowing reflection on both my role as an ESL teacher in Puerto Rico and on my personal educational philosophy while discussing English language issues from the students\u2019 perspective. The theoretical framework for this study was based on colonial/postcolonial theories, following the views of Pennycook (2001), Loomba (1998), Dimitriadis/McCarthy (2001), and Phillipson (1998), and includes critical pedagogy as described by Freire (1998) and Canagarajah (1999). Colonial/postcolonial theories helped in providing a framework for understanding the complex context in which the research project took place: English is a compulsory subject that students love, hate, and may also resist in the educational system current within Puerto Rico. A critical pedagogical perspective provided the study participants the opportunity to challenge and question the agenda of the U.S. dominant culture promoting the ESL program in Puerto Rico, and those English textbooks utilized in the program which usually reflect the predominately white middle class values and beliefs existent in the US.\nOne of the main objectives of this study was to provide an environment for the participants in which to feel safe to freely express their honest and genuine opinions toward the imposition of the English language in Puerto Rico, taking into consideration the colonial context. Another objective was to critically examine and discuss all images and story content contained within the English textbooks. From my position as postcolonial researcher, my objective was to make students aware of their own voice and to assist them in exercising their power as critical thinkers.\nThe results of this research project revealed the complex colonial/postcolonial mentality that still prevails in Puerto Rico today, congruent with a mental ambivalence common among colonial subjects who are simultaneously under the influence of two different cultures. Participants were allowed and encouraged to express their genuine concerns, (and occasionally contradicting opinions), about the ESL program in Puerto Rican schools and any connections between content and the colonial political status of the island. They also challenged and expressed strong and conflictive assumptions about the U.S. Empire, its dominant culture, and its power over the island. Additionally, they questioned the representations of themselves by Puerto Rican and non-Puerto Rican authors embedded in the English stories and were able to identify different kinds of interesting stereotypes concerning the U.S. culture as well as the Puerto Rican and Latino culture in both illustrations and story content.\nThe results of this study demonstrate that when students have the opportunity to make their voices heard within a safe and respectable environment, they are capable of exercising their power and of utilizing higher level critical-thinking skills.\nA significant landmark would be to develop ESL and ELT curriculum that includes the perspective of a critical pedagogy in which students, as well as future ESL teachers, could reflect and discuss within the English class environment, the reality and the agenda behind the ESL program in the context of Puerto Rico. A critical pedagogy curriculum could help in empowering both students and future ESL teachers as Puerto Rican individuals who are currently studying under a colonized mainstream educational system to reflect on their own uniqueness in opposition to the images imposed on them, to become critical thinkers who could challenge the actual system, and to position themselves to bring about change in society.\n \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6296], "author_name_tesi": "Santiago, Teresita ", "last_name_ssi": "Santiago", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Teresita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto", "Madhu Suri Prakash", "Steven Herb"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Dean Hade, Committee Chair", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto, Committee Chair", "Madhu Suri Prakash, Committee Member", "Steven Herb, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["literacy", "critical pedagogy", "bilingual education", "postcolonialism colonial"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF NANOSTRUCTURED SURFACES FOR ENHANCED OPTICAL SENSING", "id": "13640mas898", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13640", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-12-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "At smaller size regimes, materials\u2019 physicochemical properties change with respect to bulk analogs. In the case of metal nanoparticles like gold or silver, specific wavelengths of light can induce a coherent oscillation of their conduction electrons, generating an optical field confined to the nanoparticle surface. This phenomenon is termed surface plasmon, and has been used as an enhancing mechanism in optical sensing, allowing the detection of foreign materials at small concentrations. The goal of this dissertation is to develop nanostructured materials relying on surface plasmons that can be combined with different optical sensing platforms in order to enhance current detection limits.\n\nInitially, we focus on the development of surfactant free, stimuli responsive nanoparticle thin films, which undergo an active release when exposed to a stimulus such as a change in pH. These nanoparticle thin films provide faster analyte particle transport and direct electronic coupling with the analyte molecule, all without attenuating the evanescent wave from the optical transducer to the particle. These stimuli responsive nanostructured substrates are tested within a surface enhanced Raman platform for the detection of biomolecular probes at sub-nanomolar concentrations and \u00b5L sample sizes. Furthermore, the developed nanosubstrates can be patterned, providing a versatile nanoparticle thin film for multiplexing analysis, offering a substantial advantage over conventional surface based nanoparticle detection methods.\n\nOur results encouraged further optimization of light-matter interactions in optical detection platforms. It is for that reason that this dissertation evolves towards confined optical systems. Particularly, whispering gallery microcavities confine electromagnetic waves \u2013 at high volumes \u2013 at the boundary of a dielectric resonator. In this dissertation, we examined the sensitivity of whispering gallery modes combining optical microcavities with plasmonic nanoparticles in analogy to a \u201cnanoantenna\u201d. First, our hybrid methodology is tested by analyzing the resonant wavelength displacement of a whispering gallery mode cavity upon perturbation with a gold nanoparticle layer containing a model protein. Next, we developed a real-time optical sensing platform relying on whispering gallery microcavities and surface plasmons, and then tested it for the detection of a model protein at fM concentration (less than 1000 protein molecules).\n\nFinally, this plasmonic-photonic coupling process involving whispering gallery modes is studied via a self-referenced methodology relying on the mode splitting of a whispering gallery resonance. Specifically, we studied the mode splitting evolution of a resonant whispering gallery microcavity as a function of gold nanoparticle adherence with varying diameters. Mode splitting increases as the localized surface plasmon wavelength of the nanoparticle approaches the spectral line of the whispering gallery mode. Plasmonic-photonic coupling observed in this study provides a novel alternative to achieve single particle detection using mode splitting, as well as understanding optimization of particle size for plasmonic-photonic coupling. \n\nThe study described herein opens a new way to optimize current optical sensing technology, enabling not only the detection of an analyte, but also the execution of fundamental studies of analyte interactions at ultralow concentrations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14166], "author_name_tesi": "Santiago Cordoba, Miguel A", "last_name_ssi": "Santiago Cordoba", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Miguel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Melik C.

Optimal experimental design methods aim at finding a set of runs, or points in the factor space, that optimize some property of the fitted responses, a property usually related to the variance of the predictions of the response models. To get good experimental designs in practice, a large percentage of existing optimal design methods rely on a candidate list of potential experimental points from where an exchange algorithm selects a subset which is hoped to be close to the true variance optimal design. The quality of the final design depends therefore on the quality of the candidate list, and selecting the latter is not an easy task, particularly if the experimental region is irregular due to the existence of constraints. A smaller number of optimal design algorithms have been proposed based on evolutionary or genetic optimization methods in an attempt to get better local optimal designs. These methods do not rely on a candidate list of points, but have a representation of a design that is too simplistic, with the levels of the controllable factors forming a string of \u201cgenes'\u201d in this biological metaphor which does not allow to explore efficiently the very large design space.\n \nThe themes of this dissertation consider the optimal design problems mentioned above.  A recently proposed evolutionary algorithm, the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), is used to find experimental designs that are both D- and G-efficient. The ability of this algorithm to consider any non-convex, non-differentiable function composed of continuous variables makes this method an ideal global optimizer for finding experimental designs combining multiple alphabetic optimality criteria. The algorithm is applied to finding experimental designs for controllable and noise factors in the so-called Robust Parameter Design problem popularized by G. Taguchi. For its specific modeling flexibility and its powerful search of the design space, CMA-ES is an excellent choice to find designs that perform optimally with respect to multiple criteria. The resulting evolutionary designs, obtained with this existing algorithm outperform the existing designs available in the literature.\n \nA second topic of this dissertation addresses the lack of richness of the design representation, or genotype, in traditional genetic optimization algorithms applied to experimental design. Instead of representing a design chromosome by a string  of numbers that simply give the levels of the factors, a new representation based on Lindenmayer systems (L-systems) is presented. In this representation, the instructions on how the experimental design is constructed are stored as a sequence of symbols. The symbols themselves are subject to the usual genetic optimization operations of mutation, crossover, and selection. The main advantage of this approach is that the design space is searched more efficiently, and the resulting designs contain an overall structure which can result in intuitive geometrical properties (such as symmetries) that may not be obtainable under other methods. In this genetic optimization metaphor, the L-system based algorithm defines the \u201cgenotype\u201d as a candidate list of points, subject to evolutionary optimization pressure. The phenotype is selected, or filtered, from the genotype by a D-optimal or other similar exchange algorithm. With this, there is redundancy in the genotype, making the metaphor closer to what is observed in the natural world.\n \nThe final theme this dissertation addresses is the problem of minimizing the costs incurred while the experimental design is conducted. This leads to a sequential optimization strategy, where the sequence of experimental points must balance the exploration of the space of the controllable factors with the \u201cexploitation\u201d of the fitted models such that good response values are obtained. The problem has been studied in the Control Theory literature, and is commonly referred to as the Dual Control problem. We present a multiple response Dual Control algorithm that minimizes the sum of quadratic off-target and controllable factor adjustment costs over the duration of the experiment. The algorithm allows a faster optimization of an industrial process compared with the usual two-stage approach followed in Response Surface Methods where a model is fitted first based on an experimental design and then the optimal settings are found from such fitted model. New features of the algorithm are allowance for multiple responses and the ability to deal with the unknown covariance matrix case, not previously addressed in the literature. Sequential optimization methods are important also in the field of Engineering Design, where an experimental design is used to determine the set of computer runs or simulations, which may take several hours or even days to complete, thus metamodels are fitted and optimized in as few runs as possible. For this reason, the new Dual Control algorithm presented in this thesis is compared not only with off-line experimental designs but also with the EGO (Efficient Global Optimization) algorithm, a popular Kriging-based method for the sequential optimization of computer models in Engineering Design.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1863], "author_name_tesi": "Santiago Duran, Eduardo ", "last_name_ssi": "Santiago Duran", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Eduardo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Enrique Del Castillo", "Enrique Del Castillo", "M Jeya Chandra", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "Patrick M Reed"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Enrique Del Castillo, Dissertation Advisor", "Enrique Del Castillo, Committee Chair", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Member", "Patrick M Reed, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["optimal designs", "sequential optimization", "genetic algorithms", "optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Microfluidic systems for high-throughput single-cell assays", "id": "9706", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4122", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Microfluidic devices have recently emerged as useful tools for performing biological and cellular assays.

In this dissertation applications of microfluidic systems for performing cell-based assays are demonstrated. In the second chapter, a device for monitoring changes in intercellular connectivity in an in vitro neuronal network was fabricated and the fluid flow characterized via confocal microscopy, simulations, and amperometry. This system exploits laminar flow and hydrodynamic focusing, allowing individual cells in specific locations to be addressed with pharmacological agents while imaging is performed on the cells in the network.

Through critical and feminist pedagogical theories, I discovered similar behaviors within both. Race, class, and lifestyle differences define most circles including present-day groups. Despite tendencies to socially divide, I found sewing circles to provide a space for communities of women to advise, guide, and support one another through personal and professional challenges. Either a necessity or leisurely technique of hand needlework was central to most women\u2019s lives. Whether making for survival in preindustrial times, to sell items to raise money for war or other political causes, or for pleasure, women periodically assembled in homes or churches to sew, knit, quilt \u2013 and talk. Inspired by interracial groups formed during abolition and the intergenerational group that characterized my campus circle, I theorize an emancipatory pedagogy through the living aesthetics emerging within the sewing circle. \n\nPotentially, this space can be reclaimed for aesthetic and sociopolitical bonds to be established among women. Collegial leadership is crucial in this endeavor. Pivotal to practicing an emancipatory pedagogy is the process of critical reflection a leader/teacher must undergo in order to uncover their unconscious prejudices and agendas.

In commonly used recombination protocols (e.g., DNA shuffling , StEP, ITCHY, SCRATCHY, SHIPREC), the primary diversity generation mechanism entails the exchange of parental DNA fragments in the reassembled sequences. One of the key challenges in the use of such directed evolution techniques is that many of the reassembled hybrid proteins do not fold properly and thus are non-functional. Clearly, certain combinations of mutations/recombinations are incompatible leading to residue-residue clashes that contribute to the inability of the hybrids to fold correctly. In response to the problem at hand, this thesis presents both bioinformatics-based approaches and detailed atomistic structural calculations aimed at (i) identifying residue-residue clashes for prescreening purposes as well as targets for design and (ii) designing proteins and protein libraries with enhanced functionalities.  The application of these tools will allow for appropriate allocation of diversity in the library while correcting problematic residue combinations.

The importance of central adiposity [waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)] and general obesity [body mass index (BMI)] in relationship to SCD has not been extensively studied. The objective of this thesis is to study how other markers of obesity such as WHR, along with BMI, affect the risk of SCD. \nThe baseline and follow-up data on SCD from the ongoing Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study were used to examine the relationship between markers of obesity and SCD. ARIC is an ongoing biracial population based cohort of middle-aged Americans selected from four communities in 1987-1989. WHR and BMI for a total of 15,732 participants were measured at the baseline visit. Multivariable proportional hazards regression was used to model the association between each anthropometric variable and SCD. \nIn the model adjusted for age, gender, race, education level, smoking status, prevalent coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and total cholesterol, WHR (with a 1 SD increase) was associated with SCD within 1 hour of symptom onset (HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.22, 1.87; p= 0.0002). By examining the plots of the log hazard ratios versus the WHR quintile, there was no evidence of great deviation from a linear relationship between WHR and SCD. The association between BMI (with a 1 SD increase) and SCD within 1 hour of symptom onset was marginal (HR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.00, 1.37; p= 0.082). Gender had a marginal interaction with BMI for SCD within 1 hour (p= 0.097). There was a significant association in women only (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.06, 1.61; p= 0.013).\nAdditionally, in the model adjusted only for age, race, and gender, WHR and BMI (with a 1 SD increase) were associated with SCD within 1 hour of symptom onset for WHR (HR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.59, 2.27; p= <0.0001) and for BMI (HR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.15, 1.53; p= 0.0001). The increased HRs in the minimally adjusted model suggests that co-morbidity does play an intermediate role in the obesity and SCD relationship. Analyses were also done using follow-up data for subjects who died within 24 hours of symptom onset. Although the identified cases were higher than those who died within 1 hour of symptom onset, the overall pattern of findings remained similar on the main effects.\nThese data suggest that the magnitude of WHR association with SCD within 1 hour of symptom onset is greater than that of BMI, thus supporting the use of measures of obesity such as WHR in addition to BMI in assessing the risk of cardiac death. Co-morbidities play an important intermediate role in the etiology of obesity and sudden cardiac death. Both models were used to examine the quintile-categorized and quadratic terms of the obesity measures, and they did not support significant deviation from the linear relationship. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7266], "author_name_tesi": "Saravana Venkatesa, Deepaniranjani ", "last_name_ssi": "Saravana Venkatesa", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Deepaniranjani", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Michele Shaffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Michele Shaffer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ARIC", "cohort study", "sudden cardiac death", "body mass index", "waist-to-hip ratio"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECT OF GEOMETRY, HEMODYNAMICS, AND TISSUE FACTOR ON CLOT FORMATION IN ANEURYSM MODELS", "id": "15152pvs5384", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15152", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-04-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "According to a statistical report by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), aortic aneurysms alone constitutes 9,845 deaths in 2013, where men of age 55 and older being the most affected population. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that 2 to 5% of the United States population suffers from cerebral aneurysm. An aneurysm forms a region for recirculation of blood, which eventually leads to clot formation and rupture. This study was done to mainly explore the relationship between the geometry of an aneurysm, varying flow speed of blood, and influence of tissue factor towards clot formation. To achieve this, aneurysm models of two different sizes, 10x10 mm and 20x10 mm, and also straight tubes as controls were synthesized using a biocompatible polymer, poly (1,8 - octane diol citrate). \n\nA computational study was performed to develop an understanding of the flow dynamics in the aneurysms and for studying the effect of laminar and turbulent flows, and to optimize the experimental setup. A steady-state flow loop with bovine blood was used to represent the blood flow through a vessel, as in a human circulatory system. The blood flow rate through the loop was adjusted for both laminar (Re = 1000) and turbulent (Re = 3000) flows. The effect of tissue factor (TF) on clot formation was also studied by infusing it in an aneurysm while running the steady flow loop. To study the characteristics of the intraluminal thrombi formed in an aneurysm magnetic resonance imaging was performed. \nThe results showed that the TF flow rate of 20 \u00b5L/min through a needle inserted in the center plane of the defect with an angle of 10\u00b0 facing downward was optimal to imitate slow release of TF from the endothelial cells. The wall shear stress (WSS) was found to be high at the downstream of an aneurysm and low at the upstream. Turbulence leads to increase in WSS in both aneurysm sizes. The experimental results showed that clot formation is higher under turbulent flow than in laminar since the WSS is higher in turbulence. This was proved by comparing the simulated \n\nWSS with the 3D reconstructed clot obtained from MR imaging. The clots formed in 10x10 aneurysms had a higher volume than 20x10s under all the experimental conditions. However, the weight and surface area of the clots in 20x10 aneurysms exceeds the 10x10s under the influence of TF. The TF has proved to increase clot formation in both the aneurysm sizes under Re 1000 and Re 3000. Therefore, this study demonstrated that TF increases the size of the clot formation, and the size of an aneurysm affected the hemodynamics, and also influenced the clot formation.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16925], "author_name_tesi": "Saravanan, Pratima ", "last_name_ssi": "Saravanan", "first_name_ssi": "Pratima", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Keefe B Manning", "Jian Yang", "William O Hancock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Keefe B Manning, Thesis Advisor", "Jian Yang, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aneurysm", "hemodynamics", "tissue factor", "thrombus", "wall shear stress", "poly (1", "8 - octane diol citrate)"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Exploring Organizational Purpose,Functions,and Structures: A Case Study of a Community Health Foundation as Community Partner", "id": "8232", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1506", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study explored the role of a community health foundation in its efforts to improve the health status of the communities its serves. This exploratory study of the Carlisle Area Health & Wellness Foundation (CAHWF) offered two related opportunities to add to the existing body of knowledge on community health reform and more closely to the literatures on community foundation and community partnership theory and practice. These opportunities involved investigating the role of a community health foundation as community leader for change and within the community leadership role the responsibilities of a community health foundation as a coalition builder.\nTo exploit these opportunities, the study initially asked how the foundation interacted with community stakeholders in pursuing the goal of improved community health status and followed this with a second question focused on how the foundation was effective in achieving this goal.  A single case study research design was used to complete the study. Data for the study came from six sources: key network stakeholders including CAHWF board members, CAHWF administrative staff, service providers, and community representatives; CAHWF source documents; and, CAHWF secondary data. Data was collected in four ways by completing focused interviews of key informants; completing focus group sessions; reviewing source documents; and, reviewing secondary data.\nThe research revealed a dense and intricate organization that served the community as a convener, administrator, facilitator, advisor, and grant maker in order to advance the cause of improved community health. For research purposes this variety of responsibilities was reduced to three groupings \u2013 community organizer, community resource, and community advocate. In its first five years of operation, CAHWF predominantly served in the capacities of community organizer and community resource. Community stakeholders perceived CAHWF\u2019s efforts during its first five year of operation in the two capacities as effective in advancing the status of the community\u2019s health.  \nThe value of the research results from the conceptualization of the community foundation as a blended organization consisting of community partnership and foundation characteristics and the identification of five intermediate effectiveness measures (networking, collaborative planning, capacity building, disciplined funding decisions, and increased health and health related services) associated with this organizational model defined by the researcher as an \u201cEngaged Community Health Foundation\u201d. As a contribution, this single case study may provide a model of best practices that could be replicated by other health foundations seeking to serve in a collaborative community leadership role.  Second, the research may serve as the basis for developing a way to differentiate types of community foundations operating within the health policy arena in order to begin a more systematic evaluation of these organizations and their impact on community health and health system reform. Further research is needed to determine the role of community health foundations as community partners for health improvement.      \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1491], "author_name_tesi": "Sarcone, David Mark", "last_name_ssi": "Sarcone", "middle_name_ssi": "Mark", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Public Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Truman Ziegenfuss Jr.", "Cynthia Z M Mara", "Robert F.

Because this machinery appears on the plasma membrane of infected cells, it must be tightly regulated so that infected cells do not fuse with adjacent uninfected cells. Moreover, the fusion machinery and the proteins that regulate it are also involved in cell-to-cell spread, which enables the virus to move to uninfected cells through lateral junctions so that it can avoid neutralizing antibodies in the host. Syncytial mutants dysregulate this machinery, and cell-cell fusion results in the formation large syncytia, which contain many nuclei bounded by one membrane. Syn variants arise from mutations in any one of four HSV-1 genes, and these include gB, gK, UL20, and UL24. However, the Syn phenotype produced by these mutants is also regulated and requires \u201caccessory\u201d proteins that are involved in regulating the viral entry machinery. It has been assumed that an accessory protein required for one syn locus would be required across all the loci, and limited data support this. For example, it has been reported that accessory protein UL11 is required for both gBSyn and gKSyn. \nThis dissertation project began with the observation that tegument protein UL21 is required for gBSyn. That is, deletion of the UL21-coding sequence from the gBSyn parent resulted in a virus that was lytic even though the syn mutation was present. Because of the assumption that accessory proteins required for one syn locus would be needed for all four, and because the UL21-coding sequence had been completely deleted, we were surprised to see syncytial variants arising from \u0394UL21/gBSyn.  Similarly, passage of a virus lacking UL21 in an otherwise wild-type background also resulted in the appearance of syncytial variant viruses.  We purified and sequenced these \u0394UL21 syncytial variants and found that all these mapped exclusively to glycoprotein K, a virion membrane protein capable of binding gB and thought to modulate membrane fusion events.  A number of the changes we found were not gKSyn alleles described in the literature, so we followed up by creating recombinant viruses with these changes to confirm that they were indeed novel gKSyn alleles.  We also confirmed that UL21 is not necessary for gKSyn-mediated fusion by building recombinant viruses with gK syncytial substitutions lacking UL21, which were immediately fusogenic following viral DNA transfection into Vero cells.  Because a differential requirement for an accessory protein in syncytia formation had not been described in the literature, we tested additional gBSyn alleles for their requirement for UL21, as well as testing the requirement for UL21 in the context of UL20 and UL24 syncytial mutations.  These studies revealed that UL21 is only required for gBSyn and not for any of the other syn loci.  The viral proteins required for syncytia formation are thought to be similar to those needed for direct cell-to-cell spread. Herpesviruses use this spreading mechanism to avoid antibodies that could inactivate it within the infected host. To test whether UL21 is a component of the cell-to-cell spreading machinery, we examined the ability of the null virus to infect neighboring cells in the presence of neutralizing antibodies. For this, no syn mutations were present. Unlike the wild-type control, \u0394UL21 virus was found to be greatly impaired in its ability to infect adjacent cells. We hypothesize that this spreading defect provides a selective pressure for syn mutations, which compensate for the cell-to-cell spreading defect.         \nHaving identified the first example of a differential requirement for the Syn phenotype, we tested two viral proteins, gE and gI, that are well known to be required for cell-to-cell spread and the gBSyn phenotype.  We tested the requirement for these two glycoproteins across the gK, UL20, and UL24Syn backgrounds. They seemed to be the logical next Syn accessory proteins to test because UL21, along with tegument proteins UL11 and UL16 forms a complex on the gE cytoplasmic tail, which is known to modulate gB function in the context of the syncytial mutation gB.A855V. We hypothesized that the requirements for gE and gI would be the same because these two proteins form a heterodimer, and based on the UL21 results, we hypothesized that neither of these glycoproteins would be required for gKSyn, UL20Syn, or UL24Syn.  We were surprised to find that gE and gI are differentially required both across and within the syn loci, with UL24 syncytial mutations exhibiting a strict requirement for both gE and gI, UL20 syncytial mutations displaying a strict requirement for gE but not gI, and gK syncytial mutations displaying no requirement for gI, but an allele-specific requirement for gE. The differential requirement for gE within the gKSyn locus is the first example for an accessory protein being differentially required within one syn locus. \nIn the course of our experiments, we also found evidence that additional syn loci might exist. This came from studies of a mutant virus that 1) lacks the UL11-binding site within the cytoplasmic tail of gE and 2) also has a gBSyn mutation (gE\u0394CT(25)/gB.A855V). This virus was initially lytic when the DNA was transfected into cells; however, variants quickly arose that had the ability to fuse cells. We purified several independent variants, and confirmed that the two original mutations were present. Then, we hypothesized that the variants had gained a second syn mutation. Surprisingly, sequencing of the other three syn loci in these variants revealed no mutations. Because we could not predict what change(s) had occurred, a whole-genome, deep sequencing approach was used. The results revealed that all had mutations that prevented the expression of glycoprotein C, a viral protein implicated in adsorption of the virus to cells but also described in the literature as decidedly not a syn locus. This provides the first evidence that gC regulates the fusion activity of gB.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15517], "author_name_tesi": "Sarfo, Akua Pokuah", "last_name_ssi": "Sarfo", "middle_name_ssi": "Pokuah", "first_name_ssi": "Akua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biomedical Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Warren Wills", "John Warren Wills", "Neil David Christensen", "Jianming Hu", "Craig Eugene Cameron"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Warren Wills, Dissertation Advisor", "John Warren Wills, Committee Chair", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Jianming Hu, Committee Member", "Craig Eugene Cameron, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Herpes Simplex Virus", "Glycoproteins", "Syncytia", "Virology"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "STEREO VISION FOR AUTONOMOUS GROUND-BASED\nTRACKING OF MIGRATING RAPTORS\n", "id": "9115", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6098", "abstract_tesi": "Migration places extreme demands on birds as they travel long distances. Factors influencing when and where migrating birds stop to feed are not well understood, and may include internal conditions such as amount of body fat and external conditions such as local weather. By collecting data on individual behavior in response to internal and external conditions researchers will be able to build models of bird behavior and identify critical habitats along migration routes. The following thesis presents the design and simulation of a system of stereo cameras and processors, to enable the distributed, autonomous tracking of migratory raptors in order to facilitate the study of their flight patterns. The motivation behind this study is to map the migratory routes of raptors and other endangered species of birds. The knowledge of migratory routes will aid biological research, conservation efforts and shed light on whether man-made structures like windmills along these routes pose a threat to migrating birds or if raptors are able to alter their flight patterns to avoid collision. A cost effective method that can continuously monitor the flight path of birds around the observation site with minimal or no human input, can provide valuable information about the migratory patterns of the birds without incurring the cost of employing more people or buying specialized equipment. The proposed system, consisting of a set of off-the-shelf cameras and processors, would not require a great deal of fiscal or labor input while providing an accurate estimate of bird migration patterns.\n\nObservation points may be set up along the ridge to obtain bearings to birds that come into view in order to compute their position and velocity at every time interval, using Kalman Filter based tracking algorithms. The accuracy of the estimates is lowered due to the Dilution of Precision, DOP,  introduced into the measurements because of the large distances between the birds and the camera systems. The tracking system proposed in this thesis consists of a number of stations each composed of a camera pair and a processor, set up in a user specified geometry, along the ridge under observation. The estimation process is further complicated by the fact that the relations between the bird position and the bearings to it, utilize trigonometric properties, making the measurement model non-linear. A non-linear estimation method is therefore required.\n\nEach station computes an initial estimate of the position and velocity of the birds viewed by its cameras using a Particle Filter and further tracking is carried out by the Unscented Kalman Filter. Data association between measurements is performed from camera to camera in each stereo set and from frame to frame between one time step and the next. The estimates from each station are transmitted to a master computer that computes the association of local estimates to each other before fusing all the independent estimates to any particular bird and transmitting the resulting final estimate back to all the stations. Results of Monte Carlo simulations show the convergence of the estimated error to the true error for estimates from one or more stations. The tracking system provides fairly accurate estimates under realistic constraints and may be implemented with readily available hardware.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6091], "author_name_tesi": "Sarfraz, Sana ", "last_name_ssi": "Sarfraz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sana", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jacob Willem Langelaan", "Jacob Willem Langelaan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jacob Willem Langelaan, Thesis Advisor", "Jacob Willem Langelaan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["computer vision", "systems", "distributed", "tracking", "estimation", "bird migration"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "ANALYTICAL INVESTIGATION OF THE PERICYCLIC VARIABLE-SPEED TRANSMISSION SYSTEM FOR HELICOPTER MAIN-GEARBOX\n", "id": "10291", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6954", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the recent years, there has been significant interest in the new developments and improvements of the rotorcraft transmission systems. The main goal of the rotorcraft transmission research is the reduction of overall gear train weight while maintaining the efficiency and reliability. The Pericyclic Variable-Speed Transmission (PVT) System is one of the potential candidates of the future rotorcraft drive trains to achieve these goals. Hence, this thesis explores the feasibility of the Pericyclic Variable Speed Transmission (PVT) for rotorcraft transmissions. The contributions of this research are grouped in two main categories. These two categories are in the component level and in the system level. These contributions are originated from the analysis of the Pericyclic Variable Speed (PVT) System. In the component level, a new concept of face-gear meshing is presented first time in the gear research field. The meshing of a face-gear with another face-gear is presented at high shaft angles as an alternative to bevel gears. The conjugacy of this new face-gear meshing concept is formulated and demonstrated. The geometry, unloaded mesh kinematics and loaded mesh kinematics of the conjugate meshing face-gear pair is analyzed. The physics behind the meshing face-gear teeth contact is revealed using theory of gearing, differentiable geometry and elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory. The existence of the lubricant film formation between the meshing teeth is demonstrated. The behavior of the sliding friction coefficient is analytically simulated through the meshing cycle. In the system level contributions, the Pericyclic Variable Speed (PVT) Transmission is presented as a new unique innovative gear train mechanism. The speed change capability is analyzed for rotorcraft demands. The power flow behavior is explored for its use in variable speed transmission systems. The established component level contributions are evaluated with the PVT at the system level. The efficiency and load carrying capacity of the PVT face-gears are analyzed at the helicopter torque levels. The dynamic motion of the nutating gear mechanisms is studied to capture the load carrying capacity of the PVT support bearings. A design analysis of the PVT system with 24:1 reduction ratio at 764HP power level is conducted to replace 3 reduction stages of the existing K-MAX intermeshing rotor transmission system. The design and analysis tools established in this research are applied in the design study. The achieved design is compared to the existing K-MAX transmission.

However, during the past decade it has become increasingly challenging to achieve energy efficiency through scaling of conventional silicon CMOS. One of the key reasons that has caused this energy scaling challenge is the slowdown in VCC scaling, due to non-scalability of VT. The other reason is the steady increase in leakage power consumption with each technology generation due to worsening short channel effects. As the development of sub-22nm CMOS devices is currently underway, alternative transistor-architectures such as 3D tri-gate, and alternative novel semiconductor material systems such as III-V InGaAs (indium galium arsenide) are being considered to allow both continued feature size scaling as well as VCC scaling. However, some of these emerging transistors have unique properties which require conventional circuit and system design to be re-examined. In this context, co-design of novel devices and architecture, which is the topic of this dissertation, enables the drive toward continued energy reduction. In this dissertation, circuit and architecture-level design aspects for emerging low-VCC devices, such as the Single Electron Transistor (SET) and the Inter-band Tunneling Field E\u000bect Transistor (TFET), are examined. The energy-delay characteristics of low-VCC sub-300mV logic circuits based on nearly broken-gap GaSb-InAs (galium antimonide-indium arsenide) heterojunction TFETs, are modeled. By taking advantage of an energy-delay crossover behavior between silicon CMOS and heterojunction TFET logic circuits, a hybrid heterogeneous CMOS-TFET multi-core processor architecture is proposed. Simulated execution of several single and multi-threaded benchmark programs on this heterogeneous architecture shows signifi\fcant energy-delay advantages compared to either a homogeneous CMOS or TFET multi-core processor alone. Device-level variability plays an important role in restricting the minimum operating voltage (VCC-min) at which a circuit can operate in a reliable manner. We have constructed a device-level variability model for TFETs and studied the impact of variation on TFET-based SRAM bit-cells. From this study, it is concluded that a Schmitt Trigger-based TFET SRAM bit-cell with a built-in feedback mechanism is most suitable for enabling ultra-low VCC operation of heterojunction TFET-based SRAM circuits. Following this, the asymmetric sub-threshold characteristics of degenerately-doped source (DDS) n-channel and p-channel III-V Tunnel FETs are examined. A TFET-based 4T-loadless SRAM cell is proposed, taking advantage of the asymmetric sub-threshold characteristics of n and p-channel TFETs, which shows improved performance and lower leakage compared to Si CMOS-based 4T-Loadless SRAM cells at low-VCC. A patent application has been fi\fled based on the TFET-based 4T-loadless SRAM and a provisional patent has been approved. Finally, A design space based on physical dimensions and electrostatic properties is proposed to enable circuit-level analysis for SETs. Subsequent circuit-analysis shows that a Sense Ampli\fer-Binary Decision Diagram (SA-BDD) circuit-architecture, is most suitable to enable ultra low-VCC sub-150mV for practically realizable Single Electron Transistors, which have low self-gain. These design studies show that it is necessary to model and study characteristics such as energy-delay performance and variability of emerging transistors, in order to enable ultra low-power circuit operation in the nanoscale regime.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6467], "author_name_tesi": "Saripalli, Vinay ", "last_name_ssi": "Saripalli", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vinay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suman Datta", "Suman Datta", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Kyusun Choi", "M Jeya Chandra", "Raj Acharya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suman Datta, Dissertation Advisor", "Suman Datta, Committee Chair", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Kyusun Choi, Committee Member", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Raj Acharya, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Tunnel FET", "Single Electron Transistor", "Low Power Electronics", "Heterogeneous Architecture", "Variation-Aware SRAM"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Essays in Applied Microeconomics", "id": "7204", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5753", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis consists of three essays. In the first essay we study monopolistic pricing, with a capacity constraint, of a good that loses its value T periods after it is put on sale for the first time. Buyers only obtain utility just before the good loses its value. Examples of such goods include airline tickets and hotel rooms. This essay presents a three-period model with a single seller facing a capacity constraint, where the good being sold loses its value after the third period. The seller offers a finite measure of units for sale in a market, where in each period a continuum of buyers, each of whom might be one of two types, enter. The seller chooses, without precommitment, price and measure of units to offer in each period. Each of the buyers chooses either to make a purchase as soon as they enter, or to wait for a lower price which might be made available in the future. This allows us to capture some features of airline ticket pricing. The equilibrium price path is obtained and found to be non-decreasing, U-shaped or horizontal for\nthe relevant range of parameter values. Any strategy involving `final sales' is found to be non-optimal.\n\nIn the second essay we examine the voluntary provision of a public project via binary contributions when contributions may be made over\nmultiple rounds. In many situations, early contributors are likely to pay a higher cost than those who wait. We show that in such\ncircumstances the provision of the project always involves delay. Since this game involves coordination on complex, dynamic strategies\nin the face of asymmetries in payoffs, we examine behavior in the laboratory.\n\nIn the third essay, we empirically test the theoretical predictions of the first essay. We collect airline price data from an online\ntravel agent for 30 routes in the US, each with a different proportion of business travellers. We find that while prices never fall before departure, the price path is rising for routes with low, medium and high proportion of business travellers and that the increase in prices is sharpest for routes with the highest proportion of business travellers.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5749], "author_name_tesi": "Sarkar, Shubhro ", "last_name_ssi": "Sarkar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shubhro", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee", "Mark John Roberts", "Susanna Esteban", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Chair", "Mark John Roberts, Committee Member", "Susanna Esteban, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Airline Pricing", "Public Goods Provisioning", "Coordination Games", "Durable Goods Monopoly", "Externalities"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Hierarchical Symbolic Perception in Dynamic Data Driven Application Systems", "id": "26486", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11591", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A dynamic data-driven application system (DDDAS) is a recently formalized architecture that integrates simulation with dynamically assimilated data, multiscale modeling and computation via completion of a two-way feedback loop between model execution and the data acquisition modules. The perception layer of DDDAS requires precise feature extraction from dynamic data, multi-scale (both spatial and temporal) data analysis and hierarchical sensor fusion, which are capable of real-time execution. This dissertation proposes hierarchical approaches that tackle different aspects of the perception layer of DDDAS, based on the concept of symbolic time series analysis (STSA). \nSTSA is a nonlinear feature-extraction tool that is applied on dynamic data by constructing probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA) via symbolization based on an alphabet size. Along with proposing a supervised alphabet size selection\nalgorithm, the dissertation develops optimal STSA algorithms that capture the texture of individual temporal data (by Generalized D-Markov machines) and\nthat of the causal cross-dependence (by \u00d7D-Markov machines) from one temporal data set to another with reduced dimensionality. The aforementioned patterns\nare aggregated to construct a spatio-temporal pattern network (STPN) from a sensor network and it is pruned via an information-theoretic approach for fault diagnosis in distributed systems. Finally, a hierarchical architecture named multiscale symbolic time series analysis (MSTSA) is formalized, where a semantic finite length learning-and-inferencing mechanism is stacked to capture the multi-timescale\nnature of DDDAS events in real time. \nIn addition to extensive validation by complex simulation experiments, the proposed techniques have been applied on experimental data for early detection of Lean Blow out (LBO), and thermo-acoustic instability in combustors and the performance is compared with state-of-the-art results. A hierarchical framework is developed combining deep learning and STSA with the objective of autonomously tracking the temporal evolution of coherent structures that are distributed in the flame during combustion instability. MSTSA has been successfully implemented in real-time activity recognition from noisy sensor data for border surveillance scenarios. It is envisioned that the general contributions, made in this dissertation, will be useful for many other potential application areas in DDDAS paradigm, such as weather system causality understanding, smart grid and buildings, distributed energy systems, situation awareness in ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) missions, material damage prediction and future ground and air transportation systems.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11095], "author_name_tesi": "Sarkar, Soumalya ", "last_name_ssi": "Sarkar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soumalya", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Asok Ray", "Christopher Rahn", "Daniel Connell Haworth", "Shashi Phoha", "Thomas Wettergren", "Karen Ann Thole"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Asok Ray, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member", "Shashi Phoha, Committee Member", "Thomas Wettergren, Committee Member", "Karen Ann Thole, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Symbolic Dynamics", "Data Driven", "Hierarchical approach", "Multi-scale analysis", "Combustion Instability", "Fault detection"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "AUTONOMOUS PERCEPTION AND DECISION MAKING IN CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS", "id": "11993", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6097", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The cyber-physical system (CPS) is a relatively new interdisciplinary technology\narea that includes the general class of embedded and hybrid systems.

The mangroves of the Florida Everglades are affected by a yearly cycle of dry and wet seasons.  The first part of this study aimed to find the effects of the dry and wet seasons on the surface energy fluxes of the mangrove forest.  The transition from the wet to dry season caused changes in the partitioning of energy into turbulent fluxes.  Increases in the latent heat flux over the forest were observed in the wet season due to the increased availability of water and decreased air temperatures.  The decoupling coefficient for the mangroves stayed relatively constant throughout the year, with an average range of 0.80 and 0.95, similar to other mangrove and tropical ecosystems.  The strong decoupling between the forest and the atmosphere conveys that the net radiation is the main driver of the latent heat fluxes in the ecosystem.  This strong decoupling is common in other mangrove and tropical forests.  When the net radiation dropped below 400 W m-2 in the wet season, the latent heat flux was below 150 W m-2, regardless of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) values.  In the dry season, the net radiation threshold was 550 W m-2, which was expected due to the overall drop in latent heat fluxes in the dry season.  VPD had a higher influence on latent heating rates in the dry season but the latent heat flux (LE) controls were still dominated by the net radiation.\nHurricane Wilma (October 2005) passed over the research site which gave us the unique opportunity to calculate the surface energy and latent heat fluxes before and after a hurricane disturbance.   The second part of the study focused on how the surface energy fluxes were affected by this disturbance and why these changes occurred.  After the hurricane disturbance, the aerodynamic resistance was reduced from an average of 30 s m-1 to 15 s m-1.  Satellite data implies that the mangrove forest has recovered from the hurricane.  The aerodynamic resistance, however, has remained at about half of what was calculated before the disturbance.  The changes in the aerodynamic resistances after the disturbance showed that the structure of the mangrove forest canopy was altered, changing the surface energy dynamics of the ecosystem.  Comparing the data from 2004 to 2007, a stronger energy closure was measured during the dry season after the disturbance. Latent heat fluxes increased after the hurricane; these increases were due to the domination of evaporation processes in this ecosystem when the LAI was low.  The ecosystem became more coupled to the atmosphere after hurricane Wilma, where the decoupling coefficient dropped to a range of 0.35 to 0.65 in the years after the disturbance.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1522], "author_name_tesi": "Sarmiento, Daniel Perez", "last_name_ssi": "Sarmiento", "middle_name_ssi": "Perez", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose Dolores Fuentes", "Jose Dolores Fuentes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose Dolores Fuentes, Thesis Advisor", "Jose Dolores Fuentes, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["hurricane disturbance", "Evapotranspiration", "mangrove", "tropical forest", "surface energy"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Urban land-surface impacts on atmospheric processes for Indianapolis, Indiana", "id": "14967dps217", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14967", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As part of the Indianapolis Flux experiment, observational studies were conducted to quantify the land-surface interactions between the urban surface and the atmosphere. Meteorological simulations were also executed to investigate the ability to replicate these interactions in numerical weather models. The simulation of these land-surface interactions is crucial in the simulation of atmospheric processes and meteorological variables. Deficiencies in the model were identified and through the integration of observations, several of these deficiencies were addressed.\nA set of simulations was performed by implementing different PBL schemes, urban canopy models (UCMs), and a model subroutine was created in order to reduce an inherent model overestimation of urban land cover. It was found that accurately representing the amount of urban cover in the simulations reduced the biases in most cases during the summertime (SUMMER) simulations. The simulations that used the BEP urban canopy model and the Bougeault & Lacarrere (BouLac) PBL scheme had the smallest biases in the wintertime (WINTER) simulations for most meteorological variables, with the exception being wind direction. The model configuration chosen had a larger impact on model errors during the WINTER simulations, whereas the differences between most of the model configurations during the SUMMER simulations were not statistically significant.\nSatellite-derived observations of land-surface temperature showed that the difference between the city and rural areas of Indianapolis was as high as 10K during the daytime and as high as 6K during the nighttime. The land-surface temperature enhancement was similar to values reported in other cities, such as Seoul, South Korea (8K) and Tokyo, Japan (12K). The urban environment reduced the wind speed by an average of ~3 m s-1 throughout a layer that extended ~100 meters above the land-surface. The boundary layer height over the urban surface was found to be 10% higher than the boundary layer height over the more rural areas surrounding Indianapolis. This boundary layer enhancement was lower than expected given that Indianapolis exhibited other urban enhancements that were more characteristic of larger metropolitan cities.\nUsing the land-surface definition algorithm that was developed and a model configuration that was proven to be optimal, parameterizations and parameter values were changed to better simulate the urban atmospheric enhancements and land-surface processes seen in the observations. As the surface roughness increased, the skill of the model generally improved for most meteorological variables including: 2m air temperature, friction velocity, and 10m wind speed and direction. The only detrimental effect caused by the increase in surface roughness occurred when the sensible heat flux over the city was simulated. This detriment was small when compared to the overall errors because larger issues, such as inaccurate land-surface characterization, overestimation of solar radiation in both cloudy and clear-sky conditions, and the necessity to parameterize many of the atmospheric and surface processes, were a larger contributor to the surface energy flux errors. Allowing the model to ingest observable data in order to create heterogeneous parameter values throughout the model added a layer of flexibility that greatly improved the simulation of urban enhancement processes. Many of the parameterizations in the model can still be improved upon to further reduce the simulated errors of most meteorological variables, especially the variables that define the energy fluxes at the land-surface.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16271], "author_name_tesi": "Sarmiento, Daniel Perez", "last_name_ssi": "Sarmiento", "middle_name_ssi": "Perez", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis", "Kenneth James Davis", "David R Stauffer", "Fuqing Zhang", "Andrew Mark Carleton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth James Davis, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenneth James Davis, Committee Chair", "David R Stauffer, Committee Member", "Fuqing Zhang, Committee Member", "Andrew Mark Carleton, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Land-surface interactions", "Urban meteorology", "WRF"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF SOFTWARE FOR SYSTEMATIC BENCHMARKING OF PRODUCT FAMILIES\n\n", "id": "11207", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5358", "abstract_tesi": "Benchmarking is no longer synonymous with imitation but considered an excellent means of innovation.

However, the advantages of benchmarking of product families are often undermined by limited capability of current benchmarking tools. Additionally, the process is typically done manually without the aid of software making it not only time-consuming but also subject to human variability.

The Compton continuum from a high-energy gamma ray can obscure the full-energy gamma ray photopeaks of isotopes with lower energy gamma ray emissions. The reduction from the Compton suppression system enables a more accurate identification of these low-energy gamma rays with energy peaks located within the Compton continuum. The Penn State Compton suppression system (CSS) uses a high purity germanium (HPGe) detector and a cylindrical and plug sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) guard detector to negate the effect of partially deposited gamma rays on the gamma spectrum produced when measuring a sample. The Penn State CSS negates the effect of partially deposited gamma rays on the overall gamma spectrum, therefore producing a more accurate spectrum with fewer overall counts and reduced background interference. \nThe research performed in this thesis used the Penn State CSS to validate earlier sample measurements obtained prior to the dismantling and reconstruction of the CSS. The Penn State CSS has produced superior results when compared with published literature, and it is important that it continues to perform at this level after reconstruction. 137Cs, 60Co, and irradiated National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard reference materials were measured in the CSS. A suppression factor (SF) is a comparison of suppressed to unsuppressed peak to Compton ratios, a further explanation and definition is provided in section 6.3 of this thesis. The suppression factor (SF) for the 137Cs calibrated gamma ray spectrum was 9.21, similar to the previous SF measurement of 9.97. These values are approximately 28% larger than most SFs recorded in literature, demonstrating the superior ability of the Penn State CSS. Using the calibrated Penn State CSS, two NIST standard reference materials, SRM 1570 Spinach Leaves and SRM 1571 Orchard Leaves, were measured after irradiation in the Penn State Breazeale Reactor (PSBR). Bare and cadmium covered gold wires were also irradiated in the PSBR to characterize the neutron flux shape of the current core design of the reactor. Peak and average neutron fluxes were determined for each of the irradiation locations, and the axial positions where peak neutron fluxes occurred were determined. The reference materials were irradiated both in the PSBR dry tubes and using the PSBR pneumatic transfer system. The dry tube irradiation of SRM-1570 produced a SF of 3.30 and the pneumatic transfer irradiation of SRM-1570 produced a SF of 3.27\u00b10.21; these values are functionally equivalent. The pneumatic transfer irradiation of SRM-1571 produced a suppression factor of 4.2\u00b10.10, approximately 10% greater than a previous measurement of 3.80. This work irradiated and measured the standard reference materials in triplicate, providing a more accurate evaluation of the CSS capabilities than previous work, which used a single reference material measurement. This thesis further improved upon previous Penn State CSS characterization efforts by clarifying the contributions of two isotopes to a single photopeak: a photopeak that was identified as 56Mn in 2008 was shown to be a combination of two energy peaks with contributions from 56Mn and 27Mg. This distinction was more apparent in the suppressed spectrum.\nThe improved measurements and evaluation of the Penn State CSS validates its performance by producing suppression factors that are consistent to those obtained prior to the dismantling and reconstruction of the CSS.  Furthermore, these suppression factor results remain among the highest reported in the literature.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11525], "author_name_tesi": "Sarnoski, Sarah Elizabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Sarnoski", "middle_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenan Unlu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Compton Suppression", "Radiation Detection", "Nuclear Engineering"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "IMPLEMENTATION AND VALIDATION OF A NON-CUT CELL IMMERSED BOUNDARY METHOD FOR USE IN ICING SMIULATIONS\n", "id": "11911", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1088", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes the development of a computational fluid dynamic method for the purpose of modeling changing aircraft geometry due to icing. As a computational simulation predicts the ice shape growth of an aircraft, the change in geometry has to be taken into consideration dynamically during the simulation process. A non-cut cell Immersed Boundary Method (IBM) approach is used to represent the ice on the surface of an aircraft during the icing simulation process. The IBM allows computational cells to be changed from a normal field cell in the computational domain to a cell that will enforce a no-slip boundary condition at its nodes.\n\nThis process begins with the identification of the body of interest relative to the computational grid. The nodes that are in the computational domain are also inside the body of interest are marked with an integer value signifying that they are immersed nodes. The governing equations are modified so that throughout the solution process the independent variables of the nodes at the interface of the immersed nodes and the rest of the computational domain are set to a solid wall boundary condition values (this interface is aligned with the surface of the body being represented). This is done by enforcing a zero velocity to immersed nodes relative to the grid motion and by enforcing the independent turbulence variables to their boundary condition values.\n\nThis method has been implemented in NASA's finite volume, node centered computational code (FUN3D). The formulation and implementation of this method is explained in detail including the governing equations, the implementation, and the programs used. The IBM capability is tested for two-dimensional airfoils including clean airfoils, an iced airfoil, and an airfoil in harmonic pitching motion about its quarter chord. For these simulations velocity contours, pressure distributions, coefficients of lift, coefficients of drag, and coefficients of pitching moment about the airfoil's quarter chord are computed and used for comparison against experimental results and the results from FUN3D's normal solution process. The results of the IBM simulations show that the accuracy of the IBM compares satisfactorily with the experimental results and the results from FUN3D's normal solution process.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1077], "author_name_tesi": "Sarofeen, Christian ", "last_name_ssi": "Sarofeen", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Christian", "degree_name_ssi": "ME", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Engineering", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Patterson", "Dr Eric Paterson", "Philip John Morris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Patterson, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Eric Paterson, Thesis Advisor", "Philip John Morris, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Simulation", "Computational", "IBM", "Immersed Boundary Method", "CFD", "Icing", "Rotorcraft"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Toward Understanding the Electrical Properties of Metal/Semiconductor Schottky Contacts: the Effects of Barrier Inhomogeneities and Geometry in Bulk and Nanoscale Structures\n", "id": "9963", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3687", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The work presented in this thesis comprises of two parts. Part I deals with Schottky contacts to the wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductors SiC, GaN and ZnO. These semiconductors offer great promise for a wide variety of electronic and optoelectronic applications. Schottky barriers to WBG semiconductors are attractive in particular for high temperature/high power diodes, photodetectors, and gas sensors. However, the Schottky barriers exhibit non-ideal behavior, due in part to inhomogeneities originating from immature crystal growth and device processing technologies. Apart from being a versatile electronic component, the Schottky diode is a valuable test structure. The Schottky contact is routinely used to probe substrate and epilayer quality by different electrical characterization techniques.\n\nIt is well established that the current-voltage-temperature (I-V-T) characteristics of Schottky contacts are routinely affected by the presence of barrier height inhomogeneities (BHI). Consequently, Schottky diode parameters such as the Schottky barrier height and the Richardson constant extracted using the I-V-T measurements can deviate from their actual values. The effects of BHI on the extracted Schottky barrier height have been studied in the literature. However, the effects of BHI on the Richardson constant have not been thoroughly explored and are the focus of the first part of this thesis. Based on the inhomogeneous Schottky barrier model provided by Tung, a new method for the extraction of the Richardson constant is developed. The new method is applied to the Richardson constant determination of n-type ZnO and GaN. Excellent agreement with the theoretical value is obtained in both cases.\n\nThe advent of the nanoelectronics era has resulted in the Schottky contact evolving from the relatively simple, planar structure into a more complex structure. Compared to bulk Schottky contacts, the Schottky barrier properties are expected to be widely different at the nanoscale. For example,  the I-V characteristics of nanoscale Schottky contacts are affected by the contact size and geometry. Due to the increased surface-to-volume ratio, the conduction properties of nanoscale Schottky contacts are also influenced by surface conditions such as surface charge and traps. Depending on contact size, geometry and surface conditions, an enhanced tunneling current contribution can be expected, further distorting the I-V characteristics from the simple thermionic emission model. Determination of the true Schottky barrier height in nanoscale contacts to semiconductor nanowires is important from both technological and fundamental scientific perspectives. In the second part of this thesis, we employ a simulation-based approach to study the conduction properties of an axial Schottky nanocontact to a surround-gate nanowire. A systematic study of the effects of surface charge on the I-V characteristics of the axial nano Schottky/nanowire system is undertaken. Based on the study, a method is proposed to extract the true Schottky barrier height from the I-V characteristics. The proposed method can serve as a valuable aid for interpreting experimental I-V data and can facilitate exploration of size effects on the Schottky barrier formation at the nanoscale.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3667], "author_name_tesi": "Sarpatwari, Karthik ", "last_name_ssi": "Sarpatwari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Karthik", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Osama O Awadelkarim", "Osama O Awadelkarim", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Samia A Suliman", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Suman Datta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Osama O Awadelkarim, Dissertation Advisor", "Osama O Awadelkarim, Committee Chair", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Chair", "Samia A Suliman, Committee Member", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Suman Datta, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Schottky barrier diodes", "Nanowire"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Children's self-regulation and their academic and social-emotional adjustment to school: The roles of executive function skills, attention control, and impulse control.

Current numerical calculation of acoustic streaming can involve major computing time and resources. In order to develop a quicker model, the vorticity transport equation (VTE) is used. The goal of using the VTE is to obtain a relatively fast solution with minimal computational resources, which in this case is a single PC. The intent of this method is that it is used in the early design stage of thermoacoustic devices where preliminary (although less detailed) fast results are desired. It is also preferred that the computing power be minimized as not to tie up other resources for the optimized design of thermoacoustic devices.\n\n\nThe most well known type of acoustic streaming, Rayleigh streaming, is simulated using the VTE method. A clustered grid is utilized to capture the boundary layer effect on the acoustic streaming. The governing equations used are the VTE, Poisson's equation, and an equation that relates the stream function with the velocity. The outline of the method of calculation involves (i) generating a clustered grid and ensuring there are enough points in the boundary layer, (ii) transforming the clustered grid into the uniform computational grid, (iii) transforming the governing equations to account for the clustering, (iv) calculating the vorticity and the stream function at each grid point using a Direct Method, and (v) calculating the acoustic streaming velocity using the stream function. Steps (iv) through (v) are repeated until the solution converges.\n\n\nIt is demonstrated that the VTE method to calculate Rayleigh streaming works well. There are two cases being simulated in the research, a parallel plate case and a cylindrical tube case. The numerical results agree with the analytical results for both cases, although there are some discrepancies in the cylindrical tube case. At this time, no numerical reason can be given to explain the discrepancies. The goal to perform the simulation fairly quickly with a single PC has been achieved.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1650], "author_name_tesi": "Sastrapradja, Debbie ", "last_name_ssi": "Sastrapradja", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Debbie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Victor Ward Sparrow", "Anthony A Atchley", "Philip John Morris", "Cengiz Camci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Chair", "Anthony A Atchley, Committee Member", "Philip John Morris, Committee Member", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rayleigh streaming", "acoustic streaming", "nonlinear acoustics", "vorticity transport equation", "stream function"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Dynamic Meshing Techniques for Quality Improvement, Untangling, and Warping", "id": "15419", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7763", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In order to numerically solve partial differential equations (PDEs) on physical domains using \ufb01nite element (FE) techniques, discretizations of the equations and the domains are generated. The discretizations of the domain are called meshes.

High-quality meshes are necessary for stability, ef\ufb01ciency, and convergence of a FE solver and the accuracy of the associated PDE solution.

Background on the two major statistical methods that I have used in the dissertation, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and path analysis, is also included in this section. Additionally, the introduction contains a review of  previous experiments from Dr. Stephenson\u2019s laboratory that led to my dissertation work. \nThe second chapter was motivated by previous field studies in the Stephenson lab. These studies revealed that selfed (S) wild gourd plants (Cucurbita pepo ssp. texana) experience greater cucumber beetle herbivory than outcrossed (X) plants but outcrossed plants experience a higher incidence of bacterial wilt disease. Subsequent studies showed that both types of plants were equally susceptible to this disease when exposure was similar. Given that the pathogen responsible for bacterial wilt disease (Erwinia tracheiphila) is known to be transmitted when cucumber beetles chew leaves and then defecate onto the open wounds, the difference in incidence rates required explanation.  It is known that cucumber beetles aggregate in the flowers to mate and the Stephenson lab had data showing that X plants produced more flowers than S plants. Furthermore, the flowers from X plants produced more of the volatile compounds that are known to attract cucumber beetles. This phenomenon could be explained if E. tracheiphila can be transmitted via the floral nectaries.  Therefore, I explored the possibility of transmission of this plant pathogen via the floral nectaries by: (1) Inoculating greenhouse-grown plants by placing a solution containing Erwinia tracheiphila onto the nectaries of the flowers (after removing the nectar), and showing that E. tracheiphila is able to infect plants via the nectaries; (2) Transforming E. tracheiphila cells with a GFP-marker and visually showing the progression of the bacteria through the nectary tissue and into the xylem of the pedicel; (3) Collecting cucumber beetle frass from field collected flowers and showing that more than 50% of flowers contain cucumber beetle frass in or around the nectaries, and (4) Developing E. tracheiphila-specific primers to screen cucumber beetle frass collected from flowers in the field and showing that more that 90% of flowers contained  cucumber beetle frass contaminated with the bacteria.The results of these experiments provide strong circumstantial evidence that E.  tracheiphila can be transmitted via the floral nectaries in C. pepo ssp. texana.\nChapter three contains a series of experiments to determine if the nectar of C. pepo ssp. texana has antimicrobial properties.Having showed that E. tracheiphila cells can to traverse the nectary tissue of C. pepo flowers and infect plants, I asked if the nectar present in the flowers may interfere with the growth of the bacteria inside the floral nectaries. Flowers of many species have nectar that inhibits the growth of microbes and the secondary compounds responsible for this inhibition are thought to function in preventing the degradation of nectar (to maintain its quality as a pollinator reward). However, in the case of C. pepo, nectar could also function to prevent infection with E. tracheiphila, a floral transmitted pathogen. \n In one experiment, I examined the effect of nectar on the growth of Erwinia tracheiphila and Escherichia coli using disk diffusion assays. To accomplish this, I grew lawns of E. tracheiphila and E. coli on Petri dishes and examined the area cleared by a filter paper disk impregnated with C. pepo nectar, 40% glucose or ampicillin. This study showed that C. pepo nectar inhibits the growth of both E. tracheiphila and E. coli compared to glucose, a negative control. Additionally, the antibiotic effect of nectar was as great as ampicillin for 12 hrs. In a second experiment, I inoculated greenhouse-grown plants via flowers with and without nectar.  This experiment showed that plants inoculated through flowers without nectar experienced significantly higher incidence of wilt disease. Together, these findings show that antimicrobial compounds in C. pepo nectar inhibit the growth of E. tracheiphila and can function to retard the pathogen\u2019s transmission through the floral tissues, allowing time for an abscission layer to form between the flower and pedicel.\n \tChapter four examines the direct and indirect effects of a virus-resistance transgene (VRT) on fitness during introgression in C. pepo ssp. texana in the presence of the full range of insect herbivores (vectors) and diseases.  Virus-resistant transgenic squash (Cucurbita pepo ssp pepo) are grown throughout the United States and much of Mexico and it is likely that the VRT has been introduced into wild populations of Cucurbita repeatedly. A three-year, large-scale field study (using wild gourds, transgenic and non-transgenic introgressive plants of various generations) examined reproductive output, herbivory by the primary herbivore (cucumber beetles), and incidence of both the target diseases (viruses transmitted by aphids) and a non-target disease (bacterial wilt disease) on wild gourds and transgenic and non-transgenic introgressives. These studies revealed that (1) Each year, viral diseases became established in mid-July and spread rapidly through the fields until the end of the season when most non-transgenic (susceptible) plants showed symptoms. This also showed that the introgressed transgene was truly effective against viral diseases. (2) The wild gourds, non-transgenic introgressives and transgenic introgressives did not differ in the amount of beetle damage or wilt disease incidence prior to the spread of viral diseases. (3)  Once the viral diseases spread through the fields, cucumber beetles preferred to feed on healthy (transgenic) plants and the transgenic plants experienced increased wilt disease incidence.  (4) A series of path analysis models showed that the VRT had a direct beneficial effect on reproductive output (transgenic plants are more fit) but this beneficial effect was mitigated by the indirect effects of concentrated cucumber beetle herbivory and increased wilt disease incidence once viral diseases spread thorough the fields. These indirect effects of the VRT on fitness were only apparent in the full context of the Cucurbita pathosystem: thus we can conclude that all target and non-target components are potentially important when examining ecological phenomena. \nSince chapter four detailed the direct and indirect effects of the VRT when virus is present in all the fields, the next step in chapter five was to determine the costs and benefits of those effects.  Therefore, chapter five focuses on the costs and benefits of the VRT during introgression into the wild gourd in the presence and absence of viral diseases, as well as the costs and benefits of cultivar genes during introgression. In this study we planted four one-acre fields with wild gourds, transgenic and non-transgenic introgressives and recorded reproductive output, herbivory by the primary herbivore (cucumber beetles), and incidence of both the target diseases (viruses transmitted by aphids) and a non-target disease (bacterial wilt disease) on the plants in each field. In two fields we allowed viral diseases to spread, while the other two fields were sprayed with Endeavor\u00ae, an aphid-specific insecticide that has no effect on cucumber beetles or other chewing insects. The insecticide deterred viral transmission by controlling aphid vectors but had no effect on the vectors of bacterial wilt disease.  In the unsprayed (virus) fields the data showed that: (1) Viral diseases became established in mid-July and spread rapidly through the fields and by late August most of the susceptible plants showed virus symptoms. (2) The VRT effectively deters viral disease infection in transgenic introgressives. (3) Cucumber beetle herbivory and wilt disease incidence was higher in transgenic introgressives after the virus spread through the fields. (4) Reproductive output was higher in transgenic introgressives.  However, on the sprayed (no-virus) fields the data show that the transgenic introgressives also had greater reproductive output than wild gourds and non-transgenic introgressives but the benefit was not as great as in the unsprayed (virus) fields. The benefit of the VRT in the sprayed fields seems to be due to the introduction of the target virus into the fields in August (end of the season) and a benefit of cultivar genes. The optimal growing conditions for wild gourds are hot and dry and because the summer of 2009 was wet and cool, both the transgenic and non-transgenic introgressives had greater reproductive output than wild gourd plants, regardless of disease pressure. The parental cultivar had been bred to grow and reproduce well in the northeastern US while the wild gourd originated in Texas. These findings also show that there are indirect effects of the VRT on a non-target herbivore (cucumber beetles) and the pathogen it transmits (E. tracheiphila) when viral diseases are allowed to spread through the fields. These findings suggest that yearly variations in environmental variables such as temperature, rainfall and time of virus introduction, can impact the fitness of the VRT during introgression. In addition, it is important to note that our studies were performed north of the native range of wild gourds  and that different populations of organisms (insects, predators, pathogens) as well as competition (both inter and intra-specific) among plants may also play roles in the fitness of the VRT during introgression.\nIn summary, my dissertation explores the transmission of an important bacterial pathogen (bacterial wilt disease) through floral tissues of Cucurbita pepo ssp. texana and the effect of floral nectar on the transmission of the pathogen, as well as the direct and indirect effects of a virus-resistance transgene (VRT) on plant fitness, cucumber beetle herbivory, and the incidence of bacterial wilt disease and viral diseases as the VRT introgresses into wild Cucurbita pepo. As a unit, my research suggests that it is important to study the individual components of a pathosystem and their interactions when assessing the costs and benefits of resistance genes (both natural and transgenic). \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3967], "author_name_tesi": "Sasuclark, Miruna  Ariadna ", "last_name_ssi": "Sasuclark", "middle_name_ssi": "Ariadna ", "first_name_ssi": "Miruna ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew George Stephenson", "Andrew George Stephenson", "Richard Cyr", "James Landis Rosenberger", "Mark C Mescher", "James Alan Winsor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew George Stephenson, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Member", "Richard Cyr, Committee Chair", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member", "Mark C Mescher, Committee Member", "James Alan Winsor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bacterial wilt disease", "viral-resistance transgene", "infectious disease", "Cucurbita pepo", "ZYMV", "path analysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "CHEMISTRY OF SUSTAINABILITY \u2013  PART I: CARBON DIOXIDE AS AN ORGANIC SYNTHON AND  PART II: STUDY OF THERMODYNAMICS OF CATION EXCHANGE REACTIONS IN SEMICONDUCTOR NANOCRYSTALS", "id": "13334aas5384", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13334", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Sustainability is an important part of the design and development of new chemical and energy conversion processes.

The rapidly growing field of continuous flow processing in organic synthesis is introduced, and its importance in the development of sustainable chemical conversions is highlighted. The second chapter describes the development of a novel route to \u03b1-amino acids via reductive carboxylation of imines. A mechanistic proposal is presented and the reaction is shown to proceed through the intermediacy of \u03b1-amino alkyl metal species. Possible strategies for designing catalytic and enantioselective variants of the reaction are presented. The third chapter describes the development of a catalytic oxidative carboxylation of olefins to yield cyclic carbonates. The importance of flow chemistry and membrane separation is demonstrated by allowing the combination of mutually incompatible reagents in a single reaction sequence.\nWhile the use of carbon dioxide for synthesis of organic fine chemicals is not expected to help reduce the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, or tackle climate change, it certainly has the potential to reduce our dependence on non-sustainable carbon feedstocks, and help achieve a carbon neutral chemical life cycle. \nHaving described the use of carbon dioxide and flow chemistry for sustainable chemical conversion, the fourth chapter introduces the role of nanomaterials in sustainable solar energy conversion and storage. The use of cation exchange reactions in nanocrystals to access novel materials is highlighted. Despite having shown tremendous promise in the synthetic applications, the fundamental measurements of the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of a cation exchange reaction are largely non-existent. This impedes the future growth of this powerful methodology. The technique of isothermal titration calorimetry is introduced, and its importance to studying the thermochemical changes occurring during cation exchange is outlined. The final chapter presents results obtained from the isothermal titration calorimetry on the prototypical cation exchange reaction between cadmium selenide and silver ions. The role of nanoparticle size, identity of the silver salt, solvent, surface ligands and temperature is studied.

The nineteenth century witnessed not only the rise of specialties in the natural and physical sciences in Europe but also an unprecedented development in printing techniques and publishing practices. In newspapers, journals, novels, and plays, medical scientists presented an increasingly specialized array of knowledge. At the same time, literary works by authors outside the bounds of science proper were equally enmeshed in the creation and dissemination of scientific concepts. Working with the imperatives of literary criticism, history of science, and science, technology and society (STS) in mind, I study how this co-development of literary and scientific thought in nineteenth-century France and England informed and enabled medical scientists to situate their own experiences of a newly empirical medicine and medical technology.\n\nRather than focus on the representation of medical ideas in literature or that of literary ideas in medicine, I argue for a consideration of science and art as mutually constitutive domains of understanding, which together shape and even produce what we call \u201cknowledge.\u201d Whether in the laboratory, operating theater, or public stage, the framework within which nineteenth-century medical experiences are articulated and made sense of is decidedly aesthetic. This dissertation accordingly analyzes the dynamics of a scientific enterprise that not only established the scope of bodily aesthesis or sensory perception, but also fashioned itself aesthetically through textual publication and theatrical display, catering to the very sensory frameworks it predetermined. For example, experimental psychologist Alfred Binet, in both his treatises and medical plays, described the onset of mental illness as the unfolding of a two-act play. Similarly, Frederick Treves articulated the work of surgery as a handicraft, encouraging the artistic practices of etching and carving in the education of the surgical hand. As texts which influence public perceptions about medical practice as well as the more significant actions of future medical practitioners, literatures of experiential medicine recount, reveal and critique existing medical practices, and also propose new possibilities for medical encounters between individuals.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7125], "author_name_tesi": "Sattar, Atia ", "last_name_ssi": "Sattar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Atia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Comparative Literature", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Eburne", "Susan Merrill Squier", "Charlotte Diane Eubanks", "Robert Lougy", "Willa Zahava Silverman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Eburne, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Merrill Squier, Committee Member", "Charlotte Diane Eubanks, Committee Member", "Robert Lougy, Committee Member", "Willa Zahava Silverman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nineteenth Century", "Medicine and Literature", "Claude Bernard", "Frederick Treves", "Grant Allen", "Medical Humanities", "Alfred Binet"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "REDUCING THE COST OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY INTEGRATION IN HOUSING CONSTRUCTION THROUGH PREFABRICATION\n", "id": "11252", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1827", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Concerns over global climate change and rising energy costs have motivated the innovation of energy efficiency and renewable energy products and technologies for the residential market.

The tool showed a significant difference between the cost of systems when viewed from an initial cost and lifecycle cost.  The advanced prefabrication case, incorporating renewable energy increased initial costs by 191%, but lifecycle costs by 40%.  The in depth analysis of hydronic systems indicated that prefabrication can reduce labor costs by 17-30%, and monthly cost of ownership by 4-16%, compared to site-built hydronic systems. The research also highlighted the importance of energy costs on the affordability of advanced systems.\nQualitative data was collected to organize effects of prefabrication that cannot be assigned quantitative values.

Lifestyle modification, including dietary changes, continues to be the first line of therapy for risk management. While notable progress has been made in identifying foods and nutrients that optimize health, it remains unclear as to what eating patterns are most effective at reducing risk in vulnerable populations. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the relationship between diet and vascular risk factors in two high-risk populations: individuals with type 2 diabetes and older adults. Additionally, it will examine the reliability of a novel method of measuring vascular health that has the potential to improve risk assessment in the medical clinic.\nThe first study in this dissertation evaluated the effects of nut consumption on blood pressure, systemic hemodynamics, heart rate variability, and endothelial function in adults with type 2 diabetes. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in this population, and interventions to reduce risk are urgently needed. We enrolled 30 adults with type 2 diabetes in a randomized, crossover, controlled-feeding study. After a 2-week baseline period, participants consumed a low-fat control diet (27% fat) and a moderate-fat pistachio diet (33% fat) containing pistachios (20% of daily energy) for 4 weeks each. Following each diet period, we assessed systemic hemodynamics and heart rate variability at rest and during acute mental stress, endothelial function, and, in a subset of participants (n=21), 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure. There was no difference between treatments in blood pressure at rest and during mental stress; however, total peripheral resistance was significantly reduced by approximately 4% following the pistachio diet and did not change following the control diet. Furthermore, 24-hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure, which is a better predictor of target organ damage than resting blood pressure, was significantly reduced by 3.5 mmHg following the pistachio diet. Several measures of heart rate variability were improved following the pistachio diet, and there was no difference between the treatments on endothelial function. This study demonstrates that, for individuals with type 2 diabetes, consuming a moderate-fat diet that includes pistachios improves multiple cardiovascular risk factors. \nThe second study in this dissertation examined whether adherence to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans is independently associated with endothelial dysfunction and arterial stiffness in a cross-sectional sample of adults from the Framingham Heart Study. There is strong evidence from intervention studies that diet is related to vascular health, but the majority of these studies have tested individual foods or nutrients and relied on small samples of mostly younger adults. The effect of overall diet quality, as defined by public health recommendations, on measures of vascular health is unknown. This study included diet and vascular data previously collected in 6020 adults in the Framingham Heart study. Diet quality was quantified with the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans Index (DGAI-2010), endothelial dysfunction was assessed via brachial flow-mediated dilation, and arterial stiffness was assessed via carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Regression analyses were used to determine whether DGAI-2010 scores were independently associated with vascular health. Baseline brachial mean flow velocity significantly decreased with increasing DGAI-2010 scores (P=0.002) and hyperemic mean flow ratio significantly increased with increasing DGAI-2010 scores (P=0.02). Augmentation index significantly decreased with increasing DGAI-2010 scores; age-stratified analyses revealed that this relationship was statistically significant only in older adults (>50 years). Diet was not significantly related to measures of endothelial dysfunction. Our results suggest a link between diet quality and vascular health and as such may be useful for designing interventions to treat or prevent age-related vascular decline.\nThe third study in this dissertation assessed the test-retest reliability of a novel method of measuring endothelial dysfunction. Peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) is a promising method for non-invasive assessment of endothelial dysfunction that is operator-independent, easily standardized between laboratories, and FDA-approved for risk assessment in medical clinics. Furthermore, given the increased risk of diabetes and CVD in adults with the metabolic syndrome,  it is important to verify the reliability of PAT in the metabolic syndrome and to provide population-specific power and sample size estimates that can guide clinical trial design. This study included 20 adults with the metabolic syndrome who completed 5 PAT tests each separated by 1 week. The PAT-derived index of endothelial dysfunction (the reactive hyperemia index, RHI) showed robust repeatability (intra-class correlation = 0.74), and was not related to daily fluctuations in glucose and insulin. We show that a parallel arm study powered at 0.90 would require 22 participants to detect an absolute change in RHI of 0.40 units (equal to ~25% change in this sample), whereas a crossover study would require only 12 participants. These results indicate that PAT can be used to assess endothelial dysfunction in adults with the metabolic syndrome as reliably as in healthy subjects.\nIn conclusion, dietary modification is a key element of CVD prevention. This dissertation provides evidence that a specific food (pistachios) and health dietary pattern (the Dietary Guidelines for Americans) may reduce risk in vulnerable populations. It also demonstrates the reliability of a novel, non-invasive method of measuring vascular endothelial dysfunction in a population with elevated risk. These findings can help researchers and clinicians develop interventions to reduce the burden of CVD in the United States and globally.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9464], "author_name_tesi": "Sauder, Katherine Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Sauder", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sheila Grace West", "Sheila Grace West", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Jan Ulbrecht", "David Nathan Proctor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sheila Grace West, Dissertation Advisor", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Chair", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "Jan Ulbrecht, Committee Member", "David Nathan Proctor, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cardiovascular disease", "nutrition", "diabetes", "metabolic syndrome", "blood pressure", "endothelial function", "arterial stiffness"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Storytelling by Adults Diagnosed with Terminal Illness: Narrative Identifying through Dialogical Research", "id": "13229", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7057", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-23T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\n\tThe purpose of this dialogical qualitative research study was to gain insight into the process of storytelling with adults diagnosed with terminal illness as a way of making meaning of their experiences and lives. The study was informed by the conceptual frameworks of story, storytelling, and story listening which are grounded in the theory of dialogism. The concept of narrative learning emphasized another aim of the study which was to explore the way in which participants continue to identify themselves narratively through their stories. Conversational and semi-structured interviews designed to elicit stories were utilized with four male adult participants diagnosed with terminal illness. The verbal stories of the participants were presented in their entirety in the study and interpretation of the stories took place through the dialogical process. The stories were viewed from multiple perspectives and the multiple voices heard in the utterances of the participants were revealed.\n\tThe findings of the study indicate that there is value in the use of storytelling in order to make meaning of the life experiences of adults with terminal illness. This value lies not only in any meanings co-constructed, but also in the process of storytelling. Both the participants and the researcher continue to gain knowledge about themselves and their worldviews as the stories of the individuals are given space to interact and are allowed to affect the individuals. Viewing the study and findings dialogically, there is no final meaning found in the stories, rather meaning making and narrative identifying were found to be continual processes.\n\tBased on the findings of the study, suggestions are offered for further research and specifically for the use of dialogical research. The study added to the development of the conceptual frameworks that supported this research.

By examining the lived experiences of this population, specifically, how high-potential development shapes leader identity; this research may shed light on solutions to issues of derailment with high- potential leader transitions. My perspective on this topic was drawn primarily from three management and organization theories with roots in social psychology. First, role and interactionist role theory; second, social comparison theory; and third, social identity theory. The research and analysis generated were viewed through a social constructivist lens. A conceptual framework was developed from relevant literature that helped to build an understanding of the lived experiences of five high-potential employees who were also self-identified leaders. This case study employed Seidman\u2019s (2013) three-interview series as the primary data collection method and used grounded and phenomenological methods in the data analysis to identify themes and construct a synthesis of the participant experiences. Findings from the study brought out two major themes: 1) Individual Maturity; and 2) Social Interactions. Out of these themes, several sub-themes are important to describe the phenomenon. The sub-themes for theme 1 (individual maturity) include: a) using emotional intelligence; and (b) valuing professional development. The sub-themes for theme 2 (social interaction) include: a) managing relationships, and b) work-life balance. The study concludes with suggestions to help Talent Management professionals develop and implement modules or assessments for leader development akin to the protocol used in this study, to encourage personal reflections specifically related to experiences that shaped beliefs about leadership. Organizations may also consider adding a values-based aspect to the interview process to gain insight into the strength of culture fit and probability of loss. The study also provides recommendations for Managers, Applied Behavior practitioners, and Policy Makers. This study also recommended that scholars conduct subsequent studies using grounded theory with multiple researchers, in both corporate and nonprofit settings with a larger population sample to encourage multiple perspectives on the phenomenon, develop a theory, and possibly facilitate even richer findings.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11700], "author_name_tesi": "Saul, Marie L", "last_name_ssi": "Saul", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Marie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William J Rothwell", "William J Rothwell", "Judith Ann Kolb", "Albert Vicere", "Roy Clariana", "Glen Kreiner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William J Rothwell, Dissertation Advisor", "William J Rothwell, Committee Chair", "Judith Ann Kolb, Committee Member", "Albert Vicere, Committee Member", "Roy Clariana, Committee Member", "Glen Kreiner, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["High-potential", "self-identified leaders", "leader identity development"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Investigation of the Structure, Function, and Regulation of Quinolinate Synthase: the Iron-Sulfur Cluster Enzyme Involved in Prokaryotic NAD+ Biosynthesis\n", "id": "11725", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "270", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential biological cofactor known primarily for its role in oxidation\u2013reduction reactions, but is also involved in ADP ribosylation, adenylation and histone deacetylation. The key intermediate in NAD+ biosynthesis is quinolinic acid. The pathway to form quinolinic acid differs between most eukaryotes and prokaryotes, making the prokaryotic pathway a possible target for design of antibacterial agents. In eukaryotes, quinolinic acid is formed via the degradation of L-tryptophan by a series of enzymes, of which three require molecular oxygen for catalysis. In prokaryotes, quinolinic acid is synthesized via the action of two enzymes, L-aspartate oxidase (NadB) and quinolinate synthase (NadA). NadB oxidizes L-aspartate to form iminoaspartate by a two\u2013electron oxidation utilizing the cofactor, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). The iminoaspartate is then condensed with dihydroxyacetone phosphate by NadA to form quinolinic acid. In contrast to the eukaryotic pathway, the prokaryotic pathway can function under strictly anaerobic conditions.\nNadA from Escherichia coli was initially proposed to contain an iron\u2013sulfur (Fe/S) cluster, due to its instability in the presence of molecular oxygen and the presence of a CysXXCysXXCys motif, which contains the cysteines that commonly ligate a [4Fe-4S] cluster. This enzyme was later confirmed to contain one [4Fe-4S] that is essential for catalysis. Through further investigation of the cysteine variants of NadA, we have demonstrated that the cluster is ligated by three cysteines that are conserved in all quinolinate synthases, of which only one lies in the CysXXCysXXCys motif. Interestingly, we found that the other two cysteines in the CysXXCys motif form a redox\u2013active disulfide bond, which regulates the rate of formation of quinolinic acid. Disulfide bond formation is regulated by thioredoxin, a disulfide bond reductase, and we have determined the redox potential of NadA to be &#8722; 264 mV using the thioredoxin redox couple. \nDespite the lack of a CysXXCys motif, we have demonstrated that NadA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is also regulated by disulfide bond formation. Our results suggest that the redox potential is higher than that of the E. coli enzyme because optimal activity is obtained with DsbA, a periplasmic oxidoreductase more oxidizing than thioredoxin. Site\u2013directed mutagaenesis studies demonstrate that the disulfide bond is formed between two cysteines in a CysXCys motif. The role of the disulfide bond in vivo has also been investigated using an E. coli strain in which the nadA gene has been replaced with a kanamaycin cassette (&#916;nadA). A variant  with a single substitution of the disulfide bond forming cysteine is unable to complement the &#916;nadA strain unless the level of expression of the variant is increased and the strain is grown in the absence of oxygen. These results suggest that the disulfide bond may play a role in protecting the Fe/S cluster from oxidative stress.\nThe only published crystal structure of NadA is from Pyrococcus horikoshii and is lacking the essential Fe/S cluster. Utilizing the apo\u2013structure bound to the substrate mimic, malate, and the knowledge of the three conserved cysteines ligating the Fe/S cluster, we have modeled the Fe/S cluster and quinolinic acid precursor into the structure. Using this model, we identified eight conserved active site residues positioned to interact with substrate and changed each of these residues by site\u2013directed mutagenesis. We then characterized the resulting variant proteins for their ability to form both quinolinic acid and inorganic phosphate, a second product of the reaction. Through these studies we have identified three variants that are completely inactive for formation of both products and five others with varying reaction rates. In future experiments, these variants will be used to build up intermediates to determine the order of events during the condensation reaction.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [267], "author_name_tesi": "Saunders, Allison Hoover", "last_name_ssi": "Saunders", "middle_name_ssi": "Hoover", "first_name_ssi": "Allison", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Squire J Booker", "Squire J Booker", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr.", "Carsten Krebs", "Ming Tien", "Philip C.

The first part\npresents flow field studies for an incompressible fluid flowing through an axisymmetric\ndevice whose geometry is that of the apparatus in which the spores will be exposed to\nhigh temperature nitrogen (N2) gas. The second part involves heat transfer studies to\nindividual and conglomerates of spores. In this study it has also been assumed that, due\nto the small size of the spores, they do not affect the flow field.\nThe flow field study through an axisymmetric device is performed using Computational\nFluid Dynamics (CFD), where the Navier-Stokes equations have been solved to obtain\nthe required flow field for a number of different boundary conditions. The results of\nthese fluid flow solutions have been used to predict residence times of microscopic spores\nin the device flowing with the carrier gas (Nitrogen, N2). These residence times are used\nin the second part of the study as the time for which the spores are exposed to the high\ntemperature gas. The second part of the study involves modelling the heat transfer to\niii\nthe spores on exposure to the surrounding high temperature Nitrogen (N2) gas by two\nmodes, firstly by convection, from the surrounding gas to the outer surface of the spore,\nfollowed subsequently by conduction, from the outer surface to the inner layers. These\nstudies will aid experimentalists in two ways. First, they will be useful in optimizing\nthe design of the apparatus for experiments and, second, they will aid in determining\noperational parameters such as as gas velocities and operating temperatures of gas for\neffective annihilation of spores.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6092], "author_name_tesi": "Saurav, Samarth ", "last_name_ssi": "Saurav", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Samarth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Deborah Levin", "Dr Deborah Levin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Deborah Levin, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Deborah Levin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["abruptly expanding internal flows", "computational fluid dynamics", "heat transfer"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The effects of friction on earthquake triggering and fault zone evolution", "id": "7777", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2237", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Variations in frictional fault strength caused by oscillating stresses and slip are analyzed.  Laboratory experiments of oscillating shear stress, equivalent to oscillating stresses that trigger seismicity on natural faults, highlight changes to stick-slip instabilities such as clock advance of failure, strength of the fault at failure and pre and coseismic slip.  I test both continuous and transient oscillations.  Correlation between oscillations and stick-slip events are determined by the timing of dynamic failure with respect to the oscillation phase or by the change in recurrence interval from background rates. The correlation of failure with the shear stress oscillation depends on oscillation frequency and amplitude at low frequencies and predominantly on oscillation amplitude at high frequencies.  The frequency boundary between these two regimes is analogous to the inverse of the time needed to displace the frictional critical slip distance. \nThe role of fault zone architecture in determining a fault\u2019s susceptibility to triggering is also investigated by varying gouge layer thickness (2 - 6 mm) and studying bare granite surfaces.  Varying fault zone architecture shows that stick-slip triggering depends on both properties of the transient oscillation, as already noted, and fault zone properties.  In these experiments, the load point displacement must be greater than the critical slip distance (Dc) in order for triggering to occur.  Faults with large Dc creep throughout the interseismic period and the triggering threshold is therefore a function of oscillation amplitude and frequency as well as fault state.  Faults with small Dc are locked throughout most of the interseismic period, so that the triggering threshold is not a function of fault state.  Frequency can inhibit failure when Dc is achieved as velocity is increasing and encourages failure if Dc is achieved during velocity reduction.  Increasing velocity temporarily strengthens the fault whereas a velocity reduction further weakens and promotes failure.\nIn addition to laboratory experiments, numerical simulation of strong and weak faults, as well as slip-weakening faults, are compared to determine differences in damage zone patterns.  Tensile fractures form along the fault where slip gradients between elements are high.  The presence of off-fault fracturing changes fault zone properties, which in turn influence slip patterns and work partitioning in the fault system.  The weak and slip-weakening fault systems demonstrate that after seismic radiation and fracture propagation energy are accounted for, excess energy is available for further damage around the fault.  This damage is most likely asymmetric and concentrates in areas that have already fractured. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2218], "author_name_tesi": "Savage, Heather M.", "last_name_ssi": "Savage", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chris Marone", "Sridhar Anandakrisnan", "Terry Engelder", "Michele Cooke", "Peter E Schiffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chris Marone, Committee Chair", "Sridhar Anandakrisnan, Committee Member", "Terry Engelder, Committee Member", "Michele Cooke, Committee Member", "Peter E Schiffer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["friction experiments", "earthquake triggering", "transient stress", "fault damage zone", "fracture"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Empirical Investigation of Typographic Overprinting Displays and Their Legibility in the Context of Information and Geographic Visualization of Text", "id": "27511", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12017", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates the visual technique of typographic overprinting \u2013 printing one layer of text directly on top of another, allowing words and letters to overlap.

Inhibitory interneurons such as stellate cells are emerging as central players in cerebellar learning and function. These neurons receive their excitatory input through mostly GluR2-lacking, calcium permeable AMPA receptors. However, GluR2-lacking receptors can be replaced with GluR2-containing, calcium impermeable receptors by synaptic activity. GluR2 insertion at the Ca-permeable synapse typically increases the decay time of a synaptic current while reducing the amplitude. An increase in GluR2-lacking receptors occurs during both learning and pathological experience, in neurons that normally express GluR2-containing receptors. Despite the fact that this GluR2 subtype switch was observed in many brain regions, the functional implications of a such change are unknown. Here I investigated how GluR2 incorporation affected the ability of synaptic input to evoke an action potential (AP) in the stellate cells. Firstly, we find that fear exposure increases GluR2 gene transcription and synaptic GluR2 incorporation in stellate cells. Secondly, I show that a fear-induced increase in GluR2-containing receptors results in a significant enhancement of evoked AP probability, and a change in the firing pattern of the interneurons due to a change in post-synaptic facilitation. \nChanges in pre-synaptic activity are known to modify the composition of AMPA receptors. Here, we tested whether changes in post-synaptic APs alone can alter the synaptic AMPAR phenotype. First, we show that increasing the AP duration can facilitate the incorporation of synaptic GluR2-containing receptors in a transcription-dependent manner. Second, I observe that dendritic synapses are mostly GluR2-lacking close to the soma, but mainly GluR2-containing at the distal dendrites, which requires protein synthesis. Broadening the action potentials results in a decrease in GluR2-containing receptors along the dendrite.  Therefore the APs can have antagonistic effects on synaptic GluR2 levels. \nIn conclusion, I show in stellate cells, that the switch in AMPAR phenotype can change the probability of APs, and conversely, that changes in AP duration can alter the AMPAR phenotype. This reciprocal interaction between AMPAR remodeling and AP generation may result in a stable dendritic GluR2 gradient that may be altered by emotional experience.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2457], "author_name_tesi": "Savtchouk, Iaroslav ", "last_name_ssi": "Savtchouk", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Iaroslav", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher", "James Harold Marden", "Bernhard Luscher", "Timothy J Jegla", "Dezhe Jin", "Matthew Whim", "S June Liu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard Luscher, Dissertation Advisor", "James Harold Marden, Committee Chair", "Bernhard Luscher, Committee Member", "Timothy J Jegla, Committee Member", "Dezhe Jin, Committee Member", "Matthew Whim, Committee Member", "S June Liu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["AMPAR", "cerebellum", "stellate cell", "GluR2", "synaptic plasticity"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Providing Verifiable Integrity on Mobile Platforms\n", "id": "8616", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "540", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mobile phone systems are becoming as advanced and powerful as desktop computers.

The findings of the study showed that antibiotics were extensively used on dairy herds for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes. Beta-lactams and tetracyclines were the most widely used antibiotics on dairy herds. Beta-lactams were used for clinical mastitis, dry cow therapy, metritis, and pneumonia; while tetracycline was primarily used in medicated milk replacers. Extralabel use of antibiotics was practiced on many farms. Extralabel use of a third generation cephalosporin, Ceftiofur was reported by 18% of the dairy herds surveyed.  Recommended prudent practices of antibiotic usage (record keeping, written treatment plans, following labeled instructions, and veterinarian's advice on antibiotic usage) were not widely practiced. It is felt that current practices related to the antimicrobial usage on farms could contribute to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria. \n      Lactating dairy cattle (n=313) on 33 dairy herds were examined for antibiotic resistant gram-negative enteric bacteria. Gram-negative enteric bacteria resistant to ampicillin, oxytetracycline, florfenicol, spectinomycin, and neomycin were isolated from feces of 31, 31, 7, 5, and 1% of lactating cows, respectively. Gram-negative enteric bacteria resistant to ampicillin, florfenicol, neomycin, tetracycline, and spectinomycin accounted for 9, 5, 1, 14, and 10% of the total Gram-negative enteric bacteria. Gram-negative enteric bacteria belonging to 12 species were isolated from dairy cattle, of which Escherichia coli (87%) was the most predominant species. Monte Carlo analysis revealed that E. coli would require 126 days to undergo a 3 log reduction when held in sterile water at 7oC. It was observed that dairy producers that fed medicated milk replacers to calves were 3.4 fold more likely to have lactating cattle shed tetracycline-resistant Gram-negative enteric bacteria. However a similar relationship was not observed with calves. Ampicillin- and tetracycline-resistant E. coli were the predominant isolates among the gram-negative species isolated and these isolates were genetically diverse. The findings of the study suggest that resistant Gram-negative enteric microflora was widely prevalent on farms. \n      Tetracycline determinants tet(B) and tet(A) were detected in 93 and 7% of the isolates, respectively. These tet determinants were located on the chromosome, and sequence analysis revealed association of tetR and tetA with transposon Tn10. This is the first report of a chromosomally located tet efflux pump associated with Tn10 in enteric E. coli isolated from lactating cattle. The results of this study show that one of the pathways through which tetracycline resistance can be mediated is through transposable element Tn10 that harbor a tet(B) determinant. \n      Ampicillin resistant enteric E. coli (n=94 isolates) from lactating cattle were examined for susceptibility to other antibiotics and genetic determinants that encode for beta-lactam resistance. The majority of the E. coli isolates were resistant to tetracycline (88%) followed by chloramphenicol (30%), spectinomycin (35%), ticarcillin (33%), ticarcillin/ clavulanic acid (23%) and ceftiofur (27%). Multidrug resistance (>3 to 8 antimicrobial agents) was observed in 44 of 94 (47%) isolates, interestingly on most occasions multidrug resistant ceftiofur isolates were also resistant to chloramphenicol. All E. coli isolates were susceptible to the 4th generation cephalosporin cefepime. The extended-spectrum beta-lactamase enzymes were not detected in ceftiofur resistant isolates. Ampicillin-resistant isolates contained blaTEM, while ceftiofur-resistant isolates contained cephamycinase (blaCMY). Class I integrons of >1 kb were observed in 10 of 75 E. coli isolates. Sequence analysis revealed that the integrons encoded for streptomycin and spectinomycin (aadA), and/or trimethoprim (dfr) resistance. \nThese findings suggest commensal enteric E. coli and other Gram-negative enteric bacteria from lactating cattle can be a significant reservoir of antibiotic-resistant determinants. Widespread prevalence of antibiotic-resistant E. coli could also pose a risk to public health as these organisms have the ability to survive for long periods in the environment and could gain access to the food chain. \n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16], "author_name_tesi": "Sawant, Ashish Anant", "last_name_ssi": "Sawant", "middle_name_ssi": "Anant", "first_name_ssi": "Ashish", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao", "Avery August", "Brenda Love", "Lorraine Sordillo", "Stephen John Knabel", "Jeffrey Watts"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bhushan M Jayarao, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Brenda Love, Committee Member", "Lorraine Sordillo, Committee Member", "Stephen John Knabel, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Watts, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["molecular epidemiology", "dairy cattle", "enteric bacteria", "antibiotic resistance"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Statistical Modeling of Image Semantics from Imperfectly Labeled Data Sets", "id": "18875", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8921", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Computer vision is an integral aspect of cognitive computing with diverse applications in medical diagnostics and health-care, communication, transportation, entertainment, and data management.

Rainwater harvesting typically is used for non-potable applications in the U.S. It can reduce the need for potable water for applications such as toilet flushing and landscape irrigation; however, it can be problematic because of climatic conditions, tank storage issues, health concerns and an uncertain return on investment. \nFor this project, the rainwater harvesting potential was estimated for the Penn State Harrisburg Campus. The Hydrologic Engineering Center\u2019s Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) (version 3.4) model was selected for the analysis. The 1990 rainfall data was considered as input rainfall data values in the model as a representation of the model\u2019s operation under continuous simulation conditions. The minimum lawn requirement was 1.5 inches per week. Because of pollution concerns, the first-flush water was diverted in the HEC-HMS model as per the guidelines in the Virginia Manual for Rainwater Harvesting. \nDifferent representations of the model elements, notably the cistern, were analyzed during the development of the rainwater harvesting model. The original goal was to evaluate the ratio of irrigated area versus roof area to determine the capture efficiency of tanks sized based on typical engineering design storms.\nThe primary challenge in this modeling was representing the processes occurring in the cistern, namely a specified drawdown (based on irrigation needs) and the overflow to the drainage system when the cistern filled during a runoff event. The final conclusion was that HEC-HMS may not be the right model at this time for evaluating rainwater harvesting at a site scale. Certain limitations in the model elements as described in this thesis prevented the achievement of the original goal. However, if these limitations are addressed in a future model update, developing a site-level rainwater harvesting model that can be incorporated into existing watershed models that use HEC-HMS should be relatively simple.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5111], "author_name_tesi": "Sawant, Rima ", "last_name_ssi": "Sawant", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rima", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Pollution Control", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Shirley Elizabeth Clark", "Shirley Elizabeth Clark"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Shirley Elizabeth Clark, Thesis Advisor", "Shirley Elizabeth Clark, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["rainwater harvesting", "hec-hms model"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Catchment Classification: An empirical analysis to hydrologic similarity\n", "id": "10069", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3344", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Classification is a fundamental process of understanding major attributes and interactions of those attributes in any field of science.

Approximately 300 catchments were chosen for this study located east of the Rocky Mountains extending out towards the Atlantic Ocean.

These signatures are subsequently used to create a catchment classification system for about 300 US basins.

A top-down modeling framework with model structures of increasing complexity is applied to the same catchments used in part 1. The minimum complexity needed to represent model structures is identified. Catchments requiring similar model complexities are considered hydrologically similar. [3] In the third study, the temporal consistency of a signature-based classification is assessed over a period of over 40 years. This work provides insight into the potential hydrological implications of climate and land use change.\n\nThroughout this thesis we assume that hydrologic similarity is derived from the hydrologic behavior of a catchment.

In this study, commercial coin cells (2032, with capacity 40 mAh) and cylindrical cells (18650, with capacity of 2250 mAh) are studied systematically under extreme conditions to investigate the safety issue of Li-ion batteries.  The cells were subjected to standard short circuit (constant resistance) tests and a novel constant voltage test.  The constant voltage discharge test was used to determine how batteries perform under low voltages to calculate the limiting current.  The cells were tested at their nominal voltage, 3.6 V, as well as 3 V, and 2 V.  The coin cell was also tested at 1 V and 0.5 V.  Upon the start of each discharge the cell current shows a sharp peak and then gradually decreases.  This test was repeated at one higher and three lower ambient temperatures for coin cells with similar current and temperature trends observed for each test.  Linear trends were observed for the coin cell with respect to inrush current and maximum temperature rise vs. discharge voltage.  The 18650 cell test was performed at room temperature and also exhibited linear trends for inrush current and maximum temperature rise vs. discharge voltage.  The results of the constant voltage tests are used to determine the limiting current of the cells using a linear regression of the data to extrapolate to 0V.  The limiting current was 2.23 A (equivalent to 56 C) for the coin cell and 88.1 A (equivalent to 39 C) for the 18650 cell.  The constant resistance tests were performed on the cell to determine how it behaves under short circuit conditions as well as to obtain limiting current data for comparison with the calculations from constant voltage tests.  Both cell types showed very high inrush current at the start of discharge but rapidly decreased to lower values and then gradually decreased. The inrush currents increased with decreasing resistance for both cell types, however the 18650 cell experienced higher currents overall.  The maximum temperature rise for the coin cell tests did not vary much with the external resistance, while that for the18650 cell  increased with decreasing external resistance.    The inrush current during short circuit test was 2.51 A for the coin cell (with constant resistance of 0.026 \u03a9) and 85 A for 18650 cell (with constant resistance of 0.050 \u03a9 ). These inrush current values are very close to the limiting currents obtained from the constant voltage tests. The coin cells survived all the extreme condition tests with maximum temperature lower than 50 \uf0b0C, but 18650 cells failed during 2 V constant voltage test and 0.050 \u03a9 short circuit test with surface temperature up to 122 \uf0b0C.

The effects of gender norms and hours worked both inside and outside of the home on health, satisfaction, and work-family conflict was examined.  The goal of this study was to demonstrate that the way in which household labor is divided, as predicted by gender, hours worked, and income level relative to one\u2019s spouse, can have serious health effects on women and men in married couples, both directly and in combination with work-family conflict and perceptions of fairness.  Further, this research examined whether or not gender ideology can explain the relationships among conflict, fairness perceptions, and health among married working couples.  The tenets of deviance neutralization theory (Greenstein, 2000) suggest that women are breaking with gender norms when they are the female breadwinner.  Thus, the principles of this theory demonstrate that female breadwinners may attempt to preserve gender roles within the home (females perform more housework than their husbands).  For the purposes of this paper, female breadwinners who also do the majority of housework were termed \u201clionesses.\u201d \nUsing HILDA data, Wave 5 (2005), this paper demonstrated that the majority of women still performed more housework than their husbands, whether they were a breadwinner or not.  Further, although gender norms were not a significant predictor of the household division of labor, those women who were lionesses reported the same level of work-family conflict and satisfaction with the division of household labor/childcare as their counterparts who did not perform the majority of housework.  Although this paper did not demonstrate that overall physical or mental health differences were observed between lionesses and non-lionesses within the female breadwinner subsample, significant differences were found in one facet of mental health \u2013 emotional functioning.  Thus, this paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating the possible negative effects of continuing to perform greater amounts of work both inside and outside of the home for lioness women.  Further, this paper also demonstrated that lioness women may not report greater work-family conflict or lower fairness, despite the fact that hours worked within the home were greater overall.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3347], "author_name_tesi": "Sawyer, Katina ", "last_name_ssi": "Sawyer", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Katina", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeanette Cleveland", "Dr Jeanette Cleveland"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeanette Cleveland, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Jeanette Cleveland, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Female Breadwinner", "Health", "Household Labor"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Heterosexual bias in the measurement of work-family conflict for same-sex couples\n", "id": "16197", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8059", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Little is known about whether LBG individuals experience work-family conflict differently than heterosexual individuals.

In the present work, a frequency domain nonlinear noise propagation algorithm (NLFDA) is presented. Noise propagation of the sound generated by high-speed jets, as mentioned, experiences nonlinear propagation. This nonlinear behavior, which includes the transfer of energy to high frequencies from central and lower frequencies, is captured in the present algorithm. The generalized nonlinear Burgers equation, which includes atmospheric absorption and dissipation, is solved for the pressure signal in the frequency domain. The results are then obtained as a function of time by inverting the signal back from frequency domain. A test case of a pure tone sinusoidal wave is considered, and the results are verified with the existing analytical Blackstock Bridging Function (BBF), Fubini and Fay solutions. The predicted results of the sinusoidal wave case agree fairly well with the analytical results. Scaled jet nozzle data collected at the anechoic chambers of the Boeing Low Speed Aeroacoustic Facility (LSAF) and Penn State Jet Acoustic Facility are used for the broadband noise prediction. The experiments include both heated subsonic and supersonic jet cases. The experimental and predicted Power Spectral Density (PSD) plots are compared for the measurements made by microphones located at different radial distances. The predicted results are in good agreement with the experimental results at all the microphone locations, and the PSD plots show a lift at high frequencies due to the nonlinear steepening of the waves. The skewness of the experimental and predicted signal is discussed. NLFDA comparisons are also done with full scale F/A-18E engine tie-down tests and the differences in the results are discussed. All the nonlinear PSD plots are also compared with the linear predictions to better visualize the differences in linear and nonlinear propagation. A ground reflection formulation is then described. The Boeing LSAF heated supersonic and F/A-18E engine data are propagated using the nonlinear algorithm with the ground effects are included to study the effective noise pattern due to the sound reflected from the ground. Morfey-Howell nonlinearity parameter, normalized quad-spectral density is calculated for the Boeing heated supersonic case and F/A-18E engine test case and the energy transfer to high frequencies from low frequencies is explained with its help. To conclude, the NLFDA algorithm presented in the thesis accurately captures the nonlinear affects in broadband high-speed jet noise and can be extended further in more than one dimension.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6013], "author_name_tesi": "Saxena, Swati ", "last_name_ssi": "Saxena", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Swati", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip John Morris"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Philip John Morris, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["shock", "Burgers equation", "nonlinear acoustics", "broadband jet noise", "power spectral density"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Prediction of Noise and Installation Effects of High-subsonic Dual-stream Jets in Flight", "id": "15614", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7163", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Both military and civil aircraft in service generate high levels of noise. One of the major contributors to this noise generated from the aircraft is the jet engine exhaust. This makes the study of jet noise and methods to reduce jet noise an active research area with the aim of designing quieter military and commercial aircraft. The current stringent aircraft noise regulations imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other international agencies, have further raised the need to perform accurate jet noise calculations for more reliable estimation of the jet noise sources. The main aim of the present research is to perform jet noise simulations of single and dual-stream jets with engineering accuracy and assess forward flight effects on the jet noise. Installation effects such as caused by the pylon are also studied using a simplified pylon nozzle configuration.\n\nDue to advances in computational power, it has become possible to perform turbulent flow simulations of high speed jets, which leads to more accurate noise predictions. In the present research, a hybrid unsteady RANS-LES parallel multi-block structured grid solver called EAGLEJet is written to perform the nozzle flow calculations. The far-field noise calculation is performed using solutions to the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation. The present calculations use meshes with 5 to 11 million grid points and require about three weeks of computing time with about 100 processors. A baseline single stream convergent nozzle and a dual-stream coaxial convergent nozzle are used for the flow and noise analysis.\n\nCalculations for the convergent nozzle are performed at a high subsonic jet Mach number of Mj = 0.9, which is similar to the operating conditions for commercial aircraft engines. A parallel flow gives the flight effect, which is simulated with a co-flow Mach number, Mcf varying from 0.0 to 0.28. The grid resolution effects, statistical properties of the turbulence and the heated jet effects (TTR = 2.7) are studied and related to the noise characteristics of the jet. Both flow and noise predictions show good agreement with PIV and microphone measurements. The potential core lengths and nozzle wall boundary characteristics are studied to understand the differences between the numerical potential core lengths as compared to experiments. The flight velocity exponent, m is calculated from the noise reduction in overall sound pressure levels (OASPL, dB) and relative velocity (Vj - Vcf) at all jet inlet (angular) angles. The variation of the exponent, m at lower (50 deg. to 90 deg.) and higher aft inlet angles (120 deg. to 150 deg.) is studied and compared with available measurements. Previous studies have shown a different variation of the exponent with inlet angles while the current numerical data match well with recent experiments conducted on the same nozzle geometry.\n\nToday, turbofans are the most efficient engines in service used in almost all major commercial aircraft. Turbofans have a dual-stream exhaust nozzle with primary and secondary flow whose flow and noise characteristics are different from that of single stream jets. A Boeing-designed coaxial nozzle, with area ratio of As/Ap = 3.0, is used to study dual-stream jet noise in the present research. In this configuration, the primary nozzle extends beyond the secondary nozzle, which is representative of large turbofan engines in commercial service. The flow calculations are performed at high subsonic Mach numbers in the primary and secondary nozzles (Mpj = 0.85, Msj = 0.95) with heated core flow, TTRp = 2.26 and unheated fan flow, TTRs = 1.0. The co-flow of Mcf = 0.2 is used. The subscripts p, s and amb represent the primary (core) nozzle, the secondary (fan) nozzle, and the ambient flow conditions, respectively. The statistical properties in the primary and secondary shear layers are studied and compared with those of the single stream jets. It has been found that the eddy convection velocity is lower in dual-stream jets as compared to the single stream jet operating at a similar jet exit Mach number. The phase velocity is higher in the secondary shear layer as compared to primary shear layer. The noise measurements agree well with the predicted data and noise reduction is observed in the presence of co-flow. The variation of the flight velocity exponent is calculated as a function of nozzle inlet angle. The value of the exponent at higher inlet angles is lower as compared to the single stream jets. This suggests that the noise levels are less affected in the peak noise direction in the presence of co-flow in dual-stream jets as compared to single stream jets. Two reference velocities: primary jet exit velocity Vpj and mixed velocity Vmix are considered which result in different absolute values of the exponents. Scaling of the jet spectra is performed at different inlet angles and good collapse has been obtained between the spectra.\n\nThe installation effects on jet noise are studied using a simplified pylon structure with a dual-stream nozzle. In the presence of a pylon, the azimuthal symmetry of the nozzle is lost and thus the flow characteristics are different as compared to the baseline nozzle. This will result in different noise characteristics of the installed jet.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7150], "author_name_tesi": "Saxena, Swati ", "last_name_ssi": "Saxena", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Swati", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip John Morris", "Dennis K Mclaughlin", "Kenneth Steven Brentner", "Victor Ward Sparrow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Philip John Morris, Dissertation Advisor", "Dennis K Mclaughlin, Committee Member", "Kenneth Steven Brentner, Committee Member", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aeroacoustics", "subsonic jet noise", "dual-stream jets", "forward flight", "installation effects", "turbulence modeling", "DES"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "SECRETORY PROTEIN FOLDING AND THE QUALITY CONTROL OF MISFOLDED GLYCOPROTEINS", "id": "6663", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "341", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) provides a special environment that caters to the maturation of secretory and membrane proteins. The folding of these proteins into their native conformations within the ER lumen is a process of paramount importance. How protein folding actually takes place inside the cell however, is still poorly understood. The identification of genes and proteins that constitute the folding machinery in the ER therefore, is an important step towards understanding secretory protein folding.  Here we employ a powerful genetic screen that allows the isolation of mutants defective in various secretory pathway functions. A parallel effort was made to optimize existing methods to assay protein folding and also to develop new tools that are greatly needed to better study protein folding in vivo.  Using these methods, we have identified several genes that may play a role in protein folding. In addition, we describe the identification and characterization of a novel gene, undiscovered at the time of discovery that appears to play a role in the folding of some secretory proteins.\nWhile protein folding is a remarkable process, it is not free from errors which can result in incorrect protein folding. Such aberrantly folded proteins are known to be inherently toxic and their accumulation in cells can be detrimental. In the (ER), a quality control system exists to detect, retain and ultimately degrade terminally misfolded proteins, thereby alleviating the stress they cause. While much is known about the later events of this ER associated protein degradation (ERAD), it is not clear how the quality control machinery differentiates aberrantly folded proteins from actively folding or properly folded ones, and selectively delivers them to the degradation machinery. Past studies have shown that specific N-linked glycan structures function as signals for the targeting of misfolded glycoproteins to ERAD via a lectin targeting machinery. Recently it was discovered by our group that, of the many glycans that may be present on a protein, only certain glycans function as ERAD targeting signals, suggesting that additional components within the substrate may comprise the ERAD targeting signal \nHere we show that specific regions within the polypeptide chain that are proximal to an ERAD glycan act in conjunction with it to target a model misfolded glycoprotein substrate for degradation. Furthermore, we show that these protein-glycan determinants can be moved out of their context within the protein and still retain their functionality. Further characterization of the properties of such quality control determinants will shed more light on one of the most fundamental questions of protein quality control, i.e., how misfolded proteins are selectively degraded over other \u201chealthy\u201d proteins. The presence of such determinants on glycoproteins is an unanticipated finding and holds promise for the establishment of new paradigms in the field of protein quality control.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [335], "author_name_tesi": "Sayeed, Ayaz ", "last_name_ssi": "Sayeed", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ayaz", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wesley Tsoekjen Ng", "Richard W Ordway", "David Scott Gilmour", "Richard John Frisque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wesley Tsoekjen Ng, Committee Chair", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Endoplasmic Reticulum", "Protein Folding", "Protein Degradation", "Protein Quality Control"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Comparison of Different Types of Hydration Beverages on Anaerobic Performance Following Aerobic Fatigue in Physically Active Individuals", "id": "26603", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11640", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In athletics, performance may be inhibited by as little as a 2% decrease in body weight due to hydration loss.

This study\u2019s aim was to determine the effects of different modes of hydration on anaerobic performance following aerobic fatigue among physically active individuals. It was hypothesized that ingesting a CESD rather than water or a CPD prior to all activity would lead to lower times and greater distances. Seventeen recreationally active collegiate students were recruited for this study. This was a cross-over study that used a within-participant design in which subjects drank one of three drink conditions (300 milliliters of water, 355 milliliters of CESD (Gatorade), or 355 milliliters of CPD (Accelerade)). Following consumption of the beverage, subjects waited 30 minutes to ensure absorption, ran for 30 minutes, and then completed three trials each of three anaerobic tests: a 10-yard sprint, an agility drill, and a broad jump.

Advances in laser technology continually push the interaction of light and matter to higher energies, reaching unexplored intensities in which new science is emerging.  The work detailed in this thesis pertains to the ionization mechanisms that occur in atoms, molecules, and clusters for a wide range of laser intensities.\n\nPresented in Chapter 1 is a brief introduction to ionization, discussing the mechanisms in which it proceeds in different mediums including atoms, molecules, and clusters.  At low laser intensities, the responsible ionization mechanism for atoms and molecules is the sequential absorption of photons by the molecule until the energy is high enough to kick off an electron, known as multiphoton ionization. However, at higher intensities the electric field (ponderomotive energy) of the laser becomes comparable to the attractive forces of the nuclei and ionization proceeds through the phenomena known as quantum tunneling.  Tunneling ionization relies on the small probability that the electron exists outside a barrier. \n\nA large enhancement in the ionization rate, in which electrons are ejected at an energy that is orders of magnitude lower than expected, is observed in clustered species at very high intensities and is not yet completely understood. The focus of this dissertation research is to investigate the influence of laser intensity on the production of highly charged ions from molecules and clusters in order to gain insight into the mechanisms involved. \n\nChapter 2 provides an in depth explanation to the experimental apparatus and technique used to measure the ionization dynamics.  The experiments conducted herein required use of a femtosecond laser system coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer uniquely coupled to allow for the intensity to be selected. In the experiments conducted here, an ultra-intense femtosecond laser is focused onto a molecular/cluster beam, instantly heating the electrons to roughly a million kelvin causing ionization.  The intensity dependence on the extent of ionization is measured in a vacuum chamber via a time-of-flight mass spectrometry. \n\nA variety of theoretical simulations used for comparison to the experimental results are explained in Chapter 3.  This involves the precise determination of the electronic wavefunction through electronic structural software.  Additionally, a series of tunneling models are detailed and used for the experiments. \n\nThe ionization and fragmentation dynamics of a simple molecule, silane, are discussed in Chapter 4.  The ionization potential of silane is found to be in agreement with other techniques.  Moreover, the appearance potentials of the fragments have been measured and are also in relatively good agreement with literature results, as well as calculated adiabatic values.  The branching ratio is determined to proceed to SiH3+ to a larger extent than with chemical vapor deposition, which could help in the production of defect free thin film transistors and solar cells.  \n\nIn Chapter 5, an in depth investigation to the ionization mechanism of ammonia is detailed and compared to the mechanism observed in ammonia clusters.  The ionization of ammonia was found to proceed through tunneling of electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).  Fragments of NH2+ and NH+ are observed to appear from electrons tunneling from an inner orbital, HOMO-1.  Thus, ionization is observed to originate from multiple orbitals, with the orbital contributions separated by m/z in the mass spectrometer.  Upon clustering, complete removal of all valence electrons was observed orders of magnitude lower in laser intensity than expected.  This extreme ionization enhancement demonstrates tunneling from all valence orbitals.  Ionization occurs non-sequentially indicating that once an orbital is accessed by the laser, it is emptied of electrons.\n\nChapter 6 discusses the measurement of the ionization potentials of small silicon clusters.  The intensity scan method can be used to determine the ionization potential of stable clusters and even be used as a new technique for discovering magic clusters.  The high charge states are found to behave according to as if their ionization potentials were lowered by ~40%.  They also demonstrate a nonsequential ionization mechanism.  \n\nChapter 7 discusses the ionization mechanisms for the Group Vb transition metal (V, Nb, and Ta) oxide clusters.  The exchange of the metal ion does not lead to extensive changes in the energy requirements of the high charge states.  However, the more stable the cluster distribution, the further the ionization proceeds.  The appearance of the high charge states of the oxygen are not only enhanced, but demonstrate disagreement with the expected appearance ordering from the ADK model.  The ionization mechanism is attributed to arising from frozen orbitals.  As many orbitals are similar in energy, this leads to a steady flowing of electrons from the clusters at low laser intensities, before significant movement occurs.  \n\nFinally, Chapter 8 brings this thesis to a conclusion.  By systematically varying the laser intensity, it has been possible to not only measure the ionization potential for a wide variety of systems, but also to obtain mechanistic information.  Tunneling has been witnessed to occur from multiple molecular orbitals and is greatly enhanced by the clustering phenomena, occurring orders of magnitude lower in laser intensity than expected.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5593], "author_name_tesi": "Sayres, Scott Grayson", "last_name_ssi": "Sayres", "middle_name_ssi": "Grayson", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "James Bernhard Anderson", "Nicholas Winograd", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Chair", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member", "Nicholas Winograd, Committee Member", "Jorge Osvaldo Sofo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["high charge states", "mass spectrometry", "Coulomb explosion", "strong-field ionization", "multiphoton ionization"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT FILLING METHODS FOR DEPOSITION OF POWDERS IN DIES: MEASUREMENT AND MODELING\n", "id": "7955", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6028", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of this research was to measure, analyze, and model the pressure distribution characteristics of powder deposition into rectangular and circular shallow dies using four filling methods. The feed shoe, the rotational rainy, the point feed, and the pneumatic filling methods were used to investigate the deposition characteristics into shallow dies. In order to evaluate the pressure distribution during filling of shallow dies, factors influencing powder deposition were studied. The factors included particle size and shape, particle size distribution, feed shoe speed, and tube cross-section (in case of feed shoe filling) and deposition rates (in case of rotational rainy, point feed, and pneumatic filling). A battery powder mixture (BPM) and microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel PH102) with median size of 84 and 600 , respectively, were used to fill a shallow rectangular die 32 30 mm and 6.5 mm deep and a shallow circular die 35 mm in diameter and 6.5 mm deep. \nThe second generation of pressure deposition tester (PDT-II) with circular and square feed shoe tube cross-sections was used to measure the two powders\u2019 pressure distribution characteristics. An innovative rotational rainy filling device was designed and fabricated. This versatile device can be used to measure filling characteristics at different rotational speeds (1-10 rpm) for various powders. The point feed (funnel fill) method with a funnel of 30 mm inlet diameter and 4.2 mm outlet diameter opening was used to fill the rectangular and circular shallow dies. The pneumatic filling method was designed and fabricated to fill the die using air as the conveying medium in a rectangular cross-section tube. The pneumatic filling device was limited to using only the BPM powder, since the Avicel powder generated substantial quantity of airborne dust during the test. Symmetry analysis, variance metrics, and uniformity analysis were used to quantify the deposition characteristics.\nThe results showed that: 1) filled contour plot analysis was the most reliable method for measuring deposition characteristics; 2) for all filling methods, the circular die generated higher uniformity compared to rectangular die; 3) the rainy filling method generated the best uniformity of pressure distribution compared with the other three filling methods (average of 77% uniformity); 4) the point feed method and feed shoe filling method were the second and third best filling methods with the average uniformity of 64% and 55%, respectively; 5) the pneumatic filling method was not a suitable method to fill the die (21% uniformity of pressure distribution); 6) the average filling period for feed shoe, rotational rainy, and point feed were 8 second, 15 second, and 40 second, respectively; 7) higher stress was generated inside the rectangular die than in the circular die; 8) for rotational rainy fill and the point feed, deposition rates did not substantially influence the uniformity of pressure distribution inside the die; 9) feed shoe speed highly influenced the uniformity of pressure distribution inside the die; 10) the feed shoe tube cross-section did not influence the pressure distribution; 11) for feed shoe filling method, the areas of high pressure values (> 60 dm, where dm=decimeter equivalent of pressure) were less than 5% of the total area for both rectangular and circular dies; 12) most particle accumulation was observed in forward region of the die due to leveling process; 13) die geometry highly influenced the uniformity of pressure distribution; 14) the leveling procedure (removing surcharge powder) markedly increased non-uniformity within the die (approximately 20%); 15) the overall rate equation for all three filling methods was:  , where h is equivalent height, F(t) is a function of time,  and   are coefficients ; 16) the root mean square error (RMSE) for feed shoe, rotational rainy, and point feed were 0.16 dm, 0.44 dm, and 0.32 dm; respectively; whereas the average relative difference (ARD) values were 7%, 16%, and 11%, respectively.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6020], "author_name_tesi": "Sayyar Roudsari, Saed ", "last_name_ssi": "Sayyar Roudsari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Saed", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Virendra Puri", "Ali Demirci", "Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Ali Borhan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Virendra Puri, Committee Chair", "Ali Demirci, Committee Member", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Member", "Ali Borhan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Uniformity evaluation", "Powder Mechanics", "Powder deposition", "Mathematical Modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Accrual Information and Insider Trading: An Empirical Analysis", "id": "9213", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "295", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-11-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Managers have the ability to time the disclosure of the non-cash component of earnings, which, is termed accrual information, to outside investors.

However, there is limited work simultaneously examining these behaviors, specifically at the event-level. \n\nObjective: The current study examined the effects of alcohol use, drinking protective behaviors, social protective behaviors, and contextual risk factors on AViC at the global level, using a prospective longitudinal design (Aim 1) and at the event-level using daily diary data (Aim 2). Aim 3 utilized ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine the processes (via intentions and willingness) that influence decisions to drink, use protective behaviors, or engage in contextual risk on a given day. \n\nMethods: A random sample of 235 first-year female drinkers completed web-based assessments at the beginning (baseline) and end (3-month follow-up) of their first semester of college (Aim 1). Two-thirds of participants were randomized to an EMA protocol, which included 3-5 short cell phone-based surveys each day for 14 days (Aims 2 & 3). Hypotheses were tested using path analysis (Aims 1 and 2) and hierarchical linear modeling (Aim 3). \n\nResults: At the global level, typical weekend drinking was positively associated with alcohol-related victimization, but not consequences. This association weakened as individuals used more protective behaviors and more frequently drank in certain contexts (e.g., at parties; with friends). At the event-level, both estimated blood alcohol concentration (eBAC) and variability in eBAC (averaged across individual drinking occasions) were associated with increased AViC. Drinking protective behavior use moderated these effects; however, social protective behavior use did not. Contextual factors also moderated the associations between event-level eBAC and AViC, such that for individuals who frequently engaged in sexual behavior during/after drinking, as their drinking and variability in drinking increased, so did their risk for AViC. Aim 3 analyses revealed individuals achieved higher eBACs, used more protective behaviors and engaged in greater contextual risk when they had greater intentions and were more willing to do so (across drinking occasions). The effects of willingness and intentions on drinking, protective behavior use, and contextual risk exposure varied within and across days. For example, women engaged in a wider variety of drinking contexts on days when their context intentions were higher than their own mean, and women used more social protective behaviors on days when their willingness to do so increased throughout the day. \n\nImplications: The current study is among the first to simultaneously examine drinking, protective behavior use, and context as predictors of AViC at multiple levels (e.g., global vs. daily). Findings suggest harm-reduction alcohol interventions remain a useful tool in reducing AViC, but that their efficacy might be enhanced by also accounting for daily variability in drinking and by promoting the use of both drinking and social protective behaviors. Momentary examination of decision-making processes revealed that intentions and willingness might influence behavior at different levels, challenging behavioral theories that assume global associations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10944], "author_name_tesi": "Scaglione, Nichole Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Scaglione", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Nichole", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert James Turrisi", "Robert James Turrisi", "Michael John Cleveland", "Laura Klein", "Patricia Barthalow Koch", "Margaret Ann Lorah"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert James Turrisi, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert James Turrisi, Committee Chair", "Michael John Cleveland, Committee Member", "Laura Klein, Committee Member", "Patricia Barthalow Koch, Committee Member", "Margaret Ann Lorah, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["College student drinking", "sexual assault", "consequences", "victimization prevention"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The role of negative affect and self-concept clarity in predicting self-injurious urges in borderline personality disorder using ecological momentary assessment", "id": "jh343s28d", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12953", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Borderline personality disorder is a prevalent and deadly disorder that is characterized by deficits in identity, affective instability, and frequent self-injurious and suicidal behavior.  Deficits in identity as well as negative affect have been shown to predict self-injurious and suicidal behaviors.  However, less is known about the interactive effects of these two predictors.  The current study aims to examine the moderating effect of a particular component of identity, self-concept, on the relationship between negative affect and self-injurious/suicidal urges.  The purpose of the present study is twofold.  First, we aim to examine psychological processes that may serve as mechanisms involved in self-injurious behavior in BPD.  More specifically, we are interested in the interplay of two specific features of BPD, negative affect and identity disturbance, as they relate to self-injury.  Much of the research on suicide and self-injury has focused on identifying risk factors and correlates of these behaviors (e.g., family history of suicide, access to firearms, etc.).  Although this is valuable research for identifying factors that may be associated with suicide and self-injurious behaviors and may indirectly help to reduce the prevalence or lethality of a suicide attempt or self-injury (e.g., removing firearms from the home of an individual who is suicidal), it does not tell us much about the actual psychological mechanisms that are involved in such behavior.  Understanding the psychological mechanisms involved in self-injury in BPD is important because these mechanisms can serve as direct targets in therapy that, when addressed, may result in longer term change.  A second aim of the present study is to utilize an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approach to studying self-injury in the daily lives of individuals with BPD.  As will be discussed later, utilizing an approach that can capture the temporal dynamics observed in BPD is crucial for gaining a more valid understanding of psychological processes such as negative affect and identity, their relation to self-injury, and how these processes play out in one\u2019s daily life.\nThe present study utilizes an an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approach to study the role of negative affect and self-concept clarity in predicting self-injurious urges among 55 outpatients diagnosed with BPD or an anxiety disorder who completed randomly prompted surveys on smartphone devices over the course of 21 days.

The Introduction argues for increased attention to the tradition of liberal religious discourse; Chapter One (\u201cExploring the Intersections of Rhetoric, Gender, and Liberal Religion\u201d) subsequently suggests that the metaphysical healing movement participated in the broader conciliatory project of liberal religion, as it sought a means of making scientific and religious modes of understanding compatible.  It also introduces the three major themes that I will use to characterize metaphysical healing as a liberal religious discourse: social progress vs. individual enlightenment; reason vs. passionate belief; and professional authority vs. individual expression.  Chapter Two (\u201c\u2018Neither Christian nor scientific\u2019: Character, Common Sense, and the Liberal Backlash Against Metaphysical Healing\u201d) offers a detailed analysis of the popular debate over metaphysical healing, addressing each of the three themes introduced in Chapter One.  I show that women held the same contested relationship to religious liberalism that they held to liberalism more generally: they risked being dismissed as speaking subjects, precisely because their arguments relied heavily on liberal assumptions about reason and objectivity.\n\nChapters Three (\u201cThe Liberty of the Daughters of God: Mary Baker Eddy and a Rhetoric for Woman\u2019s Hour\u201d) and Four (\u201c\u2018I AM the radiant Logos in Mind\u2019: Emma Curtis Hopkins, Spirituality, and the Divine Dialectic\u201d) address the major figures of this study.  Chapter 3 claims that Mary Baker Eddy melded Christian and liberal values to develop what she understood as a truly progressive Christianity.  In integrating these two discourses, she redefined progressive, liberal standards in feminine terms and thus undermined the standard arguments against women\u2019s public speaking and active participation in public religious life.  However, Eddy remained invested in nineteenth-century visions of feminine spirituality, ironically reifying the very stereotypes that stymied female preaching.  Chapter 4 argues that Emma Curtis Hopkins advanced a dialectical vision of religious discourse that is in many respects more radical than Eddy\u2019s.  Hopkins encouraged dialogue as a means of religious instruction, emphasizing the democratic and mutually uplifting relationship between teacher and student.  However, the sense of empowerment Hopkins provided her followers rarely extended beyond the personal and private.  The work of these two figures suggests that a liberal religious discourse held implications for nineteenth-century women that were contradictory, shifting, and undeniably complicated.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [737], "author_name_tesi": "Scalise, Brandy Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Scalise", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Brandy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheryl Jean Glenn", "Cheryl Jean Glenn", "John L Selzer", "Robin Schulze", "Anne Carver Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheryl Jean Glenn, Dissertation Advisor", "Cheryl Jean Glenn, Committee Chair", "John L Selzer, Committee Chair", "Robin Schulze, Committee Member", "Anne Carver Rose, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["metaphyscial healing", "religious history", "Religious rhetoric"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Verb Frequency Effects and Mood Preference: Implications for the L2 Teaching and Learning of Negated Matrix Verbs of Belief", "id": "19437", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9351", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     This dissertation examines subtle distinctions of selection between the subjunctive and indicative moods in complement clauses appearing with negated matrix verbs of belief in Spanish. Motivated by the disparity between how native speakers select mood and the stringent prescriptive rules that appear in second language textbooks, I investigate whether three groups of proficient English-Spanish speakers adhere to prescriptive notions, and thereby reject indicative complement clauses when negated verbs of belief are used in the matrix clause, or whether the acceptance of indicative complements is modulated by the frequency with which matrix verbs surface with the indicative mood in subordinate clauses in natural language input. \n     In Experiment 1, the grammaticality judgments of 60 monolingual Spanish speakers from Granada, Spain, 20 monolingual Spanish speakers from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, 20 Spanish-English secondary students from Valladolid, Spain, 24 English-Spanish teachers of Spanish, 24 English-Spanish non-teachers and 16 English-Spanish now-teachers are analyzed for seven negated matrix verbs of belief. The now-teachers originally pertained to the group of non-teachers and were tested twice: once prior to having any teaching experience, and a second time after having taught for three years. The grammaticality judgments concern whether a subordinate clause that appears after a negated verb of belief in the matrix clause allows an indicative complement, \u2018Ella no cree que su novio es guapo\u2019 (She doesn\u2019t believe that her boyfriend is handsome), in addition to the widely accepted subjunctive complement, \u2018Ella no cree que su novio sea guapo\u2019 (She doesn\u2019t believe that her boyfriend is handsome). The results show that the three groups of L1 Spanish speakers judge indicative complements to be acceptable in contexts where the subjunctive mood is normally required by prescriptive grammar rules. Although still not approximating native speaker use, the 24 English-Spanish bilinguals consider indicative complements to be acceptable for all seven verbs prior to becoming teachers; however, after having taught Spanish for three years, these participants judge indicative complements to be marginally acceptable only for the three most frequent, negated matrix verbs of belief that appear in written and spoken Spanish, based on the Davies 100-million word corpus, similar to the English-Spanish teachers. This suggests that, in cases of highly frequent verbs, L2 Spanish teachers are able to use statistical verb information to override the influence of prescriptive rules on grammaticality judgments.\n     A second experiment is conducted using computer-mediated communication to create an authentic, input-rich environment in which the 20 Spanish-English secondary students from Valladolid participate in a synchronous, text-based chat session with 23 intermediate-level, L2 Spanish, U.S secondary students beginning their study of the Spanish subjunctive. The quantitative findings from Experiment 2 are compared to the results from Experiment 1 to assess whether L1 Spanish speakers demonstrate similar patterns of mood selection across both the grammaticality judgment task and the text-based chat. If so, this would lend support for an exemplar-based model of lexical representation in language learning based on verb frequency information and identifiable patterns of socio-pragmatic intention via real experiences with natural language. Are these patterns robust enough to propose a particular [negated matrix verb of belief] + que + [indicative or subjunctive complement] pattern to facilitate L2 learning? The qualitative results are discussed in terms of L2 Spanish learners\u2019 reactions to a follow-up analysis task based on their chat experiences with native speakers. L2 Spanish learners report literacy and cultural benefits, increased confidence in language abilities and the capacity to discern how the prescriptive grammar rules of mood selection found in L2 textbooks differ from real native speaker use as evinced in the chat. \n     Thus, the quantitative L1 Spanish results from Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that each of the seven negated matrix verbs of belief has a replicable acceptability rating and a clear mood preference, regardless of task. The qualitative results from Experiment 2 suggest that using electronic media in the L2 classroom, such as computer-mediated communication using synchronous text-based chat, has linguistic and cultural benefits that extend beyond what the traditional L2 classroom offers. Ideally, L2 Spanish learners\u2019 curriculum allows for the participation in native speaker-non-native speaker natural language interactions using electronic media supplemented by the use of revised and updated L2 instructional materials. Informed by the empirical findings from both experiments, one such L2 Spanish pedagogical and curricular improvement is thereby proposed. The new paradigm includes an updated treatment of mood selection to appear in L2 textbooks in which the seven negated matrix verbs are organized into four, distinct categories based on verb frequency information and three classifications based on the native speakers\u2019 preferential, socio-pragmatic intentions that emerged from the data.\n     Taken together, the implications of this research are discussed in terms of how linguistically informed studies can assist pedagogues in the creation of natural language-rich classroom opportunities and updated L2 instructional materials to reflect the ways in which native speakers select mood in the complement clause with negated matrix verbs of belief in Spanish. Taking a natural language, data-driven approach to language learning is arguably one of the most effective ways to promote L2 development of Spanish mood in U.S secondary schools. This dissertation is one of the first to demonstrate, via quantitative and qualitative measures, the necessity of providing language teachers and L2 Spanish learners with grammatical explanations informed by natural language corpora and linguistic research. Future investigations must extend this line of reasoning to other contrastive, L2 grammatical structures. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9153], "author_name_tesi": "Scaltz, Tracy Cramer", "last_name_ssi": "Scaltz", "middle_name_ssi": "Cramer", "first_name_ssi": "Tracy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Spanish", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Rena Torres Cacoullos", "Carrie Neal Jackson", "Karen Lynn Miller", "Maria Rosa Truglio"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paola Eulalia Dussias, Dissertation Advisor", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Committee Chair", "Rena Torres Cacoullos, Committee Member", "Carrie Neal Jackson, Committee Member", "Karen Lynn Miller, Committee Member", "Maria Rosa Truglio, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["verb frequency", "mood preference", "socio-pragmatic intention", "pedagogy", "subjunctive/indicative", "negated matrix verbs of belief"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Exploring Intangible and Non-financial Success Metrics for Professionals in the Meetings and Events Industry", "id": "19695", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9416", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The study discussed in this paper comes at a critical time.  As the meetings and events industry continues to grow and mature, and meetings and events become strategic solutions for clients, professionals are required to show business value in the meetings and events that they plan. Clients need constant reassurance that their event will have a positive and successful outcome.  In some cases, this measure of success can be a financial one:  where the meeting or event benefits outweigh the costs.  However, with a wide variety of meeting and event types, it is not always possible to quantify benefits with a dollar value.  Meetings and events can have intangible benefits, but with current industry evaluation models, these intangible benefits are not measured well and are somewhat ignored.  Another gap in current meeting and event evaluation models is the focus.  Models, such as the Phillips\u2019 Return on Investment (ROI) Methodology, measure return on investment for the client, but much of the data is not relevant or collectible for the meeting professional. Little information exists on how planners can measure the success of their meetings and events.  The need to demonstrate business value and limited success metrics are the key reasons why this study was conducted.\nFrom an evaluation standpoint, industry professionals are faced with two primary issues.  The first issue is the definition of a successful meeting or event, and the second is how to appropriately measure intangible, non-financial success.  What constitutes success may vary by industry segments or meeting type, but these nuances aren\u2019t addressed in current evaluation models, such as ROI.  ROI is only an appropriate measure in five percent of meetings and events (Myhill & Phillips, 2006), which suggests that additional success metrics can be developed and tested.\nA two-tiered study employing qualitative and quantitative methodologies was used to address the multiple study purposes.  First, telephone interviews were conducted with the objective of identifying how meeting and event industry professionals define and discuss success in the events they plan, as well as uncover key success traits along with ways to measure them.  In addition, the results of the interviews were reviewed to determine if the Pine and Gilmore Experience Economy framework is an appropriate classification for meetings and events industry evaluation models.  The emergent themes from the first part of the study were used to inform a questionnaire sent to a sample of the meetings and events industry population for triangulation.  The sample of professionals shared their levels of agreement with the definition of meeting and event success, and key traits and measurement metrics of success.  The results of the survey were analyzed using a chi-square statistical analysis and used to suggest a new model for success evaluation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9214], "author_name_tesi": "Scamacca, Leslie Gail", "last_name_ssi": "Scamacca", "middle_name_ssi": "Gail", "first_name_ssi": "Leslie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Lynn Passmore", "Rose Marie Baker", "Wesley Edward Donahue", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Lynn Passmore, Dissertation Advisor", "Rose Marie Baker, Committee Member", "Wesley Edward Donahue, Committee Member", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Meetings and events", "evaluation", "success"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Do Alternate Stable States Occur in Streams?

More recent work has focused on improving existing devices by employing metamaterials in their design and construction.  These recent efforts have begun to show truly practical applications of metamaterials in real-world devices, giving such benefits as increased operating bandwidth and reduced weight.  Specifically, metamaterial surfaces, or ``metasurfaces'' show great promise in improving the performance of radio-frequency (RF) and microwave antennas.\n\nProperly designed metasurfaces can be included as liners for horn antennas to support hybrid modes, which yield rotationally symmetric radiation patterns with minimal cross-polarization.  Such radiation characteristics are desirable for satellite reflector antennas, where reducing the size and weight of antennas corresponds to a dramatic reduction in costs.  These satellite antennas often use separate polarizations as separate communication channels, effectively providing nearly double the communications data bandwidth through a single antenna.  Traditionally, corrugated horns provide low cross-polarization, but they are very expensive to manufacture and are very heavy.  Here we show a conical horn antenna with metamaterial liners operating over an octave bandwidth including the Ku-band with cross-polarization better than -30 dB.  The metamaterials add virtually no loss to the horn, while exceeding the bandwidth of a corrugated horn and requiring a fraction of the weight.  To achieve this excellent performance, we developed the metamaterial surface designs, mode analyses for circular metasurface-lined waveguides, as well as an analysis of metahorns with various methods for tapering the inhomogeneous metamaterial properties along the length of the horns.\n\nThe second antenna herein developed employs metamaterials for miniaturization while providing comparable performance to much larger existing antennas.  Conventionally, efficient antennas operating over more than a few percent bandwidth require dimensions approaching a wavelength or more.  In the low UHF band, such antennas will have sizes on the order of a meter.  Artificial magnetic conducting (AMC) substrates have been shown to reduce the height profile of these antennas, but at the expense of operating bandwidth.  Adding tunability has restored the flexibility of dynamically adjusting the communication channel over a wide range, but the lateral dimensions of the antenna are still quite large.  Here we introduce a miniaturized low-profile antenna system based on a tunable AMC substrate beneath a tunable small antenna element - specifically, crossed end-loaded dipoles.  This system allows a channel bandwidth of a few percent with the flexibility of adjusting this channel over a range including 220 MHz to 270 MHz, all while using an antenna element that is still only a fraction of a wavelength in its largest dimension.  In addition, the tunable end-loaded dipoles allow dynamic control of the antenna's polarization, allowing near arbitrary polarization control without the need for expensive phase shifters or complex feeding circuitry.  While previous work has achieved several of these characteristics in isolation, we have achieved all of them from the combination of tunable AMC surfaces with a miniaturized unit cell and electrically-tunable crossed end-loaded dipoles with near-arbitrary polarization control.  Measurements of a prototype showed excellent results.  Since the antenna is nearly entirely based on standard printed circuit board manufacturing techniques with relatively inexpensive components, it promises to be an eminently practical antenna for vehicular and airborne applications requiring low-profile antennas for satellite connectivity.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10165], "author_name_tesi": "Scarborough, Clinton Post", "last_name_ssi": "Scarborough", "middle_name_ssi": "Post", "first_name_ssi": "Clinton", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner", "Douglas Henry Werner", "Pingjuan Li Werner", "Douglas Edward Wolfe", "Julio Urbina"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Henry Werner, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas Henry Werner, Committee Chair", "Pingjuan Li Werner, Committee Member", "Douglas Edward Wolfe, Committee Member", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["antennas", "metamaterials", "horn antennas", "satellite communications"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Dynamics of Fluidic Devices with Applications to Rotor Pitch Links", "id": "20438", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9628", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-31T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Coupling a Fluidic Flexible Matrix Composite (F2MC) to an air-pressurized fluid port\nproduces a fundamentally new class of tunable vibration isolator.

With NASA\u2019s Asteroid Redirect Mission in the planning stages, the prospect of bringing an asteroid back to the vicinity of the Earth is tantalizing.  Once an asteroid has been retrieved and brought back to the Earth\u2013Moon system and placed into orbit for study, human crews will visit it and study it up close.  This thesis explores the orbital dynamics of an asteroid in orbit around the Earth\u2013Moon libration point, EML1.  The dynamics of the motions for a spacecraft in close proximity to an asteroid are found using the circular restricted four-body problem (CR4BP).  Treating the problem as the superposition of two circular restricted three-body problems (CR3BP), the asteroid becomes an additional gravitational perturbation to a spacecraft close to the asteroid.  Two sets of coupled equations of motion, one for the asteroid and one for the spacecraft are derived and solved simultaneously.  A trade study to examine the near-term behavior of a spacecraft\u2019s orbit relative to the asteroid is conducted via a series of simulations utilizing a variety of variables such as the asteroid\u2019s location and mass relative to the spacecraft, the size of orbit, and the varying of initial conditions.  The characteristics being studied are the stability of the spacecraft\u2019s orbit over a short duration as well as the range between the spacecraft and its target asteroid over the mission duration.  In addition, the minimum safe stand-off distance between both objects is determined to ensure no collisions or orbital instability.  The ultimate goal is to obtain various datasets to deduce the most stable conditions for placing an asteroid and to determine where to fly a spacecraft in formation with the asteroid in orbit about the EML1 libration point.
