Though breast cancer subtypes differ in their aggressiveness and their response to treatment, the mechanisms by which distinct subtypes arise remain unknown. Traditionally, attempts to explain the varied clinical behavior of breast cancers rely on defining the genetic lesions harbored within individual tumors. However, recent evidence suggests that distinct breast cancer subtypes may arise from distinct MEC lineages, suggesting that some biological features of a given breast cancer subtype may be attributable to its antecedent \u201ccell of origin\u201d.\n\tElucidating whether MEC lineage impacts the biology of descendant breast cancers presents a formidable challenge. By the time a tumor is clinically detectable, breast cancers have undergone clonal evolution that precludes a reliable retrospective determination of the cell of origin. As such, prospective analyses may be required to determine whether distinct MEC subtypes yield distinct cancer subtypes. We hypothesized that distinct MEC compartments yield different phenotypes in response to an identical oncogenic stimulus. To test this possibility, we generated mouse models that permit doxycycline-dependent expression of transgenes in an MEC compartment-restricted manner and developed strategies to monitor transgene-mediated phenotypes in real-time.\n\tAs a first step toward studying malignant transformation of distinct MEC subtypes in mice, we tested experimental strategies designed to permit restriction of transgene expression to distinct MEC compartments in vitro. Transgenic mammary epithelium was partially disaggregated and propagated in 3D culture as mammary organoids, preserving the bilayered arrangement of the basal and luminal MEC compartments. Pairing a tet operator-driven H2B-eGFP reporter transgene with either a basal or luminal MEC transactivator enabled MEC compartment-restricted reporter gene expression. Notably, nuclear fluorescence resulting from H2B-eGFP expression enabled visualization of cellular dynamics within discrete MEC compartments. Through extended, multiparameter live cell imaging of organoids, time-lapse movies were generated that enabled visualization of MEC migration as well as tracking and quantitation of mitotic and apoptotic events.\n\tNext, we adapted this system to co-express the H2B-eGFP reporter together with a tet-operator-regulated oncogenic H-RASG12V allele. Whether expressed in a basal or luminal MEC-restricted manner, H-RASG12V expression reproducibly triggered aberrant organoid growth, reflected in measureable changes in organoid size and shape. Increases in organoid size were attributable to H-RASG12V-mediated increases in cell proliferation and decreases in cell death. In addition, H-RASG12V expression in either MEC compartment drove MECs to both traverse normal compartment boundaries and adopt modes of cellular migration distinct from those encountered in the setting of physiologic Ras signaling.\n\tSurprisingly, though H-RASG12V expression in each MEC compartment triggered similar perturbations in cell fate, inhibitor studies uncovered marked differences in the downstream signaling pathways critical for Ras-mediated overgrowth of basal versus luminal MECs. Most dramatically, inhibition of either the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (Pi3k) or the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) pathways completely suppressed growth perturbations due to the basal, but not the luminal expression of H-RASG12V. To extend these findings, future studies should examine whether MEC-specific dependencies on Ras pathway effectors are maintained during tumor progression. If so, then cell of origin may emerge as a powerful predictor of the drug sensitivity profile of descendant breast cancers.\n\tFinally, to further dissect cellular mechanisms of Ras-mediated MEC overgrowth, we developed novel methods for generating and analyzing chimeric mammary organoids engineered such that only discrete subsets of basal or luminal MECs express H-RASG12V. Overgrowth of H-RASG12V-expressing MEC subsets recapitulated those changes in organoid size and morphology triggered by broader, compartment-wide H-RASG12V expression. Aberrant growth was largely driven by expansion of H-RASG12V-expressing MEC clones. However, H-RASG12V-expressing MECs also impacted neighboring wild-type MECs by inducing them to form cellular protrusions and adopt aberrant modes of migration. These finding identify novel, cell non-autonomous effects of H-RASG12V-expression.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3322, 3323, 3324, 3325, 3326], "author_name_tesi": "Plichta, Kristin Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Plichta", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Kristin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward Joseph Gunther", "Edward Joseph Gunther", "Andrea Manni", "Christopher Alan Siedlecki", "Lisa M Shantz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward Joseph Gunther, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Committee Chair", "Andrea Manni, Committee Member", "Christopher Alan Siedlecki, Committee Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ras", "mammary organoids", "breast cancer", "transgenic mice", "mammary epithelial cells"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "THE ECOLOGY, MANAGEMENT AND MARKETING OF NON-TIMBER FOREST PRODUCTS IN THE ALTO RIO GUAM\u00c1 INDIGENOUS RESERVE (EASTERN BRAZILIAN AMAZON)\n\n\n", "id": "5895", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2596", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-10-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tIndigenous and other forest peoples in the Amazon region have used hundreds of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) for food, medicine, tools, construction and other purposes in their daily lives.  As these communities shift from subsistence to more cash-based economies, they are trying to increase their harvest and marketing of some NTFPs as one way to generate extra income.  The idea that NTFP harvests can meet these economic goals and reduce deforestation pressure by reducing logging and cash-crop agriculture is politically attractive, but this strategy\u2019s feasibility remains in doubt because the production and market potential of many NTFPs remains unknown.  The need to obtain this sort of information is particularly important in indigenous reserves in the Brazilian Amazon since these comprise the country\u2019s largest category of protected forests, and indigenous people are actively seeking economic means to support community development.\n\tBetween 1996 and 2000, I spent a total of two years in the Alto Rio Guam\u00e1 Indigenous Reserve in eastern Par\u00e1 state, Brazil studying production ecology of five regionally important NTFPs: oleoresin from copaiba trees (Copaifera spp.), resin from breu trees (Protium spp.), aerial roots from titica vines (Heteropsis spp.), latex from amap\u00e1 trees (Parahancornia amapa and Couma guianensis), and seed oil from andiroba trees (Carapa guianensis).  My studies were primarily based in the Temb\u00e9 Indian village of Tekohaw that is a one or two day journey by river and road from the regional center of commerce in Bel\u00e9m.  The objectives of NTFP case studies on copaiba, breu and titica were to: 1) quantify the amount of marketable product that could be obtained per plant and per area of forest, 2) identify key factors that influenced variation in these amounts, 3) estimate the amount of harvest that would be possible on a repeated basis and the length of this harvest cycle, 4) estimate the amount of time a harvester needs to spend to find, harvest and process a unit of product and how much income they would earn for this time invested.\n\tResults showed that a variety of factors contributed to the low economic returns that could be obtained by harvesting the NTFPs investigated in this project.  Copaiba oleoresin had a relatively high unit price, but the availability of the product was severely restricted by the low density of the trees (<1 tree/ha), the limited percentage (15%) of trees that yielded more than 50 ml of oleoresin when drilled, and a sharp drop-off in oleoresin yield in trees that were retapped one year after the initial drilling.  While the likelihood of obtaining oil from these trees was greatest in trees in the 55-65 cm Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) group, there was drop-off in oleoresin harvest in even larger trees because most were hollow and had apparently lost their capacity to store oleoresin in enclosed trunk cavities.\n\tBreu trees had a density of 10 trees per ha, and about 40% of trees yielded some resin.  The amount of resin increased with tree size and was related to the degree of attack by a bark-boring weevil whose larvae develop inside the resin lumps that form on the trunk.  The larvae of a syrphid fly are also found in resin lumps from some types of breu trees, but it is unlikely these flies stimulated resin flow.  Breu resin loses about 17% of its weight while drying, but some of this may be due to resin removal by stingless bees.  The low market price for the resin makes it difficult for harvesters to regularly earn the Brazilian minimum wage (about $US 3.50 per day in 1999), but since it will take about four years for resin levels to rebound to initial harvest levels, it is a resource that if managed wisely can provide a periodic source of income.\n\tTitica vines are very common in some forests and can be found on as many as several hundred host trees per ha.  To meet the demands of wicker furniture makers, harvesters only take relatively thick mature aerial roots.  While harvesters may gather 10 to 40 kg of roots per day, the removal of bad pieces, stripping of root cortex, and drying reduces the commercial product to 20% of the harvested weight.  This processing of roots can take as much time as the harvesting.  Among the products studied, titica offers the best short-term revenue, but since many harvested roots die or fail to regrow after being broken from the main plant, it may take decades for a titica population in an area to return to a harvestable condition.\n\tThese case studies showed that it was difficult to find NTFPs that met all the conditions (high density, high yield, low percentage of loss during processing, high price, quick resource renewal) to make their commercial collection worthwhile to Temb\u00e9 harvesters on an ongoing basis.  Better understanding NTFP production capabilities and the factors that influence them will help communities realistically assess how much each resource can contribute to their annual income and how harvesting can be managed to preserve each source population as a long-term resource.  An increase in demand for consumer goods, however, will probably necessitate greater investments in intentional NTFP planting and other economic activities.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2589], "author_name_tesi": "Plowden, James Campbell", "last_name_ssi": "Plowden", "middle_name_ssi": "Campbell", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology"}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Improvements in Wet Strength and Liquid Barrier Properties of Cellulosic Substrates Using Polysaccharide Blends", "id": "22787", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9444", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Petroleum-based plastics, including those used in the food packaging industry, pose a threat to the environment by utilizing nonrenewable resources in the manufacturing process.

Ingestion of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) foliage in the first through third instars prior to oral viral inoculation in the fourth instar significantly reduced mortality of Heliothis virescens F. by Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV).  A construct of AcNPV that expresses lacZ under the control of the hsp70 promoter of Drosophila (AcNPV-hsp70/lacZ) was used to examine viral infection in vivo.   Larvae that consumed cotton foliage in the first 8 h of the fourth instar prior to viral inoculation experienced a significant reduction in both mortality and percentage of larvae with foci of infection, compared with larvae fed artificial diet.  Although cotton ingested prior to inoculation significantly reduced the percentage of larvae with midgut infection foci (indicated by lacZ signaling), there was no difference in the percentage of larvae possessing systemic tracheal infection foci, compared with larvae fed artificial diet.  These results support the hypothesis that ingested cotton foliage hinders establishment of midgut infections in H. virescens, perhaps by modifying midgut physiology or by direct antagonism between virions and foliage components. This effect may not be limited to cotton, since other host plants of H. virescens (tobacco and oakleaf lettuce) also significantly reduced larval susceptibility to AcNPV when consumed prior to viral inoculation.\t\n\tThe peritrophic matrix (PM) of herbivorous insects lines the midgut, protecting it from damage by ingested plant material.  A significantly thicker PM was observed in cotton-fed larvae compared with artificial diet-fed larvae, suggesting that this thickened PM protects the midgut cells from damage by ingested foliage and secondarily provides protection from ingested pathogens.  Disruption of the PM by the metalloprotease enhancin in cotton-fed larvae restored larval susceptibility to the level of diet-fed larvae.  When viral pathogenesis was examined using AcNPV-hsp70/lacZ to indicate AcNPV infection, lacZ signaling appeared in larvae fed artificial diet+enhancin significantly earlier and in a greater proportion of larvae, compared with larvae fed untreated artificial diet.  Thus, the PM appears to be a barrier to baculoviral infection in cotton-fed H. virescens larvae and may be a significant factor determining pathogen success by influencing establishment of midgut infections. \n\tAlthough the ability of host plants to influence larval susceptibility to baculoviral infection is well-known, the influence on viral pathogenicity of inducing systemic acquired resistance in host plants has not been previously reported.  SAR was induced in cotton foliage by the plant elicitor benzo-(1, 2, 3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH).  BTH application significantly increased foliar peroxidase activity and total phenolic levels, but did not alter catecholic phenolic levels.  Moreover, consumption of SAR-induced foliage did not affect H. virescens pupal mass or larval mortality by AcNPV as compared to consumption of untreated foliage.  Thus, activators of SAR like BTH and baculoviruses are likely to be compatible components of an IPM system.  \n\tFurther, the colony source of H. virescens significantly influenced larval mortality.  We examined the influence of food consumed prior to viral inoculation on larval mortality of H. virescens from three different lab colonies, designated as NCSU97, AGR and NCSU02.  The NCSU97 colony had not had field-collected individuals added since its establishment five years prior.  In contrast, the AGR and NCUS02 colonies had field-collected individuals added within a year of experimentation.   Larvae from the AGR and NCSU02 colonies fed artificial diet were significantly less susceptible to AcNPV infection than artificial diet-fed NCSU97 larvae; the mechanism regulating this decreased susceptibility appears to be restricted to the midgut environment.  \n\tThis is the first report detailing the influence of ingested cotton foliage on baculoviral pathogenesis in H. virescens.  The observations that ingestion of cotton foliage alters PM structure and reduces midgut viral infections suggest possible mechanisms of host plant influence on pathogens that infect through the midgut.  Understanding the interactions between ingested foliage and insect pathogens is likely to become more important as pathogens are used more widely as biocontrol agents.  Further, these results showcase the ability of the PM to protect insects from ingested pathogens and indicate that the PM is a potentially important pest control target.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5106], "author_name_tesi": "Plymale, Ruth ", "last_name_ssi": "Plymale", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ruth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kelli Hoover", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster", "Gary Felton", "Kelly Johnson", "A Daniel Jones"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kelli Hoover, Committee Chair", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster, Committee Member", "Gary Felton, Committee Member", "Kelly Johnson, Committee Member", "A Daniel Jones, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Heliothis virescens", "peritrophic matrix", "tritrophic interactions", "biological control", "baculovirus", "pathogenesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Vulnerabilities in Advanced Metering Infrastructure", "id": "14641", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1608", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Smart grid has become a reality in the United States.

Steady-state immunity is tumor-suppressive through immunosurveillance, and recently developed immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown promise in treating various solid tumors by blocking inhibitory signals. Chronic inflammation however remains an important prognostic factor for the development of many cancers, highlighting an important dichotomy with regards to the relationship between inflammation and cancer. \n\tTo elucidate the specific roles of inflammation in cutaneous tumor establishment and progression, we used two murine models of epidermally targeted Harvey-RasG12V, specifically expressed in the basal/stem cell layer with a Keratin14 driver gene (K14Ras) under control of a reverse tetracycline transactivator, or the suprabasal/differentiated layers with an Involucrin driver gene (InvRas) under control of a tetracycline transactivator. To induce H-RasG12V expression in these mice, doxycycline was added to or removed from drinking water respectively. Specifically targeting this proto-oncogene to the basal and suprabasal layers caused generation of malignant squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) or benign papillomas respectively. H-Ras induced tumors caused initial pro-inflammatory responses in both models, but in malignant SCCs, inflammation shifted towards an immunosuppressive response. In later stages, K14Ras mice displayed a Treg/Breg skewed adaptive immune response, while InvRas mice displayed a Th2/APC+ B cell phenotype. \nTo specifically examine the roles of lymphocytes in these cutaneous tumor models, we crossed both lines onto a Recombination-Activating Gene-1 knockout (Rag1-/-) background, and found that K14RasRag1-/- mice had significantly greater tumor numbers and increased morbidity, while InvRasRag1-/- tumors regressed following 15 days of Ras-induction, indicating tumor suppressive and tumor maintaining roles for lymphocytes respectively. Depletion of CD4, CD8, and B cells was accomplished with intraperitoneal injection with specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD4, CD8, and CD20 respectively, and revealed the importance of CD4 T cells and B cells in protective immunity in K14Ras mice and tumor-promoting inflammation in InvRas mice. Adoptive transfer of CD4 T cells, B cells, or CD4 T cells with B cells highlighted that the tumor-suppressive anti-inflammatory roles in K14Ras and tumor-promoting inflammation in InvRas was a product of collaboration between these cells, as neither lymphocyte was capable of perpetuating these responses alone. Flow cytometric analysis of skin draining lymph nodes (SDLN) and tumor tissue indicated that these interactions occur within the tumor microenvironment rather than the secondary lymphoid tissue, and this was confirmed in vitro where only B cells from the tumor microenvironment were able to specifically polarize na\u00efve CD4 T cells, dependent upon direct cell-cell contact.\nFinally, we show the essential role that CD40/CD40L interactions have during the priming of both K14Ras and InvRas tumor-associated immune responses, as both in vitro and in vivo blockade of CD40L inhibited polarization of CD4 T cells, and altered tumor growth in manners that resembles Rag1-/- mice of each model. Artificial stimulation of CD40 using a CD40 agonist antibody in vivo enhanced the Rag1+/+ phenotypes of both K14Ras and InvRas mice, reducing tumor growth and inflammation in the former, and enhancing tumor growth and inflammation in the latter. The results of these studies strongly implicate CD4 T cell/B cell interactions in the establishment of the tumor-associated immune response, and that specific targeting with immunotherapeutics can tailor these responses with notable influences on tumor growth. With recent advances in immunotherapeutics as cancer treatments, our studies highlight the importance of specifically tailoring these therapies to the local immune microenvironment, as to both maximize clinical benefit as well as minimize non-responders and unintended exacerbation of a tumor-promoting immune response. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13881], "author_name_tesi": "Podolsky, Michael Adam", "last_name_ssi": "Podolsky", "middle_name_ssi": "Adam", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adam Glick", "Adam Glick", "Na Xiong", "Andrea Mastro", "Connie Rogers"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adam Glick, Dissertation Advisor", "Adam Glick, Committee Chair", "Na Xiong, Committee Member", "Andrea Mastro, Committee Member", "Connie Rogers, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Squamous Cell Carcinoma", "B-Cell", "CD40", "T-Cell", "Ras", "Immunotherapy"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Exploring The Experiences Of Technical Coaches Using Rules-Of-Thumb", "id": "10980", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5742", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nResearch literature defined rules-of-thumb as informal guidelines, shortcuts to contextual knowledge, epitomes of tacit knowledge, and codes used by both experts and novices in exchanging knowledge.

The researcher concluded the experience of using rules-of-thumb when sharing knowledge was an experience of sharing of one\u2019s self, connecting people, and pointing to what works.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5736], "author_name_tesi": "Poduch, Jr., Stanley P.", "last_name_ssi": "Poduch, Jr.", "middle_name_ssi": "P.", "first_name_ssi": "Stanley", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William J Rothwell", "William J Rothwell", "Judith Ann Kolb", "Ian E Baptiste", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William J Rothwell, Dissertation Advisor", "William J Rothwell, Committee Chair", "Judith Ann Kolb, Committee Member", "Ian E Baptiste, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rules-of-thumb", "tacit knowledge", "sharing personal knowledge"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Dynamic Assessment of Oral Proficiency Among Advanced L2 Learners of French", "id": "6627", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4100", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation seeks to offer an alternative way of conceptualizing the relationship between assessment and instruction whereby the two are not dualistically opposed, as is traditionally the case in Western pedagogies, but are instead integrated as a unified activity.  Dynamic Assessment (DA) is rooted in L.S. Vygotsky\u2019s Sociocultural Theory of cognitive development, according to which human cognitive abilities can only be fully understood through studying the processes of their development.  Thus, Vygotsky argued that assessment must go beyond mere descriptions of observable phenomena to reveal the underlying causes of poor performances and to make recommendations as to how problems can be remediated.  That is, assessment should be about prognosis rather than diagnosis.    \nAt the level of practice, DA challenges the widely accepted notion that interaction between an examiner and an examinee jeopardizes the procedure\u2019s reliability.  Instead, DA requires the examiner to mediate the examinee\u2019s performance during the assessment itself through the use of prompts, hints, and questions.  In this way, the focus of the assessment shifts from examinees\u2019 success or failure at completing a given task to an analysis of the amount and kinds of assistance they required as well as the extent to which they reciprocated the examiner\u2019s interactive moves.  Vygotsky formalized this approach to simultaneously understanding and promoting development as the zone of proximal development (ZPD).  From this perspective, analysis of examiner-examinee collaborations reveals the future performance examinees will achieve if they are given appropriate instruction (Vygotsky, 1998).  \nThis study sought to explore the application of DA to a L2 learning context.  In particular, L2 DA was considered in terms of the following: (1) any insights into learners\u2019 abilities that were not obtained from assessing a candidate\u2019s independent performance but that only came to light during DA; (2) the possibility of promoting learners\u2019 abilities through DA; (3) the usefulness of DA in leading to individualized instruction that remained sensitive to examinees\u2019 ZPD; and (4) the extent to which development transcended the given assessment context.  Six advanced undergraduate learners of L2 French were asked to orally construct a series of narratives in French based on short video clips.  The learners created the first narrative independently and the second narrative with support from the examiner.  The results of these assessments were used to develop a six-week long enrichment program in which participants met with the researcher for individualized tutoring.  The goal of these sessions was to address problems that were identified during the assessments and to do so in a manner that took account of their interactions with the examiner during DA.  Following enrichment, the nature and extent of their development was explored through repetitions of the original assessments as well as variations of these tasks.  \nThe findings suggest that DA is an effective means of understanding learners\u2019 abilities and helping them to overcome linguistic problems.  The approach is especially relevant to L2 classrooms as a method for rendering formative assessment practices more systematic.  It is therefore argued that DA should be taken seriously by Applied Linguistics researchers interested in language assessment, teaching, and learning.   \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4078], "author_name_tesi": "Poehner, Matthew Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Poehner", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Celeste S Kinginger", "James Lantolf", "Thomas Albert Hale", "Meredith Christine Doran", "Gabriella Appel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Chair", "James Lantolf, Committee Chair", "Thomas Albert Hale, Committee Member", "Meredith Christine Doran, Committee Member", "Gabriella Appel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["second language acquisition", "language assessment", "Vygotsky", "dynamic assessment", "sociocultural theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DRAFTING A NEW CHAPTER ON CRITICAL FRIENDS GROUPS: EXPLORING TEACHER LEARNING FROM A VYGOTSKIAN PERSPECTIVE\n\n\n", "id": "9729", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4936", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-03-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Teacher learning can be examined and understood from a Sociocultural Theory perspective in that learning occurs through social interaction rather than through the acquiring of skills needed to simply transmit knowledge.

To optimize learning, learners must be able to differentiate within-language variability from between-language variability, and accordingly decide when to assimilate input into an existing language representation or accommodate a new input by forming a new representation. Previous research from several language learning domains suggests that learners may be able to form separate representations for multiple inputs when provided with an adequate contextual cue (e.g., a shift from a male to female voice) that occurs at the point of transition from one input to another. Here this problem is examined in the domain of adult word learning. A series of four experiments investigates how several individual contextual cues modulate word-learners\u2019 application of the mutual exclusivity constraint (i.e., the preferential formation of one-to-one word-object mappings) to input containing many-to-one word-object mappings. In conditions lacking contextual cues, learners formed mutually exclusive one-to-one word-object mappings; by changing cues such as speaker voice and accent over successive presentations of training input, it was found that learners successfully formed many- to-one mappings. Additionally, contextual cues significantly reduced mapping ambiguity in conditions containing both one-to-one and many-to-one mappings, which in turn increased learners\u2019 confidence that they had correctly formed both types of mappings. These findings have a number of important implications for statistical learning and language acquisition: language learners appear to track statistics in a contextually sensitive manner, taking advantage of cues to optimize processing; and contextual cues, although not required for acquisition, serve as shortcuts for learners, reducing the overall amount of exposure necessary for learning when multiple inputs are available.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8667], "author_name_tesi": "Poepsel, Timothy John", "last_name_ssi": "Poepsel", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel J Weiss", "Judith Fran Kroll", "Kristin Buss", "Reginald Adams Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel J Weiss, Thesis Advisor", "Judith Fran Kroll, Thesis Advisor", "Kristin Buss, Thesis Advisor", "Reginald Adams Jr., Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["statistical learning", "mutual exclusivity", "word mapping"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The Influence of Bilingualism on Statistical Learning With Multiple Inputs", "id": "13498tjp19", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13498", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Statistical learning is a fundamental component of language acquisition, yet to date, relatively few studies have examined whether these abilities differ in bilinguals, especially when the learning task presents multiple statistically independent distributions. Furthermore, extant work comparing monolinguals and bilinguals has been undertaken in a single statistical learning paradigm representing only one of many components of the process of language acquisition.  In this dissertation, we addressed these gaps in the statistical learning literature by comparing the performance of monolinguals and late-learning bilinguals in two types of cross-situational statistical learning (CSSL) tasks that contained multiple statistical distributions. \n\tIn Experiment 1, learners (English monolinguals, English-Spanish bilinguals, and Chinese-English bilinguals) were asked to form both one-to-one and two-to-one word-object mappings, and were tested at three points during training. All groups performed identically on one-to-one mappings, but bilinguals outperformed monolinguals on two-to-one mappings, acquiring these mappings both more quickly and proficiently. In Experiment 2, learners (English monolinguals and English-Spanish bilinguals) were asked to form one-to-one mappings and two-to-one mappings that varied with respect to the amount of evidence supporting either side, and were tested at a single point after training. The average performance of monolinguals and bilinguals on both one-to-one and two-to-one mappings did not differ; however, bilinguals more frequently acquired both sides of two-to-one mappings when evidence for each side was equal, and also showed increased sensitivity to two-to-one mappings at lower thresholds of evidence. In Experiment 3, learners (English monolinguals and English-Spanish bilinguals) completed a speech segmentation task presenting multiple statistically distinct streams that differed in the degree to which their components (i.e., syllable inventories) overlapped. Here, we did not find a difference in the ability of monolinguals to acquire multiple inputs or manage the degree of statistical interference between two inputs, but we did note a significant effect of degree of overlap on learning, so that greater overlap correlated with decreased learning. In accord with previous research, the results of these studies suggest that the fundamental ability to track the statistics of language input may not be affected by bilingualism. However, we found distinct advantages for bilinguals in the acquisition of multiple distributions, and that this effect is modulated by the type of statistical learning task presented to learners. Overall, our results suggest that bilingual experience may impact a learner\u2019s response to variability in an input, and that the statistical learning mechanism may be comprised of multiple subcomponents that function and respond differently based on both a learner\u2019s experience and task-specific demands.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13678], "author_name_tesi": "Poepsel, Timothy John", "last_name_ssi": "Poepsel", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Timothy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dan Weiss", "Dan Weiss", "Judith Kroll", "Matthew Carlson", "Kristin Buss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dan Weiss, Dissertation Advisor", "Dan Weiss, Committee Chair", "Judith Kroll, Committee Member", "Matthew Carlson, Committee Member", "Kristin Buss, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Statistical learning", "language acquisition", "bilingualism", "speech segmentation", "word learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "An Evolution of Compact Thermoacoustic Refrigerator Design", "id": "6257", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4530", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-03-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The design and the performance of regenerator-based thermoacoustic refrigerators\nare described in this dissertation.

While there is much to be said in favor of this \u201creflective\u201d picture of agency (as I shall call it), doubts about its capacity to provide us with an adequate account of the sources of normativity invite further critical scrutiny. The problem with regarding the aim of \u201cself- constitution\u201d (Korsgaard) or \u201cself-understanding\u201d (Velleman) as a sufficient condition of normativity comes down to the question of how one can be rationally motivated to act in accordance with her own \u201cpractical identity\u201d or self-conception if the latter can acquire no more rational worth than what is conferred upon it from the disengaged perspective of a purely \u2018supervising\u2019 consciousness. In the first two chapters I present in detail several aspects of this line of criticism. In the second half of the second chapter I articulate, with the help of Charles Taylor, the broader question to which the foregoing \u201cconstitutivist\u201d theories can be seen as offering a partial answer: how should we account for the possibility of genuine (non-fallacious) and efficacious (non-circular) ad hominem reasoning about the sources of normativity? In other words, how (if at all) can we ground normativity in our own affective experience without begging the normative question?\nIn the fifth chapter I argue, on the basis of Charles Peirce\u2019s mature conception of pragmatism, that any intelligible (self-)conception presupposes a purposive background of significance, and that our deliberate purposes (or ideals) themselves can only be clarified by showing how they enable us to regulate our conduct by increasing its stability (in terms of the particular habits which are conceivably entailed them). Consequently, our very capacity to reflect upon our beliefs and inclinations, and control ourselves in light of standards of conduct, is constrained on one side of the deliberative process by what we cannot help believing (or doubting) and seeking (or fleeing); on the other side, it is constrained by what we cannot help affirming (or rejecting) and admiring (or despising). This conclusion might be taken to support the idea that, after all, we have not answered the normative question but rather shown the impossibility of answering it. The suggestion cannot be resisted as long as we hold on to a picture of deliberative agency that is inconsistent with the foregoing (pragmatic) view of what understanding or reflecting upon anything (including ourselves) actually means.\nAs I argue in chapters 3 and 4, Peirce\u2019s phenomenological insights contains valuable resources for the articulation of an alternative account of rational agency. The latter\u2019s distinctive features vis-a-vis the reflective picture can be most clearly exhibited by comparing their contrasting attempts at rejecting normative hedonism. The upshot of my exploration of Peirce\u2019s\n iii\nrefutation of hedonism, which is parallel to his rejection of subjective idealism (5.5), can be summed up by the idea that practical rationality does not merely begin with acts of reflective endorsement; it is rather in and through acts of acknowledgement and articulation. In other words, Peirce\u2019s pragmatism allows us to see why the sources of normativity can only be given in and developed through \u201cexperience,\u201d which in Peirce\u2019s view always involves, at one level of it, a vague sense of \u2018being incapable of doing otherwise.\u2019 This comprises the crucial moment, during a person\u2019s course of life, in which she comes to conceive of herself as being defined by a vaguely perceived normative orientation. But the latter can only be articulated by engaging ourselves in a deliberate course of self-experimentation, by which normative feelings are gradually clarified and allowed to shape our practical identities. This is what gives our \u2018indubitable\u2019 beliefs \u2018inescapable\u2019 and inclinations their normative worth: we do not confer value upon them, but gradually validate whether or not they are in fact as \u2018powerful\u2019 as they claim to be by turning them into hypotheses for the deliberate work of self-formation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13677], "author_name_tesi": "Poggiani, Francesco ", "last_name_ssi": "Poggiani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Francesco", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vincent M Colapietro", "Vincent M Colapietro", "John Philip Christman", "Leonard Richard Lawlor", "Anne Carver Rose", "Rossella Fabbrichesi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vincent M Colapietro, Dissertation Advisor", "Vincent M Colapietro, Committee Chair", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Leonard Richard Lawlor, Committee Member", "Anne Carver Rose, Outside Member", "Rossella Fabbrichesi, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Normativity", "Phenomenology", "Constitutivism", "Practical Identity", "Charles S.

Competition results in lower prices of mobile services that, in turn, can lead to increased levels of adoption. Despite these benefits, to date understanding of the drivers behind increasing international involvement (i.e., internationalization) of MNOs has not been systematically evaluated. Existing studies on internationalization in other domains have shown the importance of industry-, country- and regional-level factors in internationalization. Furthermore, differences in institutional environments between countries (known as institutional distance) have recently been shown to explain internationalization strategies of firms.\nTo that end, the goals of this study are to: 1) systematically evaluate MNO internationalization which, despite many rich case studies on internationalization of individual MNOs and MNOs in separate geographic regions, has not yet been done; 2) test the importance of industry-specific factors in institutional distance and their effects on MNO market entry from a home to a host country and 3) assess the impact of the regional dimension on MNO internationalization.\nBy achieving these objectives, this study makes the following contributions. First, it develops a theoretically-based framework that explains and predicts internationalization of MNOs. The framework considers several factors in MNO internationalization: institutional distance between the home and host countries of the MNO, regional factors and characteristics of the host country. A survival regression model is built and tested based on the framework using data on MNO entries into 36 countries of Europe and South America during the time period 1995\u20142006. Second, following institutional theory, this study combines the national- and industry-level measures of institutions, thus advancing international business research on the effects of institutional distance on market entry.\nResults of this study show that internationalization can be explained by both institutional and regional factors. The differences between institutions of MNO\u2019s home and host countries have a consistent effect on MNO entry as the MNO internationalizes. By comparison, the effect of regional experience on entry eventually decreases as the MNO enters more countries.

Previous work has shown that soluble factors alone, such as interleukins which are known to be pro-inflammatory, can promote junction disruption, making a case for endothelial cell contractility as a regulator of junction disruption and extravasation.\n\tIn this work we used melanoma as a model of metastatic cancer and sought to elucidate the signaling pathways that are involved in mediating junction disruption in the endothelium, in response to tumor cells.  Isolation of endothelial signaling was achieved by incubating endothelial cells with cytoskeletal inhibitors before soluble factor treatment or co-culture experiments.  A reduction in gap formation was measured when inhibited monolayers were co-cultured with A2058 cells, as well as with K562 cells which were used as a model to isolate receptor-ligand binding.

Entertainment, education, business, and personal interactions have all moved online.  However, the Internet remains a public medium\u2014over which we now conduct many private affairs\u2014and every communication carries with it an intrinsic degree of risk.  The traditional approach to protecting sensitive communication is the use of protocols and cryptosystems which promise to protect its confidentiality.  Unfortunately, this cannot altogether eliminate risk, as many recent high-profile cryptosystem failures remind us, and for highly sensitive information this risk is amplified such that further mitigation is needed.  Defense in depth would be the time-honored security approach to this mitigation, but we lack a \"second factor\" for confidentiality which is both usable and orthogonal to encryption.\n\nIn this dissertation, we address the practical problem of communicating confidentially without reliance on encryption, specifically by applying the information-theoretic guarantees of secret sharing.  This approach has been considered abstractly in other work, and herein we initiate the concrete systems and network research needed to bring it to practical fruition.  First, we create a naive multichannel secret sharing protocol called MICSS to investigate the real-world feasibility of secret-shared communication.  In particular, the MICSS work addresses the systems research needed to make these ideas a reality.  Second, we analyze the general case of a MICSS-style threshold-scheme protocol for channels with arbitrary properties.  We investigate the direct effect that secret sharing parameters have on tradeoffs between confidentiality, availability, and throughput, and we derive equations and linear programs which calculate the expected network behavior of the overall protocol.  Finally, we bring this knowledge out of the laboratory and into the modern Internet by finding a natural application to current state-of-the-art protocols used to deliver streaming media via content delivery networks.

Model parameterizations\u2019 incompleteness is in part due to an incomplete understanding of surface attachment kinetics, which are often represented by a growth efficiency known as the deposition coefficient.  This work seeks to improve understanding of the deposition coefficient by studying mass growth from vapor of ten ice particles formed from frozen pure water in a levitation diffusion chamber at temperatures between -43.4 and -40.2 \u00b0C.  The data are analyzed using a diffusion-kinetics model to predict the particles\u2019 deposition coefficients, and it is found that the model cannot replicate some of the growth rates in the data timeseries.  Thus, two new analysis methods are developed to eliminate the deposition coefficient\u2019s dependence on the ice supersaturation, which is uncertain.  Estimates of the deposition coefficients using the new analysis methods for five ice particles are in the range of 0.018 \u2013 0.066, 0.008 \u2013 0.02, 0.001, 0.048 \u2013 0.5, and 0.006 \u2013 0.014.  These particles can be modeled by a classical, faceted growth method.  The remaining ice particles demonstrate growth features linked to ice crystal surface transitions.  These particles\u2019 growth timeseries cannot be modeled with a classical growth method, instead requiring variable growth mechanisms in time.

Using a supply side approach to the problem of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide the first essay studies the effect of backstop technology research on the speed at which fossil fuels are depleted. The key insight is that backstop technology research encourages fossil fuel owners to supply more of their resource in the near future because they anticipate that their resource will become obsolete before it is depleted. Thus, while backstop technology research offers the promise of an eventual decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, it creates a higher near future cost of climate change due to the increase in near future carbon dioxide emissions. The paper shows that even if backstop technology research was costless, for a large enough discount rate on the cost of global\nwarming no backstop technology research can be optimal. The following chapters study carbon abatement policy instruments from a political economy perspective. They illustrate some problems with both traditional cap and trade\nsystems and carbon taxation and then proceed to propose an alternative policy instrument with significant advantages over these systems. The key feature of the proposed carbon securities is that they entitle their owners to a fixed proportion of ex ante unknown total emissions. The total level of carbon emissions is set by\nthe political process after the carbon securities have been sold. In contrast to a traditional permit system, in which a government's choice of emissions quota is influenced by one lobby which represents industries that consume significant amounts of carbon-based energy, a system based on carbon securities creates an additional group of stakeholders with a strong incentive to get organized and influence the government's choice of an emission level. The advantages over existing systems include stronger commitment to abatement policy, an equilibrium carbon price closer to the social optimum, a more predictable environmental policy in the presence of either climate or political uncertainty, and higher investment in abatement technology.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5574], "author_name_tesi": "Polborn, Sarah Elisabeth", "last_name_ssi": "Polborn", "middle_name_ssi": "Elisabeth", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barry William Ickes", "Barry William Ickes", "Mark John Roberts", "Vijay Krishna", "Michael Barth Berkman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barry William Ickes, Dissertation Advisor", "Barry William Ickes, Committee Chair", "Mark John Roberts, Committee Member", "Vijay Krishna, Committee Member", "Michael Barth Berkman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["environmental economics", "global warming", "lobbying", "environmental policy", "climate change"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "DESIGN, FABRICATION, TEST, AND EVALUATION OF RF MEMS SERIES\nSWITCHES USING LEAD\nZIRCONATE TITANATE (PZT) THIN FILM ACTUATORS", "id": "7805", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5183", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of this thesis was to design and prototype a robust, low voltage RF\nMEMS switch for use in military phased arrays. The frequencies of interest for this work\ninclude very low frequencies down to DC operation with the upper limit extending to at\nleast 40 GHz. This broad frequency requirement requires a robust high frequency design\nand simulation using microwave transmission lines. With the aid of researchers at the US\nArmy Research Laboratory, co-planar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines were chosen\nand designed to provide a low loss, 50 ohm impedance transmission line for the switch.\nCPW designs allow for both series and shunt switch configuration with this work\nfocusing on a series switch. Furthermore, a series switch an ohmic contact was chosen as\nopposed to capacitive contacts.\nPiezoelectric actuation is chosen for the switch to enable operating voltages less\nthan 10 volts while still maintaining a restoring force to prevent stiction. To meet these\ndemands, lead zirconate titanate (PZT) thin films have been chosen for the piezoelectric\nactuator. Mechanical modeling of cantilevers comprised of an elastic layer and a Pt-PZTPt\nactuator were used to demonstrate feasibility of closing large gaps between switch\ncontacts. Placement of the actuator to minimize perturbations to the RF transmission line\nis critical for broadband performance. Using fabrication design rules, electro-mechanical\nmodeling, and high frequency design, the actuators were designed to fit with the RF gap\nbetween the RF conductor and ground planes of the CPW transmission line. Optimal\nperformance was obtained with the actuators mechanically isolated from a majority of the\nRF transmission except for a small section that provides the contact pad to enable switch\nclosure.\nThe resulting switch is the first demonstrated first surface micromachined RF\nMEMS switch operating from DC to 65 GHz. This switch has a median actuation\nvoltage below 5 volts with operation as low as 2 volts. Isolation in the off state is better\nthan -20 dB across the frequency band with values better than -60 dB observed for\nfrequency below 1 GHz. The insertion loss in the on state is less than 1 dB below 40\nGHz and remains below 2 dB up to 65 GHz. Switching time was demonstrated at 40 &#956;s\nand was limited by bouncing between the contacts, with initial contact observed at less than 10 &#956;s. The cycle reliability of this switch has been tested with high contact\nresistance failures observed in the low 106 cycles range. The reliability appears to be\nlimited by organic contamination between the contacting surfaces, possibly the result of\nresist residue and/or the development of a frictional polymer on the platinum coated\ncontact surface.\nTesting of CPW transmission lines pointed to the fact that the elastic layer used to\nstress engineer the PZT actuators significantly contributes to the transmission line loss\nand limits the insertion loss of the switch in the on state. The insertion loss was improved\nto better than 0.5 dB below 40 GHz by modifying the fabrication process to eliminate the\nsilicon nitride layer within the elastic layer from underneath of the CPW. This process\nmodification leaves the elastic layer intact beneath the PZT actuators, ensuring proper\nstress engineering of the actuators.\nWith one application of this RF MEMS switch targeted for military phased arrays,\ntemperature sensitivity is an extremely important characteristic. The PZT SW5.1 design\nexhibited excellent off state performance with no change in the isolation characteristics\nfrom -25\u00baC to 100\u00baC. However, in the on state, the actuation voltage is required to\nincrease to 20 volts to ensure operation at 100\u00baC. The temperature sensitivity was\nimproved by redesigning the RF contact pad to enable co-linear contact between the RF\ninput and output sides of the transmission. This redesign, PZT SW5.2, successfully\nenables operation of the PZT RF MEMS switch from -25\u00baC to 100\u00baC with an actuation\nvoltage less than 10 volts. The isolation of the newer design remains similar to the earlier\ndesign with values better than -20 dB up through 50 GHz. The insertion loss of this\ndesign exhibited a slight improvement compared to the earlier design with values less\nthan 0.3 dB below 40 GHz and rising to 0.5 dB up through 50 GHz.\nThe DC and RF power handling of the PZT SW5.2 design was evaluated with the\ngoal of investigating the use of eutectic alloys in the contact dimple for improved RF\nperformance at elevated power levels. The testing at DC highlighted the existence of a\ncontamination layer on the switch contacts, evident by the significant reduction in contact\nresistance with increasing DC current. Subsequently analysis found these devices have\nresidual resist remaining on the switch contacts possibly from carbonization of the resist\nduring the fabrication process. This residue does not affect the power handling as it breaks down at low currents. For RF power handling, the PZT SW5.2 switch\ndemonstrated an average failure of 2 \u2013 3 WRF. A significant majority of the switch\nfailures occurred along the RF contact pad from electromigration failures, as the contact\npad has a contact resistance greater than that of the contact dimples.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5155], "author_name_tesi": "Polcawich, Ronald Gene", "last_name_ssi": "Polcawich", "middle_name_ssi": "Gene", "first_name_ssi": "Ronald", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Thomas R Shrout", "Madan Dubey"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Member", "Thomas R Shrout, Committee Member", "Madan Dubey, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PZT", "RF MEMS", "Switch"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Development of Biological Control Strategies for Integrated Management of Pre- and Postharvest Diseases of Apple in Pennsylvania", "id": "10990", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "264", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Disease prevention is an essential practice in producing quality fruit.  Chemical pesticides are widely used for controlling pre- and postharvest diseases of apple and development of fungicide resistance in pathogen populations has resulted in fewer fungicides available for disease control.  Additionally, registration withdrawal and restrictions on postharvest fungicide applications continue to plague the industry.  The objective of this research was to develop biological controls for foliar and fruit diseases that can be implemented into existing conventional, reduced risk and potentially organic apple production systems to reduce the use of fungicides needed to maintain a quality product. Specific objectives were to (1) determine the effectiveness of novel indigenous endospore-forming bacterial isolates collected from apple and vegetables to suppress pre-harvest and postharvest diseases of apple; (2) evaluate application strategies for theses isolates to optimize suppression of multiple diseases; (3) evaluate growth and survival of these isolates on several apple cultivars; and (4) examine interactions between plant, pathogen, and the biological control agent in order to formulate hypotheses regarding the mechanism(s) of disease suppression.\nHealthy leaves and fruit were collected from abandoned, organic, and conventionally managed apple orchards in Adam\u2019s County, PA in 2006 and 2007.  Endophytic and epiphytic bacteria were isolated and screened for the ability to form endospores, colonize apple leaves and fruit and the ability to hydrolyze chitin.  A total of 75 endospore-forming bacterial isolates were collected from apple and 35% were chitonlytic.  Isolates were further screened for the ability to reduce pre-harvest diseases; apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), cedar-apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniper-virginianae), flyspeck (Zygophiala jamaicensis), and fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) in growth chamber, greenhouse and field experiments.  Isolates were also screened for the ability to reduce severity of the postharvest diseases bitter rot (Colletotrichum acutatum) and blue mold (Pencillium expansum).  Following preliminary screens, six isolates were selected for field experimentation.  \nFour isolates were tested in a two-year field study on biological control of pre- and postharvest diseases at the Penn State Fruit Research and Extension Center in Biglerville, PA.  Bacteria were applied to \u2018Golden Delicious\u2019 and \u2018Rome Beauty\u2019 trees in May or in May +June.  Foliar apple scab severity was assessed weekly using a 7-point rating scale to estimate the percent leaf area scabbed.  Bacillus megaterium isolate A3-6, B. mycoides isolate A1-1 and B. cereus isolate FLS-5 applied in May or in May+June significantly reduced apple scab severity on \u2018Rome Beauty\u2019 and \u2018Golden Delicious\u2019 leaves and fruit.  Fruit harvested from this experiment were challenged with the bitter rot pathogen, C. acutatum.  When applied as postharvest treatments, these isolates significantly reduced mean bitter rot lesion size on both 'Golden Delicious' and 'Rome Beauty' fruit.  A pre-harvest + postharvest application of B. megaterium isolate A3-6 resulted in the greatest suppression of bitter rot with an average of 45% and 95% reduction in lesion size compared to no-bacteria controls on \u2018Golden Delicious\u2019 and \u2018Rome Beauty\u2019 fruit respectively.  While a synergistic effect was not observed in treatments combining pre- and postharvest application strategies, there was an additive effect as pre-harvest applications of the biocontrol bacteria were able to reduce foliar and fruit scab.  Futher, these pre-harvest effects persisted postharvest by suppressing bitter rot, but were enhanced by the addition of a postharvest application of the same isolate.\nFive isolates were tested in a field experiment conducted at the PSU Department of Horticulture research farm in Rock Springs, PA to evaluate integration of bacteria with soluble silicon and chitosan for apple scab disease suppression.  Application of Chitosan to 'Cortland' leaves in May and June did not reduce foliar apple scab severity compared to the non-treated control.  All five of the bacterial isolates tested (B. mycoides isolate A1-1, B. megaterium isolates A3-6 and Ae-1, B. cereus isolate FLS-5 and Brevibacillus laterosporus isolate FLS-1) applied alone or in combination with chitosan in May and June significantly reduced foliar scab severity on \u2018Cortland\u2019.  Further research on the concentration of chitosan as a foliar spray and combination with biocontrols is needed to determine the potential for apple scab control. Application of the potassium silicate product, AgSil alone or in combination with bacteria, to 'Cortland' leaves in May and June did not significantly reduce apple scab severity on leaves. No significant reduction in fruit scab was observed for any of the amendment or bacterial isolate treatments.  \nThe combination of bacteria with chitosan was also evaluated for suppression of the postharvest diseases bitter rot and blue mold.  Application of chitosan to apple wounds alone or in combination with B. megaterium isolate A3-6 or Ae-1, B. mycoides isolate A1-1, or Brevibacillus laterosporus isolate FLS-1 significantly reduced bitter rot and blue mold lesion size on both 'Golden Delicious' and 'Rome Beauty' fruit.  A synergistic effect was observed in treatments combining chitosan with B. mycoides isolate A1-1 or B. megaterium isolates A3-6 and Ae-1 on \u2018Golden Delicious\u2019 fruit with an average of 81% reduction in bitter rot lesion size compared to the no-bacteria/chitosan control.  Application of chitosan with B. megaterium isolate A3-6 to wounds resulted in a 78% reduction in blue mold lesion size.  Future experiments evaluating postharvest disease suppression when chitosan is applied in combination with our isolates as a fruit coating (applied as a dip or spray) will provide insights into the level of control that could be achieved in a commercial setting.\nThe bacteria B. mycoides isolate A1-1, B. megaterium isolates A3-6 and Ae-1 and B. cereus isolate FLS-5 significantly reduced bitter rot lesion size and were able to colonize fruit wounds at room and storage temperatures.  Population levels of isolates A3-6 and Ae-1 were typically log 2 lower than isolate FLS-5 at 2\u00b0C and log 1 lower at 20\u00b0C, suggesting that the mechanism of disease suppression does not involve competition for space or nutrients.  Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the mechanism of postharvest disease suppression by these isolates. Observations of wounded tissue colonized with B. megaterium isolate A3-6 showed attachment of bacterial cells to hyphae of C. acutatum.  Furthermore, sections of the hyphae where bacterial cells had attached were damaged and collapsed.  Further experimentation is needed to more conclusively elucidate the mechanism of bitter rot suppression by isolate A3-6.\nThe potential for integration of the collected bacterial isolates into existing apple management programs was evaluated.  The bacteria B. megaterium isolates A3-6 and Ae-1 and B. cereus isolate FLS-5 were able to colonize apple foliage treated with sulfur, copper hydroxide or streptomycin sulfate.  While B. mycoides isolate A1-1 significantly reduced fruit and foliar scab severity in two successive field trials, foliar colonization on non-treated or fungicide treated leaves was low.  Although, B. cereus is a ubiquitous colonizer of foliar and soil environments, these bacteria are considered an opportunistic animal pathogens and some strains cause food poisoning.  Even though only certain strains cause illness, the use of B. cereus isolate FLS-5 for biological control on apple may face regulatory issues.  Based on the controlled environment, greenhouse and field experiments conducted for this dissertation, B. megaterium isolate A3-6 and B. mycoides A1-1 are the best candidates for biological control of pre- and postharvest diseases of apple. The combination of our biological control agents with fungicides or antibiotics may provide significant benefits by reducing the variability in disease management associated with biological control agents while reducing the rate of chemical used without compromising disease suppression.  The disease management potential of our isolates combined with other BCAs with documented activity against the overwintering or secondary phase of apple scab represents an additional area of research to develop and optimize biological strategies for apple.

MS control, coping, and social support may all impact depression in MS.  MS control is a construct that is associated with the domains of learned helplessness and attributional style.  The MS literature reports relationships between coping and depression, social support and depression, and learned helplessness and depression.  However, there is relatively little research examining possible interrelationships among these variables in predicting depression in MS.  This study sought to refine and redefine these potentially broad constructs based on an analysis of the content validity and psychometric properties of tests developed to measure them, and to explore their inter-relatedness based on a comparative analysis of five structural equation models comprised of these constructs modeled in theoretically different ways.  \nOne-hundred-and-one MS patients were administered a series of questionnaires assessing multiple domains of MS control, coping, social support, and depression.  The nature of the relationships among these constructs for individuals with MS was examined with consideration given to demographic and disease-related variables.  In all five models, the construct depression was the variable being predicted and was measured as a combination of mood and negative evaluative symptoms of depression.  MS control was represented through the measurement of items assessing feelings of control related to MS.  Coping comprised measures of active coping\u2014active coping, planning, and suppression of competing activities\u2014and avoidant coping\u2014denial, behavioral disengagement, and mental disengagement.  Finally, social support was measured as the number of supports and satisfaction with that support.  \nEach model was tested for goodness of fit to the data via five fit indices:  Chi-square, the Chi-square to degrees of freedom ratio (CMIN/df), the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), the Incremental Fit Index (IFI), and the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA).  These fit indices were compared among models in order to determine which model best depicted the relationship among these constructs.  Finally, a gender discrepancy among these constructs was predicted, such that MS control, coping, and social support were predicted to be more strongly associated with depression for women than for men. \nAll five models displayed adequate goodness of fit to the data via the evaluation of three of the five fit indices.  When the avoidant coping measures were removed from the models (based on poor psychometric fit of these measures within the models), all five models displayed adequate goodness of fit to the data via the evaluation of four of the five fit indices.  \nGiven that all models displayed some goodness of fit, per standard SEM interpretive approaches, the most parsimonious model (Model 1) was considered the best explanation of the associations among these constructs.  Thus, the explanation that MS control, coping (particularly, active coping), and social support all account for significant independent amounts of the variance in depression in this population (specifically, for women) is the best fitting explanation for the current data.  According to Model 1 (with data for active coping/ women only), these data suggest that MS control, coping, and social support account for 15%, 14%, and 26% of the variance in depression, respectively.  Regression analyses showed that this and the other models were only a good fit for women in the sample.  \nHence, social support appears to have a significant, independent impact on depression for women with MS, followed by MS control and active coping.  Specifically, this study illustrates how poor social support (particularly few social supports), ineffective coping (particularly lack of planning in response to stress), and strong feelings of MS control (particularly a belief that \u201cMS is controlling my life\u201d) may likely lead to depression in women with MS.  Psychotherapeutic care for this population may be most effective if consideration for each of these specific domains is targeted as part of a comprehensive treatment protocol.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1487], "author_name_tesi": "Polen, Dawn M.", "last_name_ssi": "Polen", "middle_name_ssi": "M.", "first_name_ssi": "Dawn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter Andrew Arnett", "Michelle Gayle Newman", "William Ray", "Craig R Denegar, Ph D"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter Andrew Arnett, Committee Chair", "Michelle Gayle Newman, Committee Member", "William Ray, Committee Member", "Craig R Denegar, Ph D, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["depression", "Multiple sclerosis"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Relationships with Aging Parents: Implications for Well-being in Middle-aged Couples", "id": "28648", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12421", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Relationships with parents influence well-being across the life course.  At midlife, these ties most often intersect with the offspring's marriage.  Consequently, relationships with parents are likely to be a salient aspect of married life that affects each spouse's well-being and marital satisfaction.  Such linkages, however, are not yet well understood.\n\nThis dissertation includes two studies that utilize a sample of 132 middle-aged married couples from Wave 1 of the Family Exchanges Study.  Study 1 examined how wives' and husbands' reports of relationship quality with their own parents are linked to their own and their partners' well-being.  Study 2 considered how each spouse's views of relationship quality with their own parents influence the associations between support exchanges with parents and reports of well-being and marital satisfaction within couples.\n\nStudy 1 shows that wives\u2019 and husbands\u2019 reports of positive and negative relationship qualities with their own parents are associated with well-being.  Husbands reported better well-being when wives had more positive qualities in the relationships with their own parents.  In Study 2, wives reported greater life satisfaction when they gave more support to their parents and had less ambivalent feelings about these ties.  Wives were less satisfied with their marriages, however, when they gave more support to their parents and their husbands reported less positive relationships with their own parents.  Husbands were more satisfied with their marriages when they or their wives received more support from parents and had less ambivalence toward the parents; or when husbands received more support from parents and wives had more ambivalence toward their own parents.  Finally, husbands reported lower depressive symptoms when wives received more support from their parents and husbands had less positive or more ambivalent ties with their own parents.\n\nOverall, this dissertation demonstrates that wives' and husbands' affective evaluations of their own parent-child ties shape how their own and their partners' relationships with parents contribute to well-being and marital satisfaction.  Findings underscore the mutual influences within couples and highlight the need for future work to gain a more nuanced understanding of how ties with parents affect individual and couple processes at midlife.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11786], "author_name_tesi": "Polenick, Courtney Allyn", "last_name_ssi": "Polenick", "middle_name_ssi": "Allyn", "first_name_ssi": "Courtney", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit", "David Eggebeen", "Steffany Jane Fredman", "Lynn Margaret Martire", "Jon F Nussbaum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Steven Howard Zarit, Dissertation Advisor", "David Eggebeen, Committee Member", "Steffany Jane Fredman, Committee Member", "Lynn Margaret Martire, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["marriage", "couples", "intergenerational relationships", "parent-child relationships", "relationship quality"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Vertical Takeoff Vertical Landing Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization via                                                                    Direct Collocation and Nonlinear Programming", "id": "22802", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9530", "abstract_tesi": "Rocket-powered translational Vertical Takeoff Vertical Landing (VTVL) maneuvers are a promising lander spacecraft mobility method as compared with or in addition to rovers for certain mission profiles. Such a VTVL vehicle would take off vertically under rocket propulsion, translate a specified horizontal distance, and vertically return softly to the surface. \n\nPrevious literature suggested that the propellant required to perform such a maneuver could be estimated via an impulsive-ballistic trajectory using the \u201cideal\u201d rocket equation. This analysis was found to be inadequate. Any feasible trajectories will always require additional propellant to compensate for gravity losses while lifting off and landing. Additionally, there is an asymmetry between the takeoff and landing phases of the maneuver due to the propellant mass used over the course of the flight. Lastly, various potential spacecraft propulsion systems architectures impose a number of possible constraints on the allowable path and boundary conditions. \n\nAn adaptable Optimal Control Problem (OCP) was developed instead to model the basic dynamics and required propellant consumption of various VTVL spacecraft trajectory profiles for a range of constraints, spacecraft parameters, and translation distances. The model was discretized into a Nonlinear Programming (NLP) problem and a Direct Collocation (DC) method utilizing implicit Simpson-Hermite integration was used to ensure the feasibility of solutions with sufficient accuracy. \n\nMATLAB\u2019s Nonlinear Programming fmincon routine with the sequential quadratic programming solver was able to converge on the optimal VTVL trajectory in terms of minimizing the required propellant use within the spacecraft and mission constraints. Trades were performed to determine the impact of various parameters on the required propellant including thrust to initial weight ratios, propellant specific impulse, the allowable range and angular rate of change of the spacecraft thrust vector, translation distances, maximum altitude, flight times, and boundary conditions. \n\nThe VTVL trajectory optimization model developed was found to be robust and able to handle a wide range of various spacecraft and mission parameters. Results were compared against the required propellant use and nominal time of flight determined via the ballistic-impulse burn-coast-burn analysis. For the finite model developed herein, the required propellant use and optimal flight times exceeded the ideal impulsive case by 5-30% depending on the specific spacecraft and mission parameters and constraints implemented.

This method is used commonly for Earth-orbiting satellite collision probability. In the scaling up process, the gravitational influence of one of the bodies in the collision is taken into account, namely that of the Earth. The restricted three-body problem is sufficient to provide a backdrop for the probability analysis, while making sure to note that the results are only hypothetical given a simplified dynamic model. Uncertainty is represented mathematically by the covariance matrix and is propagated into the future by a linear transformation involving the State Transition Matrix (STM). Encounter regions are defined as regions along the nominal trajectory of the asteroid where the propagated uncertainty encloses the Earth. These regions are not known a priori. Probability is then calculated by a triple integral of the probability density function (pdf) (a function of the covariance matrix) over the volume swept out by the Earth through the encounter region. This integral is achieved by, first, integrating the instantaneous pdf at each time step in the encounter region, and then by integrating the resulting probability, as a function of time, over its domain. The process from propagating the uncertainty along the nominal trajectory, finding the encounter regions and calculating probability is repeated in a Monte Carlo simulation that varies the initial uncertainty. The orientation of the initial uncertainty ellipsoid is held constant: aligned with the velocity vector, while the lengths of the three principal axes (in-track, normal, and out-of-plane) are varied in their respective relative ranges. The trend in probability calculated vs. initial uncertainty is then investigated. It is found that higher probabilities result from initial uncertainties that are tighter in all three directions. That is, higher probabilities result when the position of the asteroid is known initially with more accuracy. This is an expected result because probability should be a conservative estimate so that likely encounters are not overlooked. And with advances in observational and analytical techniques, the initial positions of asteroids will inevitably become more accurate so that more conservative probabilities will be calculated in the future. However, it is also shown that this positive result stems from the uncertainty being very large initially, so that as the uncertainty decreases substantially, the trend will tend to reverse. This fact is not demonstrated because large uncertainties are required for this method to proceed. Suggestions for future work are given to combat these limitations. With this alternative, and the suggestions for improving it, probabilities of impact by an asteroid can be calculated that are comparable to current automated methods.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1007], "author_name_tesi": "Polito, Christopher ", "last_name_ssi": "Polito", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Spencer", "David Bradley Spencer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Spencer, Thesis Advisor", "David Bradley Spencer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["position uncertainty ellipsoid", "NEO Collision Probability"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE INCORPORATION OF GEMCITABINE AND CYTARABINE INTO DNA BY DNA\nPOLYMERASE BETA AND LIGASE\n", "id": "9462", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2885", "abstract_tesi": "2'-Deoxy-2',2'-difluorocytidine (gemcitabine, dFdC) and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine\n(cytarabine, araC) are nucleoside analogues used in the treatment of a variety of malignancies.\nThe active drug metabolites of both araC and dFdC inhibit DNA synthesis.

The purpose of this study was to discover the types of experiences-biographical and professional and the organizational practices that influenced, in a transformational way, the professional development of intern teachers and other educators who participated in a year immersion into a Secondary Level English-Language Arts Professional Development School. \nThe inquiry answers the following five questions: 1) What is transformational learning in the context of new teacher preparation and development? 2) What is the relationship between transformational learning and experiential professional development?  3) To what extent is transformational learning and experiential professional development relevant to teacher preparation? 4) To what extent do teachers identify transformational learning and experiential professional development as being relevant in their professional training? 5) What best practices are related to transformational learning and experiential professional development in the context of professional development schools? The original conceptual framework of this study applied Mezirow\u2019s Transformational Learning Theory, Kolb\u2019s Experiential Learning Model and Starratt\u2019s foundational qualities of an ethical person; autonomy, connectedness, authenticity and transcendence, as the preliminary theoretical components of a transformational professional learning experience. A qualitative case study approach was taken and utilized participant-observation, document analysis and the interviewing of 14 participants who were profiled as a phase of the data analysis. \nFindings show that transformational learning in the context of teacher preparation and development is an active, organic, constructive process. It can emanate from occurrences in one\u2019s biography-as early as when a child begins school- and is later able to identify, critically reflect, dialogue and act on these meaningful experiences and encounters within the context of learning to teach. Best practices that promote transformational learning were identified as authentic immersion, initial selections and mentor-intern match-ups, inquiry at the center of the PDS organization, critical self reflection through journaling and textual connections, subbing for substitute and the organic planning of professional activities. My results support the idea that interns in a self-selected, authentic professional immersion teacher preparation program, like the one studied here, have a significant stake, active professional community commitment and a heightened awareness during their training and prior to employment, that, as a result have a significant transformational impact in their personal and professional grounding as future career educators.

Little is known, however, about the factors that result in performance differences.  This study evaluated the effects of working memory, processing speed, and argument status on sentence imitation.  Working memory was measured by both a storage and processing and a scope of attention measure.  Performance differences on arguments versus adjuncts also tested the predictions of the Procedural Deficit Hypothesis (PDH) of specific language impairment.  The PDH predicted that adjunct processing would be more difficult for adults with SLI because it would depend on a deficient procedural memory system.  Alternatively, adults with SLI may compensate by engaging an intact declarative memory to process adjuncts.  \n\nTwenty-three adults with SLI and 23 typical language controls participated in three experiments.  First, sentence processing times were recorded for argument and adjunct conditions in a self-paced listening task.  Second, working memory and processing speed were measured, and used to predict accuracy in a sentence imitation task.  The sentence imitation materials varied in length and argument versus adjunct composition.  Finally, procedural and declarative memory systems were assessed for all participants.\n\nIn the online sentence processing task, there was a processing time advantage for noun arguments as compared to verb adjuncts, but no group difference.  Correlations of argument and adjunct frequency with processing times were found for the group with SLI, but only argument frequency effects for the typical language group.  Group differences as well as argument differences were found in the sentence imitation task.  Participants\u2019 working memory also contributed to sentence imitation accuracy, but processing speed did not.  Argumenthood, working memory and sentence length interacted, with greater argument status effects in short conditions, and greater working memory effects in long conditions.  Both the storage and processing and the scope of attention measures predicted sentence imitation.  Declarative memory performance was poorer in the group with SLI than in the group with typical language, whereas there was limited support for a procedural memory deficit in the group with SLI.\n\nOverall support for the PDH was mixed.  There was evidence of compensatory processing of adjuncts as predicted by the PDH, but the basis for the compensation was unclear given the unexpected poor declarative memory performance.  The factors of group classification, working memory and argumenthood were confirmed as factors affecting sentence imitation performance, and the complexity of the task was revealed by interactions of these factors with sentence length.  The association of a scope of attention measure to language performance suggested that the storage aspect of working memory was as crucial to adult SLI performance as abilities for concurrent storage and processing or rehearsal.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7101], "author_name_tesi": "Poll, Gerard Humphrey", "last_name_ssi": "Poll", "middle_name_ssi": "Humphrey", "first_name_ssi": "Gerard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Sciences and Disorders", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carol Anne Miller", "Adriana Van Hell", "Krista M Wilkinson", "Robert Anthony Prosek", "James Taylor Herbert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carol Anne Miller, Committee Chair", "Adriana Van Hell, Committee Member", "Krista M Wilkinson, Committee Member", "Robert Anthony Prosek, Committee Member", "James Taylor Herbert, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["specific language impairment", "adults", "sentence processing", "procedural deficit hypothesis", "sentence imitation"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Assessing Student Expectations and Preferences for the Distance Learning Environment: Are Congruent Expectations and Preferences a Predictor of High Satisfaction?", "id": "7851", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3428", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the last five to ten years, innovations in educational technology and enthusiasm for perceived gains in cooperative learning behaviors, instructional variation, larger and more distributed course projects, and learning that occurs through peer tutoring (Duffy and Cunningham 1996) have caused distance educators to move away from individualistic forms of study and toward collaborative learning environments.

This study tested the hypothesis that students who are placed in a distance learning environment that is congruent with their expectations and preferences will have higher satisfaction levels.

According to this school of thought, our understanding of virtue and vice springs primarily from our capacity for feeling as opposed to reason. A standard worry about Hume\u2019s account is that it produces an overly conservative theory of morality which blindly supports the status quo. This is because, for Hume, what makes some trait a virtue (or vice) is simply that it commonly garners sentiments of approval (or disapproval). If this is the case, then even traits that are only disapproved of due to prejudice, intolerance, and misunderstanding, must be counted as genuine vices. For example, if homosexuality produces widespread discomfort or distaste in society, then homosexuality must be seen as a vice. Thus, it seems that Hume\u2019s moral theory, instead of providing a method for critiquing and revising prevailing discriminatory attitudes, would actually lend support to them. This dissertation argues, however, that Hume\u2019s distinctive understanding of sentimentalism provides a more robust method for revising existing moral views than the above sketch would suggest. Specifically, I contend that Hume believes we have reason to revise our moral sentiments when they do not arise from the social aspects of human nature (or the humane sentiments which make us concerned for others).

However, in the large body of work that has developed at this nexus, a burgeoning group of migrants is almost completely omitted: middle class migrants who, whether as corporate professionals or cultural experience-seekers, or both, go from global city to global city, remaining just a few years in each site and weaving complicated social networks along the way. These people are unique to studies of migration because they are not a bounded \u2018population\u2019 group, are from ethnically and nationally diverse backgrounds, and their movements are characterized by continual migration. Such characteristics are outside the boundaries of traditional research conceptions that categorize migrants by ethnic, religious or national/regional heritage and often imagine a more stable and linear migration wherein people migrate from \u2018country A\u2019 to \u2018country B\u2019 to put down roots in the new land, even while continuing the connections to the homeland or with a Diaspora. \nThis ethnographic dissertation takes the \u2018global city\u2019 of Paris as a case study, to interpret how a population of \u2018international people\u2019 comes together through combined use of online and offline mediated spaces.

I also estimated the \u201cwho acquires infection from whom\u201d (WAIFW) matrix from detailed incidence data and confirmed with an R0 calculation using next-generation formalism. \n\tNext, I addressed geographic heterogeneity in the host population by addressing error inherent in the PDV incidence data in the entire North Sea with a Bayesian framework to estimate the initial population of susceptible individuals (S0), the rate of pathogen transmission (\u00e2), and the time series of infected individuals with imperfect binomial reporting to the biweekly incidence time series and used this information to create distance and gravity based models to discriminate how different geographic locations are coupled by infected host movement. Results show that the distance model has a better fit to the seal stranding data, indicating that the distance between harbor seal haulouts drives the spatial spread of PDV.\n\tLastly, I looked at the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of the viral family Paramyxoviridae by investigating serially-sampled genomes of measles virus, mumps virus, and canine distemper virus. Using a Bayesian coalescent approach, we estimate viral substitution rates, the time to common ancestry and elements of their demographic history. Strikingly, the mean Time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) was both similar and very recent among the viruses studied, ranging from only 58 to 91 years (1908 to 1943).\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3807], "author_name_tesi": "Pomeroy, Laura Warlow", "last_name_ssi": "Pomeroy", "middle_name_ssi": "Warlow", "first_name_ssi": "Laura", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ottar N Bjornstad", "Reka Z Albert", "Bryan Grenfell", "Edward C Holmes", "Peter John Hudson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Chair", "Reka Z Albert, Committee Member", "Bryan Grenfell, Committee Member", "Edward C Holmes, Committee Member", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["SIR models", "harbor seals", "wildlife diseases", "phocine distemper virus", "Paramyxoviruses", "coalescent methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "defect structure and electronic transport in low-k films used for back end of line dielectrics", "id": "19971", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9375", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work focuses on electronic transport and defect structure in multiple novel dielectric systems used for back end of line (BEOL) applications. BEOL dielectrics with low dielectric constants, so called low-k dielectrics, and materials which can be used as etch stop layers which have lower dielectric constants than silicon nitride, are needed for current and future integrated circuit technology nodes. However, an understanding of the defects which limit reliability, degrade performance, and contribute to leakage currents in these films is not yet developed.  In this research conventional electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), leakage current, and electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) measurements were utilized to investigate a-SiC:H and  SiOC:H dielectrics. These dielectrics are believed to be the most important in future technology.  \nIn this study multiple variations in processing conditions, including post-deposition anneals, film chemistry, UV irradiation, and deposition techniques were analyzed.  There is a strong correlation between conventional EPR defect density measurements and leakage currents in many of these films.  There is also a very strong correlation between hydrogen content and both leakage current and EPR defect density for the a-SiC:H films.  The SiOC:H films have a much more complex relationship between EPR defects and leakage currents.  In many cases, a close correspondence between the EPR defect density measurement and the leakage currents strongly indicates that the defects observed by EPR are largely responsible for the leakage currents. These defects therefore likely limit the dielectric reliability, but the correspondence is imperfect.  Important reliability phenomena in these films, which are likely limited by defects observed in this study, are time-dependent dielectric breakdown and stress induced leakage current.

Agricultural soil management has been estimated to contribute 79% of the total N2O emissions in the U.S., and inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilization is one of the main contributors. Nitrous oxide is a potent greenhouse gas that has a global warming potential which is approximately 298 times that of carbon dioxide (CO2) over a 100-year period and is currently the dominant ozone-depleting substance. Few studies have assessed the effects of organic N amendments on direct N2O within the context of a typical dairy forage cropping system. Most research has been limited to studying the effects of one or two sources of N inputs on N2O emissions; however, dairy forage cropping systems often apply manure and have more than two N sources that likely both contribute to N2O emissions. This study investigated how different dairy cropping practices that include differences in crop residues, N inputs (dairy manure and inorganic fertilizer), timing of N amendment applications and environmental conditions influenced N2O emissions from no-till soil planted to corn (Zea mays L.). A two-year field study was carried out as part of the Pennsylvania State Sustainable Dairy Cropping Systems Experiment, where corn was planted following annual grain crops, perennial forages, and a green manure legume crop; all were amended with dairy manure. In the corn-soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation, N sources (dairy manure and inorganic fertilizer) and two methods of manure application (broadcasted and injected) were also compared.\n\tChapter 1 reviews the scientific literature; describing the biotic and abiotic processes of N2O production in soils, summarizing current research on N2O emissions in agricultural systems, and emphasizing the main management and environmental drivers contributing to the emissions. This chapter reviews methods for matching N supply with crop demand, coupling N flow cycles, using advanced fertilizer techniques, and optimizing tillage management. Also, the applicability and limitations of current research to effectively reduce N2O emissions in a variety of regions are discussed.\n\tChapter 2 analyzes the effect of corn production management practices and environmental conditions contributing to N2O in the Pennsylvania State Sustainable Dairy Cropping Systems Experiment. Significantly higher N2O emissions were observed 15-42 days after manure injection and 1-4 days after mid-season UAN application. Manure injection had 2-3 times greater potential for N2O emissions compared to broadcast manure during this time period. Integration of legumes and grasses in the cropping system reduced inorganic fertilizer use compared to soybean with manure or UAN, however, direct N2O emissions were not reduced. The Random Forest method was used to identify and rank the predictor variables for N2O emissions. The most important variables driving N2O emissions were: time after manure application, time after previous crop termination, soil nitrate, and moisture. These field research results support earlier recommendations for reducing N losses including timing N inputs close to crop uptake, and avoiding N applications when there is a high chance of precipitation to reduce nitrate accumulation in the soil and potential N losses from denitrification.\n\tChapter 3 reports the comparison of N2O fluxes predicted with the biogeochemical model DAYCENT compared to measured data from the two-year dairy cropping systems study. Daily N2O emissions simulated by DAYCENT had between 41% and 76% agreement with measured daily N2O emissions in 2015 and 2016. DAYCENT overestimated the residual inorganic N fertilizer impact on N2O emissions in the corn following soybean with inorganic fertilizer and broadcast manure. Comparisons between DAYCENT simulated and measured N2O fluxes indicate that DAYCENT did not represent well organic N amendments from crop residues of perennials and legume cover crops, or manure application in no-till dairy systems. DAYCENT was generally able to reproduce temporal patterns of soil temperature, but volumetric soil water contents (VSWC) predicted by DAYCENT were generally lower than measured values. After precipitation events, DAYCENT predicted that VSWC tended to rapidly decrease and drain to deeper layers. Both the simulated and measured soil inorganic N increased with N fertilizer addition; however, the model tended to underestimate soil inorganic N concentration in the 0-5 cm layer. Our results suggest that DAYCENT overestimated the residual N impact of inorganic fertilizer on N2O emissions and mineralization of organic residues and nitrification happened faster than DAYCENT predicted. \n\n\t Chapter 4 highlights the impact of manure injection and the importance of timing organic N amendments from manures and/or crop residue with crop N uptake to mitigate N2O emissions. More research is needed to better understand the tradeoffs of these strategies in no till dairy cropping systems to help farmers in their operational management decisions. Improving the parametrization of DAYCENT for dairy cropping systems in no-till systems with high surface legume crop residues from perennials and cover crops, will make the model a more useful tool for testing different mitigation scenarios for farmers\u2019 and policy-designer decision making.

The successful application of this technology is dependent on reliable estimates of carbon dioxide storage capacity and insightful indication of the variability of geological storage. Injection into deep, unmineable coal formations is one option being investigated. Current basic CO2 sequestration work on powdered coal does not adequately capture the science of gas flow and storage processes at geologic sequestration conditions. To better assess the storage capacity and flow properties of CO2 and CH4 in coal, it is important to characterize the interplay of the various physical and chemical processes occurring during gas injection or production at simulated confining stress conditions representative of sequestration depths. In this thesis, the interactions of CO2 and CH4 with powder, non-powder unconfined, and non-powder confined bituminous coal were investigated under different stress conditions. The effects of stress on coal behavior at simulated sequestration conditions were determined. It includes the characterization of three-dimensional regional strain distribution induced by the application of stress, the sorption and desorption of CO2 determined with X-ray computer tomography. Carbon dioxide and methane sorption capacity was evaluated using the volumetric method. Dynamic permeability of coal under different stress condition was determined using a transient-pulse approach. Results demonstrated that the deformations of a dry bituminous coal core upon stress application, or by CO2 sorption or desorption are highly heterogeneous and differ among the various lithotype bands of a bituminous coal. Coal swelling was observed, but the extent was attenuated by compression/compaction in adjacent lithotype bands. The CO2 and CH4 sorption capacity and sorption rates are reduced under stress, emphasizing that estimates of storage capacity and transport parameters based on powdered unconfined coal samples are misleading for sequestration capacity predictions. The application of 6.9 and 13.8 MPa of confining stress contributed to 39% and 64% of CO2 sorption capacity reductions respectively in comparison to powder coal. Similarly, 85% and 91% CH4 uptake capacity reductions due to 6.9 and 13.8 MPa of confining stress in comparison to powder coal were recorded. Due to presumed methane\u2019s limited ability to dissolve in coal matrix compared to CO2, its sorption capacity reduction with applied stress was more pronounced. Coal permeability decreases with increasing confining stress. Average permeability was 0.001865 millidarcies when subjected to 6.9 MPa and decrease around 4 times to 0.000427 millidarcies when the confining stress was doubled. This decrease is likely due to the cleat and pore aperture reduction with increasing effective stress. Coal permeability also decreases over time even at constant effective stress. Permeability for both confining stress values decrease over time although at different rate: 26% reduction at 6.9 MPa and 47 % at 13.8 MPa. This reduction can likely be attributed to the swelling, structure rearrangement or compression/compaction of certain lithotypes occurring at different time-scales when exposed to CO2.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2910], "author_name_tesi": "Pone, Jean Denis Nda'si", "last_name_ssi": "Pone", "middle_name_ssi": "Nda'si", "first_name_ssi": "Jean Denis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan P Mathews", "Jonathan P Mathews", "Phillip Michael Halleck", "Derek Elsworth", "Demian Saffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan P Mathews, Dissertation Advisor", "Jonathan P Mathews, Committee Chair", "Phillip Michael Halleck, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Demian Saffer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["carbon dioxide sorption capacity in coal", "coalbed methane", "Sequestration", "coal permeability", "stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Catalytic Systems used for Polymerization, Biomass Conversion, and Enhancing Diffusion", "id": "28938", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12217", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A significant amount of research has been dedicated towards the study and improvement of catalysts.  A better understanding of how catalysts work can lead to developing more cost-efficient catalytic systems for a variety of applications.  My research is focuses on catalytic systems used in three different fields, which are (i) organometallic polymerization catalysts, (ii) molecular motors and (iii) biomass conversion.    \nResearchers have long studied and modified organometallic catalysts for use in the direct co- and homopolymerization of monomers with polar functional groups.  The ability to add polar moieties to polymers, which can potentially yield materials with a wider range of physical properties, is highly desirable.  In this study (i), a series of naphthoxyimine palladium(II) catalysts \u2013 in which the naphthyl backbone had been functionalized with different moieties \u2013 were synthesized and systematically studied to determine the ligand structure\u2019s impact on catalytic activity.  The study showed that slight modifications of the naphthyl backbone led to significant changes in the polymer\u2019s molecular weight and polydispersity index.  The catalysts were also displayed some ability to co-polymerize ethylene and functionalized norbornene.  These positive results suggest that further exploration of naphthoxyimine palladium (II) catalysts may be fundamentally interesting.  \nThe effect of active, motile particles at the nanoscale has been vigorously researched during the past decade.  By understanding how such active suspensions behave, researchers can gain new insights which can potentially provide new applications in many fields.  Here (ii) the momentum transfer of active catalysts (Grubbs\u2019 2nd generation catalyst with a hydrodynamic radius of 6\u00c5) to their immediate surroundings is observed in an organic suspension.  This phenomenon, which has been coined \u201cenhanced diffusion,\u201d has not been well studied at the angstr\u00f6m scale until now.  Diffusion-NMR spectroscopy surprisingly revealed that these angstr\u00f6m sized catalysts nearly double the speed of diffusion of passive molecular tracers in their immediate surroundings.  This result is particularly intriguing because in this size regime, the viscosity of the surroundings is expected to completely overcome the inertial forces of these catalysts.  This study has prompted further diffusion-NMR studies of molecular catalysts and enzymes as molecular motors.\nCatalytic systems play a crucial role in the conversion of renewable biomasses into energy and useful materials.   This field of research has become increasingly important and lucrative as fossil fuel sources continue to decline/destabilize in the face of increased worldwide demand for more resources.  In this work (iii), the efficacy of a hydrogen-pressurized, biphasic catalytic system to convert linear sugar polyols to iodoalkanes was examined.  These iodoalkanes can easily be converted to 1-alkenes which can then be used for the synthesis of low density polyethylene.  The results indicated that the system products were relatively pure and that the catalytic layer had a degree of recyclability, hinting that such a system may be viable for industrial use.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11607], "author_name_tesi": "Pong, Frances Ying", "last_name_ssi": "Pong", "middle_name_ssi": "Ying", "first_name_ssi": "Frances", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich", "T C Mike Chung", "Benjamin James Lear"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen, Dissertation Advisor", "Alexander Thomas Radosevich, Committee Member", "T C Mike Chung, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Organometallic", "Diffusion", "Catalyst", "NMR", "Polymer"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "TEMPERATURE DEPENDENT MICROPHASE MIXING\nOF MODEL POLYURETHANES\n\n\n", "id": "10884", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6007", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis I explore the temperature dependence of segregation of hard and soft segments of selected segmented polyurethane copolymers using synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).

The high-biomass density of the biofilm reactor contributed to a significantly shorter lag time of nisin production relative to a suspended-cell reactor. The medium evaluation study suggested a complex media for nisin production in the biofilm reactor as: 4% (w/v) sucrose, 0.02% (w/v) MgSO4\u00b77H2O, 1% (w/v) KH2PO4, 0.2% (w/v) NaCl, 1% (w/v) peptone, and 1% (w/v) yeast extract.

The U.S. women were shown as athletically superior and feminine within the male sporting world, while the Canadian women were only constructed as big and strong. U.S. nationality and North American superiority were framed to suggest that non-North American teams had a dependency on North American leagues, colleges, and coaches for their successes.

Jerome Iginla, the only Black player, was given little attention considering his playing time for Team Canada. When Iginla was mentioned, it was often in reference to his physicality, while his White counterparts were given credit for hard work and intelligence. Whiteness was also constructed through themes of the good-guy mentality and being family-oriented. The themes suggested that while equality in the amount of coverage has improved, parity in gender, nationality, and race is still unequal.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3471], "author_name_tesi": "Poniatowski, Kelly L.", "last_name_ssi": "Poniatowski", "middle_name_ssi": "L.", "first_name_ssi": "Kelly", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marie Hardin", "John Spicer Nichols", "Colleen Connolly Ahern", "Michelle E Day"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marie Hardin, Committee Chair", "John Spicer Nichols, Committee Chair", "Colleen Connolly Ahern, Committee Member", "Michelle E Day, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Olympics", "race", "nationality", "sexual difference", "hegemonic masculinity", "hockey"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "CELLULAR STRUCTURES WITH INTERNAL FEATURES FOR ENHANCED STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE\n\n", "id": "12616", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4104", "abstract_tesi": "In classical cellular structures the unit cells have typically not had any inclusions.

Of the different elements/inclusions that can be used, this thesis focuses on two:  a linear spring, and a bistable elastic arch.  The selection of the linear spring is based on its being the simplest possible inclusion. For different spring arrangements, closed-form analytical expressions are derived for the in-plane modulus and Poisson's ratio of the hexagonal cell (and by extension, of a cellular structure with that unit cell repeated).  The analytical expressions are validated using NASTRAN finite element simulations, as well as against tensile/compressive tests of unit cells with internal springs in an Instron machine. When the spring stiffness exceeds certain values, the rigid cell wall assumption is no longer valid, and these bounds are established.  The validated analysis is used to conduct design studies on how the cell modulus (nondimensionalized by the spring stiffness) would vary with cell geometric parameters such as cell angle and cell wall length ratio. An in-plane cell modulus as high as 1.15 GPa was calculated using springs that were stiff but yet compliant enough so as not to violate the rigid cell wall assumption.\n\nThe second part of the study focused on a bistable elastic arch. This is of interest because of the negative stiffness or snap-through behavior it can display.  The large stroke and velocity of the arch, when transitioning from one stable equilibrium condition to the other, can be exploited for enhanced energy dissipation when coupled to a damping element.  In the present study a finite element model of the arch is developed and its bistable behavior examined. Experiments on Nitinol and Delrin arches are used to validate the finite element analysis. The analysis is further used to conduct a parametric study on how variation in arch height, thickness or restraining spring stiffness influences the critical snap-through force, the stroke, and the maximum strains. This thesis lays the framework for cellular structures with diverse inclusions in the unit cells, and the study can be extended to other inclusions such as buckling beam elements, dashpots, etc., in the future.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4082], "author_name_tesi": "Pontecorvo, Michael  Eugene", "last_name_ssi": "Pontecorvo", "middle_name_ssi": "Eugene", "first_name_ssi": "Michael ", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi", "Farhan S Gandhi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi, Thesis Advisor", "Farhan S Gandhi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cellular structure", "elastic arch", "bistable", "hexagonal cell", "internal features", "cell modulus"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "PARVOVIRUS B19 INFECTION OF HEPATOCYTES AND INDUCTION OF APOPTOSIS", "id": "6347", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "657", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nParvovirus B19 persists in multiple tissues and has been implicated in a variety of diseases including acute fulminant liver failure (AFLF).  Despite multiple reports demonstrating the presence of B19 DNA in liver tissues from patients with AFLF, the causal relationship of B19 infection to liver failure is not yet proven.  In addition, the mechanism by which B19 infection induces liver failure remains unknown.  Although hepatocytes express the B19 receptor, globoside, these cells are non-permissive for B19 replication.   B19, although unable to replicate productively in liver cells, may establish a limited infection that kills these cells.   B19 cytotoxicity is likely mediated through the viral nonstructural protein, NS1.  The NS1 protein has the potential to damage cellular DNA through DNA nicking, covalent DNA binding, and helicase activities.  We hypothesize that DNA damage induced by these activities leads to apoptosis through PARP and ATR-mediated pathways.  \nTo investigate whether B19 is able to establish infection of hepatocytes, both primary liver cells and the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hep G2 were inoculated with parvovirus B19 and examined for the presence of RNA transcripts of viral genes.  RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that B19 was able to infect both primary and transformed hepatocytes and produce RNA for NS1. No transcripts correlating to the structural capsid proteins VP1 or VP2 were detected.  Immunofluorescence-based studies confirmed the presence of NS1 in infected cells.  These experiments demonstrate that B19 enters liver cells, and that the NS1 gene is actively transcribed and the mRNA is translated in infected hepatocytes.  \nThe ability of B19 to infect hepatocytes allows for the possibility that B19 infection of these cells is cytotoxic.  Pathological studies of tissue from patients with AFLF are characterized by non-inflammatory hepatocellular death.  Non-inflammatory disappearance of hepatocytes suggests apoptosis as the mechanism for B19-induced cell death in AFLF. To investigate whether B19 induces apoptosis in liver cells, hepatocytes and Hep G2 cells were infected and assayed for apoptosis by PARP cleavage assays and annexin-V staining.  Infection with B19 led to PARP cleavage and induced apoptosis, with a mean of 28% of infected Hep G2 cells and 24% of infected primary hepatocytes undergoing apoptosis as determined by annexin-V staining, compared to 7% apoptosis in mock-infected cells.  Several lines of evidence suggest that NS1 is the molecule responsible for the B19-induced apoptosis of liver cells.  Irradiated virions, which are incapable of having their genes transcribed, do not induce apoptosis, suggesting that transcription is requisite for B19-induced apoptosis.  Since NS1 is the only known transcript produced by B19 infection of hepatocytes, it is likely that NS1 is the apoptosis-inducing factor.     \nApoptosis can proceed through many different mechanisms.  These pathways are regulated by the involvement of different caspases, cysteine proteases that mediate apoptosis. Caspase 9 transduces apoptotic signals originating within the cell, such as responses to DNA damage.  Caspase 8 transduces apoptotic signals that are initiated by ligation of TNF superfamily receptors.  Caspase 3 is a target of caspases 8 and 9, and acts to carry out the final activities of apoptosis. Caspase inhibition studies demonstrated that caspases 3 and 9, but not caspase 8, are required for B19-induced apoptosis. The requirement for caspase 9 in B19-induced apoptosis suggests that apoptosis is initiated by an internal signal, such as DNA damage. The dispensability of caspase 8 suggests that fas and TNF-\u00e1 are not involved in B19-induced apoptosis.  The DNA modifying activities of NS1 could allow NS1 to induce apoptosis by damaging cellular DNA.\nTo directly examine the apoptosis-inducing effects of NS1, the NS1 gene was cloned and fused to the gene for eGFP in an inducible vector. This vector was transfected into Hep G2 cells. Expression of the NS1 fusion protein was sufficient to cause apoptosis in a caspase-3 and\u20139-dependent manner, similar to the apoptosis induced by infection with whole virions.  Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that NS1 covalently binds to cellular DNA, a process which likely leads to activation of DNA damage response pathways.    \nBulky adducts induce apoptosis through a pathway requiring a DNA damage repair molecule, ATR.  The single-stranded DNA binding protein RPA initiates the ATR-dependent pathway by binding complexes containing ATR, leading to ATR phosphorylation.  Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that the DNA damage-sensing molecule RPA colocalizes with NS1 in transfected cells.    Inhibition of ATR with caffeine decreases apoptosis in NS1-transfected cells by 70%, decreasing the percentage of apoptotic transfected cells from 37% to 12%, and implicating the DNA adduct repair pathway in NS1 induced apoptosis.  \nThe ATR-mediated pathway for DNA damage-induced apoptosis is not the only potential DNA repair pathway induced by NS1.  NS1 nicks viral genomes, causing single-strand breaks.  The cellular pathway that repairs single-strand breaks can also lead to apoptosis.  This pathway is initiated by the single-strand nick binding protein PARP.  Upon activation, PARP poly(ADPribose)ylates neighboring proteins. Although the mechanisms of PARP-mediated DNA repair and apoptosis are not well understood, PARP activation can lead to apoptosis through changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, leading to activation of caspase 9.  To investigate whether NS1 activates PARP, NS1 was immunoprecipitated from transfected cells and found to be poly(ADPribose)ylated.  Poly(ADPribose)ylation of NS1 confirmed that PARP is active in NS1-transfected cells, and in contact with NS1 protein.  When PARP was inhibited by 5-aminoisoquinolinone, NS1-induced apoptosis decreased by 57%.  PARP activation in the presence of NS1 demonstrates the presence of DNA single strand nicks in the immediate vicinity of NS1.\nThese experiments demonstrate the cytotoxic nature of B19 infection of hepatocytes, and elucidate the mechanisms of B19-induced apoptosis of liver cells.  The evidence shows that NS1 binds to DNA in a covalent manner and that NS1 expression induces apoptosis through the single-strand nick and adduct DNA damage repair pathways.  \nA strong association between B19 and AFLF allows treatments for AFLF to be targeted to B19.  Since B19 can be neutralized with intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), it is possible that administration of IVIG could abrogate liver injury in cases of AFLF.  The knowledge that B19 induces apoptosis through NS1-induced DNA damage also suggests potential therapies.  PARP inhibitors have been proven useful in combating apoptosis-related injury due to ischemia, and it is possible that they would also prevent cell death induced by B19 infection.  These therapies have the potential to limit the liver damage during B19-associated AFLF, perhaps eliminating the need for transplantations.  In addition, many other diseases are associated with B19 infection, and these diseases may also benefit from anti-viral or anti-apoptotic therapies.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [653], "author_name_tesi": "Poole, Brian Douglas", "last_name_ssi": "Poole", "middle_name_ssi": "Douglas", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stanley J Naides", "Robert Harold Bonneau", "Sarah Bronson", "Michael J Chorney", "Mark Kester"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stanley J Naides, Committee Chair", "Robert Harold Bonneau, Committee Member", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Michael J Chorney, Committee Member", "Mark Kester, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["parvovirus B19", "Apoptosis", "Acute fulminant liver failure", "DNA damage"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "AN ANALYSIS OF SPECTRUM SHARING FOR RADAR APPLICATIONS", "id": "13618rop5073", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13618", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The author in conjunction with The Pennsylvania State University and the United States Army\nResearch Laboratory (ARL) has developed a multichannel superheterodyne signal analyzer aptly\nnamed the Spectrum Analysis Solution (SAS).

Hydrogen is a possible ideal fuel, because the only byproduct upon energy release from H2 is clean water, and its energy density is much higher than conventional hydrocarbon-based fuels. Industrially, hydrogen is produced via methane reformation and the water-gas-shift reaction, which are processes that release CO2 into the atmosphere, thereby eliminating some of the environmental benefits of using hydrogen as a fuel.  One clean alternative is water electrolysis, which involves the decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is the half-reaction that produces hydrogen in water electrolysis [2 H+ + 2 e- \u2192 H2 (g)]. To date, the most active catalyst for HER is platinum, a rare and expensive material that is needed for a variety of applications. There is a growing need for new Earth-abundant catalysts that can serve as alternatives to platinum. This dissertation describes the synthesis and electrochemical characterization of a new class of Earth-abundant, acid-stable HER catalysts that were inspired by the catalysts for mechanistically related chemical reactions, like hydrodesulfurization. \nThe discussion will begin with our studies of the catalytic capabilities of hollow Ni2P nanoparticles for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The Ni2P(001) surface was previously predicted to outperform platinum as a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction through density functional theory calculations by Liu and Rodriguez. The Ni2P nanoparticles were synthesized colloidally through the decomposition of tri-n-octylphosphine in the presence of in situ Ni nanoparticles. The Ni2P nanoparticles had among the highest HER activity of any non-noble metal electrocatalyst reported at the time of publication, producing H2(g) with nearly quantitative Faradaic yield, while also affording stability in aqueous acidic media\nThe story continues with our second catalytic system, CoP nanoparticles. Cobalt phosphides had not been previously studied for HER catalysis, unlike Ni2P. While synthesized similarly to the Ni2P nanoparticles, the CoP nanoparticles vastly outperformed the Ni2P nanoparticles, becoming the first non-noble metal acid-stable HER catalyst to achieve a current density of -10 mA/cm2 at an overpotential less negative than -100 mV. Additionally, the catalyst shows excellent electrochemical stability and Faradaic efficiency. \nNext, morphological considerations as they pertain to HER catalysis are discussed. Highly branched CoP nanostructures that have a similar surface area to the CoP nanoparticles were synthesized. These nanostructures express a high number of (111) crystal facets, allowing us to investigate the catalytic activity of the (111) surface on this anisotropic sample. Our findings suggest the morphological control does not play a major role in the catalytic activity of CoP, while also verifying the high intrinsic activity of the material. \nBefore concluding, we briefly discuss a few additional catalytic systems that were targeted because of their known activities for hydrodesulfurization catalysis. The catalysts discussed include several transition metal phosphides, carbides, and chalcogenides, with varying degrees of success. Ternary metal phosphide solid-solutions were electrochemically characterized, including Co1-x\u00acFexP, that attempts to combine the high activity of FeP with the stability of CoP, as well as Ni2-xCoxP systems that are known to show higher HDS activity than either end member. In addition, we synthesized the ternary phosphides CoMoP, CoMoP2, and NiMoP2 through phosphate reduction and investigated their catalytic activities. Nickel carbides as well as cobalt chalcogenides are also discussed briefly. Overall, these materials are active HER catalysts but their overpotentials are significantly higher than those of the phosphides presented earlier in the dissertation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11078], "author_name_tesi": "Popczun, Eric John", "last_name_ssi": "Popczun", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Benjamin James Lear", "Christine Dolan Keating", "James Hansell Adair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanoscience", "Metal phosphide", "Hydrogen evolution", "Nanoparticles", "Electrochemistry", "Electrocatalysis", "Earth-abundant", "Catalysis"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "FUNDAMENTAL STUDIES OF MOLECULAR SECONDARY ION MASS SPECTROMETRY IONIZATION PROBABILITY MEASURED WITH FEMTOSECOND, INFRARED LASER POST-IONIZATION", "id": "14128njp170", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14128", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The work presented in this dissertation is focused on increasing the fundamental understanding of molecular secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) ionization probability by measuring neutral molecule behavior with femtosecond, mid-infrared laser post-ionization (LPI). To accomplish this, a model system was designed with a homogeneous organic film comprised of coronene, a polycyclic hydrocarbon which provides substantial LPI signal. Careful consideration was given to signal lost to photofragmentation and undersampling of the sputtered plume that is contained within the extraction volume of the mass spectrometer. This study provided the first ionization probability for an organic compound measured directly by the relative secondary ions and sputtered neutral molecules using a strong-field ionization (SFI) ionization method. The measured value of ~10-3 is near the upper limit of previous estimations of ionization probability for organic molecules. The measurement method was refined, and then applied to a homogeneous guanine film, which produces protonated secondary ions. This measurement found the probability of protonation to occur to be on the order of 10-3, although with less uncertainty than that of the coronene. Finally, molecular depth profiles were obtained for SIMS and LPI signals as a function of primary ion fluence to determine the effect of ionization probability on the depth resolution of chemical interfaces. The interfaces chosen were organic/inorganic interfaces to limit chemical mixing. It is shown that approaching the inorganic chemical interface can enhance or suppress the ionization probability for the organic molecule, which can lead to artificially sharpened or broadened depths, respectively. Overall, the research described in this dissertation provides new methods for measuring ionization efficiency in SIMS in both absolute and relative terms, and will inform both innovation in the technique, as well as increase understanding of depth-dependent experiments.

In contrast, surface heat flow in many other parts of the California dataset displays only an ~ 10 mW/m^2 range. This scatter in surface heat flow near Parkfield has been an important limitation on interpretations of geodynamic processes, but to date has not been explained. Here, I use a numerical model of coupled fluid and heat transport to test the hypothesis that heat advection by groundwater flow through an upper crust characterized by heterogeneous permeability can generate the magnitude and spatial characteristics of the scatter in the Parkfield heat flow dataset.  I also compare surface heat flow near Parkfield and in the well-studied and hydrogeologically simple western Mojave Desert to investigate relationships governing fluid and heat transport in complex geologic terrains.\n     I find that the characteristics of the heat flow scatter near Parkfield can be generated if the Tertiary sediments that comprise the upper 2-3 km of the crust are characterized by permeability ranging from 3\u00d710^-16 m^2 to 10^-15 m^2, allowing recharge of ~ 0.5 cm/yr or higher.  Simulated surface heat flow is not sensitive to basement permeability, over a range of realistic depth-dependent permeability functions.  Additionally, enhanced permeability resulting from a San Andreas Fault zone and permeability anisotropy in the Tertiary sediments both have a minimal impact on simulated surface heat flow.  Although topographically driven groundwater flow through a heterogeneous permeability crust can generate the characteristics of the heat flow scatter near Parkfield, low recharge rates estimated for four springs in the Coast Ranges suggest that the permeabilities and groundwater fluxes required to cause significant advection may not be prevalent on a regional scale.  In contrast, the lack of a significant topographic driving force in the western Mojave Desert results in nearly constant heat flow even with sediment permeability as high as 10^-13 m^2, which is consistent with the low degree of heat flow scatter observed in that area. Lastly, although not the focus of this study, I demonstrate that for a wide range of reasonable permeability architectures in the upper crust, topographically-driven groundwater flow would not mask a thermal anomaly associated with frictional heating on the San Andreas Fault and also generate the observed scatter in heat flow.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3955, 3956, 3957], "author_name_tesi": "Popek, Margaret Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Popek", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Margaret", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Demian Saffer", "Demian Saffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Demian Saffer, Thesis Advisor", "Demian Saffer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["heat flow", "California", "groundwater flow", "tectonics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Experimental Investigation of Internal Short Circuits in Lithium-ion Batteries", "id": "26683", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11508", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With outstanding performance of Lithium-ion batteries, they have been widely used in many applications.

Efforts to explain failure mechanisms of the penetration using electrochemical-thermal coupled models have been proposed. However, there is no experimental validation because researchers lack of a diagnostic tool to acquire important cell characteristics at a shorting location, such as shorting current and temperature. \nIn this present work, diagnostic nails have been developed to acquire nail center temperatures and shorting current flow through the nails during nail penetration tests. Two types of cylindrical wall structures are used to construct the nails: a double-layered stainless steel wall and a composite cylindrical wall. An inner hollow cylinder functions as a sensor holder where two wires and one thermocouple are installed. To study experimental reproducibility and repeatability of experimental results, two nail penetration tests are conducted using two diagnostic nails with the double-layered wall. Experimental data shows that the shorting resistance at the initial stage is a critical parameter to obtain repeatable results. The average shorting current for both tests is approximately 40 C-rate. The fluctuation of the shorting current is due to random sparks and fire caused loose contacts between the nail and the cell components. Moreover, comparative experimental results between the two wall structures reveal that the wall structure does not affect the cell characteristics and Ohmic heat generation of the nail. The wall structure effects to current measurements inside the nail. With the composite wall, the actual current redistribution into the inner wall is found to be a sinusoidal waveform.

As adults, f/f mice have normal blood values but are unable to respond rapidly to acute erythropoietic stress.\nWhen challenged with an acute anemia, the control mice respond by inducing the rapid expansion of erythroid progenitors in the spleen but in the f/f mice, this response is delayed.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5021], "author_name_tesi": "Porayette, Prashanth ", "last_name_ssi": "Porayette", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Prashanth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Paulson", "Avery August", "Pamela Hankey", "Douglas Cavener", "Andrew Thomas Henderson", "Peter John Hudson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Paulson, Committee Chair", "Avery August, Committee Member", "Pamela Hankey, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Andrew Thomas Henderson, Committee Member", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fetal liver", "BMP4", "Smad5", "erythropoiesis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "HYDRODYNAMICS AND MANEUVERING SIMULATIONS OF A NON-BODY-OF-REVOLUTION SUBMARINE", "id": "9114", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2662", "abstract_tesi": "Historically, physics-based predictions of the hydrodynamics and the rigid-body dynamics (six-degree-of-freedom trajectory, velocities and accelerations) associated with a maneuvering submarine is a challenging task. This is due to the tightly coupled nature of the fluid mechanics and dynamics of the vehicle, and the magnitude of the computational problem associated with resolving the hull, moving appendages, and propulsors. However, successful development and validation of a computational approach for simulating submarine maneuvering is important for understanding routine and emergency operations, and it can be used as part of the toolset in establishing a safe-operating envelope and for design and analysis of future undersea vehicles.\nIn this research, the hydrodynamics and motions for a maneuvering submarine with a non-body-of-revolution hull form and X-stern control appendages are studied. The tightly coupled unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes and six-degree-of-freedom (REL-TCURS) simulation tool, developed at the Applied Research Laboratory at Penn State, is used to perform time-accurate calculations for a series of basic maneuvers such as turning circles. For computational efficiency, REL-TCURS replaces control appendages and propulsors with body-force models, and it is shown that these models can be calibrated with fidelity models of the actual control appendages. The computational fluid dynamics model is validated through comparisons with force and moment data from steady wind tunnel experiment. The REL-TCURS simulations are compared to free-running model test data. While there is discrepancy in certain details of the rigid-body dynamics, which are attributed to uncertainty in the initial conditions and the vehicle mass properties, the REL-TCURS simulations resolve roll instability seen in the model, and are able to definitively link the instability to a sail/control appendage interaction. This result demonstrates the utility and importance of being able to correlate time-accurate hydrodynamics, with control surface and propulsor commands, and with resultant vehicle dynamics.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2655], "author_name_tesi": "Poremba, John Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Poremba", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "John", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Eric G Paterson", "Dr Eric G Paterson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Eric G Paterson, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Eric G Paterson, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["unsteady RANS", "over set meshing"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Architecting Byte-addressable Non-volatile Memories for Main Memory", "id": "25034", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11340", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "New breakthroughs in memory technology in recent years has lead to increased research efforts in so-called byte-addressable non-volatile memories (NVM). As a result, questions of how and where these types of NVMs can be used have been raised. Simultaneously, semiconductor scaling has lead to an increased number of CPU cores on a processor die as a way to utilize the area. This has increased the pressure on the memory system and causing growth in the amount of main memory that is available in a computer system. This growth has escalated the amount of power consumed by the system by the de facto DRAM type memory. Moreover,  DRAM memories have run into physical limitations on scalability due to the nature of their operation. NVMs, on the other hand, provide high scalability well into the future and have decreased static power, one of the major sources of power consumption in contemporary systems. For all of these reasons, NVMs have the potential to be an attractive alternative or even complete replacement for DRAM as main memory.\n\nFor these types of devices to be feasible, there are some obstacles that must be overcome in order for there to be a compelling reason for NVMs to augment or replace DRAM. Although the static power and scalability are better, NVMs suffers from lower performance, higher dynamic power, and lower endurance than DRAM. Furthermore, the availability of architectural and comprehensive circuit models to explore how these issues can be resolved at a high level are lacking. \n\nThis dissertation addresses these issues by proposing several models for NVMs at both the architectural and circuit level. The architectural model, NVMain, is built around the assumptions that NVMs may not be complete replacements and thus provides flexibility to model complex memory systems including hybrid and distributed levels of memory. The circuit-level model, DESTINY, combines NVMs with more recent three-dimensional circuit design proposals to obtain performance and energy balanced memory designs. These two models are leveraged to explore several NVM memory designs. The first design employs a hybrid DRAM and NVM and addresses an issue of caching large amounts of NVM data in the DRAM portion. The second design considers reworking memory bank design to provide an extremely high-density NVM bank with the capability to access individual sub-units of the memory bank. The final design leverages the high parallelism from access to individual sub-units to schedule memory requests in a more efficient manner.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10876], "author_name_tesi": "Poremba, Matthew Raymond", "last_name_ssi": "Poremba", "middle_name_ssi": "Raymond", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Morgan Sampson", "Yuan Xie", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Mary Jane Irwin", "William Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Morgan Sampson, Dissertation Advisor", "Yuan Xie, Committee Chair", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Computer Memory", "Non-Volatile Memory", "DRAM", "Memory Scheduling", "Memory Modeling", "Memory Simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "A LONGITUDIANL STUDY OF A DEVELOPMENTAL-CONTEXTUAL MODEL OF \nWORK VALUES DURING ADOLESCENCE\n", "id": "6324", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1789", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "I employ data from a sample of participants examined longitudinally from the 9th to the 12th grade and regression-based statistics to examine the development of work values and their mutual dependence with part-time work experiences during the high school period.

I explored how species pre-inhabitation shapes habitat selection, the effect of microbes on positive interactions and the thermal biology of their vectors. I used naturally cohabiting species, Rhopalosiphum padi and R. maidis, vectors of the Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) as a model system to search for such mechanisms. Using experiments, I showed that R. maidis displaced R. padi. Next, I found that BYDV increases trophic facilitation between these congeners. Third, I examined how each aphid species responds differently to temperature and how BYDV increases the heat-tolerance of R. padi. I concluded that BYDV confers an adaptive selective advantage to both viruses and vectors, allowing vectors to use warmer habitats, shaping the interactions among vector species, and increasing virus transmission. Altogether my experiments demonstrate that heat-tolerance in insects caused by a virus constitutes a novel mechanism that promote niche expansion of interacting species.\nFor the International Agriculture and Development (INTAD) dual-title degree requirement, a portion of my research was done at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Austria studying fruit fly sterile insect technology as a tool for solving fruit and vegetable pest problems in developed and developing countries.

Numerical models of single-story and 5-story steel frames with the retrofit in place were analyzed following published guidelines on nonlinear, static and dynamic, progressive collapse analysis procedures. Two types of 5-story models were studied: one having moment frames in two directions, and another with moment frames in one direction. The effectiveness of the retrofit was assessed by comparing the performance of the retrofitted models to that of numerical models representing as-built conditions. Additionally, static and dynamic analysis results were compared to assess the level of conservatism associated with using a dynamic amplification factor of 2.0 in static analyses.\n\nUnder the static, progressive collapse load combination, the retrofit scheme reduced plastic rotation at beam ends in the 5-story model with moment frames in two directions. For the retrofitted model with moment frames in one direction, a 19% increase in load carrying capacity was achieved before failure. In all cases, the disparity between the peak dynamic response of the models and the corresponding static results suggests that the dynamic amplification factor should be further researched and revised.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2880], "author_name_tesi": "Porte, James Martin", "last_name_ssi": "Porte", "middle_name_ssi": "Martin", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey A Laman", "Jeffrey A Laman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey A Laman, Thesis Advisor", "Jeffrey A Laman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["progressive collapse"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Sexual Health Communication, Peer Networks, \n& Sexual Health Education \n", "id": "23316", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10610", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The majority of American teenagers become sexually active while they are still developing physically, emotionally, and intellectually.

Evidence of this can be seen in the increase in teacher education and teacher training programs and the rising volume of research in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL).  Educators all over the world are producing an abundance of academic work and capital via the sustained popularity of English language learning in Asia and throughout the world.  The knowledge base and adjoining professional practices span the globe, and global or macro perspectives of these phenomena still guide our understanding of the field.  In this light, it is important to develop cogent and effective means of thinking/rethinking international English teacher education in terms of local knowledge.  I believe that it is important to explore not only the content of this contentious field but also the modes of knowledge production.  With this in mind I have conceived of a philosophical inquiry that begins with the personal and the immediate and seeks out not only a philosophy of local knowledge but a pedagogical and methodological process that potentially disrupts generalized modes of knowledge production.  \nThe focal point of this dissertation is a fifteen week Second Language Acquisition (SLA) course I taught in Spring 2010.  This was a Master's level course in a TESOL program at a large university on the outskirts of Seoul, Korea.  The conditions which brought me to this setting and the specified requirement of teaching generalizable language learning theories to English teachers in Korea are part of world-wide trends in teacher education.  The frantic pursuit of English proficiency in Korea has led to increased attention to teacher education (Jo, 2008) and the field as a whole is still guided by generalizable theories of language and learning.  In a larger context, globalization in educational spheres has led to a need for comparable methods, results, and bodies of knowledge, and teacher education on a worldwide scale has embraced these values (Bates, 2008).  This classroom research project is an attempt to develop a philosophy of local knowledge alongside of a pedagogical model for exploring such knowledge via teacher narratives.  How can narratives offer new possibilities for local resistance and challenge contemporary practices of professionalization and globalization?  What are the parameters of and the potential of a philosophy of local knowledge as the starting point for such challenges?  \nThis inquiry falls into two distinct sections\u2014a pre-active stage and an interactive stage (Goodson, 1998).  The pre-active portion (Chapters Two, Three, and Four) describe trends in international teacher education and narrative research and consider the possibility of rethinking these according to a philosophy of local knowledge.  The interactive stage (Chapters Five, Six, and Seven) describes events which occurred throughout the fifteen week SLA course and explores resonating concepts.  \nEighteen participants in the SLA course produced weekly narratives related to academic theories, exchanged reflections on a collaborative class website, and wrote language learning/teaching autobiographies as final projects for the course.  Additional data sources included personal interviews, course evaluations, and classroom discussions recorded in my personal teaching journal.  I analyzed these exchanges with the hopes of understanding underlying assumptions and investigating ways that practicing teachers in a graduate program in Korea were able to elaborate upon, challenge, and inquire into these assumptions.  Resonating concepts in the data included expectations, theory, and progress.  Chapters Five, Six, and Seven elaborate on these concepts and attempt to discern ways of opening our understanding of emerging problems in international teacher education.  \nThe data suggested various relationships between theory and practice rooted in the professionalization of teaching and teacher education, a range of lingering effects rooted in persisting West to East dichotomies, and problematic ways that learning theories and teacher narratives impact teachers' expressions of their experiences as teachers and learners of English.  I conclude with a discussion of pedagogical and philosophical problems which arise in efforts to invoke local knowledge in a global educational sphere and a call to move beyond a reflective/narrative framework in teacher education.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1009], "author_name_tesi": "Porter, Curtis ", "last_name_ssi": "Porter", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Curtis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamie Myers", "Jamie Myers", "Gail Louise Boldt", "Anne Whitney", "Madhu Suri Prakash"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamie Myers, Dissertation Advisor", "Jamie Myers, Committee Chair", "Gail Louise Boldt, Committee Member", "Anne Whitney, Committee Member", "Madhu Suri Prakash, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["teacher narratives", "local knowledge", "English language learners", "teacher education", "South Korea", "Deleuze"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Sensitivity and Uncertainty Study of CTF Using the Uncertainty Analysis in Modeling Benchmark", "id": "27404", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12100", "abstract_tesi": "This work describes the results of a quantitative sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the thermal hydraulic subchannel code, Coolant-Boiling in Rod Arrays-Three Field (COBRA-TF).

New federal work zone regulations require states to continually pursue improvement of work zone safety and mobility by analyzing work zone crash and operational data to enhance state processes and procedures.  Work zone design guidance was identified as an area of needed improvement.  Current guidance is heavily based on desirable speed-related outcomes, but knowledge related to actual speed-related outcomes of design and traffic control decisions is limited.  The objective of this research was to investigate relationships between speed behavior, roadway and roadside geometrics and traffic control in work zones.  The research objective was accomplished through specification, estimation, evaluation and interpretation of a series of econometric models.  Four speed-related performance measures were modeled: 85th percentile passenger car speed, 85th percentile truck speed, passenger car speed deviation and truck speed deviation.  Data for model estimation were collected in Pennsylvania and Texas work zones.  Three issues were addressed by the work zone speed models: contemporaneous correlation between equation disturbances, contemporaneous relationships between dependent variables and autocorrelation.  A simultaneous equation model estimated with three-stage least squares was recommended.  Effects of work design and traffic control features on speed were observed but small in magnitude.  Additional data collection and modeling activities are recommended before direct implementation of speed findings into work zone design practice, including observation of larger samples with greater variability in geometric design elements and investigation of purely predictive modeling techniques.  Selected results and conclusions have near-term value.  No geometric or traffic control elements showed a direct effect on 85th percentile passenger car speeds.  Passenger car speeds were controlled mostly by truck speeds, which were directly influenced by posted speed, work zone type, type of infrastructure and vertical alignment.  Truck speed deviations were lower in work zones with a posted speed reduction of 10 or 15 mph than in work zones with no posted speed reduction.  In addition, passenger car speed deviations were higher in work zones with a 70 mph posted speed limit compared to other posted speeds.  Both of these findings contradict work zone posted speed guidance in the MUTCD, that a decrease in posted speed causes an increase in speed variance and that posted speed reductions should be avoided or limited to 10 mph for this reason.

The latter property is especially noteworthy as it allows access to a design space inaccessible to other high-strain active materials, both magnetostrictive and piezoelectric.\n\nThis dissertation develops a design approach for leveraging Galfenol's unique properties to create a self-contained magnetostrictive drive constructed from finely laminated structures. The approach relies on using a generalized design framework that is flexible enough to be configured for different applications. Flexibility is achieved through the adjustment of the laminated structure dimensions, the modular assembly of these structures, and the ability to bias the system with either permanent magnets or direct current. A key outcome of this study is a one-dimensional design model that simplifies the process of tailoring the drive to potential applications. \n\nValidation of this configurable drive concept is accomplished through designing, fabricating, and modeling a prototype drive that seeks to optimize the material's use. The one-dimensional design model is used to produce the prototype design and the results are corroborated with three-dimensional, nonlinear finite element analysis. Fabrication of the device is accomplished by assembling thin layers of Galfenol steel into two laminated structures, winding drive coils on these structures, and placing permanent magnets in between. Finally, a full one-dimensional, multi-domain model is created to simulate the behavior of the device.\n\nTo investigate the performance of Galfenol in sonar applications, the drive is assembled into a tonpilz-style transducer and tested in a water-filled anechoic tank. Simulation is accomplished by updating the one-dimensional model of the drive to represent the testing scenario and by employing finite element modeling. The model results are then compared to measurement with good agreement. \n\nFinally, measured values for the quality factor, electromechanical coupling coefficient, and efficiency of the Galfenol tonpilz are compared to published data for various nickel and Terfenol-D designs. The result is that the Galfenol transducer achieves comparable results in all three areas. It is concluded that Galfenol is competitive with other magnetostrictive materials and merits consideration for future magnetostrictive designs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5737, 5738, 5739], "author_name_tesi": "Porter, Scott Phillips", "last_name_ssi": "Porter", "middle_name_ssi": "Phillips", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Thompson", "Stephen Thompson", "Richard Joseph Meyer Jr.", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Thompson, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Thompson, Committee Chair", "Richard Joseph Meyer Jr., Committee Chair", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Member", "Julian Decatur Maynard Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["modeling", "transduction", "transducer", "iron", "gallium", "galfenol", "piezomagnetism", "magnetostriction", "FEA", "SONAR", "tonpilz", "simulation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Resilient Global Supply Chain Network Design Optimization\n\n\n", "id": "8932", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5134", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In addition to the financial measures used in supply chain structure decisions, there is a need to integrate customer service, disruption risk and other strategic criteria into supply chain planning and control.

Three mechanisms known to cause variation in host plant chemistry were tested: inbreeding, gene mutation, and the presence of fungal symbionts. Many studies that measure the effect of plant differences on herbivores only focus on the immature stages of the insect. Because reproduction and dispersal generally occurs during the adult stages of insects, adults make a great contribution to the overall dynamics and demographics of the population. Understanding how host plant heterogeneity influences adult mobility may provide us with better predictive power when confronting problems dealing with insect pests, invasive species, or the preservation of biodiversity. \nChapter 2 documents the effects of host plant (Solanum carolinense) inbreeding on the growth and flight capacity of a specialist insect herbivore (Manduca sexta). Manduca larvae   grew 9.7% faster and molted into 38.4 % larger pupae when reared on inbred plants, compared to larvae reared on outbred plants. These differences in pupae mass also carried over to the adult stage of the insect. On average, mass-adjusted flight metabolic output was 12.7% higher for moths reared on inbred plants than those reared on outbreds. Changes in adult flight metabolism were also associated with changes to the relative abundance of an isoform of Troponin t (Tnt), a flight muscle protein that regulates muscle contraction. These results show that variation in host plant chemistry caused by plant inbreeding creates developmental effects that cascade through the larvae and pupae to affect dispersal-related traits of the adult stage. This suggests that plant inbreeding may increase herbivore dispersal ability. It also suggests that changes to the population biology of host plants can affect the flight capacity and population dynamics of an animal at a higher trophic level.\nChapter 3 documents how two generalist Noctuid herbivores (Fall Armyworm and Southern Armyworm) responded differently to variation in the host plant\u2019s (Solanum lycopersicum) defense response. This study compares the changes to growth and flight capacity of two lepidopteran herbivores caused by a gene mutation, in the host plant, that alters the production of jasmonic acid (JA). JA acts as a key molecule in the biochemical pathway that leads to the up-regulation of genes involved in a plant\u2019s defense response to herbivory. Manipulating the defense response of tomato host plants through the JA pathway produced differences in survival, growth and flight metabolic output in the 2 species. The survival rate for Southern Armyworm (SAW) was 71.4% compared to just 14.1 % survival rate for Fall Armyworm (FAW). Compared to defenseless (def1) plants, plants that exhibited normal levels of defense response (Castlemart and methyl jasmonate induced) had no effect on SAW adult body size, but methyl-jasmonate induced plants (MeJA) caused a significant reduction in adult body mass (31.4%) of FAW. FAW adults reared on MeJA plants also showed a 16.9% reduction in flight metabolic rate. The reductions in FAW flight metabolism were also associated with a 42.5% a reduction in the ratio of Tnt A and F isoforms. These results show that SAW appears to be better adapted to feeding on tomato than FAW because SAW was relatively unaffected by variation in tomato\u2019s induced defense response. Compared to FAW, SAW larval survival was higher, and adult fitness traits such as body size and dispersal capability were less affected by host plant defense response. Our results also suggest that changes to host plant defenses could have a greater impact on the spatial ecology and population dynamics of poorly adapted herbivores because it may decrease both their survival and ability to disperse longer distances. \nChapter 4 examines how adult flight is affected by variation in host plant (Poaceae) chemistry caused by the presence of fungal symbionts (endophytes). Endophytes have the ability to alter the levels of toxic secondary metabolites, thus decreasing host plant quality for herbivores. This chapter compared the survival, body size and flight capacity of a lepidopteran herbivore (FAW) when reared on 6 different species of grass, both with and without endophtyes. The effect of endophytes on insect survival and flight capacity varied depending on the species of host plant-endophyte symbiotum. Endophytes we associated with a 77.4% and 68.2% reduction in relative survival for insects that fed on grass species Agrostis perennuns and Poa autumnalis. Endophytes were also associated with reduced growth performance in individuals that fed on Cilamagrostis arundinacea (CIAR), but increased flight metabolism. This was a surprising result because it indicates that the presence of endophytes in CIAR caused these insects to invest more metabolic resources into the development of high performing flight muscles rather than larger bodies. Overall these results shows that fungal symbionts can be associated with changes to adult insect growth and flight capacity, but the effects are dependent upon the species of symbiota that the larval stages feed on.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9039], "author_name_tesi": "Portman, Scott L", "last_name_ssi": "Portman", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Harold Marden", "Andrew George Stephenson", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Gary Felton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Harold Marden, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Chair", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member", "Gary Felton, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["plant", "insect", "flight", "metabolism", "gene expression", "dispersal", "inbreeding", "defense", "endophyte"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "The Mothers' Circle: The Lived Experiences of Culture, Community and Care of Lower-Income Women In a Parenting Education and Family Support Program", "id": "6268", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2882", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "                       ABSTRACT\n\n\nWhat motivates lower-income parents to participate in a particularly successful voluntary parenting education and family support program was the focus of this qualitative, phenomenological study.

Variations in family support, and concerns and problems within the neighborhood/community were motivating forces. Positive program and staff attributes contributed to parents' desires to participate as well.\nThis research further revealed that the program and staff addressed the needs of participants' by being attentive to issues involving gender, class, culture and ability through an environment that created community within the larger community. The program and staff also went way beyond just parenting education, by assisting and supporting mothers in identifying and confronting gender related issues, addressing lower-income families' needs for food, clothing, and shelter, being accepting of cultural beliefs and differences, and providing support and encouragement for those with special needs.   \n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2876], "author_name_tesi": "Ports, Joan Franklin", "last_name_ssi": "Ports", "middle_name_ssi": "Franklin", "first_name_ssi": "Joan", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Daniele D Flannery", "Carol Ruth Nechemias", "Kenneth Kyle"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Chair", "Daniele D Flannery, Committee Member", "Carol Ruth Nechemias, Committee Member", "Kenneth Kyle, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["family support", "parenting education", "community programs", "motherhood"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "STRUCTURAL HETEROGENEITY IN THE RNA POLYMERASE II C-TERMINAL DOMAIN", "id": "14228bzp105", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14228", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "RNA polymerase II contains a repetitive and intrinsically disordered C-Terminal Domain (CTD) composed of heptad repeats of the consensus sequence YSPTSPS.  The CTD can be heavily phosphorylated and serves as a scaffold, interacting with factors involved in transcription initiation, elongation, termination, RNA processing and chromatin modification. Despite its role as a nexus of eukaryotic gene regulation, the structure of the CTD and the structural implications of CTD phosphorylation, are poorly understood. Additionally, there is an increasing awareness of the importance of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that function without adopting a stably folded structure. Here I present a biophysical and biochemical interrogation of the structure of the full-length CTD of D. melanogaster, which I conclude is a compact random coil. I find that the repetitive CTD is structurally heterogeneous as evidenced by a discontinuous pattern of cutting in limited proteolysis assays. Small Angle X-Ray scattering (SAXS) is a method ideally suited for the structural interrogation of large IDPs and can be employed to measure the size of a protein and to monitor structural changes in response to post-translational modification. Using SAXS I determined that phosphorylation by the kinase P-TEFb caused an increase in CTD radius and stiffness. Limited proteolysis of the phosphorylated CTD showed these gross structural changes are accompanied by increased protease accessibility and an alteration in relative protease accessibility across the length of the CTD.\n\nAdditionally, we show that the human CTD is also structurally heterogeneous and able to substitute for the Drosophila melanogaster CTD in supporting the development of flies to adulthood. These finding implicate conserved structural organization, not a precise array of heptad motifs, as important to CTD function.\nThe CTD is attached to the catalytic core of Pol II via a linker. I show that this linker is more compact than the CTD repeats and serves as an independent structural unit. The phosphorylated linker-CTD remains flexible relative to the phosphorylated CTD alone. Together, these results support a mechanism by which phosphorylation reduces the conformational entropy of the CTD, generating a more binding competent dock for CTD:protein interactions, with the linker region maintaining the ability of CTD bound factors to sample the 3-dimensional space which may be required for RNA processing and histone modification.\nThe data described herein represent the most thorough structural characterization to date of the full length CTD on the global and local scales, examining both the overall size and local structural organization of the CTD. These studies establish the Drosophila CTD as an attractive model for the biophysical, biochemical and genetic interrogation of the structure and function of the CTD from a developmentally complex organism.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15062], "author_name_tesi": "Portz, Bede ", "last_name_ssi": "Portz", "first_name_ssi": "Bede", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Gilmour", "David Scott Gilmour", "Katsuhiko Murakami", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Scott A Showalter", "Joseph C.

This model takes patient\u2019s medical scans (CT) and extracts the airways into a surface geometry file and associated skeletonized data file.  A semi-automated geometry algorithm truncates the airways and gives them generational assignments along with planar pressure boundaries at their desired outlets. A volume mesh is then generated from the surface mesh that can be used for respiration simulation.  The planar pressure boundaries interact with a second mesh comprised of automatically generated Quasi-1D pipes representing the lower airways which saves considerable amounts of computational time.  This research improved on several of these modeling components.  New algorithms were developed, coded, and verified for truncation and generational assignment that are dependent on a separate attribute algorithm, which works in conjunction to replace the previous geometry tool. Also, new automated software tools were developed to create idealized CAD models and meshes for computational simulation to calculate the losses in sub-grid scale bifurcation regions that connect the Quasi-1D pipes in the lower airways.\nThe truncation algorithms were shown to be more robust than their predecessor when dealing with very complex medical imagery; likewise, the associated generational assignment algorithm was shown to have increased accuracy when compared to the previous version.  However, mixed success was obtained from the development of loss models for the sub-grid scale bifurcation regions.  Computational simulations gave consistent values for the loss associated with these geometries and demonstrated that the flow and subsequent loss in the lower airways is dominated by viscous effects.  Unfortunately as these losses were orders of magnitude smaller than the head loss in such flows, the inherent slight variations from mesh to mesh that arises when changing a feature for comparison are enough to obscure the trends from being properly resolved. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1516], "author_name_tesi": "Porzio, David Philip", "last_name_ssi": "Porzio", "middle_name_ssi": "Philip", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Francis Kunz", "Robert Francis Kunz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Francis Kunz, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Francis Kunz, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["computational fluid dynamics", "cfd", "multiscale", "human respiration", "macroscale", "breathing", "microscale"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "READING BEYOND: CHILDREN\u2019S LIVED SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES OF \nFANTASY LITERATURE \n\n", "id": "12306", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1129", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this phenomenological study was to describe four children\u2019s lived spiritual experiences of literary texts as generated through their responses to two toy fantasy novels for children, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane by Kate DiCamillo (2006) and The Mouse and his Child by Russell Hoban (1967).

At synapses, neurotransmitter-filled vesicles fuse to the presynaptic plasma membrane in response to a depolarizing action potential, and release their cargo into the synaptic cleft. When neurotransmitter binds to receptors on the postsynaptic cell, ion channels open and the resulting current flow alters the cell\u2019s membrane potential. Analysis of temperature-sensitive paralytic (TS) mutants of Drosophila has been important to our understanding of the in vivo molecular mechanisms of synaptic transmission. These mutants behave normally at permissive temperature, but rapidly paralyze at restrictive temperature. Among these mutants are comatose, which encodes the Drosophila NSF homolog, dNSF1, and shibire, which encodes dynamin. NSF dissasembles SNARE complexes, which mediate synaptic vesicle fusion, while dynamin is essential for synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Both comatose and shibire exhibit electrophysiological and biochemical phenotypes at restrictive temperature which reflect disruptions in synaptic vesicle trafficking. \n\nGenetic screens for modifiers of existing TS paralytic mutants have revealed novel proteins involved in synaptic transmission. A TS paralytic allele of the cacophony gene, cacTS2, was recovered during a genetic screen for enhancers of comatose. This new mutant helped to identify the cac gene product as a primary presynaptic calcium channel functioning in neurotransmitter release. To further our understanding of synaptic transmission, a forward genetic screen for modifiers of cacTS2 was performed. An enhancer of cacTS2, e(cac)661, was recovered and this new TS mutation was mapped to the disabled gene. A molecular lesion in disabled was identified which introduces a premature stop codon resulting in a truncated protein. Western blot analysis confirmed that the full length Disabled protein was absent from e(cac)661, and e(cac)661 was renamed as an allele, disabled enhancer of cac 1 (dabEC1).\n\nElectrophysiological analysis at adult DLM neuromuscular synapses of dabEC1 revealed an activity-dependent reduction in excitatory postsynaptic current amplitude at restrictive temperature. In addition, biochemical studies demonstrated a TS reduction in SDS-resistant SNARE protein complexes similar to the phenotype seen in shibire mutants. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of adult DLM and larval neuromuscular synapses indicated that Dab is concentrated within presynaptic boutons but is not present at active zones. Taken together, the behavioral, electrophysiological and biochemical findings point to a role for Dab in synaptic vesicle trafficking.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3776], "author_name_tesi": "Posey, Lisa Lipowski", "last_name_ssi": "Posey", "middle_name_ssi": "Lipowski", "first_name_ssi": "Lisa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard W Ordway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard W Ordway, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["temperature-sensitive mutant", "Synaptic vesicle trafficking", "Drosophila"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "ESSAYS IN FINANCIAL TRANSMISSION RIGHTS PRICING\n\n", "id": "7360", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "814", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-08-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work examines issues in the pricing of financial transmission rights in the PJM market region. The US federal government is advocating the creation of large-scale, not-for-profit regional transmission organizations to increase the efficiency of the transmission of electricity. As a non-profit entity, PJM needs to allocate excess revenues collected as congestion rents, and the participants in the transmission markets need to be able to hedge their exposure to congestion rents. For these purposes, PJM has developed an instrument known as the financial transmission right (FTR). This research, utilizing a new data set assembled by the author, looks at two aspects of the FTR market.\n\nThe first chapter examines the problem of forecasting congestion in a transmission grid. In the PJM FTR system firms bid in a competitive auction for FTRs that cover a period of one month. The auctions take place in the middle of the previous month; therefore firms have to forecast congestion rents for the period two to six weeks after the auction. The common methods of forecasting congestion are either time-series models or full-information engineering studies. In this research, the author develops a forecasting system that is more economically grounded than a simple time-series model, but requires less information than an engineering model. This method is based upon the arbitrage-cost methodology, whereby congesting is calculated as the difference of two non-observable variables: the transmission price difference that would exist in the total absence of transmission capacity between two nodes, and the ability of the existing transmission to reduced that price difference. If the ability to reduce the price difference is greater than the price difference, then the cost of electricity at each node will be the same, and congestion rent will be zero. If transmission capacity limits are binding on the flow of power, then a price difference persists and congestion rents exist.\n\nThree transmission paths in the Delmarva Peninsula were examined. The maximum-likelihood two-way Tobit model developed in Chapter One consistently predicts the expected responses to the independent variables that have employed, but the model as defined here does a poor job of predicting prices. This is likely due to the inability to include system outages (i.e., short-term changes in the structure of the transmission grid) as variables in the estimation model.\n\nThe second chapter addresses the behavior of firms in the monthly auctions for FTRs. FTRs are a claim to congestion rent revenues along a certain path within the PJM grid, and are awarded in a uniform-price divisible-goods auction. Firms typically submit a schedule of bids for different amounts of FTR at different prices, akin to a demand curve. A firm bidding too high a price may cause the clearing price of the FTR to be higher than the realized value of the FTR, creating a loss from ownership of the FTR. A firm bidding too low means that it wins no FTRs, depriving itself of the ability to profit from ownership or to hedge against congestion. Several questions concerning firm behavior are addressed in this study. It is found that firms adjust their bids in response to new information that is obtained from past auctions: they raise or lower bids in accordance with changes in recent FTR prices and payoffs. Firms consistently bid below the value of the FTR (i.e., shade their bids.) This adds empirical evidence to the theoretically-posited notion that uniform-price auctions are not truth-telling, unlike the second-price auction for a non-divisible good. Firms employ greater bid-shading in response to increases in the volatility of both FTR clearing prices and realized FTR values. This validates the notion that firms are risk-averse.  It is discovered that better-informed \u201cinsider\u201d firms employ structurally different bidding strategies, but these differences do not lead to greater profits. However, profits do increase as firms gain more experience in these markets, lending credence to the notion that firms learn over time and that markets discipline poorly performing firms by either educating them or driving them out of the market. It is also found that firms that employ complicated bidding strategies enjoy greater profitability than firms which employ simple bidding strategies. A surprising corollary finding is that firm strategies do not converge to a common form, but that different firms continue to employ different strategies, and often move away from the seemingly dominant strategy. Firms can enter this market as either long-buyers or short-sellers, and it is discovered that long and short players display structurally divergent bidding strategies. This is perhaps unsurprising, given that long players can be either hedgers or speculators, but short players are overwhelmingly speculators. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [807], "author_name_tesi": "Posner, Barry ", "last_name_ssi": "Posner", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Barry", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mineral Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Nathan Kleit", "Nancy Gordon", "Adam Zachary Rose", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Nathan Kleit, Committee Chair", "Nancy Gordon, Committee Member", "Adam Zachary Rose, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["divisible-goods auctions", "Financial transmission rights", "forecasting techniques"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "participation of gravity framing and interaction in the seismic response of steel buildings", "id": "22155", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9884", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Separate systems are designed to resist gravity loading and lateral seismic loading.

The sample of students for both the qualitative and quantitative phase of the study included adult learners who had entered the SBDC entrepreneurial learning program and then discontinued the program before completing their learning goals. Using the qualitative data from 10 in-depth interviews that were conducted in May and June 2011, a quantitative survey was developed.  A total of 243 SBDC students completed the survey in August, 2011.  The principal component analysis asserts an emerging learning model loading 26 variables to form seven components that explained 74% of the variance. The second set of findings found that a majority of the variables produced significantly higher means for the success group of learners when the means were compared to the non-success group of learners (p < .05).

Over the past decade, numerous researchers have greatly advanced the processing and performance of these materials.  However, the best textured PMN-PT ceramics show properties only halfway between those of ceramics and <001>C oriented crystals.  In this work, long-standing problems in processing of textured PMN-PT ceramics are investigated in order to close the performance gap between textured ceramic and single crystal materials.  First, novel plate-like 0.4(Na1/2Bi1/2)TiO3-0.6PbTiO3 templates were synthesized in order to avoid deleterious effects of BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 on texture development and properties.  To produce these particles, topochemical conversion of PbBi4Ti4O15 to PbTiO3 was studied in comparison to reactions yielding BaTiO3 and NaNbO3 microplatelet templates.  Conversion was found to occur via multiple nucleation and growth of the perovskite phase, followed by recrystallization to eliminate microstructure damage.  Formation of phase-pure perovskite templates was aided by partial solid solution of Na+ and Bi3+ on the perovskite A-site of PbTiO3.  Undoped <001>C textured PMN-PT fabricated with these templates has both high density (~99%) and high texture quality (f = 92%), and shows higher electromechanical coupling (k33 = 0.83) than previous textured ceramics.  Complete sets of electromechanical properties of textured PMN-PT are reported for the first time for both undoped and Mn2+ doped compositions.  Both materials have enhanced coupling coefficients in the 33 and 31 modes, despite having crystal-like mechanical properties only in the texture (33) direction.  In addition, the dielectric properties of both materials remain ceramic-like.  As a result, enhancement of d33 is associated with increases in sE33 and k33, while enhancement of d31 is associated mainly with an increase in k31.  Rayleigh analysis of textured PMN-PT ceramics indicates that <001>C texture strongly reduces extrinsic contributions to ferroelectric properties, and this effect may partially explain the gap between textured ceramic and crystal performance.  Because extrinsic response is already limited in Mn2+ doped textured ceramics, it is likely that acceptor doped textured ceramics may perform similarly to doped single crystals.  The scalability and flexibility of textured PMN-PT fabrication is demonstrated by successful fabrication of 5 cm cylindrical transducer elements with radial <001>C texture.  Spatial control of the texture orientation allows fabrication of omni-directional transducers from monolithic textured ceramics, whereas use of crystal requires a segmented design approach.  In order to further improve the properties of <001>C textured PMN-PT, new approaches for particle alignment were investigated.  To avoid fundamental limits on shear-based methods such as tape casting, dynamic magnetic alignment (MA) was used in conjunction with slip casting and TGG methods.  Using this approach we demonstrate narrow grain orientation distributions (FWHM ~7\u00b0) are attainable at low field levels (2.2 T) in a permanent magnet array.  Texture qualities in these ceramics were limited by morphologic defects (grain boundaries or domain structure) in the template particles used, and this method may be further optimized to yield substantially narrower grain orientation distributions.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7105], "author_name_tesi": "Poterala, Stephen F", "last_name_ssi": "Poterala", "middle_name_ssi": "F", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Lynn Messing", "Richard Joseph Meyer Jr.", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "James Hansell Adair", "Clive A Randall", "Michael T Lanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Lynn Messing, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard Joseph Meyer Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Textured ceramic", "PMN-PT", "piezoelectric", "texture", "ceramic", "templated grain growth"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Ensemble and hybrid four-dimensional data assimilation for tropical cyclone analysis and prediction", "id": "22698", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10358", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Numerical models and observations contain critical information regarding the earth-atmosphere system: they present a means of quantifying the system dynamics and provide evidence of the true system state, respectively.

Chapter two presents an investigation on sampling errors in ensemble data assimilation systems, and discusses some of the major challenges for applying the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for mesoscale applications. An EnKF is applied in chapter three to explore the predictability and genesis of Hurricane Karl (2010), and study the impact of field observations in forecasting its track and intensity. The Hurricane Karl case study is revisited in chapter four to examine the impact of applying four-dimensional variational (4DVar) and hybrid ensemble-4DVar (E4DVar) data assimilation methods for analyzing and forecasting genesis. The last chapter provides a more theoretical perspective on hybrid four-dimensional data assimilation. It compares the E4DVar approach used for the WRF model in chapter 4, with an alternative method that is being considered for operational use at several national forecast centers.

It results in a reduced life expectancy and an overall poor quality of life, requiring patients to be dependent on regular medication, supplements and altered diets.\n\tFull thickness wound healing presents a number of complications to diabetic patients.  Often, due to neuropathy, a wound can go unnoticed increasing its severity and risk of infection.  Moreover, even when wounds are found and treated, a slow rate of wound closure is observed further increasing the risk of higher severity and infection level.  Treatments are typical for epithelial defects such as bandaging and antibiotic ointments but they leave out a key element to the wounding process in diabetes, increased levels of plasma [Met5]-enkephalin, or OGF.\n\tOGF interacts specifically with its receptor OGFr, which is a nuclear receptor, and together they act directly on DNA to tonically inhibit DNA synthesis and thus cell proliferation.  To counteract this effect, naltrexone (NTX) serves as a long acting opioid antagonist and through high affinity binding with the OGFr it blocks the effect of OGF, increasing DNA synthesis and cell proliferation.  NTX has been shown to be an effective treatment in re-epithelialization of the rat and rabbit cornea in vivo and human cornea in tissue culture.  In the current study 10-5M NTX is shown to increase both DNA synthesis in the epithelium of normal and diabetic rats, and to increase wound closure rates in normal and diabetic rats.  \n\tInitially a topical dose and a proper vehicle were selected.  In order to test the doses and vehicles, Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered diabetic by Streptozotocin injections and maintained hyperglycemic for 5 weeks.  Topical applications of 10-4M, 10-5M, and 10-6M NTX in Sorenson\u2019s phosphate buffer, DMSO, Neutrogena moisturizing cream, and KY jelly were administered to unwounded skin of both normal and diabetic (glucose &#61502; 350mg/dL) rats.  Animals received BrdU injections and DNA synthesis was calculated in the basal layers of epithelium.  In comparison to DNA labeling indexes in untreated rats, as well as though receiving only vehicles, dosages and vehicles were selected that significantly increased labeling indexes. Although all of the vehicles significantly increased cell proliferation at the basal layer of epithelium with at least one of the doses mentioned, moisturizing cream and KY jelly vehicles were shown to be the most effective at a concentration of 10-5M NTX in both normal and diabetic rats.  \n\tIn the second study, 6 mm full thickness wounds were surgically created on the dorsum of normal and diabetic rats.  The wound were treated 3 times daily with topical applications of moisturizing cream, moisturizing cream + 10-5M NTX, KY jelly  or KY jelly + 10-5M NTX beginning immediately after surgery and lasting until complete wound closure (no more than 13 days in any treatment group). Wounds were photographed and areal analyses conducted.  Data revealed that in comparison to animals receiving only vehicle, wound closure of NTX treated animals was increased on day 3 in normal rats and significantly increased on days 3, 5, 7 and 9 in diabetic rats.  On day 7 in diabetic rats wound closure was accelerated by more than 2 fold in topical moisturizing cream + 10-5M NTX when compared to topical moisturizing cream alone.  By day 9, wound closure in diabetic rats was accelerated by more than 2.8 fold in topical KY jelly + 10-5M NTX when compared to topical KY jelly control.\n\tAdditional studies demonstrated that the type of moisturizing cream had no significant effect on wound closure rate.  No differences in wound closure rates were noted between Oil of Olay moisturizing cream and Neutrogena moisturizing cream on days 3, 5, 7 and 9 in normal animals and days 5, 7 and 9 in diabetic animals.\n\tThe number of applications of moisturizing cream plus NTX was studied.  There were no significant differences in rates of wound closure between diabetic animals receiving 1x daily or 2x daily application and 3x daily application at day 3, 5, 7 or 9.  In normal animals  there were no significant differences in rates of wound closure between diabetic animals receiving 1, 2, or 3 applications daily of NTX + moisturizing cream at days 3, 5 or 9.\n\tAlong with being an effective treatment for increasing wound closure rates, NTX was also shown to be non-toxic.  Gross observation of unwounded skin showed no redness or irritation.  Animals display unusual behavior after receiving topical treatment.  Topical applications of cream and NTX did not result in qualitative increases in redness, infection, discharge, or swelling of the wounded or surrounding areas.  Histopathological studies supported that the processes of wound healing were similar between untreated rats and those receiving topical applications.  Furthermore, apoptosis was not observed in the epidermis or dermis of skin sections from any treatment group.\n\tIn conclusion, these studies demonstrate a new and novel treatment for wound healing that involves the disruption of biological processes invoked by the OGF-OGFr pathway.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [922], "author_name_tesi": "Pothering, Christian A.", "last_name_ssi": "Pothering", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Christian", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Anatomy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin", "Patricia Mclaughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Patricia Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor", "Patricia Mclaughlin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Type 1 Diabetes", "Full thickness wounds", "Naltrexone"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Mechanisms of Flavor release and perception in sugar-free chewing gum\n\n", "id": "7534", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5369", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The flavor properties of chewing gum are undoubtedly a key product attribute for consumption.  However little is known about how many of the various ingredients (i.e. flavor solvents) in chewing gum alter flavor delivery.  Consequently, defining mechanisms which influence flavor release in chewing gum is important for understanding its product quality and possibly may also translate to drug delivery applications for the pharmaceutical industry.\nThe first objective of this study investigated the influence of three flavor solvents on the aroma/taste/textural properties in a sugar-free chewing gum.  Model chewing gums made with [0.67%; triacetin (TA) or propylene glycol (PG) or medium chain triglycerides (MCT)] and without flavor carrier solvent.  The chewing gums were analytically characterized in vivo for three panelists over a period of 12 min.  Volatile analysis of cinnamaldehyde, L-carvone, piperitone, jasmone was conducted using Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization-mass spectroscopy (APCI-MS).  Sorbitol release from saliva was tracked using High pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with Refractive Index Detector (RID), while the textual properties (softness) were measured using TA-XT2.  Furthermore, the perceived flavor properties of these chewing gum samples were measured using a time-intensity sensory study (TI) on the aroma (cinnamon-like), taste (sweetness) and textural (effort to chew) attributes using a trained sensory panel.  \nFlavor solvent addition to chewing gum did not significantly influence the aroma release profiles of all the 4 compounds.  However, the sorbitol release rate was significantly lower for chewing gum made with TA compared to the other treatments.  The sensory analysis was in agreement with the analytically data; lower levels of sweetness and cinnamon-like flavor intensity were perceived for chewing gum made with TA were observed, suggesting taste-aroma interactions.  Chewing gums formulated with TA or MCT were reported to be softer (based on texture analysis) then with PG or no flavor solvent addition. However, no correlations were reported between the instrumental texture analyses of the chewing gum (softness) and the flavor release.  Overall, flavor solvent choice did influence the sorbitol release in chewing gum matrix due to unique plasticizing/softening mechanism of the solvent utilized.\nThe second objective of this study was to investigate the mechanisms for cinnamaldehyde release in a sugar-free chewing gum.  Chewing gums containing (25%-Paloja gum base, 61 %-sugar alcohol, 4%-glycerine, 0.46% sweeteners, and 0.02% lecithin) were made with varying concentrations of cinnamaldehyde.  Additionally chewing gums were made with p-cresol (similar log P as cinnamaldehyde).  A cinnamaldehyde or cresol flavored gum base (no sugar alcohol) was also made to investigate the role of the gum base on flavor release. Three panelists were asked to chew gums or flavored gum base, while aroma release profile was tracked from the nose exhaled breath using APCI-MS over a period of 8 min.  The release profile of cinnamaldehyde from chewing gum was found to correlate with the sugar alcohol release in a sugar free gum.  Chewing gums made with varying amounts of cinnamaldehyde (0.29 - 2.9 mg/g of chewing gum) did not show any differences in release pattern suggesting no concentration effect.  Furthermore, the cinnamaldehyde release pattern from the gum base was similar to cresol or as predicted from the log cP value (distribution coefficient between the gum base and water).  These findings suggested cinnamaldehyde was interacting with the sugar alcohol phase, possibility due to transient hemi-acetal reactions mechanisms, which resulted in a more rapid release rate than would be predicted based on the hydrophobicity of this compound.  \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5362], "author_name_tesi": "Potineni, Rajesh Venkata", "last_name_ssi": "Potineni", "middle_name_ssi": "Venkata", "first_name_ssi": "Rajesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Devin G Peterson", "John Neil Coupland", "John D Floros", "Daniel A Jones"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Devin G Peterson, Committee Chair", "John Neil Coupland, Committee Member", "John D Floros, Committee Member", "Daniel A Jones, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Flavor release", "Flavor perception", "Chewing gum", "APCI-MS", "Solvent effect", "Cinnamaldehyde"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "A Legal Analysis of the Legitimate Pedagogical Interest of Teaching Alternatives to Evolution in Public Schools", "id": "7857", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5249", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "For decades schools and students have been caught in the middle of a scientific, educational, and cultural battle over the teaching regarding the origins of life. The theory of evolution is at the center of the controversy. Widely accepted by scientists as a reliable scientific theory, evolution is attacked by conservative Christians as against God and a literal interpretation of the creation story of the Bible. Recently, intelligent design has emerged as an alternative to evolution and creationism. Intelligent design proponents argue that life becomes so irreducibly complex as to lead to the conclusion that an unnamed intelligent power must have had a role in creation.\nOver the years, the debate over teaching evolution in schools has waged in our nation\u2019s court system. The Supreme Court and various lower courts have ruled against attempts to limit teaching evolution or require the teaching of creationism. Courts have also ruled against attempts to introduce disclaimers, either written or verbal, which question the primacy of evolution as the only explanation for the origins of life. Primarily courts reason that governing bodies have been motivated by a religious purpose to inhibit the teaching of evolution or advance the teaching of a religious view of creation which violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\nThis paper reviews the legal dimensions of the origins controversy and then introduces different perspectives to the traditional approach to the debate. Specifically, other aspects of Establishment Clause jurisprudence as well as freedom of speech in schools analyses are discussed. These cases show that schools can teach \u201cabout\u201d religion so long as they do not endorse religion. They also show that school boards are the primary decision makers about what will be included in the curriculum of the schools in their jurisdiction. As such, they have only to show a \u201clegitimate pedagogical concern\u201d in support of their decisions. The cases also show courts\u2019 preference for students to have access to a wide variety of information and be free to inquire into matters of interest. Educational literature and the culture generally also acknowledge the importance of students learning about religion in a neutral manner.\nThis paper then proposes a framework that details steps school boards may take to develop a policy for teaching about the origins controversy in science classes. The framework respects the protections of the Establishment Clause and freedom of speech from the First Amendment and incorporates the educational and cultural interest in teaching about religion and the origins controversy in a way that respects the findings of science and the beliefs of many students.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5226], "author_name_tesi": "Potter, Robert Lance", "last_name_ssi": "Potter", "middle_name_ssi": "Lance", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Preston Green", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich", "John Daniel Marshall", "Scott P Mcdonald"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Preston Green, Committee Chair", "Jacqueline A Stefkovich, Committee Chair", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member", "Scott P Mcdonald, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["evolution", "intelligent design", "creationism", "teaching science", "public school", "Establishment Clause", "freedom of speech"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Multi-modal effort estimation", "id": "28784", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12460", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cognitive and physical tasks appear to have little in common, yet we are able to make decisions such as which of two tasks is easier or which to do first.

We ascribed this tendency to pre-crastination, which we defined as the tendency to hastily offload tasks from working memory, even at the expense of added physical effort. In Experiments 1 and 2 of the present thesis, I tested whether participants were willing to reach long distances and heft heavy buckets to show pre-crastination. Despite the need to lean and reach far, participants continued to favor the closer bucket. However, the probability of picking up the closer bucket fell to chance when it contained a heavier weight load (7 lbs.), while the farther bucket contained a lighter weight load (3.5 lbs.). In Experiments 3-6, I more directly tested the relation between cognitive and physical effort by asking participants to choose to perform either a mainly physical task (reaching for a bucket with different physical weight loads and carrying it some distance) or a mainly cognitive task (counting to a target number). I did so with two aims. The first was to build a metric to relate cognitive and physical costs. The second was to test the hypothesis that measured time is the substrate that relates cognitive and physical costs. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that participants used time as an index of effort. However, there was evidence to suggest that they rely on time less as task demands increase. I discuss potential alternatives to the use of time to relate cognitive and physical effort in the General Discussion section, with a specific focus on the idea that subjective effort is the amount of monitoring one must do throughout a task. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11813], "author_name_tesi": "Potts, Cory A", "last_name_ssi": "Potts", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Cory", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A.

A majority of modern techniques utilize a perfusion-based culture model where fresh media is continuously passed over growing cells in order to keep them replenished. However, such techniques require intricate setups that have to incorporate syringe pumps, the growth platform, and a culture incubator. To add to the complexity, sterility has to be maintained so as not to contaminate the cells. Unlike perfusion-based techniques, this work demonstrates a novel method to culture cells utilizing a culture media reservoir and nutrient diffusion. Two micropipette tips fixed on the inlet/outlet ends of a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic culture channel are filled with media that passively diffuses throughout the channel to sustain the cells. Optimal times and techniques to replenish the media reservoir were determined through 3D computer simulation and wet bench experimentation. Cell growth on a glass, PDMS, and a Matrigel platform were explored. Ultimately, it was shown that replenishing the culture media within the reservoirs in increments of 5\u03bcL allowed for a confluent Human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cell colony to grow in 32 hours of culture. Replenishing the media in 20\u03bcL or 50\u03bcL increments did not foster global colony growth. Further computational image analysis of cell culture images showed the 5\u03bcL culture technique led to roughly two times greater cell colony coverage throughout the growth channel.

However, the emerging concern of noise issues in quiet natural areas such as National Parks has lately shifted some of the research efforts towards the propagation of noise from high altitude aircraft (over 18,000 feet), technically defined as aircraft en route noise. Indeed, the future re-emerging of open-rotor propulsion systems which would reduce the fuel emissions by as much as 30%, could also potentially increase the emitted noise. Such a configuration calls for new methods in order to determine the transmission loss between source and receiver, compared with a traditional community noise issue.  Additionally, any numerical prediction should include a realistic and altitude-dependent weather profile along such long propagation paths, which directly affects how wave fronts bend as well as the total atmospheric absorption.  AERNOM, which stands for \u201cAdvanced En Route NOise Model\u201d, is a ray tracing numerical prediction scheme that was designed to handle such a geometry in order to account for the atmospheric effects in predicting en route noise ground contours.

Since universities accrue real, monetary gains from research, either directly from the generation of patent revenues or indirectly from the gaining of increased prestige that translates into increased tuition revenues or more external research funding, they should be required to pay their fair share of the costs.  The focus of this thesis is to explore another potential justification for the use of cost-sharing, that cost-sharing provides information to the funding agency about the quality of the proposal.  A theoretical model is developed to establish a framework for understanding the cost-sharing element in the federal funding of academic grants.  The model predicts that in some funding environments, cost-sharing would allow the agency to weed out low type projects, leaving only high type projects in the proposal competition.   Under looser agency budget environments, lower type projects could apply and be funded, but higher cost-sharing commitments would be required from all proposals which had lower preliminary assessments.    \n\nIn testing these predictions, the empirical model employed data on 1168 continuing grants that were funded by the National Science Foundation between 1993 and 2000.  The results provided very minimal evidence that cost-sharing varies negatively with the preliminary assessment.  This evidence includes results from the 1993-1994 and 1997-98 periods, results from the individual NSF directorates, and the relationship between total cost-sharing and grant award.  Thus, we cannot conclude with any certainty that there is any informational content in the cost-sharing level.  However, the testing did show that greater cost-sharing is a function of the threshold of the project, whether this threshold derives from the university, department, or researcher level characteristics.  This is supportive of the traditional leveraging explanation of cost-sharing.  Agencies seem to act in a manner similar to that of a price-discriminating monopolist, requiring varying levels of cost-sharing (or \u201cprices\u201d) based on the ability of the proposer to provide cost-sharing.  It was also found that cost-sharing was affected by the agency\u2019s threshold, which varied over time and across field or directorate.\n \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5080], "author_name_tesi": "Poulton, Robert A.", "last_name_ssi": "Poulton", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["N Edward Coulson", "N Edward Coulson", "Irwin Feller", "Mark John Roberts", "David Eissenstat"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["N Edward Coulson, Dissertation Advisor", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Chair", "Irwin Feller, Committee Member", "Mark John Roberts, Committee Member", "David Eissenstat, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["University Research", "NSF", "National Science Foundation", "Academic Research", "Cost-sharing", "Higher Education Funding"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Mechanism of Bubble Formation during the Drying of Polymer Films \n\n\n", "id": "6512", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5349", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In creating thin films of polymers by solution processing, a common problem is the undesirable formation of bubbles during the drying process. Practical experience shows that bubbles can be created well below the boiling point of the solvent.  Also, it has been observed that the degassing of the polymer solutions result in reduced bubble formation, indicating a relationship between the presence of air and bubble formation.  This work is based on a hypothesis that if the solubility of air in the polymer solution increases with solvent concentration, then the solution can become super saturated with air as the concentration of the solvent is reduced during the drying process.  To test this hypothesis we have chosen the system of polyvinyl acetate, toluene and nitrogen.  Experimental methods were developed to measure the solubility of nitrogen in the polymer-solvent system as a function of solvent composition and temperature.  The group-contribution lattice-fluid equation of state was used to correlate the thermodynamic behavior of the ternary system, utilizing experimental measurements to determine the interaction parameters in the equation of state.  In addition, experiments were conducted to measure the diffusion coefficients of the nitrogen over a range of pressures and temperatures.  Different diffusion models based on the friction coefficients and free volume model and were then used to correlate the diffusivity data so that the diffusional behavior of the ternary system can be predicted over a broad range of conditions.  Finally, the thermodynamic and diffusivity correlations were incorporated into a multi-component drying model which included main and cross diffusion terms to predict saturation behavior in the polymer solution during the drying process.  The model without the cross diffusion terms represents the ideal system in which the diffusion of one component does not affect the diffusion of others. The drying model did not predict supersaturation of nitrogen when cross diffusion terms were neglected. However, the model predicted supersaturation of nitrogen when the cross diffusion terms are included. Therefore, the cross diffusion terms in the mass transfer model are essential for the development of nitrogen supersaturation. Also different diffusion models based on the friction coefficients led to qualitatively similar predictions for the supersaturation of nitrogen. The simulation\u2019s results supported all our observations in experiments regarding bubble formation. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5344], "author_name_tesi": "Pourdarvish Mohammadi, Reza ", "last_name_ssi": "Pourdarvish Mohammadi", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Reza", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margaret K Duda", "Ronald Paul Danner", "Seong H Kim", "Ronald C Hedden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margaret K Duda, Committee Chair", "Ronald Paul Danner, Committee Chair", "Seong H Kim, Committee Member", "Ronald C Hedden, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PVAc-Toluene-Nitrogen", "Solubility", "Polymer Solution", "Dryinig", "Bubble Formation", "Diffusivity"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": " THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION: AN ANALYSIS OF STUDY ABRAOD PROGRAMMING AT THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSIRTY AND THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY ", "id": "14837aap18", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14837", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the United States the annual rate of participation in study abroad programs have steadily increased over the past two decades with a record number of students studying abroad during the 2014-2015 academic year.

This type of synthetic control is desirable as even small changes in one of these four factors can lead to drastically different material properties.  An example of this is the formation of non-equilibrium crystal phases which are metastable in bulk systems and often exhibit characteristics unique from the thermodynamically stable phase.  Consequently, these metastable phases are favored for certain applications due to their properties.  However, attempts to synthesize a phase pure sample of a non-equilibrium crystal phase are often fraught with difficulties as phase determining factors are not well understood for nanoscale syntheses.  As a result, nanoscale synthetic research is frequently performed in an exploratory, semi-serendipitous method.  It is therefore desirable to expand our understanding of nanoscale reactions so as to facilitate the directed synthesis of specific nanoscale targets.\n \nIn the research reported herein, attempts were made to elucidate the phase determining factors in two systems: polyol synthesis of manganese(II) sulfide, and cation exchange with cobalt and manganese.  First, a manganese(II) sulfide, MnS, polyol synthesis was studied to elucidate which reaction variables have the greatest impact in crystal phase determination.  Initial research showed that reaction temperature, aging time, and manganese source had the greatest influence on the crystal phase of the MnS product.  Further investigation of this reaction implied that a complex relationship exists between the decomposition rate of the sulfur source, the concentration of the tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate, and the presence of an in situ intermediate.  Although this complex relationship was not deconvoluted through this research, these results nevertheless help to shed light on the phase determining factors in the polyol synthesis of manganese(II) sulfide.  \n\nIn addition, cation exchange was investigated as a method for the synthesis of metastable phases.  Although the use of ion exchange to access metastable phases had been reported previously, much of this research was limited to copper, silver, cadmium, lead and zinc chalcogenides.1-3  In this work, cation exchange with cobalt and manganese from a roxbyite-type Cu2-xS precursor was explored.  Ultimately, metastable wurtzite-type cobalt- and manganese sulfides were synthesized through this exchange process.  This result is of great interest for several reasons.  First of all, cation exchange was performed with two transition metal cations which had previously only served as dopants in exchange reactions.  This work also demonstrates a colloidal method for the synthesis of wurtzite-type CoS which had previously only been synthesized through chemical bath deposition methods.4  Finally, formation of the metastable wurtzite-type phases demonstrates the retention of both anion and cation sublattice features \u2013 a result which has not been reported in literature to date.

This disappearance has intensified pressures on public land agencies to provide places where people can experience this human-nature connection.  As these agencies experience increased demands and shrinking budgets, effective design and management strategies must be employed to maximize the potential for visitors to experience this nature-connection.\nResearch from a diverse array of scientific fields confirms that physical attributes of spaces have the ability to contribute to an emotional connection in people.  However, despite the diverse body of research regarding nature attachment, place attachment, and landscape preference, designers charged with creating spaces that go beyond mere attachment to place and facilitate an emotional attachment to nature lack clear feedback from users regarding what experiences are most effective at creating this connection.  Traditional research has focused on users responses to landscapes as if the landscape was holistic and unchangeable,  while in reality landscape architects are challenged to craft spaces made up of discreet, malleable physical elements that work together to create an experience.  \nThis research aims to bridge the gap between what designers perceive as cogent spaces for facilitating a human-nature connection and what actual users perceive as effective or distracting from creating this connection.

The hot high speed supersonic jets exhausting from military aircraft during takeoff present a most challenging problem. Laboratory measurements are important so that noise reduction concepts can be evaluated early in the design process. Experimental research was conducted in the Penn State high speed jet noise facility on two separate methods of noise reduction of supersonic jet flows.  The first noise reduction method was the beveled exit plane nozzle concept explored most recently by Viswanathan and the second was the internal nozzle corrugations pioneered by Seiner et al. The combination of the two methods was also explored.\n   The jet plume from beveled nozzles was examined and shown to deflect less than 5 degrees for both over-expanded and under-expanded flows. A new method of rotating the exit plane about the centerline was used to create the beveled nozzles. This results in an extension of the bottom lip and a shortening of the top lip. Results show that for heated jets, noise in the peak emission direction was reduced by 3-4 dB on the long lip side of the nozzle. Similar magnitudes of noise reductions were still present with the forward flight capability being used. A novel research idea of creating fluidic corrugations similar to the nozzle corrugations has been started by Penn State. To further the understanding and analysis of the fluidic corrugations, the present study focused on the flow field and acoustic field of nozzles with two, three, and six nozzle corrugations. The effect of the combination of the internal corrugations with a beveled nozzle was explored. The results show that significant noise reductions of over 3 dB of both the mixing noise and the broad band shock associated noise can be achieved. Additionally, the combination nozzle was shown to reduce the noise over a wider range of polar angles and operating conditions than either the purely beveled nozzle or the nozzle with only hard walled nozzle corrugations.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7770], "author_name_tesi": "Powers, Russell ", "last_name_ssi": "Powers", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Russell", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis K Mc Laughlin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis K Mc Laughlin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Acoustics", "Jet Noise", "Noise Reduction", "Corrugations", "Corrugation", "Bevel", "Beveled", "Experiment", "Supersonic", "Model", "Military", "Nozzle"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Experimental Investigation of the Noise Reduction of Supersonic Exhaust Jets with Fluidic Inserts", "id": "26397", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11536", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The noise produced by the supersonic, high temperature jets that exhaust from military aircraft is becoming a hazard to naval personnel and a disturbance to communities near military bases.  Methods to reduce the noise produced from these jets in a practical full-scale environment are difficult. The development and analysis of distributed nozzle blowing for the reduction of radiated noise from supersonic jets is described. Model scale experiments of jets that simulate the exhaust jets from typical low-bypass ratio military jet aircraft engines during takeoff are performed. Fluidic inserts are created that use distributed blowing in the divergent section of the nozzle to simulate mechanical, hardwall corrugations, while having the advantage of being an active control method. This research focuses on model scale experiments to better understand the fluidic insert noise reduction method. Distributed blowing within the divergent section of the military-style convergent divergent nozzle alters the shock structure of the jet in addition to creating streamwise vorticity for the reduction of mixing noise. Enhancements to the fluidic insert design have been performed along with experiments over a large number of injection parameters and core jet conditions. Primarily military-style round nozzles have been used, with preliminary measurements of hardwall corrugations and fluidic inserts in rectangular nozzle geometries also performed.\n It has been shown that the noise reduction of the fluidic inserts is most heavily dependent upon the momentum flux ratio between the injector and core jet. Maximum reductions of approximately 5.5 dB OASPL have been observed with practical mass flow rates and injection pressures. The first measurements with fluidic inserts in the presence of a forward flight stream have been performed. Optimal noise reduction occurs at similar injector parameters in the presence of forward flight. Fluidic inserts in the presence of a forward flight stream were observed to reduce the peak mixing noise below the already reduced levels by nearly 4 dB OASPL and the broadband shock-associated noise by nearly  3 dB OASPL. \nUnsteady velocity measurements are used to complement acoustic results of jets with fluidic inserts. Measured axial turbulence intensities and mean axial velocity are examined to illuminate the differences in the flow field from jets with fluidic inserts.  Comparisons of laser Doppler measurements with RANS CFD simulations are shown with good agreement. Analysis of the effect of spatial turbulence on the measured quantities is performed. \nExperimental model scale measurements of jets with and without fluidic inserts over a simulated carrier deck are presented. The model carrier environment consists of a ground plane of adjustable distance below the jet, and a simulated jet blast deflector similar to those found in practice. Measurements are performed with far-field microphones, near-field microphones, and unsteady pressure sensors. The constructive and destructive interference that results from the interaction of the direct and reflected sound waves is observed and compared with results from free jets. The noise reduction of fluidic inserts in a realistic carrier deck environment with steering of the ``quiet planes'' is examined. The overall sound pressure level in heat-simulated jets is reduced by 3-5 dB depending on the specific angle and ground plane height. Jets impinging upon a modeled jet blast deflector are tested in addition to jets solely in the presence of the carrier deck. Observed modifications to the acoustic field from the presence of the jet blast deflector include downstream acoustic shielding and low frequency augmentation. The region of maximum noise radiation for heat-simulated jets from nozzles with fluidic inserts impinging on the jet blast deflector is reduced in overall sound pressure level by  4-7 dB.

The research was divided into two tests. Test 1 was performed holding the load constant (40% load at the rated speed) while speed was increased in steps of 300 rpm from 1500 rpm to 2100 rpm. Test 2 was performed holding the speed constant (1800 rpm) while the load was varied in steps of 7.5% from 40% to 55%. Three rail pressures of 425 bar, 500 bar and 575 bar were selected to be within a safe operating range for the engine. Injection was limited to single pulse injection for ease of control. Ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) was used as the fuel to perform the experiments.\n\nAn engine map of the exhaust gas composition, mainly NOx, was created at the given speeds, loads and rail pressures. A sweep of the injection timing was performed over a given range of operating conditions and points of constant NOx were identified on a brake specific basis. While conducting these tests, the influence of engine parameters on performance and emissions were determined. These included the effects of speed and load on specific fuel consumption and NOx, and the effect of injection timing on BSFC. Results confirmed the well established trend that retarding the injection timing helped reduce NOx but at the expense of fuel consumption. Increasing the rail pressure increased NOx emissions while particulate matter (PM) was reduced. Findings at constant NOx indicated the dominance of either speed or injection timing which resulted in high PM at a few conditions of rail pressure and speed. Heat release profiles and bulk temperatures from Test 2 indicated several trends concerning PM formation and its oxidation. A reduction in the engine load resulted in less PM exhausted from the engine. A high bulk temperature from high engine load conditions indicated a preference of PM oxidation to its formation.\n \nTo determine the influence of engine parameters on soot reactivity, particulate matter was collected at six different conditions at constant NOx for further investigation using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Raman spectroscopy was performed on all of these samples to determine the degree of disorder in the primary soot particles to support observations from TGA. Results suggested that increasing the rail pressure made soot more reactive, while a significant impact of speed and injection timing on reactivity was observed, whose trends could not be justified on the basis of a single parameter. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [888], "author_name_tesi": "Prabhakar, Bhaskar ", "last_name_ssi": "Prabhakar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bhaskar", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Andre Louis Boehman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor", "Andre Louis Boehman, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["injection timing", "NOx", "BSPM", "BSFC", "rail pressure"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Examination of Egr Cooler Fouling and Engine Efficiency Improvement in Compression Ignition Engines", "id": "18054", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8313", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The scope of this investigation is to understand the challenges associated with achieving high engine efficiency and low emissions in \u2018Clean Diesel\u2019 technology. The topics addressed in this study are: 1) understanding the challenges in reducing NOx emissions due to fouling of EGR coolers, 2) exploring high efficiency dual fuel combustion with fumigation of liquefied gases into engine air intake, and 3) understanding the effect of diesel fuel formulation on engine efficiency and emissions.  \nIn the first study, the performance of a model EGR cooler attached to a 6.4L turbodiesel engine was investigated by analyzing the microstructure and chemical composition of the deposits on the fouled heat exchanger surfaces at two engine loads: medium and low, and at two coolant temperatures: 85\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. Results indicated that the medium load condition resulted in greater thermal effectiveness loss and mass gain inside the EGR cooler, mostly due to increased thermophoresis, producing smaller (grain size) and coarser deposits. In contrast, the low load condition resulted in lower effectiveness loss, but produced large-sized deposits mostly due to increased hydrocarbon (HC) condensation. Regardless of the engine load, effectiveness and deposit mass gain plateaued in about 9 hours. Coolant temperature played a significant role in altering the deposit microstructure and in increasing the amount of condensed HCs. Deposit mass increased for the 40\u00b0C coolant condition due to an increase in both HC condensation and thermophoresis. For most conditions, the deposits were comprised of some aromatics and mostly heavy aliphatics (C17-C25 paraffins) which arise due to incomplete combustion of the heavy-end long chain compounds present in the fuel and lubricating oil. Low coolant temperatures promoted higher effectiveness recovery during engine start-up suggesting an influence of condensed water vapor on deposit layer removal. Use of an oxidation catalyst upstream of the EGR cooler to reduce hydrocarbon condensation was not effective at the engine conditions tested in the study due to low operating temperatures across the catalyst. \nIn the second study, the role of ignition quality of a fumigated fuel on combustion phasing and brake thermal efficiency (BTE) was investigated on a 2.5L turbocharged common rail light-duty diesel engine, in a process similar to dual fuel combustion. Different combinations of DME and propane were fumigated into the intake air via a specially designed manifold assembly, each combination representing a percentage of the energy supplied to the engine, with rest of the fuel being ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD). Fumigation of DME and propane significantly increased BTE and reduced brake specific energy consumption (BSEC) compared to the baseline diesel condition with no fumigation. A mixture of 20% DME with 30% propane provided the maximum BTE, with 24% reduction in BSEC, however, at the expense of increasing peak cylinder pressure by 6 bar, which was even higher at greater DME%. Fumigated DME auto-ignited early, ahead of top dead center (TDC), showing the typical low temperature and high temperature heat release events and propane addition suppressed the early low temperature heat release (LTHR), shifting more of the DME heat release closer to TDC. Total hydrocarbon emissions decreased with DME substitution, and increased with propane substitution. NOx emissions reduced with increasing DME and propane substitution, and were 45% lower at the peak BTE in comparison to the baseline diesel condition. CO emissions increased with increasing propane and DME substitution until 20% DME (455 ppm at baseline to 3700 ppm at the peak BTE), while CO2 emissions decreased mainly with increasing propane while they remained more or less constant with increasing DME substitution. It was concluded that DME and propane fumigation into the air intake offered a pathway to high efficiency combustion.\nIn the final work, the sensitivity of fuel conversion efficiency and engine performance to fuel formulation was evaluated at different engine operating conditions under a range of ultra-low sulfur diesel fuels. The fuels were comprised of a commercial baseline ULSD, along with six other diesel fuels varying in derived cetane number (DCN), total aromatic percentage, and distillation temperature (T90). Increasing the DCN improved BSFC and BTE, and reduced PM, HC and CO emissions, while no conclusive trend was observed in NOx emissions. Increasing the aromatic content reduced BTE and increased BSFC and other regulated emissions. Increasing the T90 temperature did not have much effect on BSFC, BTE, and NOx emissions, however, PM emissions increased while HC and CO emissions marginally decreased. Overall, a fuel with a high DCN, a low aromatic content, and a high T90 resulted in high engine efficiency, low fuel consumption, low NOx and PM emissions.  A fuel with a low DCN, a low T90 and a high aromatic content was a less desirable combination for engine performance. These results confirmed that fuel formulation of ultra-low sulfur diesels played an important role in achieving high efficiency and low emissions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8228], "author_name_tesi": "Prabhakar, Bhaskar ", "last_name_ssi": "Prabhakar", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Bhaskar", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Randy Lee Vander Wal", "Jonathan P Mathews", "Daniel Connell Haworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Dissertation Advisor", "Randy Lee Vander Wal, Committee Chair", "Jonathan P Mathews, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["EGR Cooler Fouling", "High Efficiency Combustion", "Dual Fuel Combustion", "Clean Diesel Technology"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Shared Storage Resource Management to Provide\npredictable Performance", "id": "13726", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7312", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Emerging high-end computing platforms at petascale provide new horizons for\ncomplex modeling and large-scale simulations. While these systems have unprecedented levels of peak computational power and data storage capacity, a critical challenge concerns the design and implementation of scalable application and system software that make it possible to harness the power of these systems for large scale I/O intensive applications. Increasing complexity of large-scale applications and continuous increases in data set sizes of such applications combined with slow improvements in disk access latencies have resulted in I/O becoming a performance\nbottleneck.\nState-of-the-art storage systems in high-performance computing platforms typically consist of a set of I/O nodes and file/storage servers that are accessed by\nmultiple compute nodes. Applications executing on compute nodes issue streams\nof I/O requests to the underlying I/O nodes that in turn request data from multiple\n\ufb01le/storage servers. In general, the storage architectures in high-end computing\nplatforms can be multi-tiered with di\ufb00erent types of shared resources through the\nentire storage stack. Consolidated resources in these systems usually include different layers of the I/O subsystem used to cache recently and/or frequently used data so that the number of I/O requests accessing the disk is reduced. They also include the shared I/O bandwidth and disk space that collectively service\nI/O requests from di\ufb00erent applications. In order to reduce the gap between the computation and I/O speeds, e\ufb00ective utilization of system resources through the entire storage hierarchy is essential.\nStorage resources are also dynamically shared among di\ufb00erent concurrently\nexecuting applications.

NGS has opened up an array of possibilities for many applications including whole-genome sequencing, epigenetics, metagenomics and characterization of pathogens.  Of these, the characterization of diversity of heterogeneous microbial environments such as metagenomes and viral populations has recently gained significant interest. Although a host of methods for whole genome assembly have been developed, reconstruction of heterogeneous populations using NGS data still remains a challenge. As compared to existing technologies, reads produced by NGS are typically shorter and more error-prone. The growth in the size of the datasets is fast outpacing the computational power needed to analyze it. Thus, many computational challenges arise while analyzing deep sequence data from heterogeneous populations. The computational methods presented in this dissertation aim to analyze and quantify the genetic diversity within a heterogeneous population based on a set of deep sequencing reads.\n\nA major challenge facing metagenomics is the development of tools for the characterization of functional and taxonomic content of vast amounts of short metagenome reads. Unlike single genome sequencing, assembly of a metagenome is intractable and is by large, an unsolved mystery. A crucial step in metagenomics that is not required in single genome assembly, is binning the reads belonging to a species. Clustering methods aim to identify the species present in the sample, classify the sequences by their species of origin and quantify the abundance of each of these species. The efficacy of clustering methods depends on the number of reads in the dataset, the read length and relative abundances of source genomes in the microbial community.\n\nFrom clustering, to assembly, to annotation and function prediction, bioinformatics is posed with new challenges in handling noisy, huge and often partial sequence data. Until now, methods to classify short sequences generated by NGS technologies have been relatively inaccurate. Most methods use sequence homology to assign reads to common ancestors. However, most extant databases are highly biased in their representation of true diversity, such methods fail to find homologs for reads derived from novel species. \n\nTo address the aforementioned problems, in the first part of dissertation, I have focused on methods to characterize and analyze the taxonomic content of vast amounts of short metagenome reads. The main contributions of the dissertation are: (i) A two-pass soft clustering semi-supervised method that is a hybrid of comparative and composition based methods. Such a hybrid approach is effective when evolutionarily close training genomes are available. (ii) An unsupervised Naive Bayes mixture model based on Poisson or Gaussian distributions to model reads within each bin. (iii) An unsupervised multivariate Bayesian mixture model based on Poisson and Multinomial distributions for clustering discrete sequence data. This method overcomes the bottleneck of above Naive Bayes by taking into account the conditional dependencies between the words within the reads. For the latter two methods, we present a two-way clustering approach to reduce the high-dimensionality and sparsity associated with the data. The method combines the words along the reads into word groups and constrains the parameters for words within the same group to be identical.\n\nHigh genetic variability in viral populations plays an important role in disease progression, pathogenesis and drug resistance. The last few years has seen significant progress in the development of methods for reconstruction of viral populations using data from NGS technologies. These methods identify the differences between individual haplotypes by mapping the short reads to the reference genome. Much less has been published about resolving the population structure when an assembled reference genome is not well-defined, which severely limits the number of populations that can take advantage of these new technologies.\n\nIn the remainder of the dissertation, I have described a computational framework, called Mutant-Bin, for clustering individual haplotypes in a heterogeneous population and determining their prevalence, based on a set of deep sequencing reads. The main advantages of our method are that: (i) it enables determination of the population structure and haplotype frequencies when a reference genome is lacking; (ii) the method is unsupervised, the number of haplotypes does not have to be specified in advance; (iii) it identifies the polymorphic sites with derived nucleotides that co-occur in a subset of haplotypes and the frequency with which they appear in the viral population.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7717], "author_name_tesi": "Prabhakara, Shruthi ", "last_name_ssi": "Prabhakara", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shruthi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raj Acharya", "Webb Colby Miller", "Mary Poss", "Padma Raghavan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raj Acharya, Dissertation Advisor", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Member", "Mary Poss, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Clustering", "Metagenomics", "Mixture-modeling", "Algorithms"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "PbMFS - Periodicity based Mobility Forecasting System", "id": "27109", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11946", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We present synthesized findings from a systematic study of user mobility based on well grounded data sets.

We start with a baseline of the user\u2019s current place, start time, and end time to predict the next place. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms, PeriodicaB and Pe- riodicaS, through aggregated average prediction accuracies across all users over a large set of diverse participants. PeriodicaS mines periodicity intelligently in users\u2019 mobility traces and further improves prediction accuracies with additional classification rules. We derive these classification rules by applying explicit semantic annotations (home, work place and public transportation points associated with places visited), and accompa- nying group information. We propose novel ways of transforming bits of information in the mobility traces, defined as inherent semantic annotations, as features for mobil- ity modeling in PeriodicaS. Inherent semantic annotations are deduced from temporal variations in visited places such as end time only, and measuring duration time. We deduce more inherent semantic annotations from place rankings by frequency of visits. By progressively employing the semantic annotations, explicitly stated in the data set and deduced from the mobility traces, we improve next place prediction accuracies up to 58% compared to baseline predictions. We cluster the users\u2019 visited places based on their proximity from each other make next place predictions based on these clusters.

This study examines the linkages between the academic knowledge creation and technology transfer process in nanotechnology, with emphasis on the environmental, organizational and individual contexts. The conceptual framework uses theories of power to trace the ascendancy of the tech transfer function from a peripheral to an increasingly core activity. The main research issues addressed include the stratification of nanotech funding, publications, and patents; the impact of interdisciplinarity on knowledge creation and transfer; effects of university policy, structure and strategies on knowledge creation and transfer; effects of organizational culture; and faculty attitudes, life-cycle associated behaviors and role balance in managing their public science and entrepreneurial roles. The methods used include data analysis of key metrics and case studies at two research universities. \nFunding, patents and publications in nanotechnology are concentrated at a few universities indicating that regional innovation in nanotechnology could be skewed. In the eleven-year period from 1994-2004, each of these measures has shown an impressive increase. Interdisciplinarity affects the process and structuring of the entire academic value chain in nanotechnology, from the training of students to the evaluation of technology at the tech transfer office. The organizational contexts of knowledge creation create path-dependent conditions for transfer of technologies. Faculty across both institutions belonged to one of two groups of thought; those who believe firmly that tech transfer and research commercialization are part of their academic role, and others who believe that research commercialization is a peripheral role and takes away from their main focus. Faculty life cycle appears to play a key role in the decision to commercialize. Academic scientists who commercialize their research successfully manage both the conflicting role demands of public and commercial science. This study models two paths to the marketplace for nanoscale academic technologies. The first path is a clear case of technologies being \u2018pulled\u2019 into the marketplace and the second path relates to technology being \u2018pushed\u2019 into the marketplace. The two paths show considerable variation in their focus and the level of involvement at the environmental, organizational and individual level. \nThe peripheral task of tech transfer at universities is changing due to environmental pressures, and the shifting dynamics of power related with commercialization activities. Policy implications include the need for fostering interdisciplinarity in the academy and actively promoting an organizational culture that values such activity. Through its focus on academic knowledge creation and transfer in nanotechnology, this study advances the discourse on the role of universities in the knowledge economy.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5278], "author_name_tesi": "Prabhu, Radhika ", "last_name_ssi": "Prabhu", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Radhika", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Roger Lewis Geiger", "Patrick T Terenzini", "James Fredericks Volkwein", "Robert M Hendrickson", "Mosuk Chow"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Roger Lewis Geiger, Committee Chair", "Patrick T Terenzini, Committee Member", "James Fredericks Volkwein, Committee Member", "Robert M Hendrickson, Committee Member", "Mosuk Chow, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["technology transfer", "knowledge creation", "interdisciplinarity", "nanotechnology", "academic spinoffs"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Therapeutic targeting of chemotherapy-resistant colorectal cancer stem cells with p73- and TRAIL-based small molecules", "id": "28936", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12256", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-01-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) tumors contain a rare population of self-renewing stem cell-like cells (CRCSCs) that contribute to tumor maintenance and therapy resistance. Therapeutic targeting of CRCSCs could improve treatment response and prolong patient survival. \n\nThe endogenous TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) protein selectively induces cell death in cancer cells while sparing normal cells. Small molecule ONC201/TIC10 induces TRAIL-mediated cell death in cancer cells via transcription factor Foxo3a, which is activated by dual inhibition of Akt and ERK. ONC201/TIC10 is currently being tested in phase I/II clinical trials for patients with advanced cancer. This study investigates whether the potent anti-tumor effect of ONC201/TIC10 in CRC involves targeting CRCSCs. ONC201/TIC10 depletes CRCSC markers and prevents chemotherapy-resistant CRCSC-mediated self-renewal in colonosphere assays and xenograft tumor initiation studies in mice. ONC201/TIC10 significantly induces cell surface TRAIL in CRCSCs. ONC201/TIC10-mediated anti-CRCSC effect is significantly blocked by the TRAIL sequestering antibody RIK-2, overexpression of Akt and Foxo3a knockdown. The identification and demonstration of CRCSCs as a target of ONC201/TIC10 provides an innovative biomarker that could be monitored in the clinic.\n\nTumor suppressor p53 is frequently mutated or inactivated in CRC. In contrast, p53 family member p73 is rarely mutated in CRC and p73 activation elicits p53-like tumor suppression. p53 restoration is known to target CRCSCs, but p73 restoration in CRCSCs has not been examined. This study investigates the effects of small molecule prodigiosin-mediated p73 activation on CRCSCs. Prodigiosin reduces chemotherapy-resistant CRCSC-mediated colonosphere formation and xenograft tumor initiation. Mechanistic studies reveal that prodigiosin increases the levels of p73 and reduces levels of the oncogenic N-terminally truncated isoform \u0394Np73 in CRCSCs. Accordingly, p73 knockdown or \u0394Np73 overexpression suppress prodigiosin-mediated CRCSC inhibition. Moreover, prodigiosin increases levels of the transcription factor c-Jun, a regulator of p73 and \u0394Np73. c-Jun knockdown attenuates prodigiosin-mediated \u0394Np73 downregulation, p73 activation and cell death. These findings have previously unrecognized implications for the use of p73 activating therapeutics and \u0394Np73 inhibition for targeting CRCSCs.\nTogether, these results demonstrate that potent small molecules targeting CRCSCs via tumor suppressive pathways such as p73 and TRAIL are a viable potential approach for robust and durable cancer therapy.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11642], "author_name_tesi": "Prabhu, Varun Vijay", "last_name_ssi": "Prabhu", "middle_name_ssi": "Vijay", "first_name_ssi": "Varun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wafik S El Deiry", "Charles H Lang", "Hong Gang Wang", "Edward Joseph Gunther"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wafik S El Deiry, Dissertation Advisor", "Charles H Lang, Committee Chair", "Hong Gang Wang, Committee Member", "Edward Joseph Gunther, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["stem cell", "cancer", "p73", "p53", "TRAIL", "small molecule", "ONC201"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "EFFICIENT COMPUTATION OF FREQUENCY RESPONSE OF MULTI-DEGREE OF FREEDOM NON-LINEAR VIBRATIONAL SYSTEM", "id": "14173amp6495", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14173", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Frequency sweep problems occur in several applications of structural dynamics, acoustics and structural acoustics. In general, the evaluation of a frequency response function involves finding solution to a large-scale system of coupled equations defining a vast system. Hence finding solutions to frequency response functions for a large range of frequencies is computationally exhaustive. However, the established method of interpolation techniques can be implemented to reduce the cost of computation. So far, several techniques of interpolation techniques have been successfully implemented in systems involving large-scale coupled linear equations.  This thesis proposes implementation of Pad\u00e9\u2019s interpolation technique in a large-scale nonlinear system. More specifically, this thesis focuses on the additional computational efforts required in finding solution to frequency sweep problems of large nonlinear systems when compared with large linear systems. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the mentioned approach are demonstrated with solutions to frequency sweep problems for a single and two degrees of freedom of nonlinear systems.
