This exclusion is reinforced by the fact that youth have no formal right to political participation in the United States and their rights in schools are not coextensive with those given to adults in schools. This study is an examination of the work of one organization partnering with high schools to support the use of youth-adult partnership as a tool for school reform focused on changing the positioning of youth within schools and to expand their role in educational decision-making. Using an embedded case study design focused on the organization Youth and Adults Transforming Schools Together, an intermediary organization, and the work of its partner schools, the study explores how youth-adult groups pursue promoting change from their position within schools and how they navigate the intersection of their work with other types of reform discourses and pressures within schools. This work draws on 21 interviews, observations, and documents collected in 2012 as part of a ten-school evaluation of the YATST program, as well as 31 interviews, four months of observation, and documents collected as part of two in-depth case studies of Pinewood High School and Maple Valley High School\u2019s YATST groups. The study finds that, in trying to create change from inside schools, groups must be more concerned with discerning and meeting the needs of all the various groups they wish to involve in the change process rather than single-mindedly focusing on advocating for their goal. In pursuing a \u201cgrassroots leadership of care\u201d, the groups have to make key compromises and strategic decisions about whose needs they will choose to meet in the event that groups\u2019 needs conflict, and decisions about how to communicate the purpose of their work in language that is not easily co-opted by other existing educational reform discourses. I discuss the implications of these findings both for the work of researchers and practitioners interested in the expansion of student voice and youth organizing for school reform, as well as how this contributes to our understanding of the nature of schools as organizations. A central conclusion of the study is that the \u201cwhy\u201d of student voice in schools matters and adds a much needed multi-dimensionality to the question of how to best integrate student voice practices within schools that moves beyond the single dimension of authenticity.

This work was begun by performing cultivation studies on sediment from ODP Site 1230. I then continued to examine the cultivability of Bacteria to determine if depth, lithology or interstitial water chemistry had an effect on the ability to recover isolates at ODP Site 1229, which had two distinct sulfate/methane transition zones (SMTZ). Using Site 1228 for comparison, at Site 1229, the cultivation of bacteria was negatively affected within the SMTZs where sulfate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is expected to occur. The shipboard direct cell counts were highest in the SMTZs, presumably because the cells obtained energy from AOM. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization was used to distinguish between members of the archaeal and bacterial domains and found that the archaeal population is highest within these SMTZs, making up to 98% of the hybridized cell count. The carbon isotopic composition of these individual archaeal cells was then analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry and showed that they were isotopically heavy (average \u00ce\u00b413C ~ 20\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0). These cells were hypothesized to be isotopically light, since Archaea within seep AOM environments have been shown to uptake isotopically light methane as their biomass. However, upon further inspection of the sediment carbon budget, these deeply buried SMTZ Archaea appear to use methane as an energy source, but not a carbon source, and the cells appear to be heterotrophic. In order to continue the examination of the microorganisms in this sediment, especially the Archaea and their genomic potential, I performed a metagenomic analysis from the sediments at Site 1229. From this metagenome, it was determined that Archaea are indeed the dominant microbial population at depth, using small subunit ribosomal RNA genes as in-silico biomarkers. Through these approaches, I have been able to unearth an interesting relationship between Bacteria, Archaea, and the geochemistry of these sediments and uncover clues about a previously unknown and unexpected metabolism of methane oxidation.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2672], "author_name_tesi": "Biddle, Jennifer Frances", "last_name_ssi": "Biddle", "middle_name_ssi": "Frances", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jean Elnora Brenchley", "Christopher Howard House", "James Gregory Ferry", "Allen T Phillips", "Ming Tien"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jean Elnora Brenchley, Committee Chair", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Member", "James Gregory Ferry, Committee Member", "Allen T Phillips, Committee Member", "Ming Tien, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microbiology", "biogeochemistry", "archaea", "ocean drilling program", "FISH-SIMS", "metagenomics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Periodic Publishing And Rhetorical Time:\nthe Birth And \"death\" Of The Newspaper", "id": "24808", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11007", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Social, cultural, and technological processes are speeding up every year, such that the lived experience of the \u201cpace of life\u201d has changed drastically.

The field of rhetoric and composition does not have a theory of time robust enough to explain or analyze the phenomenon of social acceleration.  This dissertation proposes an expanded rhetoric of time, building upon existing theories of time (such as Kairos, chonotopes, and other tools used to understand the temporal aspects of the rhetorical situation), and expanding the focus of rhetoric to include the epistemological view of time: the ways in which context, social convention, and technology/publication medium shape how audiences perceive and make sense of time. This project investigates a specific case, as a focal point for unpacking the value of an epistemological view of time: the birth (and death) of the newspaper\u2014and, through that case, the larger concept of periodicity.  I argue for an expanded understanding of how publication systems and temporal qualities (such as periodicity) can shape audiences, and suggest that the field of rhetoric and composition as a whole has been too focused on \u201clocating\u201d the audience, and not cognizant enough of how audience members are positioned in time.\n \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10587], "author_name_tesi": "Biddle, Matthew ", "last_name_ssi": "Biddle", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cheryl Jean Glenn", "Cheryl Jean Glenn", "Stuart Selber", "John L Selzer", "Stephen Howard Browne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cheryl Jean Glenn, Dissertation Advisor", "Cheryl Jean Glenn, Committee Chair", "Stuart Selber, Committee Chair", "John L Selzer, Committee Member", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rhetoric", "Composition", "Time", "Chronotope", "Periodicity", "Seriality", "Newspaper", "Technology", "New Media", "Historiography"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Towards an integrated design making approach in architectural robotics", "id": "27238", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11967", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using industrial robots in creative design has generated a wide interest among designers, artists, and architects.

Of central concern is how a transnational memory of human rights gets articulated in discourses about international law, international juridical institutions, and humanitarianism. The International Criminal Court\u2014as an international legal institution that emerged out of the international human rights system as a permanent juridical body designed to bring to justice perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide\u2014figures as a key site for rhetorical inquiry into the study of transnational memory discourses. \nA central concern of this project is to examine how transnational memory discourses\u2014specifically transnational memory discourses of human rights\u2014are employed to rhetorically produce or challenge the constitution of trans/national subjectivities and communities. Drawing on four sites where advocates are waging rhetorical battles over the meaning, reach, and application of the International Criminal Court, the study examines not only the emergence or existence, but also the resistance to transnational memory discourses at various levels. Specifically, this study helps us better understand the kinds of political subjectivities and rhetorical communities produced by discourses about the signing / unsigning of the International Criminal Court\u2019s treaty (chapter two), advocacy promoting ratification of the treaty (chapter three), negotiations over the Court\u2019s design with regards to the inclusion of a gender perspective in the treaty (chapter four), and the application and invocation of the Court\u2019s principles in contemporary advocacy campaigns for an intervention in Darfur, Sudan (chapter five). \nWhile all four discourses composing this manuscript draw on transnational memory discourses and discourses that constitute transnational communities, the focus of this project is on the residual challenges that the discursive framework of the nation-state poses to transnational memory. As such, Memory Beyond Borders? provides insight into the rhetoric of advocacy campaigns seeking to produce and foster cosmopolitan attitudes and into those discourses attempting to resist it. Consequently, I contend that, while these discourses aid in constituting transnational subjectivities, they also serve as important sites for the articulation of nationalist discourses. That is, discourses that seem to be most explicitly directed toward transnationalism are also discourses that are heavily steeped in nationalist language and reproduce rhetorics of the nation-state.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3134], "author_name_tesi": "Biedendorf, Jennifer ", "last_name_ssi": "Biedendorf", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Communication Arts and Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Howard Browne", "Stephen Howard Browne", "Thomas Walter Benson", "James Hogan", "John Philip Christman", "Janet Wynne Lyon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Howard Browne, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Howard Browne, Committee Chair", "Thomas Walter Benson, Committee Member", "James Hogan, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Janet Wynne Lyon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rhetoric", "memory", "transnationalism", "cosmopolitanism", "International Criminal Court", "human rights", "nation-state", "conservative", "women\u2019s rights", "U.S. foreign policy", "Darfur", "genocide"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "EPITAXIALY STRAINED STRONTIUM TITANATE\n", "id": "6919", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4039", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Although SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB> is normally not ferroelectric at any temperature, predictions that predate this thesis based on thermodynamic analysis concluded that a biaxial tensile strain of order 1% would shift the paraelectric-to-ferroelectric transition temperature (<I>T</I><SUB>c</SUB>) of SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB> to the vicinity of room temperature.  In practice, uniformly straining SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB> or related perovskite ferroelectrics to such strain levels is challenging and hitherto unheard of.  Nonetheless, using epitaxy and the misfit strain imposed by an underlying substrate, I have strained SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB> thin films to percent levels far beyond where they would crack in bulk.  Epitaxial ferroelectric films are often grown to thicknesses greatly exceeding their critical values, resulting in undesirable relaxation toward a zero-strain state by the introduction of dislocations.  Dislocation densities of ~10<SUP>11</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> are common in epitaxial ferroelectric films grown on lattice-mismatched substrates, and the resulting inhomogeneous strain smears out the ferroelectric phase transition.  My approach to achieving the desired high strain levels in SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB> films to assess strain predictions made use of new substrates (DyScO<SUB>3</SUB> and GdScO<SUB>3</SUB>) that enabled the growth of uniformly strained SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB> films below, or at least far closer to, the critical thickness for relaxation. The resulting strained SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB> films have better structural perfection (narrower rocking curve widths) than the best bulk SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB> single crystals. These films have the narrowest rocking curves ever reported for any heteroepeitaxial oxide thin film (6.5 arc sec).\nModeling of ferroelectrics under these strain levels predicts dramatic shifts in the transition temperature and enhancement of the polarization. Indeed, in our strained SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB>, a ferroelectric state was induced with a Tc near room temperature. These films also exhibit a peak dielectric constant near room temperature of ~20,000, comparable to that seen at very low temperatures (~4 K) in bulk SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB>. Unexpectedly, the strained SrTiO<SUB>3</SUB> films exhibit a frequency dependence of their dielectric constant consistent with relaxor ferroelectricity. Due to the anisotropy in the in-plane strain, the polarization develops at different temperatures along two orthogonal in-plane directions indicating an anisotropy in the dielectric properties due to the orhorhombicity of the substrate. These results, illustrate that in thin films strain is a viable alternative to the traditional method of chemical substitutions for shifting <I>T</I><SUB>c</SUB> by large amounts.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4012], "author_name_tesi": "Biegalski, Michael David", "last_name_ssi": "Biegalski", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Darrell G Schlom", "Long Qing Chen", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Qiming Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Chair", "Darrell G Schlom, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thin Film", "Strontium Titante", "Strain", "Ferroelectric", "Relaxor", "Epitaxy"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "AMINO ACIDS AND INSULIN ARE BOTH NECESSARY FOR AN AMPLIFIED RESPONSE OF PROTEIN SYNTHESIS THROUGH THE MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN SIGNALING PATHWAY\n", "id": "9524", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2898", "abstract_tesi": "The regulation of cell growth and proliferation is compromised in many major human diseases and disorders in today\u2019s society.

To answer the aforementioned questions, past court opinions/cases, state statutes, and school policies were retrieved from the appropriate authorities (see Appendix K: The study in a nutshell). \nContrary to popular assumptions, the findings suggested that a great majority of the school districts mentioned in the selected court cases did not have any clear policy addressing cyber-bullying.

The location and therefore the nature of the collision of the Insular superterrane with North America remains controversial.  In southern Alaska, the suture zone between the WCT and North America consists of the Kahiltna assemblage, Jurassic-Cretaceous submarine fan deposits.  Structural investigation of the Kahiltna assemblage provides additional data on the kinematics of the collision and suggests an oblique collision with a significant component of right-lateral shearing.   The first study of the dissertation presents the results across a transect at the northern end of Broad Pass where the depositional and deformational history of three tectonostratigraphic units enables determination of the tectonic evolution of the suture zone.  The Reindeer Hills exposes m\u00e9lange units that include oceanic lithologies and represent a remnant of an accretionary complex that formed during subduction prior to the collision of the WCT.  Structures within the Kahiltna assemblage in the Talkeetna Mountains indicate oblique northwest-directed thrusting and right-lateral shear during the collision of the WCT.   The Jack River conglomerate, a fluvial clast-supported conglomerate unconformably overlies the Reindeers Hills melange and represents uplift, erosion, and deposition late in the collision.  The second study is on the other side of Broad Pass, in the southern Alaska Range, and consists of a composite transect across the Peters and Dutch Hills and Chelatna Lake.  Horizontal stretching lineations and steeply-dipping foliation indicate that deformation occurred during transpression as a result of an oblique collision.

While soluble boron allows for even reactivity control and more uniform fuel burn-up, maintaining uniform distribution of the boron is important to prevent localized transients. Transients that are caused by a local disturbance in the concentration of boron are classified as boron dilution transients. While many studies have been performed to study these types of transients, the choice of existing codes available to simulate soluble boron transport have required tradeoffs to be made. Popularly used system codes such as RELAP5-3D can only simulate one-dimensional boron transport with comparatively simple physical models which neglect important physical characteristics of boron transport in the fluid such as mixing due to cross flow between channels and turbulence effects. On the other extreme, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes are capable of modeling boron transport with very high fidelity, but most CFD codes still require a large amount of computational resources to simulate a realistic physical model.\n\nRecent work by members of The Pennsylvania State University, Department of Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering, Reactor Dynamics and Fuel Management Group has helped to fill this  capability gap. The result is an improvement to the Penn State version of COBRA-TF, PSU CTF by employing a newly developed boron tracking model. The resulting version of CTF is known as CTF-BTM. The implemented boron tracking model uses a Modified Godunov method to solve the boron transport field equation. Although the CTF boron tracking model was rigorously tested at the time it was developed, it has not yet been used in coupled thermal hydraulics and neutronics simulations, which is the aim of this study.\n\nThe objective of this study is to continue the validation and qualification of the boron tracking model used in CTF-BTM. This is accomplished by first coupling CTF-BTM to the nodal diffusion-based neutronics code NEM. Part II and Part III of the 2007 OECD / NEA MOX / UO2 Core Transient Benchmark are then used to validate the coupled code at Hot-Full Power (HFP) conditions and Hot-Zero Power (HZP) conditions. Close agreement to the benchmark solutions is achieved in both cases. \n\nBetween the boron tracking and non-boron tracking code versions, the results at HZP were nearly identical with a 0.01 ppm difference of predicted critical boron and a 0.33% deviation from the benchmark reference solution. At HFP conditions, the differences introduced by the boron tracking model were more obvious. The boron tracking model result produced a larger deviation from the benchmark reference solution with a 0.61% deviation versus a 0.02% deviation predicted by the non-boron tracking code version. It was concluded that this larger deviation from the benchmark reference solution was due to the fact that the boron tracking model provides a more realistic treatment of the boron transport behavior by allowing the boron concentration to change with moderator density changes and moderator void formation.\n\nAlthough a soluble boron transient benchmark was not available for this particular core model, a systematic approach is used to build upon the successful steady-state benchmarking of the coupled code. For transient verification, a series of steady-state calculations are first carried out to find the effective multiplication factor of the core at varying levels of coolant boron concentration. Using these data to predict the core reactivity change for a prescribed change in inlet boron concentration, a series of inlet boron concentration transient simulations are carried out. The core response to the boron transient is then compared to the predicted reactivity change. Of five cases simulated, it was found that smaller and more rapid changes in reactivity produced a result that more closely matched predicted reactivity. More gradual and larger changes in reactivity caused fuel heating or cooling to occur which introduced Doppler feedback effects. Although it proved difficult to produce transient simulation results that exactly matched predicted reactivity changes, deviations from predicted reactivity changes could be explained by changes in fuel temperature corresponding to changes in reactivity introduced by the change in coolant boron concentration.\n\nThis study then culminates in the execution of a postulated post-Small Break Loss Of Coolant Accident (SBLOCA) boron dilution accident (which is considered to be a reactivity insertion accident) and an accompanying sensitivity study. While the scenario is highly idealized in terms of initiating events and assumptions, it provides an example of one of the expected future applications of coupled CTF and three-dimensional neutronics codes in LWR simulations with the introduction of boron tracking capability.\n\nIn this culminating scenario, a series of simulations are executed where deborated condensate water slugs are inserted into the core. The slugs are formed in the steam generators by condensation following loss of coolant inventory sufficient to maintain natural circulation. In the natural circulation cases, a 1.16 m3 slug is assumed. Following formation of the condensate mass, natural circulation is assumed to resume, carrying the condensate slug into the core. The location of slug entry is varied from the core periphery to the core center along an expected path of travel in the lower plenum. It is found that, of the locations where the slug was expected to enter, the most limiting location was fuel assembly E3 (sub-channel 158). The limiting case was determined by the peak fuel enthalpy in the hottest fuel node, which in this case peaked at 76.61 cal/g. This is well below the enthalpy level expected to cause fuel damage which, for a reactivity insertion accident such as this, is expected to occur at 230 cal/g.\n\nAfter finding the limiting location of condensate slug entry in the natural circulation cases, the case is simulated again with the condensate slug entering the same location with the same volume, but at forced circulation conditions assuming actuation of the corresponding reactor coolant pump. As expected, the core response was more violent than exhibited in the natural circulation cases with a larger power excursion and peak fuel enthalpy of 543.99 cal/g. At this fuel enthalpy level, extensive fuel damage is expected. In the final simulation case, the forced circulation case is executed again, but with a 4 m3 condensate slug volume. The cross sectional area of the slug remains unchanged which gives the slug a longer length. In this case, the heating of the fuel occurred for a longer period of time due to the longer power excursion event. The peak fuel enthalpy in this case was 703.81 cal/g with extensive fuel damage expected.\n\nGiven the assumptions made in the boron dilution accident scenario simulation cases, the formulation used represents worst case boron dilution accident conditions due to the amount of approximations and simplifications used and the level of compensatory conservatism in the formulation. While many studies have been performed elsewhere on boron dilution accidents for currently operating Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) this study is one of few focused on boron dilution simulations in a PWR with a MOX/UO2 core.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8481, 8482], "author_name_tesi": "Biery, Mark Byron", "last_name_ssi": "Biery", "middle_name_ssi": "Byron", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Maria Nikolova Avramova, Thesis Advisor", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Reactor Core", "Coupled Code", "NEM", "CTF", "Boron", "Boron Tracking", "Mixed Oxide", "MOX", "PWR", "Dillution", "Transient", "Benchmark"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Exploring the Beliefs and Attitudes of Exemplary Technology-Using Teachers", "id": "6281", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4928", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-03-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this study was to describe exemplary technology-using teachers\u2019 beliefs and attitudes about teaching, learning, and technology use in education while uncovering the process of how these beliefs and attitudes are formed and are influenced by many contextual factors in the school culture. Finally, this study described how the exemplary technology-using teachers\u2019 beliefs and attitudes influenced their classroom practices with technology. In this study, exemplary technology-using teachers are defined as those who effectively integrate technology into their instructional practices in K-12 educational contexts. Furthermore, this study theorized about the contextual factors that influenced the development and sustainability of teachers\u2019 beliefs and attitudes. To date, little known research has focused on the process of how beliefs and attitudes are acquired and how they may influence technology use in the classroom as well as how they are influenced by the learning context. Moreover, no grounded theory methodological approach had previously been employed in a study of exemplary technology-using teachers\u2019 beliefs and attitudes related to instructional practices. The findings of this research have implications for professional development that would take into consideration a complex array of contextual variables that interact systemically. The insights gained from this study could be used to design teacher training (in-service and preservice) that helps foster technology use in effective and meaningful ways that could enhance student learning.\nThis study used a constructivist grounded theory approach (Charmaz, 2000) in order to develop an emerging theory from the data collected in partnership with the teacher participants. The study used multiple sources of data, including interviews, documents, physical artifacts, electronic data, memos (field notes), and direct classroom observations to achieve a triangulation of data (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). The findings of this study suggested that the teachers\u2019 beliefs and attitudes are consistent with their instructional practices and that supportive and resource-rich learning environments are important factors in the teachers\u2019 development and sustainability of effective technology integration practices. Another important finding suggested that that these exemplary technology-using teachers exhibited similar personal characteristics that are expressed in their learner-centered practices. There seems to be a strong connection between their exemplary technology use and their learner-centered beliefs, as well as between their attitudes and practices in learning contexts that value learner-centered beliefs and attitudes. Although the working hypotheses of this study mainly apply to the four school districts investigated, the insights gained from the study of exemplary technology-using teachers at these research sites may prove valuable in other contexts.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4905], "author_name_tesi": "Bigatel, Paula Mae", "last_name_ssi": "Bigatel", "middle_name_ssi": "Mae", "first_name_ssi": "Paula", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara L Grabowski", "Jill L Lane", "John Daniel Marshall", "Kyle Leonard Peck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara L Grabowski, Committee Chair", "Jill L Lane, Committee Member", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member", "Kyle Leonard Peck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["technology integration", "teachers' beliefs and attitudes"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Chemical Vapor Plume Detection Using the Schlieren Optical Method\n", "id": "8736", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5295", "abstract_tesi": "Every year, millions of people, vehicles, and packages pass through security checkpoints in the United States, and it is impossible to physically inspect them all for contraband.

It is cumbersome, however, to test all possible vapor sources for detectability so a quantitative method for predicting detectability was required.  A weak lens standard method was tested using a known refractive field (free convective boundary layer over a flat plate) and then used to develop methods for predicting detectability accurate to within 15\\% error.  Thermal effects that affect vapor sampling detection by changing plume buoyancy were experimentally investigated and found to predictable using simple theory.

My dissertation research focuses on identifying positive directional selection in response to high altitude hypoxia using independent, highland populations compared to low altitude control populations.  The high altitude populations of interest are those of the Andes and the Tibetan Plateau.  The low altitude control populations are from Asia, the Americas and Europe. Three major questions are addressed by this research: 1) Is there evidence for natural selection among populations of the Tibetan Plateau?  2) Is there evidence for natural selection among populations of the Andean Altiplano? 3) Do the Tibetan and Andean populations exhibit similarities or differences in genes or functionally different changes in the same genes involved in high altitude adaptation? In order to answer these questions, this project was divided into two distinct phases of research.  In part 1, candidate genes were identified and screened for evidence of positive directional selection using genome scan data generated from the Affymetrix Inc. 1-Mega WGA SNP Chip.  This phase was administered separately for the Andean versus the Tibetan populations and the results of the analyses compared.  By independently searching for signatures of selection in Andean populations versus Tibetan populations, this research identified similarities and differences in the genetic adaptive mechanisms of these two populations. Part 2 used admixture-mapping analysis to test for associations between selection nominated candidate genes identified in part 1 of this research with pregnancy related phenotypes collected at both high and low altitude in a population sample comprised of European and Bolivian women. By understanding how similar environmental pressures can result in either the same or different genetic adaptations, we will be better situated to understand the molecular basis for convergent human adaptations.

Previous work also showed that ligand activation of PPARb/d induces terminal differentiation and inhibits proliferation in primary keratinocytes. In the present studies, the effect of ligand activation of PPARb/d on skin carcinogenesis was examined using both in vivo and ex vivo skin carcinogenesis models. Inhibition of chemically-induced skin tumorigenesis was observed in wild-type mice administered the synthetic PPARb/d ligand GW0742, and this effect was likely the result of PPARb/d activation induced terminal differentiation. These effects were not found in similarly treated Pparb/d-null mice.  Ligand activation of PPARb/d also inhibited cell proliferation and induced terminal differentiation in neoplastic keratinocyte lines that represent different stages of skin carcinogenesis. The initiation stage of the chemically-induced skin cancer model can be replaced by introduction of the ras oncogene. Mutation of the Ha-ras allele by an initiator is a critical event in the initiation stage of the chemically-induced skin cancer model. To further characterize the molecular mechanisms by which PPARb/d inhibited skin carcinogenesis, a ras oncogene-induced neoplastic keratinocyte model was utilized. v-rasHa-induced neoplastic/ malignant transformation was exacerbated in Pparb/d-null keratinocytes when compared to wild-type keratinocytes, and this effect was likely the result of PPARb/d mediated induction of senescence and terminal differentiation and concomitant inhibition of cell proliferation. PPARb/d can also inhibit cell proliferation by modulating the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade, which is induced in the oncogenic ras model. Members of the MAPK signaling cascade are critical downstream effectors of Ras signaling. v-rasHa-induced neoplastic transformation of primary keratinocytes resulted in an enhanced activation of MAPK proteins in Pparb/d-null keratinocytes when compared to wild-type keratinocytes.  Oncogenic ras exerts its tumorigenic effects via several different downstream effectors. A major downstream effector of oncogenic ras signaling is COX2. To further characterize the chemotherapeutic efficacy of PPARb/d activation on skin carcinogenesis, the effect of PPARb/d ligand coupled with COX2 inhibitor on skin carcinogenesis was examined using both in vivo and ex vivo skin carcinogenesis models. Results from these studies suggest that combining PPARb/d ligands with other chemotherapeutic agents such as COX2 inhibitors could serve as powerful chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic tools against skin cancer. Overall, this dissertation provides evidence that targeting ligand activation of PPARb/d could improve the efficacy of current chemopreventive/ chemotherapeutic strategies for skin cancer.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4442], "author_name_tesi": "Bility, Moses Turkle", "last_name_ssi": "Bility", "middle_name_ssi": "Turkle", "first_name_ssi": "Moses", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Curtis John Omiecinski", "Gary H Perdew", "Adam Bleier Glick", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Peter John Hudson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Committee Member", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Adam Bleier Glick, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Chair", "Peter John Hudson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PPARb/d", "nuclear receptors", "v-rasHa-induced skin carcinogenesis", "chemically-induced skin carcinogenesis", "skin carcinogenesis", "PPARs"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "DESIGN OF A MULTI-SITE, MULTI-REGION MICRODRIVE NEURAL RECORDING SYSTEM", "id": "13574mwb5353", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13574", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-04-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Current neurophysiology tools for chronic recording experiments in small freely-behaving animals are not capable of driving electrodes to multi-site, multi-regional targets at different angles and with greater than two implant axes.\nHere, we present a novel microdrive system designed to address these limitations for studying distributed behavioral neural circuits. Our design decouples the surgical implantation of a guide cannula with placement of a flexible tube structure to create multiple, independent drive axes with set drive trajectories and electrode depths. The system leverages tight tube-cannula tolerances and geometric constraints on the flexible drive axis to ensure concentric alignment of electrode bundles within guide cannulas as they move through tissue. Acute experiments included targeting of three separated brain targets at radically different trajectory angles to demonstrate the accuracy of the drive axis placement method. Chronic recording experiments involved targeting and recording from three non co-localized and non-collinear cell groups in brainstem of rats. Data from these experiments included identification of multiple neuron discharge waveforms over multiple spatial points as electrodes were driven through tissue. Additionally, sleep-wake behavior correlates were identified using external sensing modalities supported by the microdrive design. This is the first reported instance of a microdrive capable of monitoring neural activity from simultaneous multiple targets along independently-angled trajectories from a single body structure.

Each of these complexes contains a lipoyl carrier protein (LCP) to which lipoic acid is tethered via an amide linkage to a conserved lysine residue.  In the glycine cleavage system, the LCP is H protein.  There are two ways by which the lipoyl cofactor can be synthesized by E. coli \u2013 free lipoic acid may be directly attached to a LCP by lipoate protein ligase A (LplA), or the sulfur atoms can be directly inserted into C6 and C8 of a fatty n-octanoyl chain attached to the LCP by lipoyl synthase (LipA).\nThe way in which LipA inserts sulfur atoms into unactivated, saturated carbons has been the subject of many recent biochemical studies.  It was determined that LipA contains two [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters essential in catalysis, each of which are ligated by three cysteines in two conserved motifs.  The first, harbored in a CX3CX2C motif, is found in members of the radical S-adenosyl-L-methioine (SAM) superfamily of enzymes and is responsible for donating an electron into the sulfonium of SAM yielding highly reactive 5\u2019deoxyadenosyl radicals.  In the case of LipA, two of these radicals are thought to abstract hydrogens from C6 and C8.  The second motif, CX4CX5C, is conserved only among lipoyl synthases and the [4Fe-4S] cluster housed therein is proposed to be the source of sulfur in the lipoyl product.  In support of this role are findings that both product sulfur atoms are sourced by LipA itself and both are donated by a single LipA polypeptide.  \nThe proposed mechanism of catalysis by LipA thus invokes carbon-centered substrate radicals at C6 and C8.  Direct evidence of these radicals has not yet been presented.  In an effort to spectroscopically observe these radicals, a number of substrates for LipA where synthesized with side chains capable of radical stabilization.  These side chains were attached to the H protein LCP with LplA and used in reactions with LipA.  When a 2,4 hexadienoyl-H protein substrate was used, an organic radical was readily observed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy supporting that carbon-centered radicals are on the LipA reaction pathway.\nAdditionally, if an Fe-S cluster is indeed the source of both sulfur atoms in the lipoyl product, free monothiolated intermediates should not be observed on the reaction pathway, but instead associated with LipA via a carbon-sulfur linkage to the Fe-S cluster.  In support of this, a crosslinked species has been identified and isolated containing LipA and an 8,8,8-2H3-octanoyl-H protein.  It is known that sulfur insertion at C6 precedes insertion at C8 and that there is a significant deuterium isotope effect at C8, making it likely that LipA and H-protein are crosslinked directly via a sulfur atom in one of the [4Fe-4S] clusters.  This species has been characterized by UV-vis, EPR and M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopies.  The unique signature produced is typical of a [3Fe-4S]0 cluster, which is a possible intermediate on the reaction pathway.  Iron and sulfide release have also been observed during LipA catalysis supporting that the cluster degrades following product sulfur donation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1838], "author_name_tesi": "Billgren, Elizabeth Star", "last_name_ssi": "Billgren", "middle_name_ssi": "Star", "first_name_ssi": "Elizabeth", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Squire J Booker", "Squire J Booker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Squire J Booker, Thesis Advisor", "Squire J Booker, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["glycine cleavage system", "H protein", "lipoamidase", "lipoate protein ligase A", "lipoyl synthase", "lipoic acid", "radical SAM superfamily"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "IT\u2019S THE HARMFULNESS, STUPID: IMAGES OF GOD AND THE ROLE OF CRIME PERCEPTIONS IN PERCEIVED CRIME SERIOUSNESS AND \nRECOMMENDED SENTENCING\n\n\n", "id": "9785", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "149", "abstract_tesi": "Perceived crime harmfulness and wrongfulness are used to predict perceived crime seriousness and recommended sentencing.

The conductance can measure interface states through an energy loss associated with charge exchange between the interface states and the silicon. Conductance measurements of the interface states between Ba0.7Sr0.3O and Si show energy loss peaks that can be modeled using a single relaxation time in contrast to interface states at the amorphous SiO2 / Si interface, and this is evidence that the interface states exhibit Bloch state characteristics and not localized interface state characteristics.

Although outsourcing provides many\nbenefits, it also makes the buyer more dependent to the outside firms and increases\nhis exposure to supply chain risks. This dissertation provides quantitative techniques\nto measure those risks and mathematical models to incorporate risks in\nsupply chain decision making. Outsourcing risks are grouped under two main categories:\noperational risks which represent risks due to day to day global supply\nchain operations and disruption risks which are related to rare, but catastrophic\nevents that may disrupt supply chains and cause heavier damage than the operational\nrisks. In this dissertation, we first present a general risk quantification\nscheme and a classification based on four major risk components: severity of impact,\nfrequency of occurrence, detection time and recovery time, and implement\nthis scheme to quantify disruption risks. Severity of impact is modeled using the\nGeneralized Extreme Value Distribution which is appropriate for modeling minima\nand maxima of rare events. Frequency of occurrence is modeled as a Poisson\nprocess. A Markov chain is used to model information propagation in supply\nchains and detection time is modeled using the mean first passage time concept.\nRisk recovery time is assumed to be exponentially distributed and a conceptual\nmodel to compute the parameter of the exponential distribution is also developed.\nAnother important issue in risk management is mitigation plans. Once a supplier\nfaces a disruption, the buyer should have an alternative strategy to follow. In\nthis dissertation, we propose two multiobjective mathematical models to optimally\ngenerate supplier assignment and mitigation plans under two different purchasing\nstrategies. The first strategy, called single sourcing, assumes that the buyer assigns\nan order for a product to one and only one supplier; that is, order splitting\namong suppliers is not allowed. The second strategy, called multiple sourcing, is\na generalization of the single sourcing model where the buyer can split an order\namong a predetermined number of suppliers. Both models consider four objectives:\nminimizing total cost, lead time and risk value, and maximizing quality of\npurchased items. The multiobjective models are solved using four variants of goal\nprogramming and their solutions are discussed.\nOperational risks are more common in supply chains and can be modeled using\ntraditional probability distributions. In this dissertation, we extend the multiobjective\nmathematical models developed earlier to stochastic programming models.\nUncertainty in customer demand and production capacity are assumed to cause\noperational risk. Initially, demand and capacity parameters are modeled as normal\nrandom variables and chance constraints are formed to include those stochastic\ndata in the mathematical models. Deterministic equivalents of those chance constraints\nare derived to numerically solve the models. When no correlation among\nrandom variables is assumed, the deterministic equivalent models are linear mixed\ninteger programs which can be solved efficiently using commercial optimization\nsoftware. If correlation is included, deterministic equivalent models become nonlinear\nmixed integer programs which are computationally more challenging. Alternative\nlinearization procedures are proposed to transform the deterministic equivalents\nof the nonlinear models to linear mixed integer programs. This results in\nan increase in the problem size. Deterministic equivalent models are also solved\nusing goal programming techniques. It is observed that the optimal solutions to\nthe deterministic models are infeasible to the stochastic models. This indicates\nthat previous supply chain decisions are no longer valid when uncertainty is considered\nin decision making. We also present a robust model where the normality\nassumption on demand and capacity random variables is removed. This robust\nmodel is valuable when the decision makers have information only on the mean\nand the variance of demand and capacity. The robust model is more conservative\nand provides poorer results compared to the stochastic models under normality.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5334], "author_name_tesi": "Bilsel, Ragip Ufuk", "last_name_ssi": "Bilsel", "middle_name_ssi": "Ufuk", "first_name_ssi": "Ragip", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "Soundar Kumara", "Vittaldas V Prabhu", "Douglas J Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arunachalam Ravindran, Dissertation Advisor", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Chair", "Soundar Kumara, Committee Member", "Vittaldas V Prabhu, Committee Member", "Douglas J Thomas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chance constraints", "multicriteria optimization", "Supply chain risk", "extreme vale distributions"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Synthesis, Structural Characterization, and Analysis of an Isostructural Bimetallic Cluster Series", "id": "13208srb306", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13208", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A series of thiol-protected metal nanoclusters of the formula Ag4M2(DMSA)4 (M=Ni, Pd, Pt) was synthesized. These clusters were synthesized by wet chemical methods and identified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The clusters were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, tandem mass spectrometry, computational methods, and single crystal x-ray diffractometry. These structural characterization techniques revealed that the series of clusters was isostructural as well as isoelectronic, meaning that any change in the cluster properties will predominately be the result of the shift in identity of the metal M down the periodic table. The properties of the cluster series as a whole were evaluated in terms of electronic structure and stability. A stepwise blue shift was found as the metal M was substituted down the periodic table. The stability of the clusters was found to be somewhat low when M=Ni, but higher for M=Pt and M=Pd, with the palladium cluster exhibiting exceptionally high stability. The synthesis of the cluster series significantly expands the diversity of existing thiol-protected nanoclusters, an important class of compounds. The observations of the shift in properties enhances the general understanding of the structure property relationships of these clusters, potentially helping to promote more rationally designed cluster synthesis in the future. \nDuring attempts to synthesize another cluster series to confirm the observed trends, a novel effect of nickel on an existing cluster synthesis was observed.  The addition of nickel to this existing synthesis did not create bimetallic clusters, but instead simply altered the size of the monometallic silver clusters synthesized. The origins of this effect were evaluated and may serve as another mechanism of size control in future cluster syntheses. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12888], "author_name_tesi": "Biltek, Scott Russell", "last_name_ssi": "Biltek", "middle_name_ssi": "Russell", "first_name_ssi": "Scott", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen", "Ayusman Sen", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "John V Badding", "James Hansell Adair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ayusman Sen, Dissertation Advisor", "Ayusman Sen, Committee Chair", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Member", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanocluster", "Silver", "Bimetallic", "Thiol Protected"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Implementation and Evaluation of a Software-based Power Virtualization Technique", "id": "17630", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8639", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As data centers grow in size and popularity, managing utilization of resources like power\nbecomes increasingly important due to rising costs.

Antibody products are administered at high doses since the volume that can be delivered by injection is limited. Although ultrafiltration systems are used for final formulation of essentially all high value recombinant products, it is often challenging if not impossible to achieve the very high final formulation concentrations required for monoclonal antibody products. The overall objective of this thesis was to study and fundamentally understand the ultrafiltration behavior of highly concentrated monoclonal antibody solutions. This included:  (1) evaluating the filtrate flux and maximum achievable antibody concentration during ultrafiltration of very high concentration (>200 g/L) antibody solutions, and (2) developing appropriate theoretical models to describe the ultrafiltration behavior in terms of independently measured biophysical properties of the antibody solution.\nThe osmotic pressure of a highly purified monoclonal antibody at concentrations up to 250 g/L was evaluated over a range of pH and ionic strength, and in the presence of specific excipients, using membrane osmometry. These data were used to calculate the second and third virial coefficients. The second virial coefficients were in good agreement with independent measurements from self-interaction chromatography using a newly developed approach to evaluate the column dead volume. The second virial coefficient was positive under all conditions, consistent with repulsive electrostatic interactions between the positively charged antibody molecules. In contrast, the third virial coefficients were negative reflecting the presence of short-range attractive interactions between oppositely charged domains on adjacent proteins.\nViscosity data were obtained over a wide range of protein concentrations, solution pH, ionic strength, and in the presence of different excipients. The concentration parameter in the viscosity correlation appeared to be well-correlated with the values of the third virial coefficient, consistent with the importance of short range attractive interactions. The viscosity and osmotic pressure data were incorporated in a modified concentration polarization model that accounts for the effects of intermolecular protein-protein interactions in the highly-concentrated antibody solutions as well as the presence of a back-filtration phenomenon arising from the large pressure drop through the tangential flow filtration module. This model was in very good agreement with experimental data and was able to correctly predict the maximum achievable protein concentration during batch ultrafiltration experiments conducted over a wide range of conditions. These results provide important insights into the factors controlling the ultrafiltration behavior for highly concentrated antibody solutions as well as a framework for the development of improved ultrafiltration systems for use in bioprocessing applications.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10470], "author_name_tesi": "Binabaji, Elaheh ", "last_name_ssi": "Binabaji", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Elaheh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney", "Andrew Zydney", "Themis Matsoukas", "Manish Kumar", "William O Hancock"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "Manish Kumar, Committee Member", "William O Hancock, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ultrafiltration", "Memebrane", "Concentration", "Formulation", "Monoclonal antibodies", "Biotechnology", "Purification"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Identification of novel catalytic strategies of small ribozymes", "id": "14710jzb254", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14710", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since their discovery in 1981, RNA enzymes, or ribozymes, have been of interest for their potential applicability for site-specific catalysis and pathogenic targeting. The class of small ribozymes, which are generally less than 100 nucleotides in the catalytic core, utilize an internal RNA 2\u2032OH group as the nucleophile in their self-cleavage mechanism, which results in 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate and 5\u2032OH termini. There have been nine classes of small ribozymes identified thus far, but the recent increase in discovery rate due to bioinformatic searches suggests that more will be found in the near future. The glmS ribozyme is one class of small ribozymes found in the untranslated region of Gram-positive bacteria. The ribozyme is unique in that it requires binding of a small molecule cofactor, glucosamine-6-phosphate (GlcN6P), for activity, making it a riboswitch-ribozyme. Previous biochemical studies have suggested a role for GlcN6P as a general acid-base catalyst in the glmS ribozyme self-cleavage mechanism. Structural studies support this finding and show that the GlcN6P binds in such a way that it is positioned to protonate the 5\u2032O leaving group and act as the general acid. \nIn addition, structural and biochemical studies support a role for an active-site guanine, G33, in the self-cleavage mechanism. Though G33 is found positioned in crystal structures to act as the general base, there is still uncertainty as to whether G33 acts directly as the general base or as a proton donor to the 2\u2032OH while some other moiety acts as the base. Studies from our lab in collaboration with Sharon Hammes-Schiffer\u2019s lab suggest that the pKa of G33 is shifted away from neutrality, supporting its role as a proton donor to the 2\u2032OH until either another moiety abstracts the proton from the nucleophile or nucleophilic attack by the 2\u2032OH proceeds enough for the pKa of the 2\u2032OH to be lowered and the proton to transfer to G33 (Zhang, S.; Ganguly, A.; Goyal, P.; Bingaman, J.L.; Bevilacqua, P.C.; Hammes-Schiffer, S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 784). We also probed the effect of a Mg2+ ion at the active-site of the glmS ribozyme in collaboration with the Hammes-Schiffer lab and found that although direct coordination with a non-bridging oxygen atom is detrimental due to electrostatic repulsion of the cofactor, obstruction of nucleophilic attack, and disruption of hydrogen bonding interactions, Mg2+ binding to the Hoogsteen face of could be beneficial to catalysis due to lowering of the pKa of G33 (Zhang, S.; Stevens, D. R.; Goyal, P.; Bingaman, J.L.; Bevilacqua, P.C.; Hammes-Schiffer, S. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2016, 7, 3984). The work in this thesis is geared towards uncovering new strategies that the glmS ribozyme, and small ribozymes in general, use in their catalytic mechanisms. \nChapter 2 is focused on understanding the multifunctionality of the GlcN6P cofactor in the glmS ribozyme using scissile phosphate non-bridging oxygen (NBO) atom (pro-RP and pro-SP) thio substitutions, which have traditionally been used to test for metal ion binding. Previous studies have suggested a role for the cofactor as the general acid in the glmS ribozyme self-cleavage mechanism. Large, normal thio effects in the holoribozyme (in the presence of GlcN6P) that are not rescuable by thiophilic metal ions suggest that the GlcN6P cofactor and other nucleobases help to align the active site for catalysis. A large, stereospecific inverse thio effect in the aporibozyme (in the absence of GlcN6P) suggests that the 1-hydroxyl group of GlcN6P prevents an inhibitory interaction between the 2\u2032OH and the pro-RP NBO atom. Additionally, thiophilic metal ion rescue in the aporibozyme with the RP and dithio substrates, the latter of which contains a sulfur substitution at both NBO atoms of the scissile phosphate, suggests the amine group of GlcN6P provides charge stabilization at the pro-RP NBO atom during self-cleavage. The experimental results presented in this chapter are supported by computations performed by Sharon Hammes-Schiffer\u2019s lab. This work demonstrates that RNA can compensate for its lack of structural diversity by recruiting exogenous organic cofactors, which contribute in myriad ways to ribozyme catalysis.\nThe focus of Chapter 3 is the mechanism behind activation of the glmS ribozyme through prevention of the 2\u2032OH to NBO inhibitory interaction observed in Chapter 2. A series of ribozyme variants are prepared where certain active-site guanines that contact the NBO atoms are changed to adenines and a deoxy GlcN6P analog is synthesized to probe the effect of deleting various hydrogen bond donors to the NBO atoms of the scissile phosphate. Thio substitutions are used in an unconventional way to probe hydrogen bonding within the active site. Thio substitutions in the background of single G32A, G57A, and 1-deoxy-GlcN6P variants show diminished normal thio effects for the thio substrates whose mutated atom contacts the varied moiety in the wild-type (WT) holoribozyme. However, upon double variation in a G57A+1-deoxy-GlcN6P ribozyme and a G57A aporibozyme, the RP substrate, whose mutated atom contacts G57 and GlcN6P in the WT holoriboyzme, shows a large inverse thio effect, similar to the inverse thio effect observed for the WT aporibozyme in Chapter 2. These results suggest that the glmS ribozyme has evolved an overdetermined set of hydrogen bond donors within the active-site to compete with the 2\u2032OH nucleophile. This in turn activates the nucleophile, which could be a general strategy for ribozymes.\nChapter 4 aims to unify our understanding of small ribozyme catalysis through the evaluation of catalytic strategy usage based on published crystal structures. Custom Python plugins are used to probe small ribozyme crystal structures for their use of the in-line nucleophilic attack (\u03b1), charge stabilization at the NBO atoms (\u03b2), deprotonation of the 2\u2032OH nucleophile (\u03b3), and protonation of the 5\u2032O leaving group (\u03b4) strategies enumerated by Breaker. Results presented in this chapter reveal that evidence for these strategies is found primarily at the scissile phosphate and not at other phosphates throughout the ribozymes. Furthermore, this work suggests two additional strategies used by the small ribozymes for activation of the 2\u2032OH nucleophile: (1) acidification of the nucleophile through hydrogen bond donation to the 2\u2032OH (\u03b3\u2032) and (2) release of the 2\u2032OH from inhibitory interactions through hydrogen bond donation to the NBO atoms (\u03b3\u2032\u2032), the latter of which was investigated in Chapter 3. These findings reveal the conservation of catalytic strategies across small ribozymes and show how ribozymes selectively activate the 2\u2032OH nucleophile at the scissile phosphate.\nThe focus of Chapter 5 is the contribution of exogenous species on the self-cleavage of the glmS ribozyme. The glmS ribozyme is known to misfold and dimerize from work in our lab and other labs. In this chapter, Mg2+ ions, buffer molecules, and macromolecular crowders are found to enhance glmS ribozyme folding, catalysis, or both. These results suggest that the ribozyme might avoid misfolding and react efficiently in the cell by binding species in the cellular milieu. Additionally, a new method for detecting ionized guanines is presented in this chapter. This method involves chemical modification of the Watson-Crick face of guanines with glyoxal, a reagent that is sensitive to the ionization state of the guanine at the N1 position. Chemical probing with glyoxal in the glmS ribozyme reveals that the putative general base, G33, does not show enhanced reactivity, and in fact shows less reactivity, compared to other guanines in the ribozyme. This suggests that G33 does not have a pKa shifted towards neutrality and may in fact have one shifted away from neutrality, which is consistent with previous pH-dependent studies involving a guanine analog. This method could be applied to other small ribozymes to test for the presence of guanines with both down-shifted and up-shifted pKas. Overall, the work presented in this thesis provides mechanistic insight into novel catalytic strategies used by ribozymes and suggests that though these ribozymes may be limited structurally, they have developed ways of attaining catalytic proficiency.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15629], "author_name_tesi": "Bingaman, Jamie Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Bingaman", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Jamie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

Three experiments were conducted that addressed different questions about the effects of diet on oxidative stress.  Different population groups were studied using study-specific methodologies appropriate for each study to address research questions about the effects of diet on oxidative stress.  In the first study, the combined effects of dietary fat and iron status on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation were assessed using a pharmacologic dose of an iron supplement in women with low iron status (n=26).  The experimental diets were an average American diet (AAD) [36% of energy as fat; 15% saturated fatty acids (SFA)], and a Step 2 diet (26% fat; 7% SFA).  Subjects consumed each diet for three weeks before crossing over to the other diet. In addition, subjects received either a supplement containing 160 mg of ferrous sulfate (50 mg elemental iron) or a placebo twice daily [supplement group received a total of 320 mg ferrous sulfate (100 mg elemental iron) daily].  Subjects consumed the iron supplement or placebo throughout both diet periods.  After supplementation, serum ferritin increased in the supplement group compared to the placebo group (p = 0.008). Although iron status was improved by the high-dose iron supplement, LDL oxidative susceptibility was not affected.  However, measures of LDL oxidation were affected by diet.  As expected, lag time was increased after the women consumed the low fat, low SFA diet (p < 0.0001).  Rate of oxidation and total dienes were not affected by diet.  Therefore, the results indicate that although the low fat, low SFA diet significantly increased lag time, the addition of a therapeutic dose of iron did not affect all measures of oxidative stress measured despite improved iron status in subjects receiving the supplement.  Although supplemental iron did not act as an oxidant in this study, we conclude that a blood cholesterol lowering diet can be recommended for individuals treated with supplemental iron for poor iron status to decrease cardiovascular disease risk.  \nThe second study was designed to examine the effects of different dietary fatty acid profiles in subjects with moderately elevated total cholesterol levels (n=12 M, n=19 F) on plasma lipids and lipoproteins and oxidative stress.  Two experimental diets were studied that provided 30% calories from fat (either olive oil or NuSun\u201e\u00a7 sunflower oil contributed one half of the total fat), 8.3% vs. 7.9% SFA, 17.2% vs.14.2% MUFA and 4.3% vs. 7.7% PUFA (olive oil and NuSun\u201e\u00a7 sunflower oil, respectively), and 294 mg/day of cholesterol.  The olive oil and NuSun\u201e\u00a7 sunflower oil diets were designed to provide similar amounts of SFA whereas MUFA and PUFA levels varied, in a manner that reflected the fatty acid composition of the oils used in the respective diets.   The control diet was an average American diet (34% fat, 11.2% SFA, 14.9% MUFA, 7.8% PUFA).  Subjects consumed each diet for 4 weeks with a two-week compliance break before crossing over to the other diets. The NuSun\u201e\u00a7 sunflower oil diet significantly reduced total and LDL cholesterol compared to the AAD (p<0.0001 and p=0.0006, respectively) and the olive oil diet (p=0.005 and p=0.008, respectively).  In contrast, there was no effect of the olive oil diet compared to the AAD on plasma lipids and lipoproteins.  Although the experimental diets were lower in total fat, plasma triglycerides did not differ among the three diets.  No significant differences were observed due to diet for rate of oxidation, total dienes, lipid hydroperoxides or alpha-tocopherol.  However, lag time increased following the olive oil diet as compared to the NuSun\u201e\u00a7 sunflower oil diet (p=0.01). The greater total and LDL cholesterol lowering of NuSun\u201e\u00a7 sunflower oil diet could be explained by its higher PUFA content compared to the olive oil diet.  However, the increase in PUFA may also explain the reduction in lag time observed in response to the NuSun\u201e\u00a7 sunflower oil diet suggestive of increased oxidative susceptibility.  Despite increased oxidative susceptibility with the NuSun\u201e\u00a7 sunflower oil diet as measured by lag time, no differences in the resulting oxidation products (total dienes and lipid hydroperoxides) were observed suggesting no adverse effects of the NuSun\u201e\u00a7 sunflower oil diet on LDL oxidation.  Thus, since PUFA are important for cholesterol-lowering, foods that replace SFA should include a balance of unsaturated fatty acids, and not be disproportionally enriched in MUFA.  \nThe last study is an analysis of data collected from a clinical nutrition study conducted at Pennington Biomedical Research Center.  The objective was to evaluate the effects of two cholesterol-lowering, test diets on markers of LDL oxidation in individuals with different LDL phenotypes.  Previous studies have shown that a low fat diet may be preferable for individuals expressing LDL phenotype B and contraindicated for some persons with LDL phenotype A because they may convert to LDL phenotype B, the atherogenic LDL phenotype.  In this study, 87 normocholesterolemic men consumed an AAD that provided 37% of calories from total fat and 14% SFA; a Step 1 diet that provided 28% total fat and 9% SFA and a Step 2 diet that provided 24% total fat and 6% SFA.  Subjects consumed each diet for six weeks in a randomized crossover design.  \nTen subjects converted from LDL phenotype A to LDL phenotype B during the study.  The analysis included subjects who remained LDL phenotype A on all three diets (Stable A; n=55), those that remained LDL phenotype B on all three diets (Stable B; n=22), and a \u00a1\u00a7change\u00a1\u00a8 group (n=10) which converted from LDL phenotype A to LDL phenotype B in response to reductions in total and saturated fat.  Greater reductions in LDL size following the Step 2 diet were observed in the \u00a1\u00a7change\u00a1\u00a8 group compared to both the Stable A group (p=0.0002) and the Stable B group (p=0.0003).  At screening, both the Stable B group and the \u00a1\u00a7change\u00a1\u00a8 group had higher triglycerides (p<0.01) and lower HDL cholesterol (p<0.05) compared to the Stable A group.\nReductions in apolipoprotein A1 were observed in the Stable A and Stable B subjects following both the Step 1 and Step 2 diets compared to the AAD (p<0.0001).  The Stable A subjects had a further reduction in apo A1 following the Step 2 diet compared to the Step 1 diet (p=0.0006).  In addition, the \u00a1\u00a7change\u00a1\u00a8 group did not have a reduction in apo A1 but did have an increase in HDL3b on the Step 2 diet compared to the AAD (p=0.02) indicative of a shift to a more dense HDL particle.\n Lag time, total dienes and paraoxonase activity were not different between test diets. While no differences between groups was observed for lag time or paraoxonase activity, rate of oxidation and total dienes were increased in the \u00a1\u00a7change\u00a1\u00a8 group across all diets compared to the Stable A group (p=0.03 and p=0.02, respectively) and the Stable B group (p=0.06 and p=0.06, respectively).  \nTogether, the results of the third study suggest that with reductions in dietary fat typical of those that can be achieved in a clinical setting, a diet lower in total and saturated fat is not necessarily beneficial, nor is it detrimental for persons with LDL phenotype B.  Although a dietary reduction in total and saturated fat may induce some individuals with LDL phenotype A to switch to the more atherogenic LDL phenotype B, these individuals are not at increased risk in terms of lipid response.  However, reductions in LDL size and a shift to a more dense HDL particle are observed in these individuals as well as increases in rate of oxidation and total dienes. Compared to those who remain LDL phenotype A or B with dietary intervention, there appear to be metabolic differences in individuals who change LDL phenotype in response to changing diet.  Therefore, individuals who change LDL phenotype in response to diet appear to be at increased risk in terms of their overall lipid profile, LDL and HDL size and susceptibility of LDL to oxidation.\n\tCollectively, the results of these three studies show that different dietary interventions did not have substantive effects on measures of LDL oxidation in any of the population groups studied.  There were subtle effects noted on some measures of oxidative susceptibility that appeared to be due to varying the type and amount of dietary fat.  Decreasing total fat may favorably affect lag time and decreased rate of oxidation in individuals who convert from phenotype A to B in response to a Step 1 diet.  Altering type of fat also may have subtle effects on measures of oxidative susceptibility.  For example, a diet enriched in olive oil favorably affects lag time compared with mid-oleic sunflower oil.  It will be important in future studies to evaluate whether subtle changes in measures of oxidative susceptibility are of any clinical importance.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [84], "author_name_tesi": "Binkoski, Amy E.", "last_name_ssi": "Binkoski", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Amy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "John Elliot Beard", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Carla K Miller", "Sheila Grace West", "Richard John Frisque"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Chair", "John Elliot Beard, Committee Member", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Carla K Miller, Committee Member", "Sheila Grace West, Committee Member", "Richard John Frisque, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cardiovascular disease", "LDL oxidation", "dietary fat"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "The Medvedev and Muchnik Lattices of Pi-0-1 Classes", "id": "6092", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5556", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis contains four chapters including the Introduction. It is an analysis of the structure of the Medvedev and Muchnik lattices of non-empty Pi-0-1 classes of the Cantor space. These two structures are denoted P_M and P_w respectively. P_M and P_w are countable, distributive lattices each with a maximum and minimum element. <p>\n\n<b> Chapter 2  </b> has been accepted for publication in Mathematical Logic Quarterly [4]. Its main result is a proof that every finite distributive lattice can be embedded into P_M and P_w. Further, given any special Pi-0-1 subset, P, of the Cantor space, any finite distributive lattice can be embedded into P_M and P_w with its maximal element going to P. As a corollary, any non-zero Muchnik or Medvedev degree is the least upper bound of two strictly lower degrees. The result can be extended further for P_M. We show that given any P strictly greater than Q in P_M, any finite distributive lattice can be embedded between P and Q with its top element going to P. <p>\n\nThe second part of Chapter 2 deals with a model theoretic consequence of these theorems. Here it is shown that both P_M and P_w have decidable existence-theories. <p>\n \n<b> Chapter 3 </b>  also deals with lattice embeddings, but this time of countable lattices. We use similar techniques to those used in [17]. The two main countable lattices that we deal with are FD(omega) and FB(omega) - the free distributive lattice on countably many generators  and the free Boolean algebra on countably generators respectively. It is shown that, in P_M,  FD(omega) can be embedded below any non-zero element of the lattice. Similarly, we show that in the Muchnik lattice, FB(omega) can be embedded below any non-zero element. <p> \n\nThe second result is stronger as any countable distributive lattice can be embedded into  FB(omega), and this is not the case for FD(omega). We do, however, show that the distributive lattice of finite (co-finite) subsets of the natural numbers can be embedded into P_M below any non-zero element. <p>\n\n<b>Chapter 4 </b> examines the relationship between certain structural properties of Pi-0-1 classes and their Muchnik and Medvedev degrees. Two structural properties - \"smallness\" and \"very smallness}\" - are defined and examined. We show that the class of Pi-0-1 classes that contain a small (very small) subset forms a non-trivial proper prime ideal in P_w and P_M. We also look at the relationship between smallness, very smallness and the well-studied property of thinness. We show there are thin sets that are not very small and vice-versa as well as other results of this sort.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5547], "author_name_tesi": "Binns, Stephen Ernest", "last_name_ssi": "Binns", "middle_name_ssi": "Ernest", "first_name_ssi": "Stephen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mathematics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen George Simpson", "Richard Beech Mansfield", "William C Waterhouse", "Dale Jacquette"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen George Simpson, Committee Chair", "Richard Beech Mansfield, Committee Member", "William C Waterhouse, Committee Member", "Dale Jacquette, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Medvedev", "computability theory", "recursion theory", "Cantor space", "Pi-0-1", "Muchnik", "recursive functional", "small", "very small", "thin"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Current and Future Perceived Importance of Training and Development Competencies in a Selected Area Identified by Saudi Practitioners", "id": "28665", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12215", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The primary purpose of this quantitative study was to investigate the perceptions of training and development (T&D) practitioners from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) regarding the current importance of selected training and development competencies, as well as the perceived future (5 years hence) importance of these competencies.

Each white-rot fungus produces different enzymes, however, and it has been shown that co-culturing various species together in suspension can increase total enzyme production and yield better overall remediation.\nIn this study, the possibility of more efficient remediation of pulp and paper mill effluent was investigated by culturing the white rot fungi Phanerochate chrysosporium and Pleurotus ostreatus individually and together in a series of batch tests.  The fungi were immobilized on 1\u201d plastic Tri-pack balls in replicate, aerated batch reactors containing effluent from a local pulp and paper mill.  \nThe studies of P. chrysosporium alone indicate that it is able to remove 14-24% of COD, 15-30% of lignin, and 20-40% of color in unamended pulp and paper mill wastewater.  With added carbon and nitrogen, the efficiency of remediation was enhanced 2 \u2013 3 times, yielding removal of 50-60% COD, 70% lignin, and 40-50% color after only 7-14 days.  Similarly amended studies with P. ostreatus yielded removal of 60-80% COD, 50-65% lignin, and 30-50% color.  Co-culturing studies with the two fungi show high capacity for fungal growth and the overall remediation was increased 5-10% for COD, lignin, and color removal.

The resulting transverse piezoelectric coefficient, e31,f, is approximately -6 to -7 C/m2 for PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3.  This thesis describes the preparation of high quality PZT films, the nonlinearity in their dielectric and piezoelectric responses, as well as their patterning by reactive ion etching. \nTwo types of PZT films were prepared:  PZT films with mixed {001} and {111} orientation and those with strong levels of {001} orientation.  Dense polycrystalline PZT films on (111)Pt/Ti/SiO2/(001)Si substrates (with thicknesses from 0.28 to 4.40 \u00b5m) were obtained by optimizing the chemical solution deposition process.  Higher piezoelectric coefficients (about -12 C/m2) can be obtained if significant {001} orientation is achieved.  Thus, one goal of the research was to obtain {001} oriented PZT films on Pt-coated Si substrates.  In this work, PbTiO3 buffer layers were chosen due to good lattice matching with PZT films, and the strong propensity for development of {001} orientation.  The pyrolysis, crystallization steps, and lead excess addition of PbTiO3 buffer layers deposition were investigated.  Using a thin PbTiO3 buffer layer and controlled pyrolysis conditions allowed {100} oriented PZT films to be prepared.  The PbTiO3 buffer layer can be used over a full wafer to provide orientation.  Higher piezoelectric coefficients, e31,f of -14 and -10 C/m2 were achieved for {001} PZT thin films of 1.0 \u00b5m and 0.24 \u00b5m thickness, respectively using appropriate poling conditions. \nThe local and global domain wall contributions were studied by piezoelectric nonlinearity and dielectric nonlinearity in both {001}-textured PZT films and PZT films with mixed {001} and {111} orientation.  Band Excitation Piezoelectric Force Microscopy (BE-PFM) was shown to enable quantitative measurements of the local piezoelectric nonlinearity. It was found that films over the thickness range probed showed Rayleigh-like behavior.  4 &#956;m thick films were nearly uniform in their Rayleigh coefficient, suggesting that any heterogeneities in the response developed at lateral length scales below the resolution of the PFM measurement.  In contrast, thinner films showed significantly more patchiness in their response, so that fluctuations in behavior developed at a lateral length scale on the order of 0.6 to 2.5 micron.  These variations did not appear to be correlated directly with the surface topology.  The ability to detect lateral inhomogeneity in the nonlinearity of thinner films is likely to be a function of the volume probed in the measurement. Finally, it is hypothesized that the same population of domain wall contributes to the local and global nonlinearity.\n\tNanoindentation measurements were conducted in an attempt to distinguish 180\u00b0 and non-180\u00b0 domain wall motion in these films.  Non-180\u00b0 domain walls can be moved by both electrical and mechanical fields.  In contrast, 180\u00b0 domain walls can be moved by electric fields, but not by uniform stresses.  In PZT films with mixed {111} and {001} orientation, some ferroelastic wall motion took place during loading, at stress levels on the order of GPa.  The reduced elastic modulus is much higher on the unloading curve.  Thus, on unloading, it is believed that there is no contribution from mechanical softening associated with ferroelasticity.\nThe global polarization switching in polycrystalline, {001}-textured films on Si, and {001}-films on SrRuO3 / SrTiO3 was studied through first order reversal curves (FORC) in order to assess the Preisach distribution governing the switching behavior.  Then, the local polarization switching in polycrystalline PZT films was studied by using Switching Spectroscopy Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (SS-PFM).  Acquisition of multiple hysteresis loops allows polarization switching parameters including nucleation biases, coercive biases, and the amount of switchable response to be mapped in real space.  SS-PFM was studied on both bare PZT film surfaces and in capacitor structures (metal/ PZT film/ metal).  The capacitor structure shows the evolution of correlated switching of 102 \u2013 103 grain clusters with well-defined imprint and nucleation biases. A transition from a regime where the domain wall motion is over a short range to the formation of clusters to complete switching is observed.  The switchable polarization as a function of bias window allows the voltage dependence and spatial distribution of regions with reversible and irreversible wall motions to be mapped. \nThe final chapter of experimental work describes the patterning of PZT films for MEMS.  The ability to dry etch large depths of ferroelectric materials such as lead zirconate titanate is important in both microelectromechanical systems and in high frequency medical ultrasound transducers.  Dense Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 films (&#8805;1 &#956;m) were used to study the etching characteristics. The films were etched using an Inductively Coupled Plasma Reactive Ion Etcher (ICP-RIE) with a mixture of Ar and SF6 gas.  The variation of the etch rate with gas flow rate, source power, substrate holder power, and operation pressure and the uniformity of etching were investigated.   The maximum etch rate achieved was 0.31 \u00b5m/min. The electrical properties of PZT films directly exposed to the plasma after etching (&#949;r = 1300, tan&#948; = 3.29%, Pr = 29.8 \u00b5C/cm2, Ec = 39 kV/cm) are similar to the electrical properties of PZT before etching (&#949;r = 1400, tan&#948; = 4.35%, Pr = 27.1 \u00b5C/cm2, Ec = 32 kV/cm). Small changes in the minor hysteresis loops were found, suggesting that there may be a small change in the internal field induced by the patterning process. In addition, sidewall angles of > 80\u00b0 have been achieved using a non-contact method (laser writer) for the lithography step.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4969], "author_name_tesi": "Bintachitt, Patamas ", "last_name_ssi": "Bintachitt", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Patamas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Susan Trolier Mc Kinstry", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Thomas R Shrout", "Christopher Muhlstein", "Thomas Nelson Jackson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof Susan Trolier Mc Kinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Chair", "Thomas R Shrout, Committee Member", "Christopher Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ferroelectrics", "Piezoelectric", "Thin Films", "Piezoelectric Force Microscopy (PFM)", "MEMS", "Lead Zirconate Titanate PZT"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Designing for the Space Environment Via Trade Space Exploration", "id": "10563", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1290", "abstract_tesi": "The focus of spacecraft design has long been on cost efficiency.  Many options exist that will fulfill the mission requirements, but the best design is the one which maximizes the return while minimizing the cost.  The industry has a number of ways to optimize the design process, but this thesis suggests a new method.\nThe traditional design process includes consideration of space environment effects, but normally these are secondary concerns.  This work brings these effects \u2013 specifically contamination, radiation, and atomic oxygen attack \u2013 to the forefront of the process.  An Earth-sensing satellite in low Earth orbit is used as a design example.\n A basic model is developed in Microsoft Excel, and includes thermal, power, optics payload, and thruster/propellant design issues.  In the thermal model, a simple lumped approximation is used, and the effects of thruster plume contamination on the thermal control surfaces are accounted for.  The solar panel lifetime is estimated using a model for degradation due to the radiation environment as well as thruster contamination.  The optics payload performance is a function of contamination and spacecraft glow.  Atomic oxygen erosion of the selected thermal control material is also used as a lifetime estimate.\nThe model allows the designer to input somewhat high-level design variables, such as the dimensions of the spacecraft, and the selection of thermal control material and thrusters; and calculates estimates for relative lifetime, cost, and performance.  It is then linked with Penn State\u2019s Applied Research Lab\u2019s Advanced Trade Space Visualization (ATSV) software, which allows designers to use the \u201cdesign by shopping\u201d paradigm by providing visual steering tools.  This setup is used to search for optimal designs in several different cases.  \n\tThe model generally converges in less than 10,000 designs, with many cases converging in fewer than 5,000.  The visualization tools easily show trends such as the primary limiting lifetime factor (solar arrays), the effects of a limited propellant budget, and the groups of materials which are best suited for this problem.  In addition to showing the single optimal design, the Pareto sets are shown as well.  The industry trend towards smaller spacecraft is reflected here, with most preferred designs on the order of 30% of the maximum allowable volume.  Feasible designs are found for most thermal materials, and all propellant options.\nThis combination of designing specifically for space environment effects and using visual steering to aid in the optimization process creates a new way for designers to approach the problem.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1279], "author_name_tesi": "Binz, Christopher ", "last_name_ssi": "Binz", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Spencer", "David Spencer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Spencer, Thesis Advisor", "David Spencer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["trade space exploration", "space environment", "design optimization", "atsv", "spacecraft design", "visual steering"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Quantitative thermodynamic understanding of the solid-liquid interface during heterogenous catalysis", "id": "19730", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9309", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We use isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to study the binding mechanism that occurs at the solid-liquid interface during heterogeneous catalyst synthesis.  The study focuses on Pt transition metal complexes (TMC) that adsorb via an electrostatic interaction onto an oxide support (\u03b3-Al2O3 and SiO2).  The electrostatic driving force is controlled by adjusting the solution pH during synthesis further from its point-of-zero charge (PZC).    \u03b3-Al2O3 was chosen due the amphoteric nature of the surface potential (PZC = 7.8), which will allow for a similar pH range to be probed for anion (chloroplatinic acid (CPA)) and cation (tetraammineplatinum(II) nitrate (TAP)) adsorption.  SiO2 was chosen because it is an acidic support (PZC = 4.4) which will allow a large pH range for TAP adsorption.  For all synthesis conditions, we analyze the thermodynamic parameters (K, \u0394G, \u0394S, and \u0394H) and the binding stoichiometry to determine the effect of changes in the electrostatic driving force on final catalyst properties.  We correlate the thermodynamics with Pt nanoparticle size and loading through the use of high-energy x-ray diffraction with a PDF analysis over a temperature range of 323 \u2013 773 K, determine the final nanoparticle size after reduction at 623 K with the use of chemisorption, and elemental analysis to determine weight loading.   For CPA and TAP adsorption close the PZC, we observe minimal TMC uptake that exhibit small exothermic enthalpies, which correlate to larger supported nanoparticles.  As the solution pH is shifted further from the PZC, the supported nanoparticles are smaller with a higher weight loading and an increased exothermic enthalpy.  There is also a large difference noticed between the adsorption enthalpy for CPA and TAP.  We suggest this could be due to the formation of covalent bonding between the CPA and surface hydroxyl groups once CPA is in the diffuse layer or could be associated with larger hydration sheath interactions between TAP and the surface.  We also observe the free energy of adsorption remains relatively constant through these studies, suggesting there are compensating entropic contributions associated with interactions between the hydration sheaths and surface water groups.   \nWe also use ITC to study the adsorption of Rh(OH)3 nanoparticles onto early transition metal oxides.  This study highlights the ability of the ITC to elucidate specific binding enthalpies from a complex reaction network through the use of the Born-Haber cycle.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9113], "author_name_tesi": "Binz, Jason Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Binz", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Martin Rioux Jr.", "Darrell Velegol", "Themis Matsoukas", "James Hansell Adair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Darrell Velegol, Committee Member", "Themis Matsoukas, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["heterogeneous catalysis", "catalyst synthesis", "strong electrostatic adsorption", "isothermal titration calorimetry"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Wind Estimation and Closed-loop Control of a Soaring Vehicle", "id": "19978", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9507", "abstract_tesi": "Birds possess a remarkable ability to harvest energy from the atmosphere, allowing them to traverse vast regions foraging for food.

Archaeal ANerobic MEthaneotrophs (ANME) oxidize methane in anoxic sediment, and prevent methane, a potent greenhouse gas from reaching the atmosphere.  This process is hypothesized to take place via the reversal of methanogenesis based on culture and genetic evidence.  Coenzyme F430 is a tetrapyrrole used in the last step of methanogenesis, and likely enables the first step in reverse methanogenesis.  Therefore, the presence and concentration of F430 in association with AOM serves as a test for the reverse methanogenesis pathway in sediment.  \n\nIn chapter 2, F430 was extracted, quantified, and isotopically analyzed in methanotrophic sediment from Hydrate Ridge and the Santa Monica Basin (west coast U.S.A).  The greatest amounts of F430 were recovered where sulfide, sulfate, and methane concentration profiles indicate the greatest AOM activity in the sediment.  These sediment horizons also contained the highest ANME-2 aggregate counts.  F430 was found to be isotopically distinct from methane and archaeal lipids, but similar to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). In the Hydrate Ridge and Santa Monica sediment F430 was ~60\u2030 enriched in 13C relative to archaeol lipids. \n\nIn chapter 3, the dual assimilation of methane and DIC is explored with a series of stable isotope labeling experiments using sediment from Hydrate Ridge and the Santa Monica Basin.  In experiments using Hydrate Ridge sediments, we observed the 13C label from DIC assimilated into archaeol, while in experiments using Santa Monica Basin sediment the 13C labeled from DIC and methane was assimilated into both F430 and lipids. The amount of DIC assimilated into F430 and lipids ranged from ~50% to 100%, with between 0% to 20% of carbon coming from methane.  Due to the amount of labeled methane that is oxidized to DIC we cannot be sure if methane is directly assimilated or first oxidized to DIC.  Coenzyme F430 was also only recovered from experiments where methane was added to the headspace, strengthening the link between F430 and methanotrophy.  \n\nLittle Salt Springs is a sinkhole in Florida where a red biofilm in the euxinic water column produces large amounts of bacterialhopanetetrol (BHT), 2-methyl bacterialhopanetetrol (2-MeBHT) and 2-methyl anhydrobacterialhopanetetrol (2-MeAnhydroBHT).  The amount of each BHT produced varies seasonally and between years, with the geochemical cause of this variability unknown.  In chapter 4, a red cyanobacteria isolated from this biofilm was cultured under a number of different geochemical conditions in an attempt to identify possible causes for variability in bacteriohopanepolyols (BHP) production.  No single geochemical control was identified as amounts of BHT and 2-MeAnhydroBHT were similar in all experiments.  Future experiments should explore what effects oxygen concentration, fixed nitrogen species, trace metals, microbial community and combinations of different conditions have on BHP production.

Decisions made by surrogates affect not only their individual situations, but have implications for the health care system and society as a whole.  The majority of work on surrogate decision-making has been related to chronic or slow progressing illness but little is known about the experiences of surrogate decision-makers during critical illness.  \n\nMethods: A prospective qualitative approach was used based in grounded theory.  The setting included four intensive care units (ICUs) in a large university medical center.  The sample consisted of 19 surrogate decision-makers (as identified on patient record) of critically ill patients in the acute phase of critical illness who were unable to make independent health care decisions.  Participants were interviewed on enrollment and 14 days later, or at the time the patient for whom they were making decisions was transferred from the ICU if sooner than 14 days.  The interviews explored participants\u2019 cognitive and moral decision-making processes. An interview guide framed the interviews, though participants were encouraged to speak freely.  Data analysis was completed per the tenets of grounded theory, beginning with the first interview and concluding when data saturation was achieved.\n\nResults:  A model of the Process of Surrogate Decision-Making in Critical Illness was developed, grounded in the data, to explain the process of surrogate decision-making in the context of acute critical illness.  Four major themes emerged from the data and are included in the model:  Understanding the Patient\u2019s Values and Preferences, Acquiring Health Care Knowledge, Considering Family Perspectives, and Recognizing Personal Values.  The overarching theme that explains the connections between the themes is Integration. \n\nConclusions:  The findings of this study bring a new perspective to surrogate decision-making during critical illness, intertwining the cognitive and moral processes.  Through integration of the four identified themes, the surrogate decision-maker reaches decisions based on a broader understanding of the factors involved.  Nurses are well positioned to assist surrogates through this process during the critical illness of a family member.  The model of the Process of Surrogate Decision-Making in Critical Illness forms a basis for education of nurses and other healthcare providers and the development of intervention studies to optimize the results of the surrogate decision-making process.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14764], "author_name_tesi": "Birriel, Barbara A", "last_name_ssi": "Birriel", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Barbara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nursing", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa Kitko", "Lisa Kitko", "Judith Hupcey", "Susan Loeb", "Michelle McGowan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa Kitko, Dissertation Advisor", "Lisa Kitko, Committee Chair", "Judith Hupcey, Committee Member", "Susan Loeb, Committee Member", "Michelle McGowan, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Surrogate decision-making", "critical care", "bioethics", "ethics"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF A BOVINE UTERINE EPITHELIAL CELL LINE AND THE EFFECTS OF PREGNANCY ON GENE EXPRESSION IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD LEUKOCYTES", "id": "19056", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8987", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "   The uterine endometrium is vital for the production of a complex array of molecules, which make up uterine histotrophe. Uterine histotrophe is essential to the maintenance of a successful pregnancy. Currently there are no in vitro models available to study bovine uterine epithelial cells. Therefore, the objective of the first study presented here was to develop and characterize an immortalized bovine uterine epithelial cell line to investigate the effects of conceptus signaling on the maternal endometrium. Primary epithelial cells were transfected with human papillomavirus (HPV) genes E6 and E7 and human telomerase (hTERT). Cells were treated with interferon tau to study the effects of conceptus signaling on maternal endometrium. In response to IFNT, MX1 and MX2 transcripts were detected in bEP cells, however, neither MX1 nor ISG15 were detectable by Western blotting in bEP cells when treated with interferon tau (IFNT). Further investigation is needed to understand why mRNA, but not protein, for these interferon-stimulated genes was stimulated by IFNT.\n\tInterferon tau is a type I IFN produced by the elongating conceptus and is the signal for maternal recognition of pregnancy in ruminants. IFNT acts to up-regulate the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), both locally in the uterus and systemically in peripheral blood leukocytes. A study was conducted to examine the effects of recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) treatment and pregnancy status on peripheral ISG expression. Several IFN- stimulated genes were quantified in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) in pregnant (BPP), bred, non-pregnant (BNP), and pregnant but open on Day 60 (BPL) cows 19 days after insemination. Cows were either treated with a single injection of 325 mg of rbST at AI (Single \u2013rbST; S-rbST) or two sequential injections of rbST at AI and 14 days later (Double-rbST; D-rbST). Steady-state concentrations of mRNA for MX1, MX2, ISG15, OAS and RTP4 were quantified and examined for effects of status and treatment. Status effects for MX1, ISG15, and RTP4 were detected in BPP compared to BNP for control cows not treated with rbST. Also, there was a decrease (P\u22640.05) in MX1 expression in BPP cows receiving two injections of rbST compared to other treatment groups. When outliers were removed from the BNP group and parity removed from the model, an increase in ISG15 expression was detected in D-rbST cows compared to other treatment groups. Results indicate that rbST injections caused a differential expression of ISG but did not affect the ability to detect pregnancy status in PBL on Day 19. Therefore, factors that affect pregnancy rate in dairy cows can be detected by assaying ISG transcript expression in PBL as early as 19 days after insemination. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8823], "author_name_tesi": "Birt, Alyssa Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Birt", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Alyssa", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Troy Ott", "Joy Lee Pate", "Francisco Javier Diaz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Troy Ott, Thesis Advisor", "Joy Lee Pate, Thesis Advisor", "Francisco Javier Diaz, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Immortalized", "Bovine", "Endometrium", "Uterus", "Pregnancy", "ISG", "Peripheral blood", "IFNT"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Efficiency in Auctions and Public Goods Mechanisms\n\n\n", "id": "6395", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4830", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Efficient allocation of scarce resources is one of the central themes in economics. The essays in this thesis approach two aspects of this problem. In the first essay I consider the problem of the efficient provision of a public good with congestion in a setting with asymmetric information. Mailath and Postlewaite (1990) and Rob (1989) show that in such a setting an efficient, budget balanced and individually rational mechanism for provision of pure public goods does not exist. Many public goods are not pure public goods, that is, they are excludable and to some extent congested. I show that when congestion is taken into account, in a wide class of economies it is possible to construct a mechanism that produces the public good efficiently, balances the budget ex-post and satisfies individual rationality constraints. \n\n\nIt is known, see Krishna and Perry (2000), that a desired mechanism exists if and only if the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism results in an expected budget surplus. In the VCG mechanism each consumer is levied a tax equal to the externality that she exerts on the rest of the society. When a good is pure public a consumer pays only if she is pivotal. When a public good is congested even a consumer that is not pivotal exerts an externality on the others. This externality is stronger when congestion is higher, hence the payment from such a consumer \"increases with the level of congestion.\" On the other hand, when congestion is higher, fewer consumers are given access to the good, hence fewer consumers pay at all. Due to this trade off, it is too simplistic to say that the VCG mechanism runs an expected budget surplus if the good is congested enough. There are simple examples where the VCG mechanism runs an expected budget surplus with less congested good and a deficit with more congested good.\nI show that it is most likely that the VCG mechanism runs a surplus if the level of congestion is neither too high nor too low. I present a simple and intuitive condition on the parameters of the economy that guarantees that the VCG mechanism results in an expected budget surplus. As a result, in these economies, there also exists an efficient, incentive compatible, ex post budget balanced and individually rational mechanism.\n\n\nThe second and third essays deal with the problem of efficient allocation of private goods. In the second essay, written jointly with Serguei Izmalkov, we study efficiency properties of a single-object irrevocable exit English auction in the setting with interdependent and asymmetric values. Maskin (1992) shows that the pairwise single-crossing condition is both necessary and sufficient for efficiency of the English auction with two bidders. Our paper extends both Maskin's result and the single-crossing condition to the English auction with N-bidders. The pairwise single-crossing imposes the following: if starting from a signal profile where the values of two bidders are equal and maximal we slightly increase the signal of one of the bidders, her value becomes the highest. \nWe introduce the generalized single-crossing condition (GSC) a fairly intuitive extension of the pairwise single-crossing. GSC requires the following: if starting from a signal profile where the values of a group of bidders are equal and maximal we slightly increase the signals of a subset of the group, no bidder outside of the subset can attain the value higher than the maximal value attained among the bidders from the subset. Generalized single-crossing both implies the pairwise single-crossing and reduces to it in the case of two bidders. We show that GSC is both necessary and sufficient condition for existence of an efficient equilibrium in the English auction with N-bidders.\n\n\nIn the third essay I deal with the setting of interdependent and asymmetric values and consider the class of auctions that possess an efficient ex-post equilibrium. An equilibrium is ex-post if none of the bidders wants to change his strategy after all the information that was private before the auction is revealed to her. Intuitively, this seems to be a significant restriction on the strategies, so that, hopefully, auctions that have an efficient ex-post equilibrium have few other ex-post equilibria. This intuition is, in fact, incorrect. I show that every auction that implements efficient allocation in ex-post equilibrium also has a continuum of inefficient ex-post equilibria in undominated strategies.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4807], "author_name_tesi": "Birulin, Oleksii ", "last_name_ssi": "Birulin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Oleksii", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vijay Krishna", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Tomas Sjostrom", "Susan H Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vijay Krishna, Committee Chair", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member", "Tomas Sjostrom, Committee Member", "Susan H Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["efficiency", "budget balance", "voluntary participation", "auctions", "mechanism design", "public goods"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Superinfection Exclusion and Competition between Multiple High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Types during A Co-Infection", "id": "r781wg00k", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12832", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent of cervical cancer and is associated with other anogenital and orphopharyngeal cancers.  Recent epidemiological studies show that up to 50% of women are concurrently infected with more then one HPV type.  However, it is unclear whether multiple HPV types interact on a molecular level during a co-infection or whether superinfection exclusion takes place.  Also unknown, is whether multiple infections leads to an increased risk of developing cervical cancer.\n\nThe objective of this thesis was to investigate the molecular interaction between two high-risk HPVs \u2013 HPV16 and HPV18 \u2013 during a co-infection.  We specifically wanted to explore whether there were any mechanisms of superinfection exclusion that prevent a single cell from being simultaneously infected with more then one HPV type or whether there was any competition between multiple types during a co-infection.  Here, we show that HPV16 and HPV18 are able to infect and replicate within the same cell.  However, the infectivity of HPV18 is reduced by approximately 50% in the presence of HPV16, indicating some level of superinfection exclusion or competition between the two types. \n\nWe further analyzed the point during the viral lifecycle during which there was a block or competition.  When cell surface events are bypassed, and the genomes are co-transfected into cells, the viruses are equally able to replicate and transcribe their genomes, indicating that there is no block/interference at the steps of genome replication and transcription.  However, when cells are co-infected, we show that HPV16 efficiently blocks the ability of HPV18 to bind to the cell surface/ECM.   Previous studies have revealed that different HPV subtypes have different requirements for HSPGs as well as furin for cellular entry.  Therefore, we analyzed the localization of initial attachment to cells and the time it took for each virus to enter cells.  HPV16 is able to bind directly to the cell surface, whereas HPV18 predominantly initially binds to the ECM.  Additionally, HPV16 appears to enter cells faster than HPV18, which we attribute to the previously described differences. \n\nOur data demonstrates that, like other virus types, some level of superinfection exclusion is likely present for HPV.  Additionally, we demonstrate that native HPV16 and HPV18 differentially attach to and enter cells, indicating that what proves true for one HPV type should not be assumed true for all HPV types.  Further, this sets a framework for future research investigating HPV co-infections.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12149], "author_name_tesi": "Biryukov, Jennifer L", "last_name_ssi": "Biryukov", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Craig Matthew Meyers", "David Spector", "Neil David Christensen", "Todd Schell", "Alistair J Barber"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Craig Matthew Meyers, Dissertation Advisor", "David Spector, Committee Chair", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "Alistair J Barber, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["human papillomavirus", "co-infection", "superinfection exclusion", "HPV16", "HPV18"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Complement and Antibody-mediated Enhancement of Red Blood Cell Invasion by Plasmodium falciparum", "id": "27577", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12235", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Plasmodium falciparum malaria is responsible for close to one million deaths worldwide each year.  The Plasmodium life cycle involves invasion of hepatocytes and erythrocytes.  The repeating cycle of erythrocyte invasion and destruction is the root cause of the morbidity and mortality brought about by the pathogen.  Development of naturally acquired immunity against the parasite is an extremely slow process taking years to decades to develop, and it does not seem to result in sterile immunity.  Attempts to develop a vaccine to block erythrocyte invasion have proven unsuccessful.  Clinical data have demonstrated the development of a strong humoral immune response in vaccinated individuals.  Although antibodies raised against vaccine antigens inhibit invasion in vitro in the presence of heat-inactivated (HI) serum, there is poor efficacy in vivo.  The reasons for this discrepancy are unknown. A number of studies, in both humans and animal models, have shown that the complement cascade is activated during malaria infection. \n\nWe hypothesize that complement activation and opsonization of merozoites enhances complement receptor 1 (CR1)-mediated invasion of erythrocytes.  If we are correct, the parasite can hijack this arm of the innate immune response for its own benefit, avoiding or diminishing the efficacy of antibodies.  We tested this hypothesis by studying the effect of mouse monoclonal anti-merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) antibody 5.2 (mAb5.2) and antibodies from recipients of a merozoite vaccine (MSP142) for their ability to enhance or inhibit invasion in a complement-dependent manner. We carried out invasion assays with the above antibodies with appropriate controls in fresh or HI serum, or in complement-depleted or reconstituted serum. In addition, we tested the relevance of the CR1 pathway by inhibiting with sCR1.  Invasion of erythrocytes was enhanced by fresh serum relative to 3 min, 5 min, or 30 min HI serum.  Furthermore, addition of mAb5.2 to fresh serum increased the enhancement effect.  Addition of C2 and Factor B to 3 min HI serum, but not to 30 min, rescued the enhancement of invasion in the presence of mAb5.2.  Likewise, Compstatin, a C3 specific inhibitor, and sCR1 negated the enhancing affects of mAb5.2 in fresh serum but not that of fresh serum alone.  Furthermore, soluble CR1 had invasion inhibitory activity in 3 min HI serum that was independent of antibody.  Purified antibodies from MSP-1 vaccinees showed inhibitory activity in C3/C4 inactivated serum, but inhibition was drastically reduced in C3/C4 reconstituted serum.  Passive transfer of anti-P. berghei antibodies into wild type mice enhanced parasitemia in an inverse dose-dependent manner. In addition, C3-deficient mice showed decreased parasite growth relative to wild type mice.\n\nIn addition, we utilized erythrocytes from individuals with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), which results in the absence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored receptors, in an effort to identify novel receptors utilized by the parasite for erythrocyte invasion. We found that PNH RBCs were invaded less effectively than wild type RBCs. Therefore, we carried out growth and invasion assays with anti-GPI erythrocyte receptor antibodies against six potential targets with appropriate controls in fresh or HI serum, or in complement-depleted or reconstituted serum.  We identified Semaphorin-7A (SEMA7A) as a potential erythrocyte receptor that may interact with complement in promoting erythrocyte invasion by merozoites. \n\nOur results demonstrate that merozoites can highjack the complement system to their own advantage in a number of ways. Activation of the complement cascade via the classical pathway can allow merozoites to bind to CR1 and invade via this pathway. In addition, in the absence of antibodies, activation of the mannose binding lectin pathway by default may allow merozoites to bind to other complement receptors on the RBC that mediate invasion.  Such mechanisms could explain or contribute to the low efficacy of vaccine-induced anti-merozoite antibodies to block invasion in vivo. These findings are of great importance to the efforts to develop a merozoite blocking vaccine.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11623], "author_name_tesi": "Biryukov, Sergei S", "last_name_ssi": "Biryukov", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Sergei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Microbiology and Immunology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jose A Stoute", "David Joseph Spector", "Neil David Christensen", "Todd Schell", "Channe D Gowda"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jose A Stoute, Dissertation Advisor", "David Joseph Spector, Committee Member", "Neil David Christensen, Committee Member", "Todd Schell, Committee Member", "Channe D Gowda, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Malaria", "Complement", "Plasmodium falciparum", "Innate immunity", "Erythrocytes"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The Application of Intramolecular [4+3] Cyclizations of 2-(trialkylsilyloxy)enals to the Synthesis of Englerin A and Analogs", "id": "16075", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7966", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The synthesis of the trans-perhydroazulene substructure of the natural product englerin A is described.

However, studying electron transfer processes in these systems directly can be difficult. In order to understand the fundamental processes in these systems, charge transfer (CT) and mixed-valence (MV) compounds have been used extensively as model systems to study the basics of electron transfer reactions under various conditions. This dissertation uses steady-state spectroscopic analyses to determine how structure affects electronic coupling and charge delocalization in several MV and CT systems that are of interest for understanding the fundamental processes that occur in organic devices. In Chapter 2, we find that the introduction of an ethylene bridging ligand between two bis(alkoxy)benzene redox sites increases the intramolecular electronic coupling when compared to the system in which the redox active sites are directly connected, despite an increase in distance. We quantify the increase in coupling as a function of both distance and steric effects. Chapter 3 focuses on the systematic investigation of how van der Waals forces control the electronic coupling in non-covalently bound organic mixed-valence naphthalene diimide dimers, and we find that, in general, as the van der Waals forces in the intermolecular complex increase so does the electronic coupling. Chapter 4 focuses on the analysis of the CT band in donor-acceptor charge-transfer liquid crystals (DACLCs) and uses resonance Raman spectroscopy to investigate the phase-dependence of the charge transfer transition and the vibrational modes that are associated with this transition.

This is of interest because a supercritical water reactor design is envisioned as one of the Generation IV reactors. Three alloys were studied: 9CrODS, HCM12A and HT9. 9CrODS is an oxide dispersion strengthened steel that contains nano-particles of Y2O3. These alloys were corroded in the supercritical water corrosion loop at the University of Wisconsin at two temperatures (500\u00baC and 600\u00baC) during different exposure times. Both 9CrODS and HCM12A were corroded at both temperatures during 2, 4 and 6 weeks. HT9 was only corroded at 500\u00baC during 1 and 3 weeks. \nThe oxide microstructure was characterized by using synchrotron microbeam X-ray diffraction and fluorescence using the APS synchrotron facility at the Argonne National Laboratory. This technique has a high spatial resolution enabling a detailed analysis of the oxide structure. Both elemental information with the fluorescence data and microstructural information with the diffraction data are acquired simultaneously.\nThe three alloys had similar oxide microstructures with Fe3O4 in the outer oxide layer, with a mixture of FeCr2O4 and Fe3O4 in the inner oxide layer, and with a diffusion layer often containing chromium rich oxide precipitates. The oxide precipitates in the diffusion layer were mainly FeCr2O4 in the 600\u00baC samples, but in the 500\u00baC samples the diffusion layer contained few oxide precipitates and was a solid solution of oxygen ahead of the oxide. The corrosion resistant interface was characterized by chromium enrichment in the fluorescence data and the presence of Cr2O3. In most cases this interface was the inner oxide-diffusion layer interface. Nevertheless, in the 9CrODS 600\u00baC 4 and 6 week samples, the corrosion resistant interface shifted to the diffusion layer-metal interface, where a uniform Cr2O3 ribbon had formed. The presence of such a Cr2O3 ribbon is thought to have an important role in the oxidation resistance of the material.\nHCM12A and HT9 had similar corrosion behaviors but 9CrODS formed the most protective oxide even though it contains the least amount of chromium. The enhanced corrosion resistance of the 9CrODS is likely due to the fine dispersion of the Y2O3 nano-particles.

This understanding is acquired through the analysis of the oxide microstructure using microbeam synchrotron radiation diffraction and fluorescence associated with electron microscopy (both SEM and TEM). \n\nThe microbeam synchrotron radiation diffraction and fluorescence technique provides unique microstructural data of the oxide. This technique simultaneously probes elemental and phase information step by step with a sub-micron spatial resolution throughout the oxide layers. Thus we were able to locate specific phases, such as Cr2O3, at specific locations in the oxide layer, mainly the interfaces. The electron microscopy complemented this analysis by imaging the oxide layers, to yield detailed information on the oxide morphology. All the alloys studied exhibited the same three-layer structure with an outer layer containing only Fe3O4, an inner layer containing a mixture of Fe3O4 and FeCr2O4, and a diffusion layer containing a mixture of chromium-rich precipitates (Cr2O3 and FeCr2O4) and metal grains. By analyzing samples with various exposure times, we were able to follow the evolution of the oxide microstructure with exposure time.\n\nTo obtain the corroded samples, several corrosion experiments were performed: some in supercritical water (at 500\u00c2\u00b0C and 600\u00c2\u00b0C) and one experiment in 500\u00c2\u00b0C steam. The test in steam was undertaken to obtain more data points in the kinetic curves, because we thought the corrosion in steam and supercritical water at the same temperature would result in similar kinetics. This turned out not to be the case and the samples in supercritical water corroded much faster than those in steam (1.5 to 2 times faster). Additionally, during these corrosion tests a marker experiment was performed with the deposition of micrometric palladium markers on the surface of some samples prior to oxidation. The markers were found at the outer-inner layer interface, consistent with a corrosion mechanism of outward migration of iron to form the outer layer and inward migration of oxygen to form the inner layer. The discrepancy between the SCW and steam environments suggests that the outward migration of iron may be the rate-limiting step.\n\nA detailed study of the oxide advancement was performed using the TEM by analyzing the inner and diffusion layer structure. Energy-filtered TEM images were acquired to analyze the micrometric and nanometric distribution of elements in these layers. Such images from the inner layer revealed the presence of localized chromium enrichment regions associated with the presence of pores. Additionally, an iron-chromium nanometric segregation was observed and may be associated with the mixture of Fe3O4 and FeCr2O4. In the diffusion layer, small nanometric chromium-rich oxide particles were seen within metal grains.\n\nThe (Fe,Cr)3O4 spinel oxide has an inverse spinel structure as Fe3O4 but becomes normal spinel as FeCr2O4, thus the structure changes depending on the chromium content. Additionally, the spinel structure was analyzed using the ligand theory and showed that chromium does not migrate and that the main diffusing species is the Fe2+ ion. \n\nCalculations of the amount of iron leaving the inner layer showed that this amount accounted for the amount of iron necessary to form the outer layer, thus no dissolution of oxide in SCW is observed. Additionally, the differences in oxidation behavior in steam and SCW suggest that the rate-limiting step for the corrosion of ferritic-martensitic steels is the iron outward migration. The iron migration is driven by the gradient in the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio and is associated with a flux of vacancies in the opposite direction. The vacancies coalesce into pores at the inner-diffusion layer interface.\n\nThese results are presented and discussed in this thesis and were used to analyze the oxidation behavior of ferritic-martensitic and ODS alloys in SCW. Finally, a mechanism of oxide advancement is proposed.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12793], "author_name_tesi": "Bischoff, Jeremy ", "last_name_ssi": "Bischoff", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jeremy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur T.

Change was quantified through two eras of satellite-derived land cover data separated by nine years, 1992 and 2001.  Validation of these data revealed accuracies between forest and non-forest classes greater than 80%, 83% and 88%, respectively.  Forest change that occurred between the two eras was analyzed to determine our ability to detect forest change and its impacts on avian habitats.  Mapping revealed increasing forest fragmentation patterns, in some regions, that are potentially detrimental to avian communities.\n\nForest fragmentation change was tracked using a variety of geographic information system (GIS) techniques.  Changes among patch size and between edge and core forest were calculated.  Forest cover was classed by collecting contiguous forest patches into size classes ranging from 1 ha to 25,000 ha for each era.  Areas that changed patch class were analyzed.  More than 60% of small patches (< 10 ha) converted to non-forest while total number of patches in small classes, nevertheless, increased at the expense of patch classes between 25 ha and 100 ha.  In contrast, larger patch classes, > 500 ha, tended to remain in their original class.  Core versus edge conversion was similar with 34% of previously edge forest changing to non-forest.\n\nEcological landtype association (LTAs) boundaries were selected to analyze forest change because their size (mean = 1078 ha) and ecological relevance.  Fragmentation change metrics were calculated within LTAs.  When mapped, most forest change metrics illustrated clear regional fragmentation trends.  Frequently, LTAs clustered together showing regions undergoing similar fragmentation.  Notable regions include north-central Pennsylvania, showing evidence of fragmentation decrease, and northeastern Pennsylvania showing patterns of increasing fragmentation. \n\nTo understand the impacts of forest fragmentation on natural habitats, breeding bird survey (BBS) data were used to create forest and grassland guilds to test avian responses.  Avian guild richness responded predictably to fragmentation change for all guilds and the grassland area sensitive guild had significant results.

The added pressure effects produced by the booster have long been disregarded.  To fill this gap, the present research addresses the booster charge effects when employed in a composite-charge arrangement at the laboratory scale, i.e. with explosive charges in the gram-range.  The composite charge consists of a well-characterized spherical booster charge surrounded by a concentric, spherical \u201ccandidate material\u201d shell charge.  By way of composite-charge explosive characterization, the radial-TNT equivalent of the candidate explosive material is determined through the removal of the known booster effects.  Laboratory-scale air-blast explosive tests are conducted using digital high-speed shadowgraph visualization to measure the radial propagation of the explosively-driven shock wave as a function of time.  An ultra-high-speed digital camera is also incorporated to measure the radial propagation rate in close proximity to the explosive charge itself.  Profiles of peak shock wave pressure vs. shock wave radius are determined from the temporal history of the shock wave propagation.  Initial experiments are performed with both booster and shell charges made of characterized pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), in order to determine the booster relationship within a composite-charge arrangement.  Using peak shock wave pressure vs. shock wave radius profiles, a procedure is developed to remove the booster effects from the composite-charge signature, yielding the sole effects of the shell material, as if it were detonated alone.  Method verification is performed by comparing results to previous homogeneous explosive material characterization.  A second booster removal procedure is developed based upon the explosive impulse rather than peak shock wave pressure.  Temporal pressure histories of the shock wave pressure decay are measured using piezoelectric pressure transducers.  Explosive impulse is calculated from these pressure histories through knowledge of the peak shock wave pressure, the positive pressure duration, and the waveform parameter describing the pressure decay.  Composite explosive charges are numerically modeled to verify the proposed peak shock wave pressure and explosive impulse booster removal procedures.  Finally, this composite-charge characterization procedure is extended to the characterization of smokeless powder (SP), cyclotrimethylene trinitramine (RDX), and cyclotetramethylene tetranitramine (HMX).  The results demonstrate the ability to successfully test and characterize insensitive explosive materials, requiring a booster charge for detonation, at the laboratory scale by way of composite charges.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4237], "author_name_tesi": "Biss, Matthew Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Biss", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary Stuart Settles", "Gary Stuart Settles", "Richard A Yetter", "Panagiotis Michaleris", "Daniel Linzell", "Michael J Hargather"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary Stuart Settles, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary Stuart Settles, Committee Chair", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Member", "Panagiotis Michaleris, Committee Member", "Daniel Linzell, Committee Member", "Michael J Hargather, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Laboratory-scale", "Booster charge", "Composite explosive charges", "Shadowgraph visualization", "TNT equivalent"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "For a Better Life: The Integration of Thai Marriage, Family, and Labor Migrants in Iceland", "id": "14433", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7188", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent decades Thai women began coming to Iceland for a better life, whether by marrying an Icelandic man, reuniting with Thai family already in Iceland, or through employer sponsorship.  These three means are termed the \u201causpices of migration.\u201d  By 2006, however, Iceland\u2019s policy of prioritizing workers from the European Economic Area made it nearly impossible for Thais and other non-Europeans to secure a work permit, leading to an increase in marriage-based migrations among this group.  The main objective of this dissertation is to examine how the auspices of migration affect host country language skills and economic integration, the power and influence of Thai women in homes shared with Icelandic men, and reciprocal exchange networks between Thais and Icelanders.  858 Thai adults were living in Iceland at the time of the study, including 665 women.  Fieldwork among this population took place over a period of 22 months.  In my analyses I focus on qualitative interviews with factory workers, participant-observation in the Thai community, and quantitative survey data from a sample of 109 Thai women.\n\nResults have shown that women who came to Iceland under the auspices of an employer had the best Icelandic language skills of all three groups of women, and as a result they also had better economic outcomes than those who came by other means.  Additionally, employer-sponsored migrants reported belonging to more egalitarian households with less-traditional divisions of labor and more equitable distributions of decision-making power.  In contrast, migrants sponsored by an Icelandic spouse reported the highest levels of cross-ethnic exchanges when compared to those who came to Iceland under other auspices.  Migrants sponsored by employers were far more likely to be limited to Thais-only in their exchange networks.  These results suggest that the auspices of migration matter, and that Icelandic labor and migration policies constrain migrants\u2019 choices in reaching Iceland.

The two studies that comprise this dissertation used data from the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health (Add Health) to examine whether parents\u2019 differential treatment of their offspring is associated with sibling\u2019 academic outcomes.  Parents\u2019 differential treatment was measured by subtracting younger siblings\u2019 from older siblings\u2019 reports of parenting.  Study 1 used 1008 sibling dyads to examine whether mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 differential treatment of their offspring on two parenting aspects (involvement in education and educational expectations) was associated with two outcomes for older siblings: their educational expectations during adolescence and their odds of starting college during emerging adulthood.  This study also examined whether racial-ethnic group moderated these associations.  Raw correlations in the overall sample showed positive associations between these sets of variables, but regression models suggested that parents\u2019 differential treatment was not associated with older siblings\u2019 achievement outcomes after controlling for their individual reports of parenting.  Correlation analyses also suggested that the link between parents\u2019 differential treatment and siblings\u2019 achievement outcomes may be stronger for whites than for other racial-ethnic groups.  Regression models including controls for older siblings\u2019 individual reports of parenting suggested a tendency for blacks to be more likely than whites to show negative associations between differential treatment and older siblings\u2019 achievement outcomes.  Study 2 was motivated by national data showing that females are now more likely than males to attend college.  This study used 565 mixed sex sibling dyads to examine whether maternal differential treatment during adolescence could be associated with the odds of just sisters vs. just brothers in the family starting college during emerging adulthood.  After controlling for other demographic variables, the gender gap favoring sisters was larger in black families than in other racial-ethnic groups and was larger in two parent biological family structures than in other family structures.  A multinomial logistic regression model that controlled for family background factors and differences between siblings\u2019 academic achievement suggested that maternal differential treatment in educational expectations was associated with the odds of just sisters vs. just brothers in the family starting college.  Overall, the findings suggested that differences in academic achievement may be more strongly linked than parents\u2019 differential treatment to sisters\u2019 and brothers\u2019 differential odds of starting college, but suggest the possibility that parenting factors could play a small role.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2832], "author_name_tesi": "Bissell-Havran, Joanna Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Bissell-Havran", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Joanna", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eric Loken", "Eric Loken", "Susan Mc Hale", "Hobart H Cleveland Iii", "Rayne Audrey Sperling", "Aleksandra B Slavkovic"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eric Loken, Dissertation Advisor", "Eric Loken, Committee Chair", "Susan Mc Hale, Committee Member", "Hobart H Cleveland Iii, Committee Member", "Rayne Audrey Sperling, Committee Member", "Aleksandra B Slavkovic, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["emerging adulthood", "siblings", "adolescence", "academic achievement", "parenting"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Minimum Hellinger Distance Classification of Underwater Acoustic Signals\n\n", "id": "10271", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "666", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Passive source classification in the underwater environment is a challenging problem in part because propagation through the space- and time-varying medium introduces variability and uncertainty in the signal.  Acoustic propagation codes can predict received fields accurately but they are sensitive to input environmental parameters which cannot be known exactly.  This uncertainty in environmental knowledge used in signal predictions results in imperfect statistical class models.  Classifiers that rely on simulations of the environment must therefore be robust to imperfect environmental models.  Maximum likelihood methods provide ideal performance when the class models are correct but their performance quickly deteriorates when class models are imperfect.  Minimum distance methods generally can offer robustness to mismatches at the expense of performance, with that tradeoff governed by the distance metric used.  Hellinger distance, when used as a distance metric, offers robustness to outliers while retaining the performance of a maximum likelihood method, properties that make it well-suited for classification of passive underwater acoustic signals.  In the present work the robustness of the Minimum Hellinger Distance Classifier (MHDC) is quantified and its performance is compared to a Log-Likelihood Ratio Classifier(LLRC) with three different data sets: synthetic Gaussian data, synthetic acoustic data from propagation simulations and real acoustic data.  In cases of acoustic data, class models are derived from Monte Carlo acoustic propagation simulations.

Results from recent studies of growth promoting rhizobacterial and biocontrol microorganisms have demonstrated that those organisms emit volatile compounds that promote growth and enhance biotic and abiotic stress resistance of plants.  However, very little is known about if and how volatiles emitted by soilborne pathogenic fungi affect neighboring plants. The main goal of this thesis is studying how volatile compounds emitted by the soilborne fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Verticillium spp. affect Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum in growth and stress resistance. First, known and suspected roles of microbial volatiles and their mechanisms of action, with the focus on their roles in affecting plant growth and stress resistance, have been reviewed (Chapter 1). A large number of F. oxysporum isolates, from diverse geographical locations and plant sources, have been screened for their ability to promote Arabidopsis growth (Chapter 2). The majority of the isolates produced volatiles that augmented Arabidopsis biomass, signifying that volatile-mediated growth promotion is a common trait for F. oxysporum. Further experiments with selected F. oxysporum isolates revealed that their volatiles instigate morphological and physiological alterations in A. thaliana and N. tabacum. Employment of A. thaliana phytohormone signaling mutants and a transgenic line expressing GUS under the DR5 promoter revealed that volatile-mediated biomass augmentation is regulated through manipulation of root auxin transport and perception. These results are similar to previous findings regarding bacterial volatile-mediated growth promotion and suggest that soilborne bacteria and fungi associated with plant roots potentially share a mechanism to manipulate neighboring plants. Chapter 3 concerns the effect that F. oxysporum volatiles have on plant resistance to biotic stress. Infection of A. thaliana with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 after exposure to F. oxysporum volatiles showed volatile-mediated increased disease resistance. Pathogenicity assays with a transgenic A. thaliana line containing PR1::GUS, GUS under the control of the salicylic acid (SA) PR1 gene promoter, suggested that F. oxysporum volatiles prime SA-dependent induced systemic resistance. Volatiles from F. oxysporum also increased salinity tolerance in A. thaliana (Chapter 4). Chapter 5 outlines preliminary data on the effects of volatiles produced by Verticillium spp. on plant growth. Verticillium volatiles augmented growth of A. thaliana and N. tabacum in a manner similar to that caused by F. oxysporum volatiles. In conclusion, results shown in this thesis suggest that microbial volatile-mediated manipulation of plants represents a possibly conserved mechanism utilized by many root-associated microorganisms and is not an exclusive trait of beneficial microbes.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10158], "author_name_tesi": "Bitas, Vasileios ", "last_name_ssi": "Bitas", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Vasileios", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Seogchan Kang", "Seogchan Kang", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco", "Gretchen Anna Kuldau", "David Michael Geiser"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Seogchan Kang, Dissertation Advisor", "Seogchan Kang, Committee Chair", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Member", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco, Committee Member", "Gretchen Anna Kuldau, Committee Member", "David Michael Geiser, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Fusarium oxysporum", "Verticillium", "volatile compounds", "Arabidopsis", "growth promotion", "auxin", "root", "stress resistance"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "STUDY OF DEFECT STRUCTURE AND ELECTRICAL TRANSPORT IN\n BACK END OF LINE DIELECTRICS \nAND SIC MOSFETS\n\n", "id": "12636", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "636", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-12-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "SiC MOSFETs show great potential for use in high power and high temperature environments.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is a tool that can identify the physical and chemical nature of point defects responsible for limiting the performance of semiconductor / dielectric systems.

We have examined a wide array of films composed of SiOC, SiO2, SiN, SiNC, and SiC to help build an understanding of the defects which limit reliability and cause increased leakage current.  A strong dependence on film chemistry as well as processing parameters such as deposition technique, post deposition anneal temperatures, and UV curing is observed with EPR defect densities, which are correlated to leakage current measurements.  We further correlate leakage currents to EPR results by utilizing a technique called spin dependent trap assisted tunneling in several capacitor structures.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [632], "author_name_tesi": "Bittel, Brad ", "last_name_ssi": "Bittel", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Brad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patrick M Lenahan", "Patrick M Lenahan", "Suman Datta", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Jerzy Ruzyllo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patrick M Lenahan, Dissertation Advisor", "Patrick M Lenahan, Committee Chair", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["magnetic resonance", "EPR", "low-k", "BEOL", "SiC"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Perceptual organization: dimensional consistency effects, illusory contours, and perceptual and decisional influence", "id": "8926", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2764", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis reports a set of experiments that test three specific hypotheses regarding perceptual organization.

Previous work with both hierarchical forms and faces have shown that participants are faster to respond to a form when there is consistency among the global and local dimensions of that form. These dimensional consistency effects have been used to argue for global precedence, configurality, and other concepts relevant to perceptual organization. The current research studied hierarchical forms through the use of illusory contours. Signal detection theory (SDT) and general recognition theory (GRT) were used to assess performance for both perceptual and decisional influences. Experiment 1 was a hierarchical forms study in which three dimensions were analyzed for consistency benefit. Reaction times (RTs) showed dimensional consistency effects while response frequencies provided evidence for the presence of both perceptual and decisional influences. Experiment 2 documented the same patterns even when a decision on one of the stimulus dimensions was not required. Experiment 3 showed that analogous results could be obtained with both face-like and object-like hierarchical forms.

IBD is composed of two main groups, ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease.  Nearly 20% of those who suffer from IBD will develop colorectal cancer and 50% will die as a result.  In addition to the decrease in quality of life and increases in colorectal cancer risk, IBD also presents a significant economic burden.  The total economic burden of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\u2019s disease in the United States is estimated to be US$19 \u2013 30 billion annually.  IBD patients suffer from increased inflammatory gene expression, cytokine production, oxidative stress, and decreased gut barrier function.  This decrease in gut barrier function is a result of modulation of tight junction proteins responsible for modulating paracellular transport in the epithelium.  Decreased gut barrier function allows for intestinal endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to pass from the lumina into the systemic circulation causing further inflammation.  Dietary intervention is of particular interest when studying IBD as many phytochemicals have biological activity and some have been shown to decrease inflammation.  Though some may are not very bioavailable, they may have activity through direct interaction with epithelial cells.  The overall goal of this project was to investigate the beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with dietary phytochemicals on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colonic inflammation and gastrointestinal permeability.  The specific objectives were:  a) to evaluate the effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, gut barrier function, and nutrition in mice with DSS-induced ulcerative colitis and in DSS-treated Caco-2 cell monolayers in culture, b) evaluate the effect of an isoflavone-free soy protein concentrate on markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, gut barrier function, and inflammasome formation in mice with DSS-induced ulcerative colitis and in DSS-treated Caco-2 cell monolayers in culture.\nEGCG, the most abundant green tea polyphenol, has been shown to inhibit oxidative stress in animal and cell studies.  We examined the effect of EGCG on DSS-induced permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayers and found that EGCG treatment significantly reduced permeability.  We examined the anti-inflammatory, anti-nutritional, and intestinal permeability effects of EGCG in the DSS-induced mouse model of ulcerative colitis.  Mice received DSS (1.5% w/v) for 7 days to induce ulcerative colitis and then received 0.32% EGCG as their sole source of drinking water for an additional 3 days.  Colonic levels of the inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), were increased in DSS-treated mice, but the effect was mitigated as a result of EGCG administration.  Gut barrier improvements were seen in the mice that received EGCG intervention as measured by a multi-sugar permeability assay.  These results indicate that EGCG decreases the inflammatory response of the intestine and modulates intestinal permeability.  In spite of these anti-inflammatory effects, we observed that EGCG decreased feeding efficiency and enhanced body weight loss compared to DSS-treated control mice.  These changes were related to increases in fecal proteins and lipids and were observed in EGCG-treated mice suggesting that EGCG exerted anti-nutritional effects and indicating a potential dose-limiting toxicity. \nSoy (Glycine max), a widely consumed dietary component, has been reported to have beneficial effects against a number of chronic diseases.  We examined the ability of soy protein concentrate (SPC) to suppress inflammation and oxidative stress, and improve gut barrier function both in vivo and in a cell culture model.  In vitro, SPC exhibited radical scavenging activity.  This activity was further supported by an in vivo experiment where SPC protected Caco-2 human colon cells from H2O2-induced cytotoxicity.  DSS-induced increases in Caco-2 monolayer permeability were also decreased as a result of SPC treatment.  In a DSS-induced ulcerative colitis CF-1 mouse model, mice received 1.5% DSS for 7 days and consumed dietary SPC (6% or 12%) throughout the course of the study.  Dietary SPC reduced colonic cytokine levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1).  Gene expression of IL-1\u03b2, EGF-like Module-containing Mucin-like Hormone Receptor-Like 1 (EMR-1), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptor-3 (NLRP3), and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4) were also observed.  SPC decreased Caspase-1 activity, suggesting inhibition of inflammasome formation.  In the mice, protein levels of glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) increased and mRNA expression of tight junction proteins, claudin-1 and occludin, tended to normalize as compared to the negative control.  Our results suggest that SPC attenuates colonic inflammation in part by suppressing oxidative stress and intestinal permeability.\nCollectively, we have demonstrated that dietary treatment with EGCG and SPC can reduce inflammation and improve gut barrier function in DSS-induced ulcerative colitis in mice.  These results are supported by studies of antioxidant and epithelial protective effects in cell culture.  While the exact mechanism of each of the treatments remains to be investigated further, it suggests that dietary intervention with plant based phytochemicals may be a viable route to reducing inflammation and improving intestinal barrier function in the context of IBD.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10528], "author_name_tesi": "Bitzer, Zachary T", "last_name_ssi": "Bitzer", "middle_name_ssi": "T", "first_name_ssi": "Zachary", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert", "Ryan John Elias", "Andrew David Patterson", "Robert F Roberts"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joshua D Lambert, Dissertation Advisor", "Ryan John Elias, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew David Patterson, Committee Member", "Robert F Roberts, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Inflammatory Bowel Disease", "IBD", "Soy", "EGCG", "DSS", "Permeability", "Inflammasome", "Colorectal Cancer", "Ulcerative Colitis", "ROS"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "Essays on the Transferability of Migration Licenses", "id": "5911", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3792", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The first chapter, Trasferability of Migration Licenses and the Distribution of Potential Rents,\ncompares the effects of migration restrictions using licenses which are freely \ntraded to those that occur when licenses are allocated to \nfirms who are not permitted to trade them.

The real atmosphere is observed to have a wind and temperature gradient which affects the sound speed profile. Refraction causes bending of sound rays and potentially affects the total intensity of the sound received at a particular location on the ground. This effect was analyzed using the NORD2000 outdoor sound propagation model. A MATLAB code was written to run the NORD2000 propagation code for three different sound speed profiles such as the homogeneous, linear and logarithmic sound speed profiles. This thesis compares simulation results obtained from the three cases in the NORD2000 code and an in-house propagation code with the sound pressure levels obtained at noise monitors. The airport considered was Vancouver International Airport in British Columbia, Canada. The comparisons with measured data help in understanding the difference in results computed using the NORD2000 propagation code when real atmospheric data was considered to calculate a sound speed profile as compared to a vertically homogeneous sound speed profile.

The importance of using ill-structured problems with students to teach problem solving is generally agreed upon by educators (Helgeson, 1992). Ill-structured problems are those that characterize the types of complex problems that we encounter in everyday life. As great deal of  interest in the uses of ill-structured problems in education exists (Jonassen, 1997, 2006; de Jong and van Joolingen, 1998), more research here is needed. Furthermore, one of the critical elements required for successful problem solving is motivation (Albanese & Mitchell, 1993; Berkel & Schmidt, 2000), and the relationship between motivation and ill-structured problem solving is unclear and complex.\n\nThe purpose of the study was to investigate the effects of question prompts in scaffolding college students' problem-solving process and motivation on an ill-structured task. While scaffolding has been studied in previous research, few studies were focused on its use to support students\u2019 problem solving on ill-structured tasks. A literature review did not identify any studies that examined motivational aspects of scaffolding. Thus, this study focused on the use of question prompts to support college students' problem-solving processes on an ill-structured task, especially in the processes of problem representation, solution, justifications, and monitoring and evaluation. Additionally, the motivational aspects of scaffolding via question prompts was investigated.\n\nA mixed study design was used, integrating quantitative with qualitative methods. The quantitative method empirically measured individual's problem-solving outcomes on an ill-structured task. Four ill-structured problem-solving processes were measured: problem representation, developing solutions, making justifications, and monitoring and evaluation.\n\nThe qualitative method investigated contextual information about the individual's problem-solving process, such as how it affected their motivation and problem representation, solution development, making justifications, and monitoring and evaluation of solutions. This was accomplished via observation, interviews, and think-aloud protocols. Through these methods, the researcher examined individuals' thoughts, actions, decision-making, as well as their motivational states during the problem-solving process. This was done to gain insights into student's problem-solving processes and motivational structures on an ill-structured task.\n\nSeventy-nine college students participated in the study; 40 in the control group and 39 in the experimental group. The results of the experimental study showed that students working with question prompts significantly outperformed students without question prompts in all four problem-solving processes.\n\nWhile no students in the experimental group actually claimed to be more motivated by prompts, question prompts had a positive role in subjects' motivation as evidenced by reduction of frustration and stress, an increase in self-efficacy, an increase in strategic behavior, and by providing a fail-safe environment for learning.\n\nWhile this study confirmed the findings of previous research on the effectiveness of question prompts in facilitating students\u2019 cognition and metacognition, it also showed the motivational benefits. The study implied that, in order for students to gain full benefits from question prompts, some teacher or peer interaction may be needed, and this interaction process itself may need to be scaffolded.\n\nIn an online learning environment, question prompts may constrain students from full exploration of the available resources, as they may be seen as overly prescriptive in nature. Finding the optimal balance between too much openness and over prescription is problematic in these environments.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [838], "author_name_tesi": "Bixler, Brett A", "last_name_ssi": "Bixler", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Brett", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Mary Land", "Kyle Leonard Peck", "Brian Smith", "Magy Seif El Nasr"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Mary Land, Committee Chair", "Kyle Leonard Peck, Committee Member", "Brian Smith, Committee Member", "Magy Seif El Nasr, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["scaffold", "scaffolding", "prompts", "motivation", "online learning", "problem solving", "ill-structured problem"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Analyzing Subjectivity and Sentiment of Online Forums", "id": "22850", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10277", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Online social media has emerged as a popular medium for seeking and providing information, opinions and social support.

For support identification, I build supervised classifiers using several generic and novel domain-specific features and analyze the posting behaviors of regular members and influential members in the OHC in terms of the type of support they provide in their messages.

Follow-up studies had been conducted on MM instruction in Scandinavia, Germany, and the United States but prior to this study not in Iceland. Traditionally, the MM program has been delivered as a classroom package in Grade 1. Of the 160 Icelandic preschool children who participated in this study of the effects of phonological-awareness instruction, 123 received either traditional or an adapted MM instruction. In the adapted instruction, 96 children got assignments commensurate with their skills (3 levels). Measures of their reading skills at the end of preschool were of limited value, however, because approximately 4 out of 5 children could not read at the time.\nResults of this study indicate that phonological awareness can be taught. Comparing the children who had received MM instruction with children who had not, revealed differences between their phonological-awareness skills in preschool and their reading skills in first grade. Indications of reduced need for remedial reading in the group that had received MM instruction were found, but further research is needed accordingly. More research on gender differences is also required because the question was raised on the basis of data obtained in this study as to whether boys might profit more than girls from MM. A comparison of the use of adapted and traditional instruction indicated that children receiving the adapted MM did better on first grade reading. Differences in language development and grapheme knowledge between the two groups, both before and after the MM intervention, were indicated. When reading skills in first grade were predicted from preschool measures, grapheme recognition was the strongest predictor, followed by language skills and age. Because phonological awareness overlaps other skills, the overall conclusions based on phonological awareness only, might imply differences where detailed empirical evidence is missing.

The alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is an important part of gene regulation that engenders multiple protein isoforms from a single gene. Our group has previously shown that the alternative splicing of fast skeletal muscle troponin T (Tnnt3) responds to both natural and experimentally-induced changes in body mass, and that this process is impaired in obese Zucker rats, suggesting that excessive calorie consumption may impair the normal regulation of pre-mRNA alternative splicing. Therefore, the overall goal of this research was to understand if dietary factors, specifically fatty acids, affect pre-mRNA alternative splicing. The overall hypothesis was that in addition to modulating Tnnt3 pre-mRNA alternative splicing, consumption of a high-fat diet leads to transcriptome-wide changes in the pattern of alternative splicing in skeletal muscle and that these changes are mediated in part by saturated fatty acids. Studies from an exon array analysis performed on the gastrocnemius/plantaris complex of rats fed a 10% or 60% fat diet for two or eight weeks demonstrated that consumption of a high-fat diet resulted in the alternative splicing of 668 and 726 exons, respectively. Tnnt3 alternative splicing was among the top-five regulated pre-mRNAs. Further validation of these studies demonstrated that the high-fat diet-induced changes in Tnnt3 alternative splicing also occurred in rats fed a 30% fat diet across a one- to eight-week treatment period independent of changes in body mass between groups. Moreover, this effect depended on fat-type, because Tnnt3 alternative splicing occurred in response to 45% fat diets enriched with lard, but not in response to diets enriched with 45% mono- or polyunsaturated fatty acids. Collectively, these findings suggest a role for saturated fatty acids in the high-fat diet-induced modifications in Tnnt3 alternative splicing. Furthermore, addition of the saturated fatty acid palmitate to myotubes in culture induced a more robust change in Tnnt3 alternative splicing compared to the mono- or polyunsaturated fatty acids, oleate and linoleate. Treatment with a downstream metabolite of palmitate, ceramide, had effects similar to palmitate on Tnnt3 alternative splicing. Pretreatment with myriocin, an inhibitor of de novo ceramide biosynthesis, attenuated the palmitate-induced effects on alternative splicing. Furthermore, pretreatment with okadaic acid to inhibit the ceramide-induced activation of protein phosphatase 2A prevented the palmitate- and ceramide-induced Tnnt3 alternative splicing. Overall the results support the hypothesis that fat enriched diets induce changes in the pattern of alternative splicing in skeletal muscle and suggest a role for saturated fatty acids and their metabolites in mediating the changes observed in Tnnt3 alternative splicing.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16259], "author_name_tesi": "Black, Adam James", "last_name_ssi": "Black", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scot R Kimball", "Scot R Kimball", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Charles H Lang", "Ralph Lauren Keil", "Lisa M Shantz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scot R Kimball, Dissertation Advisor", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Chair", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Committee Member", "Charles H Lang, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Outside Member", "Lisa M Shantz, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["alternative splicing", "fatty acids", "Tnnt3", "high-fat diet", "fast skeletal muscle troponin T", "skeletal muscle", "ceramide"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "An Exploration of Laser-sustained Plasma Interactions with Titanium Substrates During Nitriding Without Direct Irradiation by the Laser", "id": "21421", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9337", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Laser-sustained plasma (LSP) is plasma which can be sustained indefinitely by a laser beam away from any potentially interacting surfaces. LSPs can be sustained at steady state by balancing power input through inverse bremsstrahlung absorption with loss through radiation (continuous and line), convection, and conduction. For many years, plasma has been considered a negative influence in laser materials processing, disrupting the beam path and distorting radiation prior to the beam reaching the surface. New research indicates that LSP can be an opportunity for metallurgical surface treatments and the deposition of coatings with an improvement in properties over conventional coating methods.\n\nFor the first time, the LSP was used to nitride surfaces independently of the associated laser beam and the resulting specimens were examined to gain new insights into the effects of laser plasmas on surface modification processes. A titanium plate was placed parallel to and at a radial distance from an LSP, rather than perpendicular to it, as is the typical geometry for laser processing. During the exposure of the substrate to the LSP, the process was observed via a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. The processed substrates were then examined visually, by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, focused ion beam, transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction to elucidate the morphological and microstructural features that are characteristic of this processing method.\n\nResults indicated that an LSP is a powerful tool for heating surfaces and simultaneously introducing activated gas species into the melt. The nitrided surfaces exhibited complex and uncommon morphologies, including faceted titanium nitride crystals, which had not been produced by conventional laser nitriding. The underlying microstructure demonstrated that LSP can generate layers similar to those produced by conventional laser nitriding, but to a much greater depth. This characteristic structure exhibited four distinct layers with gradated nitrogen contents ranging from titanium nitride at the surface to the base titanium metal.\n\nA timeline for the evolution of these metallurgical transformations was developed based on process monitoring and the materials characterization. These observations also led to a new understanding of the influence of plasma on the laser nitriding process. New methods for observing LSP-material interactions without additional contributions from the laser beam itself were effectively employed. The viability of LSP nitriding as a surface modification process and as a tool for future research on plasma-substrate interactions is discussed.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9141], "author_name_tesi": "Black, Amber N", "last_name_ssi": "Black", "middle_name_ssi": "N", "first_name_ssi": "Amber", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith Todd Copley", "Stephen M Copley", "James Hansell Adair", "Albert Eliot Segall", "Dr Vladimir V Semak"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith Todd Copley, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen M Copley, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Member", "Dr Vladimir V Semak, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["laser", "plasma", "nitriding", "titanium", "laser-sustained plasma", "laser material processing", "laser nitriding"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "A boundary-line approach to dendroecological release criteria", "id": "6153", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "604", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-09-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Identifying releases from suppression represents one of the most fundamental dendroecological procedures for quantifying forest disturbance histories.  In tree-ring series, releases are typically defined as pulses in percent-growth change that exceed a minimum threshold.  Past methodologies have applied fixed growth change thresholds that may overly generalize the ability of a tree to respond to a disturbance event.  This study presents a more precise method that scales each release by its maximum release potential as defined by prior growth rates, using an old growth hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L.) forest in central Pennsylvania as an example.  On average, tree age, diameter, and crown class appear to influence the magnitude of release response.  However, differences in release response between age, diameter, and canopy classes are largely an artifact of the more fundamental relationship between release response and growth immediately prior to release.  Specifically, maximum percent-growth change declines at a steep, negative exponential rate as prior growth levels increase.  Slow-growing hemlocks can exceed 800% growth increases while fast-growing hemlocks do not exceed growth increases of twenty percent.  This negative exponential threshold, or boundary line, represents the maximum percent-growth change that is physiologically possible at a given level of prior growth.  Thus, release potential is relative to prior growth rate.  The relationship between prior growth and release potential is species-specific and is demonstrated in 24 additional hemlock stands.  New release criteria based on prior growth are proposed in which moderate and major releases are those falling within 20-49.9%, and 50-100% of the boundary line, respectively.  Effects of short, moderate, and long-term climate events are reduced by the percent growth change calculation and the high growth-change threshold applied to slow-growing trees.  Overall, this approach provides a more theoretically sound and flexible approach to developing disturbance histories. \n \nPrior growth is also shown to strongly influence release response in species representing a wide diversity of habitats in North America.  Species included in this study are white pine (Pinus strobus), chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), white oak (Quercus alba), shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), white spruce (Picea glauca), black spruce (Picea mariana), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa), post oak (Quercus stellata), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii).  Prior-growth boundary lines are developed for each species, and in all cases the boundary line follows a negative exponential function.  Size and diameter interactions with release response are then explored and reveal that diameter or age limits may be necessary for many species.  In general, shade-intolerant species, which grow where competition is low due to fire or other edaphic factors, tend to lose release potential the fastest as age and size increase.  Tolerant species retain full release response for nearly all of their lives.  Furthermore, boundary line differences among northeastern species reflect levels of understory tolerance in that shade tolerant individuals have a relatively high release potential under slow-growing conditions while intolerant individuals have a relatively high release potential under fast-growing conditions.  Thus prior growth not only can be applied to enhance release criteria, but also to reveal differences among tolerant and intolerant species.  \n\nA bootstrapping test is designed to estimate the minimum sample size necessary to develop a species-specific boundary line.  The results somewhat consistently indicate a minimum sample size of 50,000 growth increments and an ideal sample size of 150,000 growth increments to develop a prior-growth boundary line.  Next, the boundary-line release criteria are validated using tree-ring data obtained from a chestnut oak stand with a known thinning history.  The largest crown releases (87.5 \u2013 100% of crown exposed) approach the boundary line while smaller crown releases occupy increasingly lower subsets of the boundary line maximum value.  This validates that the boundary line represents maximum release potential and that the degree of release is proportional to distance from the prior-growth boundary line.  Release responses of nineteen white oak trees that survived a catastrophic tornado also approach the white oak boundary line, but less consistently.  Failure to reach the boundary line is correlated with small difference in radius, which may be due to the exposure of these trees to the high winds.  If these large trees have muted or delayed release responses, the estimated date of a catastrophic disturbance may be much later than the true date of the event.  Overall, these examples illustrate that incorporation of prior growth into release criteria could greatly improve the ability to detect disturbances and estimate the magnitude of each disturbance event.  Thus these new criteria represent a significant improvement over pre-existing methodologies and will have broad applications to many other species in a wide variety of forest types.  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [600], "author_name_tesi": "Black, Bryan Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Black", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "Bryan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marc David Abrams", "Kim C Steiner", "Roger Tai Koide", "David Eissenstat"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marc David Abrams, Committee Chair", "Kim C Steiner, Committee Member", "Roger Tai Koide, Committee Member", "David Eissenstat, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dendrochronology", "historical ecology", "forest dynamics", "disturbance ecology", "release criteria", "eastern hemlock"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Faking Bad: \ndo high-ability elementary students intentionally underachieve when their work is peer-reviewed?\n", "id": "16232", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8147", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "While faking bad, or the intentional distortion of assessment results, has been studied extensively with self-report measures (Lim & Butcher, 1996; Roskes, 2009), the possible presence of this behavior on direct measures has only just begun to be examined.

Results from traditional regression methods show that rural vs. urban residence does not significantly contribute to differences in obesity prevalence by county; whereas minority composition, features of the built and natural environment, and physical inactivity among adult residents are all significantly associated with county-level obesity prevalence. Also, county-level income inequality was found to provide a protective barrier against higher obesity prevalence.

In general, the economic costs of racial inequalities in health are substantial, but poor health outcomes among blacks are specifically costly, because blacks account for nearly 75% of the financial burden of racial inequalities in health (LaViest, Gaskin, and Richard 2009). There have been several public health campaigns launched to target these disparities, but the mortality gap still exists. In this dissertation, I aim to understand why mortality disparities between blacks and whites persist. I employ a historical and theoretical framework to better understand social and economic relations between blacks and whites, and how these relations contribute to relative black disadvantage. I also borrow heavily from the writings of Marx and Weber, before and after the Civil War, to examine these social and economic social relations. I draw upon the framework to argue that contemporary black disadvantage is historically conditioned, and is embedded within place. Furthermore, the vestiges of these historical conditions restrict blacks from gaining access to intangible resources that are imperative to improving health, decreasing mortality risk, and narrowing mortality disparities.\nIn order to test my argument, I merge more than 40 years of mortality data with historical Census data from 1860, 1930, and 2000, to examine the effects of slavery on contemporary mortality disparities between blacks and whites at the county-level. I also investigate if the effect of slavery in 1860 operates through inequality during the Jim Crow era and the Post-Civil Rights era. In all, I test a series of five hypotheses to explore\niii\nthe relationship between the historical vestiges of slavery and contemporary mortality disparities. I find some evidence that the concentration of slavery in 1860 has a positive and significant effect on crude mortality disparities between blacks and whites from 1969 to 2009. I also find some evidence that the effect of slavery contributes to higher absolute death rates for both blacks and whites, but the magnitude of the effect is greater on black crude mortality rates than white crude mortality rates. However, these findings were not confirmed when using age-standardized rates as the dependent variable. In fact, after adjusting for age, the effect of the slavery on mortality disparities was negative and significant. The results from the age-adjusted models were antithetical to the results of the crude models, and to findings in the current literature, which leads to some complex questions about the potential mechanisms and methodological issues that may be driving these conflicting findings.

The first question asks what factors would create an implied contractual relationship between states and their postsecondary institutions. The second question asks what factors could provide students third-party beneficiary status under that implied contract, if one exists. The recent cuts in public postsecondary funding and trends toward institutional performance accountability were the impetuous for this research. As state fiscal support for public higher education has dropped, student cost and debt has risen. These research questions examine whether students have a legal remedy that could force states to provide enough resources to make postsecondary education affordable and accessible. \nA case study methodology is used to study these research questions. The state of California serves as the single state case study for this research. California was chosen for a number of reasons. First, the state\u2019s tripartite public postsecondary system provides clear insights into the unique considerations that face different types of postsecondary institutions. Second, the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding California\u2019s higher education sector are vast. This allows for a depth of analysis that other states simply could not provide. Lastly, California\u2019s previous fiscal commitment to postsecondary education has been unmatched by other states. The state\u2019s recent cuts have also been as severe as any other state in the country. These fiscal considerations bring additional insights to the analysis.  All told, these traits made California an ideal case study for this research.\nThe research reveals a few interesting considerations. First, a number of factors influence the answer to the research questions. These factors can be analyzed within a historical, legal, administrative, and fiscal framework. Second, given the right circumstances, a particularly generous court may find that students are third-party beneficiaries to an implied contract between California and its postsecondary institutions. However, students may have an easier time proving that California directly promised to provide them affordable access to high-quality postsecondary education. If this is true, students may be a principal party to implied contract with California. All told, proving either claim would be difficult. However, states and their postsecondary institutions would likely benefit from treating their relationship in a contractual manner so that each party understands their rights and accepts their responsibilities before accountability or funding disputes arise.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10102], "author_name_tesi": "Blackman, Phillip Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Blackman", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Phillip", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson", "Dorothy H Evensen", "John Jesse Cheslock", "Katherine C Pearson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert M Hendrickson, Dissertation Advisor", "Dorothy H Evensen, Committee Member", "John Jesse Cheslock, Committee Member", "Katherine C Pearson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Higher Education", "Law", "Implied Contracts", "Affordable Access", "Public Finance"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: A Structural Approach.\n\n", "id": "7232", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1901", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this research, neuroticism and introversion were hypothesized to promote the fear-avoidance conditioning common in anxiety disorders, and would therefore be highly associated with chronic PTSD.

Girls were aged 8, 10 and 12 years and boys were aged 9, 11 and 13 years at study entry. The Eastern sample, along with a multiethnic West Coast sample (N=454), which included participants aged 9-12 years, drawn from a longitudinal study on neglect and behavior, was used in the third study. The first study examined the cross-sectional relationship of diurnal variation in cortisol, an exaggerated stress response, relational aggression and externalizing behavior, as moderated by timing of puberty and depressive symptoms. Results show that earlier maturing adolescents with a low diurnal cortisol variation, as well as adolescents with a heightened response to a stressor and less diurnal cortisol variation, were most relationally aggressive. Sex differences were found when externalizing behavior was examined, with depressed girls with a low diurnal cortisol variation and either heightened or attenuated cortisol reactivity exhibiting the most externalizing behavior problems. Later maturing boys with higher numbers of depressive symptoms and heightened cortisol reactivity also exhibited higher levels of externalizing behavior problems. The second study investigated the prediction of diurnal cortisol variation by relational aggression and externalizing behavior over 12 months. Relational aggression predicted less diurnal cortisol variation over 12 months in earlier maturing adolescents with higher numbers of depressive symptoms. Externalizing behavior predicted a steadily decreasing diurnal cortisol variation over 12 months in earlier maturing adolescents with lower numbers of depressive symptoms. Between-group differences indicated that girls who practiced relational aggression and externalizing behavior also had less diurnal cortisol variation over 12 months. The final study examined the interaction of cortisol reactivity and externalizing behavior in the prediction of weight status 12 months later in a multiethnic sample of children and adolescents. Eastern adolescents with lower levels of externalizing behavior and West Coast non-Hispanic Black girls with higher levels of externalizing behavior and a diminished cortisol output at baseline (0 months) had a higher weight status a year later. Only non-Hispanic Black girls with higher levels of externalizing behavior and heightened cortisol reactivity at baseline (0 months) had a higher weight status a year later. These studies highlight a need for additional studies to further examine the unique, integrative role that aggressive behavior can play in the development of atypical HPA axis activity and overweight/obesity in multiple ethnic youth. Such studies may elucidate the pathways leading to the development of health disparities in chronic disease during the adolescent period.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3544], "author_name_tesi": "Blades, Keeva Taneka", "last_name_ssi": "Blades", "middle_name_ssi": "Taneka", "first_name_ssi": "Keeva", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biobehavioral Health", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Susman", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa", "Lori Anne Francis", "Michael J Rovine"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Susman, Committee Chair", "Collins O Airhihenbuwa, Committee Member", "Lori Anne Francis, Committee Member", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["diurnal rhythm", "stress response", "externalizing behavior", "relational aggression", "cortisol", "overweight/obesity", "ethnicity"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Perceptions of Primary Teachers Using Responsive Classroom in the Era of No Child Left Behind", "id": "18827", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8781", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Using a case study design, with a phenomenological perspective, this research focused on a sample of primary classroom teachers (grades K \u2013 3rd grade) in south central Pennsylvania who are currently using and have been using Responsive Classroom (RC) strategies for an extended period of time.  Their perspectives provide insight into their use of Responsive Classroom strategies.  \nInitially the focus of the study was to determine if the mandates of No Child Left Behind were impacting teacher\u2019s use of RC.  The research questions that guided this study were: (1) What pressures have primary grade teachers (K-3) experienced as a result of No Child Left Behind (NCLB)?, (2)Have teachers changed or adapted their classroom practices to continue to use RC?  If so, in what ways?, (3) Why have these teachers made the decisions they have made in their implementation of RC?, and (4) How do these teachers perceive the impact of changes, if any, in their implementation of RC?  However as the research process unfolded, the story that developed from the teachers had to do with the teachers\u2019 understandings of and perceptions of the value of the RC approach. Though NCLB and changes in curriculum and assessment had impacted the implementation of RC for some of the teachers, the teachers did not perceive in general that the value of the RC approach had been diminished.

In this thesis, the overall effectivenesss of chewing gum as a delivery vehicle for bioactive polyphenols found in green tea was investigated.  In order to fully understand this delivery method, the release of the catechins from three different gum treatments were measured by HPLC.  The inhibitory effect that green tea catechins may have on amylase activity was tested to evaluate the effect of starch addition to the gum base.  Lastly, the effect of the complex on bioavailability of bioactive components was investigated in-vivo by dosage in 72 male CF-1 mice and HPLC analysis of beta-carotene absorption in plasma and fecal samples.  Overall, the results of these studies support the need for further investigation of the use of chewing gum and starch inclusion complexes as a delivery vehicle for bioactive components.  There is no evidence of interference by tea polyphenols on the breakdown of starch by amylase and hence the release of the bioactive components into the body.

To this end, we have used low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to study individual molecular adsorbates related to heterogeneous catalysis and precise nanostructures tethered on self-assembled monolayers.  High spectroscopic resolution enabled by low temperatures was employed to identify adsorbates on atomically flat surfaces, as well as to probe the electronic properties of precise cluster assemblies. \n\nThe role of the substrate in the reactivity and interactions between surface-bound species is critical for a comprehensive understanding of complex surface phenomena. We  have studied the atomic-scale reaction pathway of a surface-catalyzed reaction and utilized scanning tunneling spectroscopy to identify reactive intermediates and products in the Ullmann coupling reaction on Cu{111}.  Chemical identification of fluorophenyl intermediates and biphenyl products was achieved by vibrational spectroscopy via inelastic tunneling spectroscopy.  The strongest vibrational mode in the phenyl species disappears when the tilted intermediates couple to form biphenyl products.  We infer that the surface normal component of the dipole moment is important in determining the transition strength in inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy. \n\nThe role of the substrate surface-state electrons in mediating long-range electronic interactions between islands of bromine adatoms on Cu{111} was investigated. We have quantified nearest neighbor island separations and found island-island distances correspond to half-multiples of the Fermi wavelength of Cu{111}, indicative of the role of the surface state in determining the lateral spacings between the islands at catalytically relevant temperatures.  These substrate-mediated interactions are critical for developing new insight in the development of precisely nanostructured films and devices.\nThe electronic properties of ligand-stabilized undecagold clusters and nanoparticles were investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Significant spectral hopping and diffusion were observed across single and multiple clusters.  Although precisely constructed and controlled, this spectral diffusion demonstrates the acute sensitivity of these clusters to their physical and chemical environment.  This has enabled an understanding and ability to make unique measurements with unrivaled specificity and resolution, which can be applied to more complex systems, where understanding local electronic properties is key to device function. \n\nWe have designed surfaces to capture superatom clusters, both in the solution and in the gas phase, that exhibit exceptional stability, in order to measure their electronic structure.  Clusters of certain elements are known to exhibit \u201cmagic number\u201d behavior that leads to their enhanced stability.  Understanding how to tailor these superatoms with specific electronic, optical, and magnetic properties enables the fabrication of building blocks for cluster-assembled materials.   \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4236], "author_name_tesi": "Blake, Meaghan Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Blake", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Meaghan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss", "Paul S Weiss", "John V Badding", "Lasse Jensen", "Seong H Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss, Dissertation Advisor", "Paul S Weiss, Committee Chair", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member", "Seong H Kim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["clusters", "self-assembled monolayer", "STM", "STS"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A Methodology for Identifying Unobserved Categories When Consumers Assign Brands to Multiple Categories\n\n", "id": "11688", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5925", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "According to previous research, consumers naturally think of brands or products as belonging to multiple categories, depending on which of various available categories come to mind.

Data were collected in conjunction with Triad Research Group, Inc. of Cleveland Ohio.  Telephone surveys were administered to residents of Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Medina, Portage, and Summit counties in the greater Cleveland metropolitan area.  In total, 1200 surveys were collected with a 77% response rate.  Of these data, 96 were considered single parents compared to 278 married parents.  The data were then analyzed using cross-tabular tests with Chi-square analyses.  To control the population for income, the data were then re-analyzed using logistic regression methods.\nFindings indicated that single parents face transportation constraints more so than dual parents even when controlling for income.  Park managers who wish to serve single parents should consider potential public transportation strategies in order to provide increasing accessibility and convenience.  Additionally, single parents indicated that fear of crime and a desire to make parks safer were salient concerns.  Finally, single parents were more likely to indicate a desire for programming involving child-care within public park offerings.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2470], "author_name_tesi": "Blanco, Joel ", "last_name_ssi": "Blanco", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Joel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Justin Mowen", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Alan R Graefe", "Dr Harry Zinn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Justin Mowen, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Justin Mowen, Thesis Advisor", "Alan R Graefe, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Harry Zinn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["single parents", "park visitation", "recreation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Posthum(or)ous: The Folk Response to Mass-Mediated Disasters in the Digital Age\n", "id": "11644", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6181", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-02-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Today, Americans are raised to seek and sustain intimacy with others through the use of computer-mediated communication.  As a result, American society is becoming gradually more addicted to the convenient accessibility of satisfying content and the opportunities for expressive exchange.  To be sure, people inherently need to feel connected or united with others in some way.  New media technologies deeply fulfill these needs by providing users an expansive forum for humorous, combative, or intellectual communicative exchanges\u2014especially in times of social anxiety or forced emotional suppression.\n\nMore so than other events, shocking news of death, disaster, and scandal invite humorous vernacular expression on the Internet when repetitively consumed via mass media outlets.  The Internet propels the diffusion of humor about tragedies to many people that would not have been included in previous years.  Considering that the Digital Age\u2019s accessibility and interactivity now prohibit most stories, jokes, or regional behaviors from remaining exclusive to their originating contexts, it is essential that we examine the new ways that people respond to media disasters in contemporary society, and how cyberspace became the \u201cgo-to\u201d format for vernacular expression.\n\nBy comparing the pre-Internet contexts of local, regional, and national responses to disaster with the trends of vernacular expression in today\u2019s new media-driven society and popular culture, this dissertation shows that the global reach of cyberspace has irrevocably extended itself into the ways that modern society expresses itself and underscore the implications that this has for the trajectory of contemporary folklore studies.  Most importantly, this work demonstrates that the allure of the Internet (as a locus of vernacular expression) comes from not only its widespread accessibility, but because it eases the growing trend of physical detachment from the analog world that cyberspace has made commonplace in the lives of working people.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6174], "author_name_tesi": "Blank, Trevor J.", "last_name_ssi": "Blank", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Trevor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "American Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Simon Josef Bronner", "Simon Josef Bronner", "Michael Lee Barton", "Charles David Kupfer", "Girish Subramanian"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Simon Josef Bronner, Dissertation Advisor", "Simon Josef Bronner, Committee Chair", "Michael Lee Barton, Committee Member", "Charles David Kupfer, Committee Member", "Girish Subramanian, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Digital Age", "computers", "Internet", "humor", "death", "disaster", "mass media", "folklore"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Galaxy, a web-based framework for the integration of genome analysis", "id": "10224", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1411", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The standardization and sharing of data and tools are among the biggest challenges facing large collaborative projects and small individual labs alike. Here a compact web application, Galaxy, is described which effectively addresses these issues. It provides an intuitive interface for the deposition and access of data and features a vast number of analysis tools including operations on genomic intervals, utilities for manipulation of multiple sequence alignments and molecular evolution algorithms. By providing a direct link between data and analysis tools, Galaxy allows addressing biological questions that are beyond the reach of existing software. Available both as (1) a publicly available web service providing tools for the analysis of genomic, comparative genomic and functional genomic data and (2) a downloadable package that can be deployed in individual labs, Galaxy attempts to serve both sides of the user distribution: experimental biologists and bioinformaticians. \nFor experimental biologists, it provides an intuitive interface for data deposition and access, features a large number of tools and makes analysis transparent by documenting every step in the Galaxy history system. Most importantly, it streamlines the path from data to analysis, as even complex tools can be applied to genomic data directly without manual parsing or preprocessing. \nFor bioinformaticians, Galaxy is a software system that provides informatics support through a platform that gives biologists simple interfaces to powerful tools, while automatically managing the computational details. Galaxy provides a framework that can integrate command-line tools with almost no effort. For each tool, Galaxy generates the interface and provides all computational housekeeping. \nA prime example of a remarkable disconnect between genomic data and analysis tools is in the case of multiple-species whole genome alignments. Continuingly expanding collections of freely downloadable multiple-species whole genome alignments have been made available to the scientific community, however, several issues exist which prevent experimental biologists from utilizing these important datasets. Simply put, these alignments are not only large enough to cause significant logistical problems just to download and store, but there are no tools available that allow command-line averse biologists to manipulate these alignments. Furthermore, current genome analysis packages, such as the phylogenetic software HyPhy, do not accept the Multiple Alignment Format (MAF) as input. A set of tools designed to address these challenges has been integrated into the Galaxy framework and is included as part of the standard software distribution. Short examples of tool usage as well as an in-depth sample analysis are presented along with descriptions of the individual tools. The step-by-step sample analysis and toolset integration provide real-life examples of the utility of Galaxy both as (1) an effective and intuitive analysis platform for experimental biologists and (2) a tool and data source integration framework for bioinformaticians.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1400], "author_name_tesi": "Blankenberg, Daniel James", "last_name_ssi": "Blankenberg", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anton Nekrutenko", "Anton Nekrutenko", "Webb Colby Miller", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Stephan Schuster", "Andrey S Krasilnikov"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anton Nekrutenko, Dissertation Advisor", "Anton Nekrutenko, Committee Chair", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Member", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Stephan Schuster, Committee Member", "Andrey S Krasilnikov, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sequence Analysis", "Genome", "Databases", "Algorithms", "Molecular Sequence Data", "Software"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Framing Animal-Rights Activism:  An Analysis of Grant Morrison\u2019s Animal Man\n\n\n", "id": "11483", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "633", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the late 1980s, animal-rights activists spread their message through a variety of channels.

If using an uncalibrated model parameterized with typical reference values, the volume of runoff and peak rate of runoff for these karst watersheds could be over-predicted by over 200% and over 500%, respectively.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3599], "author_name_tesi": "Blansett, Katherine L", "last_name_ssi": "Blansett", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Katherine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Michael Hamlett", "James Michael Hamlett", "Albert R Jarrett", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer", "Arthur Carl Miller", "Lawrence Albert Fennessey", "Scott Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Michael Hamlett, Dissertation Advisor", "James Michael Hamlett, Committee Chair", "Albert R Jarrett, Committee Member", "Elizabeth Weeks Boyer, Committee Member", "Arthur Carl Miller, Committee Member", "Lawrence Albert Fennessey, Committee Member", "Scott Brown, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["urban hydrology", "karst", "stormwater management", "SWMM"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "An Experimental and Computational Approach to Iced Wind Turbine Aerodynamics", "id": "25029", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11299", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-01-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents an analysis of power loss of a representative 1.5 MW wind turbine for variable icing conditions. Power losses are estimated using aerodynamic data obtained in a combination of two experimental methods. Atmospheric icing conditions varying in temperature, droplet size, and liquid water content are generated in an icing facility to simulate a 45-minute icing event on a representative wind turbine airfoil section. The ice shapes are then molded for preservation and subsequent wind-tunnel testing. Lift and drag measurements are made and used to estimate the total power production of the iced wind turbine using a blade-element momentum theory prediction code. Detailed measurements of ice profiles show that aerodynamic penalties are mainly a function of surface roughness due to icing. A 16% loss of airfoil lift at operational angle of attack is observed for freezing-fog conditions. Drag increases at a lift coefficient of 0.5 are observed to be 190% at temperatures near 0\u00b0C, 145% near -10\u00b0 C, and 80% near -20\u00b0C. An analysis of the wind turbine aerodynamic loads due to atmospheric icing yields power losses ranging from 16% to 26% near an average wind speed of 8 m/s. An exception to these results exists for a single super-large droplet icing case in which lift decrease and drag increase are more severe at 25% and 219%, respectively.

The influence of participant characteristics (i.e., biological sex, personal abuse history, and attitudes towards intimate partner violence) on assessment was investigated.  Using an analogue methodology, intimate terrorism and situation couple violence were depicted in scenarios where the number of control tactics varied between the violence types.  A violence-type by couple-type between subjects multivariate analysis was utilized to study the differences in psychologists\u2019 assessment responses.  An exploratory analysis of differences in treatment recommendations for violence types and couple types was performed.  Opposite-sex intimate terrorism (OS-IT) was assumed to be the baseline prototypical response for assessment in this study.  Three groupings of dependent variables (i.e., control, victim and perpetrator assignment, and perceived outcome) were used to test whether the OS-IT prototype emerged. \n\nThe results of the two previous studies were not replicated in these studies\u2019 findings.

This means that psychologists appear able to distinguish between SCV and IT based on the number of control tactics presented in the scenarios.

The assessment data shows that psychologists are consistent in assigning victim and perpetrator for both violence types and couple types.

Research has suggested strategies such as consuming a high protein diet, reducing dietary energy density, or consuming pre-portioned meals to help lower energy intake. The literature testing these strategies, however, is either inconsistent or incomplete. A series of studies have been conducted that examine the effects of these strategies on energy intake in order to provide better recommendations for controlling energy intake. \n\nThe purpose of Study 1 was to determine whether increasing the protein content of meals reduced daily energy intake and enhanced satiety. The satiating effects of protein were investigated by varying the protein content of meals consumed ad libitum across a range of commonly consumed amounts over a day. In this crossover experiment, 18 normal-weight women consumed ad libitum lunch and dinner entr\u00e9es one day a week that were covertly varied in protein content (10, 15, 20, 25, or 30% energy). Entr\u00e9es were manipulated by substituting animal protein for starchy ingredients and were matched for energy density, fat content, palatability, and appearance. Unmanipulated breakfasts and evening snacks were consumed ad libitum. Participants rated their hunger and fullness before and after meals as well as the taste and appearance of entr\u00e9es. Results showed that mean 24-hour protein intake increased significantly across conditions, from 44\u00b12 g/d in the 10% protein condition to 82\u00b16 g/d in the 30% condition. Daily energy intake, however, did not differ significantly across the 10% to 30% protein conditions (means 1870\u00b193, 1887\u00b193, 1848\u00b1111, 1876\u00b1100, and 1807\u00b198 kcal). There were no significant differences in hunger and fullness ratings across conditions or in taste and appearance ratings of the manipulated entr\u00e9es. \n\nStudy 2 tested the recommendation of substituting low-energy-dense foods (vegetables) for foods higher in energy density to reduce energy intake. Pur\u00e9ed vegetables were incorporated into entr\u00e9es at multiple meals to decrease the energy density and the effects on daily energy and vegetable intakes were investigated. In this crossover study, 20 men and 21 women ate ad libitum breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the laboratory once a week for three weeks. Across conditions, entr\u00e9es at meals were varied in energy density (100%, 85%, or 75%) by covertly incorporating 3 or 4.5 times the amount of pur\u00e9ed vegetables. Entr\u00e9es were accompanied by unmanipulated side dishes. Participants rated their hunger and fullness before and after meals. The results showed that subjects consumed a consistent weight of food across conditions of energy density; thus, daily energy intake significantly decreased by 202\u00b160 kcal in the 85% condition (p<0.001) and 357\u00b147 kcal in the 75% condition (p<0.0001). Daily vegetable consumption significantly increased from 270\u00b117 g in the 100% condition to 487\u00b125 g in the 75% condition (p<0.0001). Despite differences in energy intake, ratings of hunger and fullness did not differ significantly across conditions. Entr\u00e9es were rated similar in palatability across conditions.\n\nStudy 3 determined how the effects of energy density and energy content of pre-portioned entr\u00e9es combine to influence daily energy intake. In a crossover design, 28 men and 40 women were provided with breakfast, lunch, and dinner on one day a week for 4 weeks. Each meal included a compulsory, manipulated pre-portioned entr\u00e9e and a variety of unmanipulated discretionary foods that were consumed ad libitum. Across the 4 weeks, the entr\u00e9es were varied in both energy density and energy content between a standard level (100%) and a reduced level (64%). In men, reducing both the energy density and the energy content of the pre-portioned entr\u00e9es led to independent decreases in total meal energy intake (both p<0.01). A 36% decrease in energy density led to a 6% decrease in energy intake (154\u00b146 kcal), and a 36% decrease in energy content led to an 11% decrease in energy intake (291\u00b175 kcal). Thus, decreases in the energy density and energy content of pre-portioned entr\u00e9es acted independently and added together to reduce total meal energy intake. Women showed similar effects on daily energy intake as men, however, this outcome was influenced by the interaction of energy density and energy content to reduce total meal energy intake (p<0.01). \n\nThe findings from these studies suggest that energy density plays a major role in the regulation of energy intake. When energy density is held constant, variations in the protein content of entr\u00e9es consumed ad libitum are not likely to influence daily energy intake or affect ratings of satiety. On the other hand, variations in energy density lead to changes in energy intake and may influence satiety. One way to reduce energy density is by increasing the amount of vegetables or fruits in foods. Pur\u00e9ed vegetables can be incorporated into various sweet and savory foods in large amounts; a strategy that can not only reduce energy intake, but can also increase vegetable intake without increasing hunger. A reduction in energy intake can also be found when the fruit and vegetable content of pre-portioned entr\u00e9es is increased. Furthermore, reducing the energy density in addition to reducing the energy content leads to further decreases energy intake while maintaining satiety. In summary, the results of these studies support the recommendation of decreasing energy density, but not increasing protein content, to reduce energy intake and make an impact on the growing rates of obesity. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [63], "author_name_tesi": "Blatt, Alexandria D", "last_name_ssi": "Blatt", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Alexandria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Jean Rolls", "Barbara Jean Rolls", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Sharon Nickols Richardson", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "Mary Jane De Souza"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Jean Rolls, Dissertation Advisor", "Barbara Jean Rolls, Committee Chair", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Sharon Nickols Richardson, Committee Member", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "Mary Jane De Souza, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pre-portioned entrees", "energy density", "protein", "intake", "obesity"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Processing Verbal Arguments in a First and Second Language: The Role of Immersion Experience\n", "id": "7795", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2015", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nPast research examining the processing of structurally ambiguous modifiers, such as adjunct phrases consisting of a complex noun phrase followed by a relative clause show that bilingual speakers sometimes resolve this ambiguity when reading in their first language (L1) using parsing strategies from their second language (L2). Years of immersion experience in the L2 has been found to account for this result (Dussias, 2003; Dussias & Sagarra, 2007). The primary goal of the present research was to determine whether the information directing parsing decisions for verbal arguments are as vulnerable to intrusion from the L2 as the factors that affect the parsing of adjuncts. In addition, some current empirical evidence suggests that when L2 learners read sentences in their L2 they are not guided by the same structurally-based principles typically evidenced during monolingual sentence parsing. Therefore, the secondary aim of this research was to assess whether L2 speakers use structure-based parsing principles or lexical-semantic information to process structurally ambiguous arguments in their L2. To address these questions, monolingual English speakers, monolingual French speakers, French-English bilinguals immersed in the L2 environment (English) and English-French bilinguals who lived in a bilingual environment read ambiguous object/subject sentences in English and in French were selected and tested.\nThe results imply that when bilinguals have regular access to only one of their two languages, the dominant language guides the way they process sentences containing object/subject ambiguities and when bilinguals use both their languages on a regular basis, they are able to parse each language following the linguistic constraints of that language. Additionally, the results obtained showed that certain bilinguals appear to parse argument constructions using structure-based principles, whereas others may primarily rely on lexical-semantic information and perform a shallower interpretation of sentences.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1997], "author_name_tesi": "Blattner, Geraldine A", "last_name_ssi": "Blattner", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Geraldine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa A Reed", "Paola Eulalia Dussias", "Judith Fran Kroll", "Celeste S Kinginger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa A Reed, Committee Chair", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Committee Member", "Judith Fran Kroll, Committee Member", "Celeste S Kinginger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["bilingual sentence processing", "psycholinguistics"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Role of the endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor IRE1 alpha in oncogene-induced senescence", "id": "25004", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11114", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Inositol requiring enzyme 1\u03b1 (IRE1\u03b1) activation during chemically-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulates divergent cell fate responses-adaptation versus cell death- through mechanisms that depend on its cytosolic endoribonuclease (RNase) domain.  Adaptive responses are mediated by X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), where IRE1\u03b1 promotes cleavage and splicing of unspliced Xbp1 mRNA to generate an active transcription factor, XBP1S.  In contrast, cell death is mediated through preferential cleavage and degradation of mRNAs important in survival through a process called regulated IRE1\u03b1 dependent decay (RIDD).  However, it is not clear if IRE1\u03b1 regulates similar divergent responses during cancer progression.\nTo model and study the contribution of both IRE1\u03b1 RNase outputs to oncogene activation, we transduced oncogenic v-Ha-RAS (v-RASHa) into primary keratinocytes.  During the initial proliferative response, oncogenic v-RASHa simultaneously activates IRE1\u03b1-mediated splicing of Xbp1 mRNA as well as promotes mRNA decay through RIDD.  ShRNA knockdown and pharmacological approaches implicate ER stress-dependent Xbp1 mRNA splicing as part of the proliferation response to oncogenic v-RASHa, while RIDD mediates cell cycle growth arrest in the absence of XBP1. The requirement of Xbp1 mRNA splicing for proliferation is linked to suppression of v-RASHa-induced senescence.  In contrast, IRE1\u03b1 promotes v-RASHa-induced senescence in the absence of XBP1 and is required for suppression of malignant transformation.  Gene expression profiling of v-RASHa keratinocytes deficient in IRE1\u03b1 identified a number of RIDD candidate mRNA substrates that are linked to senescence and malignant transformation. Among those identified was the ID family, of which Id1 mRNA was confirmed as a direct target of IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity using cell-free assays. Furthermore, shRNA knockdown of Id1 mRNA rescued the senescence phenotype in v-RASHa keratinocytes with inactive IRE1\u03b1. Together, these results suggest that the balance between IRE1\u03b1-XBP1S and IRE1\u03b1-RIDD determines whether a premalignant tumor cell undergoes proliferation and tumor progression or senescence and tumor suppression.\n\tNext, we showed that regulation of IRE1\u03b1 RNase outputs in v-RASHa keratinocytes can be modulated by the potent TGF\u03b21 tumor suppressor pathway. TGF\u03b21 treatment significantly enhanced v-RASHa- induced senescence which was associated with dampened ER stress and Xbp1 mRNA splicing but caused greater downregulation of RIDD substrates.  Treatment of v-RASHa keratinocytes with the TGF\u03b21 type I receptor inhibitor SB-431542, previously shown to inhibit v-RASHa-induced senescence, enhanced Xbp1 mRNA splicing and attenuated RIDD.   Pharmacological inactivation or depletion of IRE1\u03b1 prevented TGF\u03b21-induced senescence independent of XBP1 and this was not due inhibition of TGF\u03b21-induced transcriptional activation.  Conversely, pharmacologically-induced ER stress inhibited TGF\u03b21-induced senescence and growth arrest in v-RASHa keratinocytes.  This inhibition resulted from inactivation of downstream TGF\u03b21 signaling through a mechanism that involved impairment of ligand-induced receptor internalization.  Together, selective modulation of v-RASHa-induced IRE1\u03b1 RNase activity toward an mRNA decay pathway by TGF\u03b21 may suppress tumorigenesis by promoting senescence.  Furthermore, ER stress, which promotes the adaptive functions of the UPR, represents a new mechanism to inactivate TGF\u03b21 signaling and inhibit the senescence response.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10681], "author_name_tesi": "Blazanin, Nicholas ", "last_name_ssi": "Blazanin", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Adam Bleier Glick", "Gary H Perdew", "Curtis John Omiecinski", "Wendy Hanna Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Adam Bleier Glick, Dissertation Advisor", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Curtis John Omiecinski, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ER stress", "UPR", "IRE1alpha", "RIDD", "ras", "senescence", "TGFbeta"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Numerical Modeling of Laser-silicon Interactions during Formation of Selective Emitters", "id": "14560", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7348", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The formation of highly doped selective emitters improves the efficiency of silicon-based solar cells by lowering the contact resistance at the interface between the silicon front surface and the metal contacts.

A mathematical model, which solves for the temperature, velocity, and dopant concentration fields, is used to investigate the characteristics of the molten region during laser doping with a continuous-wave green laser (\u03bb = 532 nm) moving over the sample at speeds up to 8 m/s and laser output powers ranging from 5 to 20 W.
