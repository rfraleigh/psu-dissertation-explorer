A Class 1 hydrate reservoir is more preferable than class 2 and class 3 hydrate accumulations because a small change of pressure and temperature can induce hydrate dissociation. In this study, production characteristics from class 1 methane-hydrate reservoirs by means of conventional depressurization technique are studied. In this work, the production characteristics and efficiency from different production strategies (mainly focused on a constant bottom-hole pressure production scheme) such as well-completion locations, well spacing, and production scheduling are investigated. \nIn the production of conventional gas reservoirs using a constant bottom-hole pressure production scheme, both gas and water production rates exponentially decrease with time. However, for methane-hydrate reservoirs, gas production rate exponentially declines with time whereas water production rate increases with time because methane hydrate dissociation increases water saturation of the reservoir. \nThe effects of well-completion locations on the production performances are examined. The simulation results indicate that the moving well completion location strategy provides better gas production performance than the fixed completion location strategy. The optimum well-completion location (using a moving completion location strategy) is at the middle of free-gas zone. Due to the effects of hydrate saturation on formation permeability, one should not complete a well in the hydrate zone.  \nThe effect of well spacing on the production efficiency is also investigated. As expected, smaller well-spacing system yields more total gas production and it can dissociate gas-hydrate more rapidly than the larger well-spacing system. However, the number of wells increases when the well-spacing decreases resulting in the increase of the capital investment of the project. Based on this study, when the well-spacing increased about 100 percent (from 45.0 acres to 74.38 acres) the cumulative gas production decreased about 8.4 percent at 1,000 days of production. Therefore, once the similar simulation study for a particular reservoir has been performed, the optimum well spacing for a specific reservoir can be determined.  \nThe effect of well scheduling on the production performance is also examined. In multiple-well systems, starting all production wells at the same time provides faster hydrate dissociation. However, based on this study, starting production wells at different times yields more produced gas (about 10 percent by volume) even though less gas-hydrate dissociates. Therefore, starting production wells in the multiple-well system at different times could help in improving the gas production efficiency.   \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6088], "author_name_tesi": "Silpngarmlert, Suntichai ", "last_name_ssi": "Silpngarmlert", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Suntichai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Luis F Ayala H", "Michael Adebola Adewumi", "Zuleima T Karpyn", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Committee Chair", "Luis F Ayala H, Committee Member", "Michael Adebola Adewumi, Committee Member", "Zuleima T Karpyn, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["reservoir simulation", "production characteristics", "methane hydrate", "Numerical model", "production strategy"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "A Composite-Based Retro-Prediction Method for Jet Contrail Outbreaks Over the United States\n\n", "id": "10033", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "81", "abstract_tesi": "The cirrus-level contrails (condensation trails) produced by jet aircraft likely have contributed to recent climate changes on regional and sub-regional scales in the U.S. and Europe.  Accordingly, there is growing concern about reducing the impacts of contrails on climate, especially the surface temperature, through improved forecasting\u2014in real time\u2014of when and where they are most likely to occur.  This research develops a climatology of upper troposphere (UT) meteorological conditions associated with multiple occurrences of contrails, or outbreaks, for sub-regions of the U.S. in the mid-season months of 2000-2002.  The climatology consists of composites (i.e., multi-case averages) of UT variables developed using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction-National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP-NCAR) reanalysis data, and is the first step in designing and verifying a retro-prediction method for contrail outbreaks.  For mapping the UT climatology of contrail outbreaks, the study develops an objective (GIS-based) regionalization of the conterminous U.S. from the overlaps of outbreak areas in the 2000-2002 period.  The regionalization reveals that the high-frequency areas of contrail outbreaks vary spatially according to mid-season month, although the Midwest U.S. has the maximum frequencies on average for the year. The UT composites of meteorological variables indicate that contrail outbreaks tend to occur in advance (to the east) of baroclinic weather systems (troughs, fronts, jet streams), which have associated upward vertical motion, moistening of the air, a thicker upper troposphere (i.e., higher and colder tropopause), and horizontal wind shear.  However, statistical analyses (e.g., contingency, logit modeling) of UT conditions associated with contrail outbreaks, reveal that the utility of particular meteorological variables and their associated map characteristics (magnitude, pattern, gradient) in retro-predicting outbreaks for the 2000-2002 study period differs by sub-region and mid-season month.  Using the statistical model results of which UT variables are the best retro-predictors for each sub-region and mid-season month, the research conducts a verification study that involves retro-predicting contrail outbreaks for July and October in 2008, and January and April 2009.  The results of the verification study are mostly positive.  They reveal that a relatively simple map-based method of retro-predicting contrail outbreaks is successful in certain U.S. sub-regions and mid-season months (e.g., the Central region in April).  Further verification studies are needed to refine the method and make it suitable for forecasting contrail outbreaks.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [82], "author_name_tesi": "Silva, Armand Daniel", "last_name_ssi": "Silva", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniel", "first_name_ssi": "Armand", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Mark Carleton", "Andrew Mark Carleton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Mark Carleton, Thesis Advisor", "Andrew Mark Carleton, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["contrails", "regionalization", "retro-prediction", "upper troposphere", "aviation", "climate diagnostics", "synoptic climatology"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "INFLUENCE OF OXIDE MICROSTRUCTURE ON CORROSION BEHAVIOR OF ZIRCONIUM-BASED MODEL ALLOYS\n\n\n", "id": "7952", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4168", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-07-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The extensive utilization of zirconium-based alloys in fuel cladding and other reactor internal components in the nuclear power industry has led to the continuous improvement of these alloys. At the present moment, demands for better performing nuclear fuel cladding materials are increasing. Also, new reactor designs have been proposed that would require the materials to withstand even more rigorous conditions. One of the factors that limit s fuel cladding utilization in nuclear reactors is uniform corrosion and the consequent hydriding of the fuel. In an attempt to develop mechanistic understanding of the role of alloying elements in the growth of a stable protective oxide, a series of model zirconium-based alloys was prepared (Zr-xFe-yCr, Zr-xCu-yMo, Zr xNb-ySn, for various x and y, pure Zr and Zircaloy-4) and examined with advanced characterization techniques. The alloys were corrosion tested in autoclaves under three different conditions: 360oC water, 500oC steam and 500oC supercritical water in excess of 400 days. These autoclave testing conditions simulate nuclear reactor environment for both current designs (360oC water) and the new supercritical water reactor (500oC steam and 500oC supercritical water) proposed by the generation-IV initiative. The oxide films formed were systematically examined at the Advanced Photon Source using microbeam synchrotron radiation diffraction and fluorescence of cross-sectional samples to determine the oxide phases present and their crystallographic texture as a function of distance from the metal/oxide interface. Also, the overall texture of the oxide layers was investigated using synchrotron radiation diffraction in frontal geometry.\nThe corrosion kinetics is a function of the alloy system and showed a wide range of behaviors, from immediately unstable oxide growth to stable behavior. The corrosion weight gains from testing at high temperature are a factor of five higher than those measured at 360oC but the protectiveness ranking of the alloys is similar.\nMeasured pole figures from different oxides in different corrosion regimes showed that monoclinic oxides grow in slightly distinct directions: protective oxides grow along the (-904)m pole, wheter non-protective oxides grow along or close to the (-302)m pole. The angle in between these two directions ((-904)m and (-302)m) is       about 6o.\nMicrobeam synchrotron radiation diffraction and fluorescence was performed in the oxide layers and systematic differences are observed in protective and non-protective oxides, both near the oxide/metal interface and in the bulk of the oxide layers. The non-protective oxide interfaces show a smooth transition from metal to oxide with metal diffraction peaks disappearing as the monoclinic oxide peaks appear. In contrast, in a protective oxide, a complex structure near the oxide/metal interface was seen, showing peaks from Zr3O suboxide and a highly oriented tetragonal oxide phase with specific orientation relationships with the monoclinic oxide and the base metal.\nThe highly oriented tetragonal phase, only present in protective oxides, is believed to be a precursor to the formation of monoclinic oxide found in the bulk of the oxide layer. This plane may promote stable growth by causing the oxide to form in a manner that maximizes occupation of the substrate surface and minimizes stress accumulation, leading to more stable oxide growth. The association seen in this work of the precursor oxide phase with protective oxides and its orientation relationship with the monoclinic oxide, combined with the difference in oxide growth direction seen between protective and non-protective oxides, is interpreted as evidence that this phase allows a more properly oriented oxide to grow, in a way that minimizes stress accumulation and therefore delays the oxide transition to larger oxide thicknesses.\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4143], "author_name_tesi": "Silva, Marcelo Jose Gomes da", "last_name_ssi": "Silva", "middle_name_ssi": "Jose Gomes da", "first_name_ssi": "Marcelo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Barry Earl Scheetz", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Robert J Comstock", "Jeremy T Busby"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta, Committee Chair", "Barry Earl Scheetz, Committee Member", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Member", "Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Member", "Robert J Comstock, Committee Member", "Jeremy T Busby, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["microstructure", "zirconium oxide", "zirconium model-alloys", "corrosion behaviour"]}, {"year_isi": 2000, "title_ssi": "Accreditation, Knowledge, and Strategies of Professionalizing Occupations\n", "id": "5824", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4226", "defended_at_dtsi": "2000-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tEver since specialized accrediting agencies began to proliferate in the United States during the early decades of the twentieth century, scholars have speculated about the goals and strategies of these agencies and their effect on professional education.

Hematocrit is defined as the ratio of the volume of packed red blood cells to total blood volume.  Changes in hematocrit have a considerable effect on the viscoelastic properties of blood and can alter the fluid dynamics throughout circulatory support devices like the PVAD.  Unlike adults that generally have a more consistent hematocrit, the pediatric population has been shown to have a more varied hematocrit range anywhere from 20%-60%.  Additionally, the animals used for PVAD testing tend to have a comparatively low hematocrit in the 20%-30% range.  For this study, three different non-Newtonian blood analogs were created to match the viscoelastic properties of 20%, 40% and 60% hematocrit pediatric blood.  These fluids were then used in an in vitro mock circulatory loop designed to mimic the pediatric circulatory system.  In order to examine the effect of hematocrit on the flow through the PVAD, planar particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to develop whole field velocity profiles.  These fluid dynamic measurements helped to describe the flow both quantitatively and qualitatively throughout the cardiac cycle.  The changes observed in the flow field of the different hematocrit blood analogs are important because flow characteristics like stagnation and turbulent flow have the potential to increase the chances of clot formation, cause blood damage, and disrupt flow.  While the general flow pattern within the PVAD was similar, the varying blood analogs created distinct inlet/outlet jets and rotational flow patterns.  Specifically, the 20% hematocrit blood analog created a slightly higher peak velocity inlet jet that penetrated deeper into the blood sac earlier in the cardiac cycle.  The more viscoelastic fluid, the 60% hematocrit blood analog, created an inlet jet that developed later and was maintained longer into the cardiac cycle, resulting in a more delayed rotational flow pattern.  This delay continued into systole and resulted in a lower velocity outlet jet in the more viscoelastic fluids.  It is clear that changes in hematocrit alter the fluid dynamics in the PVAD.  Understanding the exact effect of hematocrit on the PVAD flow helps to understand animal testing data and guide future use of the device in pediatric patients in a hematocrit range of 20%-60%.

The first study, Patient Evaluations of the Interpersonal Care Experience (ICE) in U.S. Hospitals: A Factor Analysis of the HCAHPS survey seeks to determine the degree to which HCAHPS evaluations are responding to underlying aspects of the patient care experience via a two-step factor analytic process on a nationally representative split sample of HCAHPS performance from 2007-2011.

We also extended a wavepacket dynamics model for simulating linear optical properties, including one-photon absorption and resonance Raman scattering, to\ninclude nonlinear optical properties, such as two-photon absorption and resonance hyper-Raman scattering.  Interpretation of the derived expressions shows that\nit is possible to simulate each technique using a common set of parameters.  It is illustrated through applications to small molecules and the fluorescent dye\nrhodamine 6G that these expressions can be employed generally in cases where vibronic effects are important and when the harmonic oscillator approximation is\nvalid.  Finally, we show that our implementation of analytical excited state energy gradients in the framework of time-dependent density functional theory allows for\nthe efficient simulation of linear optical properties for large molecules.  This reduces time and number of calculations required to generate a resonance Raman\nspectrum, while maintaining accuracy.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8635], "author_name_tesi": "Silverstein, Daniel William", "last_name_ssi": "Silverstein", "middle_name_ssi": "William", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lasse Jensen", "Barbara Jane Garrison", "John B Asbury", "Victor Nistor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lasse Jensen, Dissertation Advisor", "Barbara Jane Garrison, Committee Member", "John B Asbury, Committee Member", "Victor Nistor, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory", "Linear Optical Properties", "Nonlinear Optical Properties", "Raman Scattering"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "A STUDY OF THE LATE POSTCLASSIC AZTEC-TARASCAN FRONTIER\nIN NORTHERN GUERRERO, M\u00c9XICO:\nTHE OZTUMA-CUTZAMALA PROJECT", "id": "5860", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2664", "defended_at_dtsi": "2000-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this thesis is to examine issues associated with the formation and\nmaintenance of the Late Postclassic frontier between the Aztec and Tarascan Empires.

As a fuel additive, functionalized graphene sheets (FGS) without or with the decoration of metal catalysts, such as platinum (Pt) or polyoxometalates (POM) nanoparticles, were examined against conventional materials including nanometer sized fumed silica and aluminum particles. Supercritical pyrolysis experiments were performed as a function of temperature, residence time, and particle type, using a high pressure and temperature flow reactor designed to provide isothermal and isobaric flow conditions. Supercritical pyrolysis results showed that the addition of FGS-based particles at a loading concentration of 50 ppmw increased the conversion rates and reduced apparent activation energies for methylcyclohexane (MCH) and n-dodecane (n-C12H26) fuels. For example, conversion rates, and formations of C1-C5 n-alkanes and C2-C6 1-alkenes were significantly increased by 43.5 %, 59.1 %, and 50.0 % for MCH decomposition using FGS19 (50 ppmw) at a temperature of 820 K and reduced pressure of 1.36. In addition, FGS decorated with 20 wt % Pt (20wt%Pt@FGS) at a loading concentration of 50 ppmw exhibited additional enhancement in the conversion rate of n-C12H26 by up to 24.0 % compared to FGS. Especially, FGS-based particles seem to alter initiation mechanisms, which could result in higher hydrogen formation. Hydrogen selectivities for both MCH and n-C12H26 decompositions were observed to increase by nearly a factor of 2 and 10, respectively. Supercritical injection and combustion experiments were conducted using a high pressure and temperature windowed combustion chamber coupled to the flow reactor through a feed system. Supercritical injection/combustion experiments indicated that the presence of a small amount of particles (100 ppmw) in the fuel affected the injection, ignition, and subsequent combustion for hydrocarbon fuels. For instance, the addition of Pt@FGS reduced the core lengths of the supercritical jets by up to 56.7 % (MCH) and 68.8 % (n-C12H26) depending on flow rate. Supercritical combustion studies demonstrated that the addition of 100 ppmw 20wt%Pt@FGS to n-C12H26 fuel reduced ignition delay times by nearly a factor of 3 (12.4 to 4.1 ms), increased spreading angles by approximately 32.0 % (15.4 to 20.3o), reduced the flame lift-off length by 54.0 % (1.74 to 0.8 mm), and demonstrated an increase in conversion by 35.0 % relative to the pure fuel baseline at a volumetric flow rate of 5.0 mL/min. The enhancing mechanisms of FGS-based materials on pyrolysis and combustion were studied using ReaxFF molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The simulation results were in good agreement with the experimental observations, showing enhanced conversion rates and lowered activation energies in the presence of the particles. A combination of Pt and FGS facilitated catalytic dehydrogenation forming a n-C12H25 radical. Another catalytic initiation step is hydrogenation of the fuel molecule resulting in production of an alkanium ion, as a free hydrogen atom is donated to the fuel molecule. Furthermore, hydroxyl radical (OH), which is dissociated from FGS, was found to participate in dehydrogenation of the fuel forming water molecules. The recovery of the catalyst was observed, resulting from dissociation of H2 molecule from the surface of the Pt. Using the ReaxFF embedded with nudged elastic band (NEB) method, it was found that the bicomposite structure of Pt@FGS served to lower the reaction energy and energy barrier for dehydrogenation, which could result in the enhanced conversion rates and increased product yields. These results demonstrate that a low mass loading of a high surface area material employed either as an additive or a means of distributing another additive can significantly enhance, and be used to tailor, the conversion of liquid hydrocarbon fuels/propellants under supercritical conditions, resulting in reduced ignition delay time and improved combustion. Such enhancements benefit practical propulsion systems which require high conversion efficiency in a short residence time.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11697], "author_name_tesi": "Sim, Hyung Sub", "last_name_ssi": "Sim", "middle_name_ssi": "Sub", "first_name_ssi": "Hyung", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter", "Richard A Yetter", "Domenic Adam Santavicca", "Adrianus C Van Duin", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard A Yetter, Dissertation Advisor", "Richard A Yetter, Committee Chair", "Domenic Adam Santavicca, Committee Member", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Committee Member", "Robert Martin Rioux Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supercritical Pyrolysis", "Supercritical Combustion", "Particulate Fuel Additives", "Graphene", "Platinum Nanoparticles", "Hydrocarbons"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Managing Supply Chain Sustainability through Microfinance and Recycling", "id": "22783", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10345", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As environmental laws and regulations tighten and the expectations for social responsibility of manufacturers rise, the conventional supply chain has responded by incorporating economic, environmental, and social content. In response to the demand for an increased social aspect of a sustainable supply chain, this study proposes the concept of supply chain microfinance (SCMF) as a financial sustainability solution to the problem of high interest rates in microfinance.\nBased on a minimum interest rate obtained from a Black-Scholes debt (BSD) model, this study first develops scenario-based stochastic microcredit contract models to calculate a proper interest rate that minimizes both the risk of adverse selection and the risk of moral hazard. The suggested models also include financial statement analysis through financial ratios to reflect the unique characteristics of the microfinance business environment. \nNext, this study formulates the concept of SCMF as a Stackelberg game model in the framework of a newsvendor problem for three entities, a manufacturer, a supplier, and a bank, based on the concept of SCMF. In the model, the manufacturer as a leader decides on an optimal order quantity and an optimal interest rate of a microcredit loan to a supplier. In a fair price trade, the supplier as a follower decides on an optimal wholesale price. The bank as a sub-leader decides on an optimal interest rate for a bank loan to the manufacturer. \nTo investigate the financial sustainability and outreach of MFIs in terms of interest rate and default rate, this study employs an interest rate premium methodology for the evaluation of microcredit interest rates, along with a default rate premium methodology for the evaluation of microcredit default rate. To employ the Black-Scholes (BS) model to calculate microfinance institutions\u2019 (MFIs) default rates, this study preliminarily tests the validation of MFIs\u2019 asset values and default rates of geometric Brownian motion (GBM) using the Ryan-Joiner test and the chi-square test on two-way tables. \nFinally, to address the environmental aspects of a sustainable supply chain, this study conducts a life cycle analysis of energy usage and air emissions of two types of carpet, wool carpet and nylon carpet. In the first step, the analysis estimates the total energy requirement and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) in the carpets\u2019 six life cycles -- raw material acquisition, raw material production, product manufacturing, product installation, product use, and product recycling -- along with transportation in a sustainable supply chain.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10018], "author_name_tesi": "Sim, Jaehun ", "last_name_ssi": "Sim", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jaehun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu", "Paul Griffin", "Tao Yao", "Douglas J Thomas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu, Committee Chair", "Paul Griffin, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "Douglas J Thomas, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Microfinance", "Sustainable Supply Chain", "Carbon Emission", "and Energy"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "FACTORS THAT INFLUECE UNDERREPRESENTED RACIAL & ETHNIC MINORITY STUDENTS\u2019 SUCCESS IN GRADUATE STEM PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES & ENGLAND", "id": "hq37vn57m", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12807", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-04-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the U.S. and England racial/ethnic minority student success in STEM graduate disciplines is important to HEI administrators and those policy makers concerned with ensuring viable and healthy economies and communities.

For this dissertation I employed qualitative research methods (and quantitative baseline data) to design and conduct comparative phenomenological case study on the factors that influence minority success in graduate STEM. National clearinghouse data in both countries and insights from interview with students, faculty, and administrators at four comprehensive public research institutions (two per country) were used to develop the themes of social and cultural capital (focusing on socioeconomic status and parental education/family support); educational preparation; and educational experiences/engagement (focusing on institutional/faculty support and mentoring) to make comparisons that could be useful to educators in both countries in the continuing efforts to increase success through widening participation initiatives.

In order to demonstrate that this practice is a complementary yet autonomous dramatic experience of theater, and thus a legitimate filmic form as worthy of consideration as its fictional and documentary homologues, I first deconstructed deeply rooted theater-centric beliefs responsible for the conceptual paucity surrounding what I coined as \u201cfilm-theater.\u201d Two main arguments have in effect diminished the potential for such films; namely that: 1). recording a theatrical production lessened the experience of the viewer and misrepresented the scenic space; and 2). the film should primarily \u201crespect\u201d its theatrical counterpart and undermine its own rhetoric in favor of the play\u2019s; i.e. the artistic vision of the filmmaker must be subservient to the design or supposed \u201cintention\u201d of the stage director. My research firmly departs from these assumptions of subordination. On a conceptual level, I argue that \u201cfilm-theater\u201d exhibits a distinctive cinematic language. My research also validates that the reciprocal influence between theater and film renews their respective esthetics and that \u201cfilm-theater\u201d yields to ontological and epistemological implications worthy of analysis. On a practical level, I show how \u201cfilm-theater\u201d can serve as a didactic device that contributes to, promotes and complements literary and scenic interpretations of theater. To fulfill these objectives, I organized my study according to four distinctive criteria of determination. I first redefined the new concept of \u201cfilm-theater\u201d. Secondly, I highlighted the singular nature of this category of film. I then assessed its status as a \u201cmonument\u201d in order to supplement its usual practical function as a \u201cdocument\u201d. Finally, I substantiated its value as an educational tool.

First, I use tools from exploratory  spatial statistics and an appropriately devised simulation framework to investigate the likelihood of a cell being infected given its proximity to an infected cell [Simeonov et al., 2010].\n\nNext, I focus on an exploratory summary statistic often used in the analysis of spatial point patterns called the pair correlation function.

The 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of a gene can have a significant effect on regulation at the levels of transcription and translation.  Post-transcription, the 5\u2019 UTR is capable of conferring mRNA stability, providing binding sites for translation machinery, containing degradation and/or localization signals, and other functions dependent on tertiary RNA structure and RNA-protein structure.  One gene in which the 5\u2019 UTR is essential for proper control of protein expression is Surfactant Protein A (SP-A).\nSP-A is one of four pulmonary surfactant-associated proteins, all of which are encoded by separate genes.  A thin liquid layer covers the distal airspaces or alveolar spaces.  Pulmonary surfactant is found between the air-liquid interface of the distal airspaces and its function is to reduce surface tension at low lung volumes and prevent alveolar collapse.  Pulmonary surfactant is comprised of proteins and lipids that together play a vital role in lung function and host defense.  Furthermore, aberrant expression of SP-A is a characteristic of many pulmonary diseases and disorders, including asthma, respiratory distress syndrome, and cancer, among others.\nPrevious studies have indicated that exon B of the SP-A 5\u2019 UTR may be a potent cis-acting element of post-transcriptional and translational regulation.  Using the luciferase assay and quantitative real-time PCR, the translational enhancer capacity of this 5\u2019 UTR exon was assessed to investigate the hypothesis that the 30-basepair exon B sequence is a cis-acting translational enhancer.  Transcription was normalized by using an SV40 promoter and through the calculation of a translational index (activity divided by relative mRNA content).  To investigate the function of exon B in the context of the whole SP-A 5\u2019 UTR, exon B was deleted from the 5\u2019 UTR.  In another construct, the exon B sequence was replaced with a 30-basepair random sequence.  Compared with the whole SP-A 5\u2019 UTR construct, these two constructs, which lack the exon B sequence, showed reduced luciferase activity.  This indicated that exon B is capable of increasing translation activity and could have resulted from an increase in stability, altered localization patterns, or an increase in translation efficiency.\nTo determine whether exon B acts as a translational enhancer in the context of other 5\u2019 UTR sequences, constructs that each contained one of two independent guest 5\u2019 UTRs cloned downstream of the B exon were used in a guest 5\u2019 UTR study.  The SP-B and SP-D 5\u2019 UTRs functioned as guest 5\u2019 UTRs.  While the size of the leader sequence appeared to have little effect on translation, constructs containing the complete exon B sequence were found to have activities twice as high as the activities of 5\u2019 UTR constructs containing only the guest 5\u2019 UTRs.  Constructs containing exon B also exhibited twice as much activity as those containing random 30-nucleotide sequences in place of exon B.  This indicated that exon B is a translational enhancer and functions in a sequence-specific manner.  Furthermore, the combination of the expression and real time PCR data suggest that SP-A 5\u2019 UTR exon B enhances expression by improving translational efficiency.  A finding unrelated to SP-A 5\u2019 UTR exon B was that the SP-D 5\u2019 UTR is stronger than the SP-B 5\u2019 UTR, meaning that it enhanced expression by a larger amount when the luciferase assay was used to measure activity.\nUsing a series of deletion mutations, as well as other site-directed mutagenesis changes, the region of this noncoding exon that is responsible for the expression enhancement was investigated.  For this, 5 basepairs were deleted at a time within the B exon of a complete SP-A 5\u2019 UTR-luciferase construct, and these deletion mutation constructs were transfected into NCI-H441 cells.  Luciferase assay results indicated that a 15-nucleotide region appeared to be important for exon B\u2019s translational enhancement.\nTranslation is a complex and dynamic biological process and is regulated at several levels and by various means.  While elucidating the precise mechanisms of SP-A translational control is beyond the scope of the present study, the resources and technology required to advance our understanding of these processes are available.  Future studies may reveal the trans-acting factors necessary for SP-A translation and how the process of regulating SP-A expression works from nuclear mRNA export to translation termination.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [762], "author_name_tesi": "Simmons, Brett Patrick", "last_name_ssi": "Simmons", "middle_name_ssi": "Patrick", "first_name_ssi": "Brett", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joanna Floros"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joanna Floros, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Surfactant Protein A", "Translation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Relationship among Types of Aggression, Pro-Social Behavior, Sex, and Perceived Emotional Distress\n", "id": "8395", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1584", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study was designed to examine forms of aggression and their relationship to sex, and\nemotional distress.

In the introduction I provide general background and information on the study system, zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), and one of its host species, Cucurbita pepo ssp. texana (a wild gourd). Also included in this section are background on the methods that I have used, which are Bayesian coalescent and tree building methods.\nThe first study (chapter two) was motivated by the fact that plant RNA viruses were considered more genetically stable than animal RNA viruses. Animal RNA viruses are assumed to achieve extremely high levels of genetic diversity as a result of their high mutation rates, rapid replication rates and large population sizes. However, it was believed that the same did not hold true for plant RNA viruses due to a combination of lower mutation rates, weaker immune selection, as well as the result of genetic bottlenecks during systemic movement through the plant and during horizontal transmission by aphids. Therefore, we determined the mean rate of nucleotide substitution for the coat protein (CP) of Pennsylvanian ZYMV samples using a Bayesian coalescent approach to be 5.0 x10-4 subs/site/year (4x10-4 - 8x10-4), which is within the range of those found for animal RNA viruses. As scant data were available on the timescale of the evolution of this virus within the Cucurbitaceae (squash, melon, cucumber), using the same approach we found the time to the most recent common ancestor for the lineages of ZYMV we sampled to be approximately 400 years  (HPD: 119-771 years) with a possible origin in Asia. In addition, we found evidence in support of purifying selection (dN/dS = 0.108). We also undertook an analysis of phylogeographical structure and found in situ evolution of ZYMV within individual countries, suggesting intermittent movement of ZYMV across geographic boundaries.\nSince we had established that the substitution rate estimate was in accord with those previously observed in animal RNA viruses, we sought to determine if plant RNA viruses exhibit quantifiable intra-host genetic diversity in the second study (chapter three). Most plant viral genetic diversity studies had focused on genetic diversity at the inter-host level; however, there was no consistency in the results of those studies that had considered intra-host genetic diversity. In addition, it was believed that population bottlenecks associated with both aphid-vectored transmission, as well as with systemic movement through the plant, drastically reduced the effective population size. Although there had been some in vitro work on the effect of population bottlenecks on viral genetic diversity in plant viruses, little work had been conducted in natural systems. Therefore, to assess intra-host genetic diversity, as well as the effect of the aphid induced population bottleneck on viral genetic diversity, we generated intra-host sequence data for the CP gene of ZYMV from two horizontally transmitted populations: one aphid-vectored and the other mechanically inoculated (to avoid aphid-related bottlenecks). We also sampled multiple time points from individual plants to assess intra-host viral genetic diversity.  We determined that despite the relatively frequent generation of mutations, most of these occurred only transiently, as they were deleterious and tended to be purged rapidly from the population. There appeared to be more population structure in the aphid vectored clones as indicated by multiple clones bearing the same mutations, the presence of a distinct sub-lineage, as well as several clones being more than one mutational step away from the consensus sequence. We also observed possible evidence of complementation occurring in trans. Unlike most comparable studies, we quantified the error rate associated with the RT-PCR procedure used in this study.   In doing so, we determined it was high enough to cause a portion of the mutations detected, indicating future intra-host studies of this nature should quantify the extent to which detected mutations are artificially induced.\nAlthough the CP is the most frequently studied protein of ZYMV, it is a multifunctional protein that is not the sole protein involved in aphid transmission.  Therefore, we decided to undertake full genome sequencing of these samples in the third study (chapter four). We had sequenced a limited number of clones with conventional cloning and Sanger sequencing (we averaged 35 clones per sample), but it was extremely difficult to detect minor variants with this method. Thus, we sought to increase coverage by uncovering mutations present in the population at low frequencies using deep sequencing. We used the same aphid vectored and mechanically inoculated samples from the previous study with a few modifications: we increased the number of time points in the field samples, and increased the number of serial passages in a mechanically transmitted experiment. We found that mutations persist during inter-host transmission events in both the aphid vectored and mechanically inoculated populations, suggesting that the vector-imposed bottleneck is not as extreme as previously supposed. Likewise, we found that mutations persist intra-host over time, indicating that systemic bottlenecks may not constrain viral genetic variation as severely as previously suggested. In addition, differential selective pressures as a result of transmission mode was suggested by the presence of minor alleles that move to fixation in the aphid vectored plants, but remain as low frequency alleles in the mechanically inoculated plants. We determined that the high level of coverage obtained during deep sequencing makes it the preferred method for detecting low frequency variants in the population.\nThe fourth study (chapter five) was prompted by the results I obtained while procuring vertically transmitted samples of ZYMV for sequencing, which showed that the seed transmission rate of ZYMV was three orders of magnitude greater than the most commonly cited rate (0.047%). Whether or not seed transmission occurred in ZYMV was a controversial issue as the rates in the literature ranged from 0-18.9%. Therefore, to definitively determine what the seed transmission rate of ZYMV was in C. pepo, we measured the seed transmission rate of this virus by visual inspection, RT-PCR, and antibody tests. We found a seed transmission rate of 1.6% using RT-PCR, and showed that vertically infected C. pepo plants are capable of initiating horizontal ZYMV infections, both mechanically and via an aphid vector (Myzus persicae). Thus, it appears that ZYMV infected seeds may act as viral reservoirs, thereby accounting for the current geographic distribution of ZYMV. We also found that vertical ZYMV infection in C. Pepo results in virtually symptomless infection and that antibody tests failed to detect vertical ZYMV infection, suggesting that current methods used to detect seed-borne variants of this viral pathogen need to be modified. \nThis dissertation explores the nucleotide substitution rate of ZYMV, the patterns and extent of viral genetic diversity within individual hosts, the effect of transmission mode on this diversity, as well as the vertical transmission rate of this virus. As a group, these studies reveal the underlying mechanisms of an emerging RNA virus that will serve to aid in managing this devastating crop pathogen. In addition, these studies highlight the need to consider how methodological choices may impact viral population genetic results and, by extension, data interpretation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2172], "author_name_tesi": "Simmons, Heather Elaine", "last_name_ssi": "Simmons", "middle_name_ssi": "Elaine", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew George Stephenson", "Andrew George Stephenson", "Edward C Holmes", "Frederick Eugene Gildow Jr.", "Andrew Fraser Read", "Michael Axtell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew George Stephenson, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Chair", "Edward C Holmes, Committee Chair", "Frederick Eugene Gildow Jr., Committee Member", "Andrew Fraser Read, Committee Member", "Michael Axtell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Zucchini yellow mosaic virus", "intra-host genetic diversity", "seed transmission", "potyvirus", "transmission bottleneck"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EVALUATION OF CAVITATION-CORROSION RESISTANCE AND RECIPROCATING WEAR RESISTANCE OF SURFACE COATED AND CRYOGENICALLY TREATED SILICON BRASS\n", "id": "8375", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4642", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cavitation and corrosion resistance are important characteristics to consider in marine environments with flowing liquid.

Considerable work has been done to produce surface coating treatments that resist cavitation and corrosion, but little work has been done to treat the entire material throughout.  Surface coating and cryogenic treatment combinations of silicon brass were analyzed in this study due to the potential for increased erosion resistance using a relatively cheap treatment.  The cavitation environment was provided by an ultrasonic cavitation apparatus in two different corrosive mediums, tap and Artificial Seawater.  The samples to be tested and analyzed were coated with one of four paint pens, cryogenically treated, and tested.  During testing it was noticed that the coating was not adhering well to the substrate and additional efforts had to be taken to assist the coating adhere better.  To help the coating adhere better, some samples were oxidized or sandblasted.  A set of samples tested in artificial seawater had the coating removed prior to testing because it was determined that through testing the poorly adhering coating contributed significantly to the samples mass loss.  The samples tested with the coating intact did not perform as well as the samples that had the coating removed prior to testing that exhibited a mass loss roughly 10 fold less than the baseline material.  In addition to the cavitation and corrosion resistance tests, reciprocating wear tests were also conducted on samples subjected to the same treatments above to determine if the treatment could be used to reduce mass loss due to reciprocating wear.

The main objective of the research presented was to develop finite element modeling (FEM) techniques and closed-form kinematic equations to describe the seismic behavior of a 4SSG curtain wall system.  The computer software SAP2000 was used for the FEM.  Most of the previous experimental seismic testing of curtain wall systems did not incorporate a FEM for comparison.  The FEM technique employed was developed with models of the curtain wall systems used in previous experiments and then calibrated based on existing test results.  Once the FEM modeling technique was validated, it was then applied to a curtain wall system featuring a re-entrant corner that was tested during the course of the study as the experimental part of the project.  The boundary conditions tested are referred to as unitized sway, stick-built-with-vertical-slip, and stick-built.  The analytical focus of this thesis was on the stick-built-with-vertical-slip and stick-built boundary conditions.  The experimental part of the project consisted of physical full-scale racking testing of three 4SSG mockups based on AAMA 501.6 loading protocol.  Each mockup had the same size and geometry and was first tested for the unitized sway condition.  Then modifications were made to vary how the mockup panels would be attached to each other and/or how the mockups would be attached to the testing facility.  The experimental test data and videos recorded during the test, served to verify or improve the FEM results.  The details of the FEM modeling results obtained from the experimental part of the project and videos of the performance of the mockups were then used to develop closed-form kinematic equations that describe the drift capacity of the system.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4602], "author_name_tesi": "Simmons, Nicholas C", "last_name_ssi": "Simmons", "middle_name_ssi": "C", "first_name_ssi": "Nicholas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Memari", "Ali M Memari", "Andres Lepage", "Carlo G Pantano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Memari, Thesis Advisor", "Ali M Memari, Thesis Advisor", "Andres Lepage, Thesis Advisor", "Carlo G Pantano, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stick-built-with-vertical-slip", "Unitized-sway", "Coach 6", "CMA", "point tracking", "video analysis", "SAP2000", "FEM", "Physical testing", "Curtain wall", "Glazing", "Structural Silicone", "Stick-built", "Racking", "AAMA 501.6", "seismic"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF A PHASE FIELD MODEL OF HYDRIDE MORPHOLOGY IN ZIRCONIUM ALLOY NUCLEAR FUEL CLADDING", "id": "14815pjs5523", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14815", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Zirconium alloys are widely used in the nuclear industry as fuel cladding due to their particular properties. During normal operation conditions, hydrogen enters the cladding and forms brittle hydride precipitates. The effect of the presence of hydrides on the deformation behavior of the cladding largely depends on the orientation and the morphology of the hydrides. Because of the zirconium texture and the thermo-mechanical conditions, hydrides usually precipitate circumferentially in the cladding. However, temperature cycling and the application of additional stress can lead to hydride reorientation in the radial direction, which eases crack propagation through the cladding, and thus threatens the integrity of the fuel rod. \n\nIn an effort to understand the mechanisms governing the orientation and the morphology of the hydrides, two different phase field models were developed using the Multi-physics Object Oriented Simulation Environment MOOSE. The first model was first proposed by Wheeler, Boettinger, and McFadden and is known as the WBM model. The second model, called the grand potential model, has the advantage of allowing the definition of the interfacial thickness independently of the bulk free energy of the different phases of the system. It thus allows the use of thicker interfaces, which means coarser mesh, making the simulations computationally less expensive. Because of the importance of the mechanical contributions in the nucleation and growth of hydride precipitates, both phase field models have then been coupled with elastic schemes. The first scheme, called the Voight-Taylor scheme (VTS), was shown to strongly overestimate the elastic free energy contribution at the interface, while the Khachaturya's scheme (KHS) performed better with just a small underestimation of the elastic free energy at the interface. \n\nIn the project presented in this thesis, the multi-phase models simulated the alpha phase of the zirconium as well as the zeta, the gamma, and the delta phase of the hydrides. The models are dimensional, use the Gibbs free energy of formation of the different phases and the mechanical properties found in the literature. In this study, the phase field models have been carefully verified, meaning that their implementations have been successfully tested by comparing their results to widely accepted solutions. Once the models were applied to the zirconium hydride system, the first steps towards the validation of the code were promising. Simulated hydrides grew preferentially in the direction of the basal plane of the zirconium matrix, thus reproducing experimental observations.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15956], "author_name_tesi": "Simon, Pierre Clement", "last_name_ssi": "Simon", "middle_name_ssi": "Clement", "first_name_ssi": "Pierre", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Arthur Thompson Motta", "Michael R.

Science is comprised of the actual research practices involved with producing knowledge and publishing articles, and it is also comprised of organizations designed to support research, such as university departments and professional societies.  Every research project is directed toward a specific set of goals and utilizes a specific set of theoretical and methodological concepts.  Similarly, the social organizations that support research are also directed toward a specific set of goals and concepts.  These goals and concepts can be called \u201cresearch topics\u201d.  A research topic is any theory, method, or object of study that scientists make use of in their research.  Some research topics get a lot of attention from scientists, and have a large literature associated with them.  Other research topics receive hardly any attention and have very little literature associated with them.  Research topics also vary in the extent to which they have social organizations devoted them.  Some research topics are highly institutionalized, having university departments devoted to them and large professional societies.

Although various proxy records have been used to reconstruct the timing of these MCA and LIA megadroughts in the western United States, there still exists great uncertainty in the magnitude and spatial coherence of such droughts in various cross sections of western North America (i.e. the Pacific Northwest region),especially on decadal to centennial timescales. This uncertainty motivated the following study to establish a causal link between the climate forcing that induced these megadroughts and the spatiotemporal response of regional North American hydroclimates,such as those of the Pacific Northwest, American Southwest, and the Great Plains,to this forcing.  \n \nThis study seeks to establish a better understanding of the influence of tropical Pacific,tropical Indian, extratropical North Pacific, and North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on North American drought during the MCA (950-1250 AD) and LIA (1400-1700 AD). We force NCAR\u2019s Community Atmosphere Model version 5.1.1 (CAM 5), as part of a special configuration of the fully coupled Community Earth Systems Model version 1.0.5 (CESM 1.0.5), with prescribed proxy-reconstructed tropical Pacific, tropical Indian, extratropical North Pacific, and North Atlantic SST anomalies from the MCA and LIA, in order to investigate the influence that these SST anomalies had on the spatiotemporal patterns of drought in North America. To isolate the effects of individual and multiple ocean basin SSTs on the North American climate system, the conducted model experiments use a variety of SST permutations in the tropical Pacific, tropical Indian, extratropical North Pacific, and North Atlantic basins as climate forcing. In order to quantify the spatiotemporal response of the western North American hydroclimate system to these SST forcing permutations, precipitation data derived from the MCA and LIA model experiments are presented here as MCA anomalies relative to the LIA reference period. The spatiotemporal precipitation patterns from the model experiments indicate that in the Pacific Northwest, the MCA and LIA were anomalously wet and dry periods, respectively, a finding that is largely supported by the available lake sediment proxy records. This pattern contrasts with the dry MCA/wet LIA pattern diagnosed in model experiments for the U.S. Southwest and Great Plains regions and indicated by tree ring-based proxy data. Thus, the CAM 5 model experiments confirm the wet/dry meridional precipitation dipole pattern suggested by proxy data for the western U.S. during the MCA and LIA and highlight the role that the natural variability of tropical Pacific, tropical Indian, extratropical North Pacific, and North Atlantic SSTs played in driving this spatiotemporal climate pattern and its related teleconnections. Lastly, this study conducts a diagnosis of the physical mechanisms of causality which link the remote SST forcing specified by any given MCA and LIA model experiment and the regional atmospheric response in western North America. This diagnosis ultimately reveals that the simulated MCA-LIA tropospheric circulation anomalies (sea level pressure, mid-tropospheric vertical velocity, and upper-tropospheric geopotential height fields) associated with the MCA megadroughts dynamically support the prevalent western North American MCA-LIA precipitation anomaly patterns identified in the conducted model experiments, and exhibit spatial coherency, in the horizontal and vertical, resembling those of tropically-forced Rossby wave train-like structures which link remote SST forcing regions with local, regional response regions in the western North American troposphere.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10801], "author_name_tesi": "Simon, Steven Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Simon", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Mann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Mann, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Climate modeling", "Western North American Hydroclimatic Variability", "Medieval Climate Anomaly", "Little Ice Age", "Megadrought"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Studies of OH and HO2 in the Region of the Arctic Winter Tropopause", "id": "15442", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7863", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study is based on in situ measurements made on the NASA DC-8 during the SAGE III Ozone Loss and Validation Experiment/Third European Stratospheric Experiment on Ozone (SOLVE/THESEO) campaign which was conducted in the 1999-2000 Arctic winter (November, 1999 to April, 2000).

A conceptual framework for this work was developed from consideration of the teacher education and distance education literature and the small body of literature relating to distance delivered pre-service teacher education.  \n\nThe findings were presented using the three fields of literature from the conceptual framework as a structure to identify points of convergence and limitations.  It was found that understanding of distance education was strong among the programs of distance delivered pre-service teacher education studied.  Understanding of teacher education was weaker and the intersection of practice that distance delivered pre-service teacher education should represent was weak.  \n\nIt was concluded that success in distance delivered pre-service teacher education would seem to come from resolving the very particular issues and challenges that arise at the intersection of distance education and teacher education.  Suggestions for good practice are presented and a number of recommendations for further research and development are made.  The study concludes with comment on the increasing use of information and communication technologies such as the Internet and the World Wide Web which seem to provide enhancement to print and other delivery technologies and appear to be allowing innovations in delivery that support the core pre-service teacher education elements of dialog and reflection.

Currently, rates of active travel are particularly low among the general population in the United States. Understanding how these policies influence travel behavior, health, and health disparities will inform future research and improve policy development. Accordingly, this dissertation aims to (1) develop and implement an appropriate checklist for examining Complete Streets policy quality, (2) identify how the presence of policies, policy language, and time since policy implementation influence the aforementioned outcomes, (3) investigate how leaders in communities with and without Complete Streets policies perceive the aforementioned outcomes. A new policy checklist was created for this study. Both this new checklist, as well as an existing checklist, were used to examine policy quality among county-level Complete Streets policies (n=52). These scores were then used to examine the association between policy quality and active travel, health outcomes, healthcare access, gathered from national datasets. Next, Complete Streets counties (n=52) were matched with control counties (n=52), to quantitatively examine differences in travel behavior, health, and healthcare access by county type, race/ethnicity, and income level. Finally, interviews were conducted with community leaders to qualitatively examine differences in the physical environment, travel behavior, health, and health disparities. Results led to seven major conclusions. First, the policy checklist used may not be of importance. Second, time since implementation was related to health outcomes; however, policy quality was not. Third, active travel was higher among control counties than Complete Streets counties; however, among certain populations, active travel was greater among Complete Streets counties participants. Fourth, health and healthcare access were greater among Complete Streets counties as compared to control counties. Fifth, no differences surfaced among the basis of county type in community leader interviews. Sixth, mixed results emerged on county leader perceptions of the previously mentioned variables. Finally, community leaders tended to believe Complete Streets policies would be beneficial in their counties. Ultimately, this dissertation informs the Complete Streets literature and may be useful by researchers and policymakers, alike, in determining the appropriate changes to be made to Complete Streets policies, as well as the populations to be targeted for future intervention.

In order to explain the mechanisms by which victimization affects mental health, Meyer (2003b) theorized that sexual orientation victimization increased more proximal indicators of stress related to sexual orientation, or minority stress, such as fears of being discovered to be LGB and internalized homophobia. These were hypothesized to increase mental health and behavioral problems with further consideration being given to possible mediators or moderators of this association. Using a sample of 528 LGB youth, I tested Meyer\u2019s theoretical model, considering personal resources (self-esteem and mastery), social support, LGB-specific social support, and minority identity characteristics as possible mediators and moderators between minority stress and mental health. \n\tResults indicated that sexual orientation victimization predicted mental health and behavioral problems, although this finding disappeared after controlling for other stressful life events. Additionally, victimization predicted minority stress which, in turn, predicted mental health problems. Evidence was found for partial mediation between minority stress and victimization by personal resources and moderation by social support. Furthermore, with the exception of minority identity characteristics, all moderator analyses indicated that externalizing problem behaviors should be treated separately from internalizing behaviors and other mental health symptoms when considering the effect of minority stress on mental health. Youth with worse contexts (i.e., less social support, fewer personal resources) were less likely than youth with more supportive contexts to exhibit externalizing behaviors in response to minority stress but were equally likely to exhibit internalizing behaviors and report increased stress. For minority identity characteristics, no effects were found. \n\tFollowing a summary of the implications of these results, I describe limitations to the current research program and suggest ways for researchers to further examine this theoretical model.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3515], "author_name_tesi": "Sinclair, Katerina Ocean", "last_name_ssi": "Sinclair", "middle_name_ssi": "Ocean", "first_name_ssi": "Katerina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Anthony Raymond D'augelli", "Anthony Raymond D'augelli", "Peter Cm Molenaar", "Michael J Rovine", "Zhang, Yu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Anthony Raymond D'augelli, Dissertation Advisor", "Anthony Raymond D'augelli, Committee Chair", "Peter Cm Molenaar, Committee Chair", "Michael J Rovine, Committee Member", "Zhang, Yu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["adolescents", "sexual orientation", "minority stress", "victimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Barriers and bridges to adaptive capacity: A case study on water governance in the middle hills of south central Nepal", "id": "25006", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11254", "abstract_tesi": "Observed climate change impacts are increasing pressures unevenly across space and amongst social actors who possess differential capacities to cope with and adapt to change. Governance of environmental resources plays an important role in this capacity to adapt, particularly in an era of unprecedented social and environmental changes. What is less known is the degree to which and the extent that environmental governance shapes differential adaptive capacities. Nepal has been identified as one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, with availability of water resources a prime concern.  Using qualitative methods conducted during a five-week span of fieldwork in two communities in the middle hills of central Nepal, this research examines how water governance provides a barrier or bridge for the adaptive capacity of socially diverse actors.  \n\nFindings from this research reveal that the temporal, spatial, and jurisdictional scales involved in water governance decision-making processes are mismatched for the scale and level of water scarcity experienced within study site locations.  The repercussions of these mismatches are felt strongest along lines of caste/ethnicity. Additionally this thesis reveals that gendered, embodied practices of access of water also play a role in producing differential adaptive capacities.\n\nThrough the lenses of scale and level mismatches and embodiment, this work reveals the power dynamics embedded in water governance decision-making processes and the everyday practices of water access, effectively producing barriers to adaptive capacity for some social actors, and bridges for others. \n\nThis work illuminates the biases and systemic inequities that are embedded in water governance decision-making processes. Furthermore these findings add greater understanding to the literature on adaptive capacity and environmental governance by tracing the scalar dimensions of water governance in its production of differential adaptive capacities.

Despite the wide use of UT, the current method is inefficient. One of the largest uses of UT is for monitoring of pipes, pressure vessels, and other mechanical components in energy production facilities. Energy production facilities require UT annually. Presently, if an inspection is required then the facility must be shutdown, which can cost millions of dollars, and an ultrasonic inspection could take weeks. In addition a technician is required to make the measurements. The goal of this thesis is to demonstrate the abilities of a spray-on transducer on a comparative basis to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the spray-on transducer technology. The spray-on transducer provides a leave in-place solution to structural health monitoring where plant shutdown and an operating technician are not required, which significantly decreases the cost of UT. Spray-on transducer technology was first developed in the early 2000\u2019s and has been studied in depth at Penn State over the past decade. A ferroelectric powder is combined with an organic binder. Once these are mixed together the slurry is then sprayed onto a sample. Then the organic binders are removed from the structure using a heat treatment. Then an electrode is applied to the ceramic material and the ferroelectric is poled to create an actuator. As a result of this process the actuator is bonded to the substrate.\nThis thesis compares results for a commercial 5 MHz k C75-5-X Ultran transducer and a bismuth titanate spray-on transducer. Both transducers demonstrate the capability of detecting small thickness changes as well as a frequency and phase shift due to the formation of oxide layers. For thickness measurements the spray-on transducer was found to be more accurate and capable of operating at higher temperatures than the commercial transducer system. Furthermore, now that a leave-in place solution has been proven viable for UT a wireless communication system was tested for passive monitoring. A small dipole antenna was used to wirelessly transmit data up to 20cm. It is shown that active powerless wireless monitoring is possible since the spray-on transducer can respond to voltages less than 50mv. Finally, a variety of signal processing methods are presented to decrease the noise in an ultrasonic signal. The Total Variation method proves the most useful at decreasing the noise in a system.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10856], "author_name_tesi": "Sinding, Kyle Matthew", "last_name_ssi": "Sinding", "middle_name_ssi": "Matthew", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard R Tittmann", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard R Tittmann, Thesis Advisor", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Thesis Advisor", "Mark William Horn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Spray-on Transducers", "Wireless Monitoring", "Ferroelectrics", "Corrosion Monitoring", "Signal Processing"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Chemical synthesis and modification of target phases of chalcogenide nanomaterials", "id": "14645", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7436", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Inorganic nanoparticles have been at the forefront of materials research in recent years due to their utility in modern technological processes. Chalcogenide nanomaterials are of particular interest because of their wide range of desirable properties for semiconductors, magnetic devices, and energy industries. Primary factors that dictate the properties of the material are the elemental composition, crystal structure, stoichiometry, crystallite size, and particle morphology. One of the most common approaches to synthesize these materials is through solution mediated routes. This approach offers unique advantages in controlling the morphology and particle size that other methods lack. This dissertation describes our recent work on exploiting solution chemical routes to control the crystal structure and composition of chalcogenide nanomaterials. \nWe will start by discussing solution chemistry routes to synthesize non-equilibrium phases of chaclogenide nanomaterials. By using low-temperature bottom-up techniques it is possible to trap kinetically stable phases that cannot be accessed using traditional high-temperature techniques. We used solution chemistry to synthesize and characterize, for the first time, wurtzite-type MnSe. Wurtzite-type MnSe is the end-member of the highly investigated ZnxMn1-xSe solid solution, a classic magnetic semiconductor system. We will then discuss PbO-type FeS, another non-equilibrium phase that is isostructural with the superconducting phase of FeSe. We synthesized phase-pure PbO-type FeS using a low-temperature solvothermal route.\nWe will then discuss the post-synthetic modification of chalcogenides nanomaterials. By exploiting the solubility of Se and S in tri-n-octylphosphine we can selectively extract the chalcogen from preformed chalcogenide nanomaterials. This gives chemists a technique for purification and phase-targeting of particular chalcogenide phases. This method can be modified to facilitate anion exchange. When Te is dissolved in tri-n-octylphosphine prior to chalcogen extraction, the Te replaces the S or Se in the material. We show how this can be utilized to synthesize porous SnTe nanosheets. Both the chalcogen extraction and anion exchange pathways give scientists new tools for the modification of chalcogenide nanomaterials. \nBefore concluding we will briefly discuss a new low-temperature solution-mediated crystal growth technique. This method combines concepts of solution chemistry and metal flux synthesis to generate bulk-scale single crystals of transition-metal stannides. This method has generated micron-scale single crystals of CoSn3, Ni3Sn4, PtSn4, and PdSn4. The low-temperature regime that this synthesis is conducted in may possibly lead to the synthesis of bulk single crystals of non-equilibrium phases.   \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7382], "author_name_tesi": "Sines, Ian Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Sines", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Ian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Sridhar Komarneni", "Benjamin James Lear"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Sridhar Komarneni, Committee Member", "Benjamin James Lear, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nanoparticles", "Conversion chemistry", "Chalcogenides", "Non-equilibrium phases", "Superconductors", "Single crystals"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Building Liberal Religion: Jews and Unitarians Reform Faith and Architecture in Nineteenth-Century Philadelphia", "id": "np193917x", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12685", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\u201cBuilding Liberal Religion: Jews and Unitarians Reform Faith and Architecture in Nineteenth-Century Philadelphia\u201d fuses family, social, intellectual, and religious histories with material culture analysis to document, interpret, and explore the achievements of the ecumenical network that developed between Victorian Philadelphia\u2019s community of Americanizing and liberalizing Jews and Unitarians. The locus of this network was the relationship that developed between the Reverend William Henry Furness (1802\u20131896) of the First Unitarian Church of Philadelphia and the progressive Rabbi Marcus Jastrow (1829\u20131903) of Congregation Rodeph Shalom soon after the rabbi\u2019s arrival in Philadelphia in 1866. This network expanded and continued for some sixty years among the clerics\u2019 families, congregations, colleagues, and friends. Through his singular talents, vision, and the prolificness, the Reverend\u2019s son Frank Furness (1802\u20131896) translated the reformist theological, philosophical, social, and aesthetic sensibilities that shaped the ministry of his father and the rabbinate of Marcus Jastrow into ecclesiastical, cultural, educational, commercial, and domestic structures and their furnishings. In doing so, the junior Furness\u2014with the initial support of his father and Rabbi Jastrow and continuing with the patronage of their cohort of reform-minded individuals\u2014created a built landscape in Philadelphia that stood as evidence of strong links connecting religious and social reform with aesthetic change. \nBy analyzing its most significant structures, I place this \u201creformed\u201d built landscape in the context of the nationally and internationally emerging ideological, \ntheological, aesthetic, and social concepts and concerns that inspired its creation. Many, but alas not all, of the buildings that composed the \u201creformed\u201d built landscape of late-nineteenth-century Philadelphia still stand. Numerous works of scholarship and literature produced by the Reverend Furness, Rabbi Jastrow, their accomplished children, and others in their circle may be found on library bookshelves. They are with us, but have not been considered as the cohesive expression of a collective reformist and ecumenical spirit.

However, the challenge of accomplishing this objective is understanding what product features (e.g. battery, camera, processor for a mobile phone) to include in a product. This thesis is aimed at reducing the mismatch between what designers deem relevant in the products that they design and what customers deem relevant in their purchasing decision. Product feature preferences are heterogeneous in nature and hence it is difficult for product designers to make decisions about product designs or features while designing next generation products.  Typically, searching for product features to include in next generation products is a manual process, often involving numerous iterations with customers. With an increase in the number of customers migrating to online platforms to buy products, acquisition of product feature preference data is viable through online product data streams. In this work, a product feature is defined as representing a product\u2019s form (i.e. pertaining to the shape, scale, material etc.), function (i.e. pertaining to the functional characteristics) or behavior (i.e. pertaining to the performance of a product during its lifecycle). While designing next generation products, designers must be able to assess the current state of product features, in order to minimize the risk of product failure in the market. This thesis illustrates a methodology to quantify the heterogeneity of product feature preferences in customer generated feedback posted online in order to enable product designers extract product features that receive homogeneous sentiments across all customers. Towards this end, this thesis investigates the \u201cmust have\u201d and \u201cdeal breaker\u201d product features  expressed by users of online platforms (e.g., customer review websites or social media networks) in order to inform designers of product features that should be investigated during the next iteration of a product\u2019s launch. Here, the term \u201cproduct\u201d is defined broadly to include tangible (e.g., cell phone) and intangible (e.g., healthcare service) systems that serve a given function(s). There exists a knowledge gap in terms of what product features impact real world outcomes. Existing product design literature highlights the risks of aggregating group preferences, and suggest that design teams should instead, focus on maximizing enterprise value by optimizing the features of a product. However, design knowledge about products and product features are influenced by market information, which is dynamic and difficult to acquire. The use of online product review platforms has emerged in the design community as a viable source of product data acquisition and demand model prediction. However, as the heterogeneity of product preferences increases, so does the complexity of understanding which product features should be optimized by the design team to maximize enterprise value. In the process of designing next generation products, designers should be able to assess the relevance of incorporation of features with homogeneous preferences across users called as \u201cmust have\u201d or \u201cdeal breaker\u201d features based on the product feature preferences mined from online data.  These challenges are exacerbated in product preference acquisition techniques that rely on mining online data, as the customer is typically unknown to the designer, which limits the amount of follow up data available to be mined. This work uses natural language processing techniques to acquire product feature preference data from online customer feedback to be combined with statistical analysis in an attempt to enhance the way in which products are evaluated by designers after launching into the market.  By quantifying the degree of \u201cmust have\u201d and \u201cdeal breaker\u201d product feature preferences expressed online, designers will be able to understand what product-features should be omitted from next generation product design optimization models (i.e., \u201cdeal breaker\u201d features) and what product features should be considered (i.e., \u201cmust have\u201d features). A case study involving customer electronics mined from online customer review websites is used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed methodology. Results obtained from this work are a testimony of its application for analysis of features across different products and services. The authors were able to demonstrate the methodology and extract \u201cmust have\u201d and \u201cdeal breaker\u201d features for the product under consideration which would result in optimized decisions on the designers\u2019 end for next generation product design.

Missions may\ninvolve delivery of a payload from one location to another. Some loads are externally attached to the\nhelicopter by cables. In this configuration, the loads are referred to as slung loads. Due to the coupling\nbetween the slung load aerodynamics and inertial forces, loads dynamics can become unstable when\nairspeed increases. Slung load instabilities limit the flight operations of a rotorcraft. Because limiting\nflight speeds reduce the operational efficiency of the rotorcraft, methods for stabilizing external loads\nin forward flight are the subject for research. In recent years, the dynamics and control of slung loads\nwere studied using analysis, dynamic wind tunnel tests, and flight tests.\nThe research presented in this thesis investigated a control design methodology and its feasibility\nto stabilize an external load across the flight envelope, including high speed flight. The capability of an\nactive cargo hook (ACH) to provide external load stabilization in high speed flight is studied. The ACH\nis an electromechanical device that can slide longitudinally and laterally along the base of the fuselage.\nPrevious work used the ACH to directly control the load\u2019s roll and pitch but only during hover and low\nspeed flight. Previous studies\u2019 results proved promising.\nThe test load and helicopter simulated in this thesis is a CONEX cargo container and a UH-60 Black\nHawk helicopter, respectively. During high speed flight, the load can become unstable, exhibiting sustained\nperiodic motion, or limit cycle oscillations, which can degrade helicopter handling qualities. Previous\nstudies observed the load dynamics in a wind tunnel. The findings showed the excessive swinging\nand rotation in the slung load are due to its nonlinear dynamics.\nThe control methodology first examined designed a full-state feedback (FSF) linear-quadratic regulator\n(LQR) controller. In this controller, the load states and cargo hook longitudinal and lateral positions\nare used as inputs to the controller with the commanded cargo hook longitudinal and lateral positions\nas outputs. Results showed high damping in the load\u2019s attitude response with little saturation in the\nACH stroke and stroke rate. The full-state LQR controller demonstrated success in stabilizing the slung\nload.\nThe FSF controller, however, requires sensors to measure the load\u2019s states real-time. A more practical\napproach is using a reduced order model (ROM) using relative cable angle feedback (RCAF). With RCAF,\nthe relative cable angles can be measured real-time, requiring less sensors and measurements. The\nreduced order model is used to design an LQR controller for the ACH. The inputs for the controller\nare the relative cable angles, relative cable angular rates, and ACH positions. The results demonstrated\nbetter performance than the FSF LQR controller, stabilizing the load approximately 20 percent quicker.\nThe load\u2019s damping of the RCAF controller is higher than the FSF\u2019s and the ACH does not saturate in\nstroke or stroke rate. The settling time of the load was also improved significantly. Furthermore, the\ncontroller\u2019s robustness was tested through applying a Dryden Turbulence model in the simulations. The\nRCAF was able to appropriately stabilize the load through low, mild, and severe turbulence levels.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16941], "author_name_tesi": "Singh, Ajay ", "last_name_ssi": "Singh", "first_name_ssi": "Ajay", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Francis Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Francis Horn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Slung", "External Load", "Active Cargo Hook", "LQR", "Full-State Feedback", "Reduced Order Model", "Relative Cable Angle", "Cable Angle Feedback", "CONEX", "Dryden", "Bifurcation", "Sling"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "The Effects of SFAS 133 on the Corporate Use of Derivatives, Volatility, and Earnings Management", "id": "6437", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "544", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS)133 had raised concerns about the potential impact the standard could have on firm hedging activities.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of SFAS 133 on the use of derivatives, cash flow volatility, earnings volatility, and income smoothing one-year before and after the implementation of the standard.  Data from 2000-2001 for a sample of 305 non-financial, non-regulated Fortune 500 was used to determine if the implementation of SFAS 133 had any significant effect on firm hedging activities, volatility of earnings and cash flows, and income smoothing.  Using dummy variables and interaction terms to proxy for SFAS 133, the differences in the coefficients after implementation of SFAS 133 are compared to the coefficients in the period before implementation for derivative users and a control group of non-users and also within groups of derivative users.  The results of this study showed no significant differences in earnings volatility, cash flow volatility, and income smoothing between derivative users and non-users before and after the implementation of SFAS 133.  Results also show no significant decline in the use of derivatives after the implementation of SFAS 133.  The empirical evidence does support the claims of critics and managerial concerns about the impact of the standard on volatility and hedging.  Within groups of derivative users, there is some evidence that firms reporting a transition adjustment or termination of derivatives may have smoothed income to reduce volatility.

The plates are modeled using LS-DYNA with 3-D hexahedral elements. The goal is to minimize the peak dynamic displacement of the back-face while monitoring plastic strain values, mass, and envelope constraints.

Only two of the 12 sub-families of fibrillins have been characterized genetically or functionally. This study characterized the fibrillin from sub-family 4, a member of an unstudied fibrillin protein group.  Fibrillin4 (FIB4/FBN4) is found associated with the photosystem II light-harvesting complex, thylakoids, and plastoglobules, which are chloroplast compartments rich in lipophilic antioxidants. Plastoglobule osmiophilicity is lower in fib4 knockdown (fib4 KD) apple tree chloroplasts than in the wild-type. Furthermore, levels of several lipids including plastoquinone were lower in the plastoglobules from fib4 KD apple trees than in the wild type. Compared with the wild type, net photosynthetic CO2 fixation in fib4 KD trees was lower at high light intensity and higher at low light intensity. Apple fib4 KD trees were also more sensitive to high light intensity, methyl viologen (MV) and had higher superoxide levels during MV treatment. Arabidopsis fib4 mutants and fib4 KD apples were more susceptible to bacterial pathogens and were more sensitive to ozone-induced tissue damage. Following ozone stress, plastoglobule osmiophilicity decreased in wild-type apple and remained low in fib4 KD trees. FIB4 overexpresser apple plants were more sensitive to ozone, MV, and had fewer osmiophilic plastoglobules, indicating that excess FBN4 protein might disturb the lipid-protein stoichiometry of the plastoglobule, resulting in improper localization of plastoglobule osmiophilic lipids, consequently reducing the plastoglobule\u2019s osmiophilicity and increasing the plant\u2019s sensitivity to oxidative stress. This study suggests that FIB4 is involved in regulating plastoglobule content and that defective regulation of plastoglobule content leads to broad stress sensitivity and altered photosynthetic activity.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1442], "author_name_tesi": "Singh, Dharmendra Kumar", "last_name_ssi": "Singh", "middle_name_ssi": "Kumar", "first_name_ssi": "Dharmendra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Timothy W Mcnellis", "Timothy W Mcnellis", "Siela Maximova", "Seogchan Kang", "Henry K Ngugi", "David M Braun"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Timothy W Mcnellis, Dissertation Advisor", "Timothy W Mcnellis, Committee Chair", "Siela Maximova, Committee Chair", "Seogchan Kang, Committee Member", "Henry K Ngugi, Committee Member", "David M Braun, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Plastoglobule", "Plastoquinone", "biotic stress", "abiotic stress", "Fibrillin4"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DETECTION, ESTIMATION, AND CHARACTERIZATION OF FATIGUE DAMAGE IN POLYCRYSTALLINE-ALLOY STRUCTURES\n\n", "id": "12377", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1576", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Quantifying damage in complex electromechanical systems under uncertain loading conditions becomes a difficult task due to the absence of a reliable mathematical model. Therefore, sensor-based analysis is necessary for degradation monitoring and plant health assessment. The pertinent information, derived from sensor time series, is also critical for  remaining life estimation of individual components. To obtain robust information on damage and anomalous behavior of such a system, appropriate sensors must be installed at correct locations supported by efficient signal processing tools. From these perspectives, this dissertation focuses on fatigue damage detection, estimation and characterization in mechanical structures.\n\nFatigue damage is broadly classified in two stages: (1) Crack Initiation and (2) Crack Propagation. Damage detection is relatively less difficult in the crack propagation stage although damage prognosis may require advance signal processing tools. Ultrasonic-based data-driven tools have been used in this research for failure prediction and remaining life estimation, where structural health information is recursively updated in real time with ultrasonic measurements.\n\nDue to microstructure-level changes in the crack initiation phase, online detection, quantification and characterization of damage is a challenging task. This dissertation investigates changes in the surface profile due to fatigue loading before the appearance of a crack. It is observed that changes in the surface texture can be gainfully utilized as  a precursor for the damage onset. White-light interferometry has been used to measure the profile of a damaged surface. Symbolic dynamic filtering(SDF) has been successfully applied to extract damage information from the deformed surface. This study has been limited to laboratory environment as interferometry of the surface profile may not be reliably and inexpensively monitored in field applications. To address this problem the damage quantified by a surface change is calibrated with the changes in the measured ultrasonic signals. This calibration yields an ultrasonic-based online monitoring tool for estimation of any possible damage occurred during the crack initiation stage.\n\nThis research also investigates the fractal nature of surface profiles, that may continuously deform under fatigue loading. In contrast to the common practice of studying surface changes based on an average value of roughness, a new insight is provided into crack initiation process by fractal and lacunarity analysis of surface profiles. Evolution of fractal dimension and lacunarity with accumulating fatigue damage has been investigated to understand surface deformation characteristics in the crack initiation process.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1560], "author_name_tesi": "Singh, Dheeraj Sharan", "last_name_ssi": "Singh", "middle_name_ssi": "Sharan", "first_name_ssi": "Dheeraj", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Asok Ray", "Asok Ray", "Alok Sinha", "Matthew M Mench", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Shashi Phoha", "Shalabh Gupta"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Asok Ray, Dissertation Advisor", "Asok Ray, Committee Chair", "Alok Sinha, Committee Member", "Matthew M Mench, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member", "Shashi Phoha, Committee Member", "Shalabh Gupta, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Surface Deformation", "Ultrasonic NonDestructive Evaluation", "Structural Health Monitoring", "Condition Monitoring", "Remaining Life Estimation", "Pattern Recognition", "Fatigue Damage Diagnosis"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "FINITE-VOLUME ANALYSIS OF TWO-PHASE SPLIT AT T-JUNCTIONS\n\n", "id": "9091", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2115", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-30T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A two-fluid finite-volume model for predicting liquid route selection for two-phase gas-liquid flow at diverging T-junctions is presented.

In July 2015, dry natural gas production worldwide reached an all-time high of 350 BCF/Day and it now accounts for almost a third of the world\u2019s energy consumption, as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Accurate reserve estimation and the capability to predict production performance is an essential aspect for the development of natural gas reservoirs. Once available, analysis of production data from natural gas reservoirs can serve as one of the most powerful tools to estimate remaining reserves and provide a forecast of its future performance. \nWell performance forecasting is important for field development to guide economic decisions during the life of a reservoir. For liquid reservoirs, these fundamentals are very well understood and described in literature, using a linear flow rate-pressure relationship. In contrast, traditional well performance methods for dry and wet gas wells rely on the use of single phase pseudo-pressure and pseudo-time linearizations to solve the highly non-linear gas flow equations due to the presence of strongly pressure-dependent gas properties like viscosity and compressibility. However, natural gas reservoirs often exhibit multi-phase flow of fluids resulting in simultaneous production of oil and gas, sometimes accompanied by water. Such rich gas reservoirs also undergo changes in reservoir fluid composition during their producing life due to retrograde condensate dropout within the reservoir once reservoir pressure falls below dew point pressure. Any predictive model used to analyze these reservoirs must account for the appearance of these multi-phase flow effects. \nTypically, analytical models use a pressure-based approach for rate forecasting and tracking fluid property changes with reservoir pressure. This work presents rigorous mathematical models capable of predicting non-linear flow behavior in multi-phase gas-condensate reservoirs using a density-based approach, i.e., tracking fluid property changes with variation in fluid density, applicable to boundary-dominated flow regimes under variable bottom-hole flowing pressure conditions. Here, gas-condensate systems have been modeled analogous to dry gas reservoirs through an elegant material balance approach which uses equivalent fluid molar densities in multi-phase systems, resulting in simplified analytical equations for the different flowing phases. This work shows that a rescaled exponential model is a rigorous decline solution for liquid-rich gas wells producing under variable bottom-hole pressure during boundary dominated flow, under conditions of water being present but immobile in the reservoir.\nThe goal of this work is to build a framework for a three-phase analytical model valid under variable bottom-hole pressure conditions.

The characteristic decay length of the wavefunction of this pair (or the \u201csize\u201d of a Cooper pair) is the superconducting coherence length \u03be. When any of the 3 physical dimensions of a superconducting system become comparable to this characteristic length the effect of fluctuations become important and superconductivity is predicted to be destroyed  [2]. In 1D systems (nanowires with diameter < \u03be) the limit at which superconductivity is quenched and the mechanism by which it is quenched is an active field of study. Fluctuations and changes in boundary conditions lead to many novel phenomena in 1D nanowires. Experimental exploration of these novel effects forms the basis of this dissertation. \n\tMetallic 1D nanowires have been fabricated using template-based electrodeposition and evaporation. Availability of nanowires of different morphologies helps in performing comparative experiments to isolate effects due to disorder from true 1D physics. The electronic transport properties of superconducting, ferromagnetic and normal nanowires with superconducting and normal electrodes have been studied in various measurement geometries. \n\tExperiments on aluminum nanowires studying the counterintuitive anti-proximity effect (APE) [3] have been performed. The results of these experiments appear to bring a complete understanding of the phenomenon and have resolved a number of puzzles in the early experiments.  In addition, measurements of a single resistance reading found switching from the superconducting to the normal state close to Tc of the wire and at low temperatures in the APE regime. The switching at low temperature is triggered by individual quantum phase slips. These results indicate that the low temperature APE regime offers a clean platform for the observation of individual quantum phase slips, a goal eluded in numerous experiments. \n \tSystematic studies on crystalline and granular ferromagnetic cobalt and nickel nanowires sandwiched between superconducting electrodes have been performed. A very long-range proximity effect (~ 600 nm) was found. This range is two orders of magnitude larger than that measured for bulk superconductor-ferromagnet systems. The superconducting transition was foreshadowed by a large peak in resistance dubbed the \u2018critical peak\u2019. Possible explanations of these counterintuitive effects have been discussed. \n\tIn earlier experiments on crystalline gold nanowires contacted with superconducting tungsten electrodes, a mini-gap state along with magnetoresistance oscillations indicating individual vortex trapping were found [4].

However, widespread declines in pollinator populations have become a cause of concern. RNA viruses are suspected as one of the major contributors to honey bee (Apis mellifera) losses including the recent malady, colony collapse disorder (CCD). But, our knowledge of viral diseases in other managed and wild bee species is very limited. This dissertation investigates the ecology and epidemiology of RNA viruses in different hymenopteran pollinators. Detection of RNA viruses in thirteen non-Apis hymenopteran species, using reverse transcriptase-PCR, indicated widespread occurrence of these viruses. This study provides the first evidence of pollen as a route of inter-taxa transmission of RNA viruses in hymenopteran pollinators. Molecular detection of viruses in pollen pellets from foragers and the subsequent phylogenetic analyses support that these viruses are disseminating freely among the pollinators via the pollen itself. The viruses in the pollen and honey stored in the hive were demonstrated to remain infectious for at least six months of storage. RNA viruses were also widespread in commercial colonies of the bumble bee, Bombus impatiens, the major pollinator of greenhouse crops, but were less prevalent in the alfalfa leafcutting bees (ALCB) (Megachile rotundata) and the alkali bees (Nomia melanderi), the two solitary bees essential for the alfalfa seed crop. Inter-taxa transmission of one of these viruses was further demonstrated in containment greenhouse experiments, where the recently described Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) moved between honey bees and bumble bees within ten days. IAPV disseminated throughout the bee body including the ovaries and eggs when fed to virus-free bumble bee queens, but remained restricted in the gut of the ALCB larvae. IAPV infection negatively impacted the health of bumble bee and honey bee colonies under greenhouse conditions, and adult survivorship and larval diapause in ALCB laboratory bioassays. However, further studies are needed to understand the role of IAPV and related viruses in the recent declines in field populations of different pollinators. This study increases our understanding of RNA virus ecology and epidemiology and may help explain bee disease patterns and pollinator declines in general.

Most of the\nwaterheds models require a simulation based approach to arrive at optimal parameter sets.\nOne of the major problems is dependence of watershed models on calibration, whose outcome\nis dependent on the climatic regime of the calibration data, or on a priori parameter estimates,\nwhich often perform poorly even in reproducing historical data.

Increasing threats to global water security due to rising population, land use change and global warming poses a major challenge to water resource planners. To make sound management decisions, they need reliable estimates of future water resource availability. In this dissertation, we identify and address the challenges in obtaining continuous projections of future streamflow in order to assist water management decisions. With this practical aspect in mind, we also address the knowledge gaps in hydrologic modeling under large uncertainties, under a changing climate or land use and in data sparse regions of the world. \n\tThe general approach to derive projections of streamflow is to drive a hydrologic model whose parameters are calibrated on historical streamflow with projections of changed future climate obtained from global climate models (GCMs). The first issue in this approach is that parameters of hydrologic models display a dependence on the climate of the calibration period. This makes the future projections of streamflow using parameters calibrated on historical climate unreliable. We ask \u2013 when and by how much does this climate dependence of model parameters impact the streamflow projections? We suggest a trading space-for-time framework to account for the climate dependence of model parameters and compare the projections derived from the proposed framework to the traditional method.\n\tThe second question is whether accounting for the climate dependence of hydrologic model parameters matter in the wake of large uncertainties in the climate change projections from the GCMs. We apply the trading space-for-time framework to the Olifants Basin in South Africa, a data sparse region. Using available downscaled climate projections, we show the large uncertainties in future streamflow projections and find that the uncertainty ranges are a function of the historical climate of the watershed and its future trajectory. \n\tThe trading space-for-time method relies on the ability of the hydrologist to identify streamflow signatures that can be regionalized, so we need to know which signatures to regionalize in a given location. In the third study, we use a diagnostic approach to identify the watershed characteristics and streamflow signatures that determine successful parameter transfer in different regions of the US, and hence should be preferentially regionalized. \n\tIn the fourth and final study, we answer a more general question \u2013 how to assist decision makers when there are large unavoidable uncertainties in future projections of streamflow? Until we reduce uncertainties in climate and hydrologic models through better understanding of the system, we will require alternative methods to aid decision making. Using an exploratory modeling design, we analyze a wide range of climate and land use settings in a watershed to assess the critical thresholds of climate and land use change, after crossing which the watershed is likely to transition to vulnerable regimes.\n\tThis approach provides the decision maker an estimate of the vulnerability of a particular aspect of the hydrologic regime (magnitude, duration, frequency, or rate of change) to environmental change. After that, the available information on future climate change can be integrated to assess the plausibility of the watershed actually witnessing such changes. We also compare the results of this approach with the traditional approach to derive hydrologic projections and show they agree well with each other but the new approach provides more information to the decision maker.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8907], "author_name_tesi": "Singh, Riddhi ", "last_name_ssi": "Singh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Riddhi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Thorsten Wagener", "Peggy Ann Johnson", "Prof Michael Gooseff", "Christopher J Duffy", "Robert George Crane"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof Thorsten Wagener, Dissertation Advisor", "Peggy Ann Johnson, Committee Member", "Prof Michael Gooseff, Committee Member", "Christopher J Duffy, Committee Member", "Robert George Crane, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Climate change impact on water resources", "uncertainty", "decision making", "vulnerability", "hydrologic modelling", "space-for-time"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Effects of Neuromuscular Fatigue on Hierarchical Control and Motor Synergies", "id": "14876", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7667", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Muscle fatigue leads to changes at many levels of the neuromotor hierarchy. Some of these changes are adaptive, that is they try to alleviate effects of fatigue on performance.  Several earlier studies have shown that, if a motor task involves a redundant set of elements, goal-relevant features of performance are relatively preserved during neuromuscular fatigue of one (or a few) of the elements. In the series of studies presented in this dissertation a hypothesis has been tested that fatigue increases the co-variation within redundant sets of elements in order to preserve the goal-relevant features of performance. The results from the first three experiments included in this dissertation show that fatigue of one of the elements within a redundant system leads to increased variability of both exercised and non-exercised elements. This is associated with an increase in the indices of motor synergies stabilizing task-related performance variables.  These findings have been confirmed in multi-finger accurate force production tasks and multi-muscle accurate sway tasks. Another issue addressed in this dissertation is the effects of fatigue in a hierarchically organized motor system. The fourth study looked at the effects of fatigue on the motor synergies of the ipsilateral (exercised) and contralateral (non-exercised) hand in accurate force production tasks. We found an increase in the indices of motor synergies stabilizing task-related performance variables in the ipsilateral as well as the contralateral hand. The last study in this dissertation investigated the effects of thumb and index finger fatigue in a static prehension task.  We did not find any effects of fatigue in motor synergies stabilizing the main performance variables, but the force and moment output of the individual digits changed to keep the grasped object in static equilibrium.  We conclude that fatigue of an element within a redundant system may lead to increased indices of synergies stabilizing important performance variables.

The serotonin system regulates a diverse array of biological functions, including mood, anxiety states, cognition, reward-related behavior, motor function, gut motility, and appetitive behavior, among many others. Treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders using drugs that directly affect serotonin transmission has provided evidence for the involvement of the serotonin system in generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and major depressive disorder. The focus of this thesis is on investigating serotonin neurotransmission as it relates to the etiology and treatment of these disorders. \n Currently, the most widely studied variant in psychiatric genetics is the 5 hydroxytryptamine transporter-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). This commonly occurring polymorphism has been linked to differences in trait anxiety, heightened stress responsiveness, susceptibility to depression, and variable treatment responsiveness. The human 5-HTTLPR is hypothesized to alter serotonin transmission whereby the short variant, a 43-base pair deletion in the promoter region, leads to reduced transcriptional efficiency resulting in lower SERT mRNA levels, decreased SERT expression, reduced serotonin reuptake, and increases in extracellular serotonin. Moreover, it has been suggested that higher levels of extracellular serotonin, particularly during key developmental periods, alter activation of postsynaptic receptors and downstream targets, ultimately leading to changes in the neural circuitry that modulate anxiety and mood. However, studies on the effects of the 5-HTTLPR in have produced conflicting results, possibly because of the influence of additional polymorphisms in the human serotonin transporter (SERT) gene, factors affecting in study design, and measurement issues. Rhesus macaques express an evolutionarily related SERT gene polymorphism termed the rh5-HTTLPR. At present, no other polymorphisms in the promoter region of the rhesus SERT gene have been identified suggesting that this animal model provides a means to study directly the influence of the 5-HTTLPR on serotonin neurotransmission. \nOne of the goals of this thesis was to elucidate the effect of the 5-HTTLPR on serotonin transmission in rhesus peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). We investigated rhesus PBLs because they express the same SERT gene as neurons and glia in the central nervous system. Additionally, we wanted to begin to investigate whether peripheral cells, such as lymphocytes, can be used as surrogates of SERT function in the brain. We utilized high-speed chronoamperometry to measure serotonin transport because this technique provides kinetically resolved measurements of uptake with the sensitivity to detect small but biologically relevant changes in transporter function. However, one of the problems associated with serotonin measurements in biological samples using carbon fiber microelectrode (CFM) voltammetry is electrode fouling. We compared CFMs with or without Nafion coating to boron-doped diamond microelectrodes (BDMs), which have recently been used for bioanalytical applications. We observed significantly reduced fouling of BDMs after exposure to high concentrations of serotonin and biological samples. Using chronoamperometry and BDMs, we found a significant decrease (30%) in serotonin uptake rates associated with the short variant of the rh5 HTTLPR. We concluded that decreases in serotonin uptake resulted from reduced surface SERT expression measured by [125I]RTI-55 binding and not decreases in SERT mRNA levels. These findings are in contrast to the current hypothesis that the 5 HTTLPR exerts its influence via altered transcription. Our results show that rhesus monkeys provide an animal model to study alterations in the serotonergic system associated with the 5-HTTLPR. They also suggest that lympocytes can be used as peripherally accessible biomarkers to study changes in serotonin transmission. \n\tIn addition to chronoamperometry studies in lymphocytes, we developed and optimized fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV) for measuring in vivo serotonin release and reuptake. Fast cyclic voltammetry has been used to investigate dopamine neurotransmission in vivo for many years; however, transforming CFM voltammetry into a technique that can be used to study serotonin neurotransmission has been elusive. Principal difficulties include the low levels of serotonin released in the brain in response to stimulation, interference from other monoamines and metabolites, and electrode fouling. To circumvent some of these issues, we carried out head-to-head comparisons of different electrode coating materials and protocols including Nafion, fibronectin, and base-hydrolyzed cellulose acetate (BCA) applied to CFMs to increase sensitivity, selectivity, and to decrease electrode fouling. We observed that electro-deposited Nafion and BCA-coating with a 40 min hydrolysis time did not interfere with electrode sensitivity. However, only Nafion showed high selectivity for measuring serotonin vs metabolites like 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 HIAA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and ascorbate. Electrode fouling studies showed that fouling occurs immediately after exposure of electrodes to brain tissue, with sensitivity remaining relatively constant thereafter. Among the coatings investigated, electro-deposited Nafion and BCA with 40 min of hydrolysis were associated with the highest sensitivity after exposure to brain tissue. However, we concluded that electro-deposited Nafion is the best coating for CFMs for in vivo serotonin measurements because of its ability to exclude anions and to prevent serotonin-selective reductions in sensitivity associated with 5-HIAA fouling. Using Nafion-coated CFMs and FCV with a highly tuned \u2018N-shaped\u2019 waveform, we measured serotonin release and reuptake in the frontal cortex after electrical stimulation of serotonin cell bodies in the brain stem in mice. Serotonin release was confirmed pharmacologically by paroxetine administration, which doubled the half-life of serotonin clearance. \nIn SERT-deficient mice, administration of the combination of paroxetine and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), the biological precursor of serotonin, produces hypothermia that can be fatal. This drug combination has ramifications for humans. Carriers of the short variant of the human 5-HTTLPR, possibly in combination with additional alleles associated with low SERT function, are hypothesized to be poor responders to serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressants. This increases the likelihood that these patients will seek alternate treatments while on antidepressant medications. 5-Hydroxytryptophan is an unregulated dietary supplement marketed as an antidepressant, appetite suppressant and sleep aid. Therefore, we investigated the effects of paroxetine and 5-HTP on serotonin release and reuptake rates in mice with reduced SERT expression. We found that this drug combination leads to more than a 3-fold increase in serotonin release. Moreover, the inhibition of SERT by paroxetine causes excess serotonin to persist in the extracellular space for a much longer period of time.\n\tUsing nonhuman primate and mouse models, we find that voltammetry methods provide the time resolution and sensitivity required to measure functionally important changes in serotonin transmission. We developed and optimized carbon fiber microelectrode voltammetry to measure endogenous serotonin release and reuptake. Furthermore, we showed that the 5-HTTLPR gene polymorphism influences SERT function in adult rhesus PBLs. These peripheral cells have the potential to be used as biomarkers in humans to study changes in SERT function in a peripherally accessible tissue. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6785], "author_name_tesi": "Singh, Yogesh ", "last_name_ssi": "Singh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yogesh", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Anne M Andrews", "Anne M Andrews", "Paul S Weiss", "Andrew Ewing", "Richard W Ordway"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Anne M Andrews, Dissertation Advisor", "Anne M Andrews, Committee Chair", "Paul S Weiss, Committee Chair", "Andrew Ewing, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Boron-doped diamond electrode", "5-HTTLPR", "Carbon fiber Voltammetry", "Electrochemistry", "Serotonin Transporter", "Electrode Coating"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "APPLICATION OF THE REAXFF MOLECULAR SIMULATION METHOD FOR INVESTIGATING HYPERGOLICITY OF ENERGETIC IONIC LIQUIDS\n", "id": "11236", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5878", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The conventional fossil fuels that are currently used for energy generation in different areas are non-renewable and harmful for the environment. This problem has made researchers and people around the world work towards finding alternatives to these fuels. One special area of application for certain type of fuels is their use as hypergolic space propellants. Hypergolic in the context of propellants refers to the process of spontaneous ignition upon contact with an external species such as an oxidizer. The most common hypergolic propellants in use today are a mixture of fuels like Hydrazine, Monomethyl Hydrazine (MMH) and Unsymmetrical Dimethyl Hydrazine (UDMH) along with oxidizers like White Fuming Nitric Acid (WFNA), Red Fuming Nitric Acid (RFNA), Inhibited Red Fuming Nitric Acid (IRFNA) and Nitrogen Tetroxide (NTO). Since hydrazines are carcinogenic, have a high vapor pressure, are low density fuels, evaporate easily and can be highly toxic if inhaled or internally ingested, there is a significant need for the development of new fuels with matching performance properties and lower toxicity.\n\n     The high chemical reactivity of hypergolic fuels makes it extremely difficult to measure their reaction chemistry and reaction kinetics with certainty. Computer simulations like molecular dynamics (MD) methods can help us identify the intermediates and predict the reaction chemistry at an atomistic level. Results obtained using MD in analyzing combustion and thermal decomposition problems coupled with convincing results have prompted this study at the atomistic level to be performed in probing hypergolic behavior among ionic liquids.\n\n     In this thesis, the ReaxFF reactive force field is used for performing MD simulations on a number of ionic liquid and oxidizer species combinations. We predict the reaction chemistry of these energetic IL\u2019s and correlate it with earlier results published using QM calculations. Primary cation is 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium and anion is dicyanamide. Oxidizer species used are nitric acid (HNO3) and nitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). We have first trained the force field for nitric acid by training it against a set of available QM and experimental data. Then we use this force field to perform simulations and extract the data obtained from the output to retrain the force field. Drop-test simulations on a fuel and oxidizer combination and analysis of the chemistry are performed. We analyze the trajectory of the different cation and anion to find out the crucial intermediates from the reaction.\n\n     In our simulations, we observe that when the fuel droplet comes in contact with the oxidizer at a velocity of 9-12 km/s, it undergoes vigorous reactions leading to the formation of key reaction intermediates HC2N3 and HC2N4O3. Cookoff simulation involving a steep temperature ramp-up of 2000K carried out with HC2N4O3 in a nitric acid environment eventually led to the formation of dinitrobiuret (H3C2N5O6). This reaction mechanism observed through ReaxFF is in good agreement with that proposed in QM and experimental studies [15, 32] indicating that ReaxFF provides a feasible computational approach for designing and analyzing hypergolic ionic liquid formulations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5874], "author_name_tesi": "Singhai, Shashank ", "last_name_ssi": "Singhai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shashank", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Prof Adri Van Duin", "Adrianus C Van Duin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Prof Adri Van Duin, Thesis Advisor", "Adrianus C Van Duin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ionic liquid", "energetic", "hypergolic", "simulation", "Reaxff", "molecular dynamics", "combustion"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Critical Evaluation of Transbronchial Biopsy Practice in the Diagnosis of Lung Cancer at the Hershey Medical Center\n\n", "id": "9285", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "551", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this project is to determine the pre-test probability and diagnostic yield of transbronchial biopsy (TBBx) in detecting lung cancer and to identify gaps in the current process of care associated with use of TBBx for lung cancer diagnosis at the Hershey Medical Center.\nThe hypotheses of this project are that the current TBBx practice at the Hershey Medical Center has a low diagnostic yield, high false negative results, especially for small peripheral lesions, provides insufficient clinical data to the interpreting pathologist, and the current process of care for lung cancer patients has variable time gaps between CT scan, TBBx and lung resection.\nThe specific aims are:\n1.\tTo define the current clinical process of care and to identify clinical datasets used for key elements of lung cancer diagnosis.\n2.\tTo critically evaluate a retrospective cohort of bronchoscopically acquired TBBxs and estimate the pre-test probability of diagnosing lung cancer.\n3.\tTo identify and integrate matched pairs of TBBx and lung resections in order to validate the performance of TBBx against lung resection as the gold standard.\n4.\tTo benchmark TBBx pathology reports as a function of digitally acquired computerized tomography (CT) lesions using a novel classification scheme and identify characteristics of lesions commonly biopsied and lesions frequently reported to be positive for malignancy.\n5.\tAssessment of pulmonary lesion characteristics accurately and inaccurately diagnosed to be malignant by TBBx.\n6.\tTo estimate the time intervals between CT scan, TBBx and lung resection in order to identify time gaps in the current process of care for lung cancer patients at the Hershey Medical Center.\nMethods: Specific Aim 1: Process of care and quality measures are assessed by defining the audience of this project, the clinical area being evaluated in this study, the assessment team, the component of the process being measured, preliminary tests, scoring and analytic specifications. To understand and define the current process of care at the Hershey Medical Center for diagnosing, staging and managing patients with lung cancer, various physician resources utilized are conferences with pulmonologists, pathologists, oncologists, radiologists, and cardiothoracic surgeons. Electronic resources utilized to assess patient information are billing records, Power Chart, digital CT scan repository, \u201cNatural Language IIa search\u201d, a software program available in the pathology department, and AJCC guided lung cancer classification protocol adopted by the Department of Pathology.\nSpecific Aim 2: Patients who underwent TBBx are identified through billing records, their pathology reports are acquired from Power Chart. An epidemiological codebook is developed to document data. Outcome measures evaluated are: Pre-procedure suspicion of lung cancer, pathology report positive for malignancy, smoking history, specimen site biopsied, average aggregate volume of tissue, statistical analysis of average aggregate tissue volume differences between samples positive for malignancy and those negative for malignancy, histopathological type of malignancy, gender distribution by histopathological type of malignancy, estimate of the pre-test probability of a positive pathology report for malignancy among samples obtained from patients clinically suspected to have lung cancer, cellular atypia, non-malignant findings, and staining.\nSpecific Aim 3: \u201cNatural Language IIa search\u201d, software is used to identify and acquire pathology reports of lung resection surgeries. Patient name and MRN are used to identify patients common in the TBBx and lung resection datasets. An epidemiological codebook is developed to document lung resection data. TBBx reports are categorized as test positive and negative based on presence or absence of malignancy. Lung resection reports are used as gold standard to assess TBBx performance in diagnosing lung cancer. Data are integrated to identify four groups of cases, true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative.\nSpecific Aim 4: The digital CT scans IDX/GE electronic image repository is used to retrieve digital images of pulmonary lesions biopsied for patients included in the TBBx dataset. A single transverse slice of each CT scan image centered on the region of interest (ROI) is extracted using Snagit\u00ae. A novel image classification scheme is used to classify ROIs into focal and diffuse lesions. Each type of lesion if further divided into subcategories based on size. Outcome measures evaluated are: availability of digital CT scans with time, most commonly biopsied lesion characteristic, and characteristic of lesion most commonly reported to be malignant by TBBx.\nSpecific Aim 5: TBBx pathology report, lung resection pathology report and digital CT scan image data are integrated in order to identify lesion characteristics in the true and false positive and negative categories. The outcome measures established are: location of lesion biopsied and resected, congruency of site biopsied and site resected, histopathological type of malignancy reported by TBBx and lung resection, and digital CT scan lesion characteristics.\nSpecific Aim 6: Availability of lung resection and digital CT scan data with time are established. In order to assess time to diagnosis (TDx) and time to treatment (TRx) only pre-TBBx CT scans and post TBBx resections are included. TDx and TRx are established for the four groups of cases to identify gaps in process of care.\nResults: Specific Aim 1: The audience of this project includes patients, physicians and researchers involved and interested in lung cancer. The clinical area being evaluated is TBBx and its efficiency in diagnosing lung cancer. The assessment team is primarily composed of the author and her thesis advisor. The component of the TBBx process being measured is primarily the pre-procedure differential diagnosis of cancer. Datasets utilized in this study include billing department records, Power Chart (Cerner), digital CT scan image repository, \u201cNatural Language IIa search\u201d software available in the Department of Pathology. \nSpecific Aim 2: Pathology reports from 801 TBBx samples obtained from 653 procedures done over the 5 years 10 months period of this study are obtained and data organized and analyzed. Patients\u2019 age averaged 58yrs 2mths +/- 15yrs 2mths (mean +/- SD) and 360/653 (55.13%) are male. Lung Cancer was suspected pre-procedure in 122/653 (18.7%) cases. Pathology report is positive for malignancy in 111/801 (13.86%) TBBx samples. Pre-test probability of diagnosing lung cancer is highest (22.45%) among patients suspected to have lung cancer, intermediate (13.89%) in the group where differential diagnosis is not specified and minimum (0.7%) in the group where lung cancer is not suspected pre-procedure. Average aggregate volume of samples positive for malignancy is significantly higher (0.062cm3) than the average aggregate volume of samples negative for malignancy (0.047cm3). Adenocarcinoma is the most common histopathological type of cancer seen in our study. A lack of transfer of clinical information to the diagnosing pathologist is noticed. \nSpecific Aim 3: Fourteen of 72 cases common to TBBx and lung resection datasets are true positive, 28 are false negative, 29 are true negative and 1 is false positive. Sensitivity of TBBx in diagnosing lung cancer is estimated to be 0.33, specificity is 0.97, false negative rate (FNR) =0.67, false positive rate (FPR) =0.03, predictive value positive (PVP) =0.93, predictive value negative (PVN) =0.51.\nSpecific Aim 4: Digital CT scan data are available for 298/653 TBBx procedures. Focal ROIs are more commonly biopsied (180/298, 54.05%) compared to diffuse lesions (153/298, 45.95%). Focal ROIs 1-3cm in size are the most commonly biopsied lesions. Among diffuse lesions, ROIs involving <25% of the lobe are most commonly biopsied. However, malignancy is most commonly reported in focal ROIs >3cm in size. Among diffuse lesions, malignancy is most commonly reported in ROIs involving >50% of the lobe.\nSpecific Aim 5: Of the 29 true negative cases diffuse lesions involving <25% of the right lower lobe is most commonly seen. Among the 14 true positive cases adenocarcinomas, focal lesions 1-3 cm in size, located in the right upper lobe are most commonly seen. One false positive sample is reported to be carcinoma in situ, squamous cell carcinoma in the left upper lobe. CT scan for this case is not available. Of the 28 false negative cases, adenocarcinomas, focal lesions 1-3cm in size and lesions in the right upper lobe are most commonly seen.\nSpecific Aim 6: Digital CT scan images are available for 298/653 (45.64%) and lung resection data are available for 74/653 (11.33%) of TBBx procedures. The median time to diagnosis (TDx) is 7 days pre-TBBx (range 0-57 days) and the median time to treatment (TRx) is 63.5 days post-TBBx (range 4-1493). No significant difference is seen in TDx and TRx between the true and false positive and negative groups. However the number of cases in these groups is small (4-14) therefore these results need to be confirmed in a study including larger number of patients.\nConclusions: Disparate electronic datasets can be linked to critically evaluate TBBx yield in diagnosing lung cancer. Essential clinical information is not provided to the diagnosing pathologist frequently. Pre-test probability of diagnosing lung cancer is highest among patients suspected to have lung cancer. Average aggregate volume is significantly higher in samples reported positive for malignancy compared to non-malignant samples. This is an important factor when assessing feasibility of using TBBx tissue for molecular markers. Validation of TBBx performance in diagnosing lung cancer against lung resection as gold standard provided a sensitivity= 0.33, and specificity= 0.97 with a high false negative rate of 0.67. Malignant focal lesions >3cm in size are more frequently detected accurately than adenocarcinomas, focal lesions 1-3cm in size that have a high false negative rate. The median TDx is 7 days pre-TBBx and the median TRx is 63.5 days post-TBBx. Variability is seen in TDx and TRx but no statistically significant difference is seen in TDx and TRx between the true and false positive and negative groups.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [548], "author_name_tesi": "Sinha, Anju ", "last_name_ssi": "Sinha", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Anju", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Medicine", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rebecca Bascom", "John Peter Richie Jr.", "Shantu G Amin", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich", "Dani S Zander"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rebecca Bascom, Committee Chair", "John Peter Richie Jr., Committee Member", "Shantu G Amin, Committee Member", "Eugene Joseph Lengerich, Committee Member", "Dani S Zander, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hershey Medical Center", "diagnostic yield", "lung cancer", "transbronchial biopsy", "molecular markers"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Making use visible: a teacher-centered study of technology-enabled work practices", "id": "17609", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8712", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many studies have examined the use of technology in education aimed at preparing students for the 21st century. Some studies have emphasized the importance of teacher attributes, such as attitudes, beliefs and self-efficacy, in predicting these professionals\u2019 use of technology in schools (Dupagne & Krendl (1994), Marcinkiewicz (1994), Milbrath & Kinzie (2000), Vannatta & Fordham, 2004). Other studies have assessed whether technology improves students\u2019 engagement as well as achievement (Schacter, 1999).  Still others have investigated the development of online communities that may help teachers to become advanced users of technology (Carroll et al., 2003, 2005; Barab et al., 2003; Schlager & Fusco, 2003). In general however, many studies of technology in education consider teacher preparation as a peripheral concern. In contrast, Fullan (1991) suggested that researchers should consider the teachers\u2019 perspective when studying changes that occur due to technology integration to understand their subjective experiences.  Similarly, Laurillard (2008) argued that by taking into account the teachers\u2019 concerns, specifically their points of view on whether and how technology can serve education, researchers will be able to first identify and understand the educational problems and then find technology solutions that address these problems.  In this way, it can be ensured that issues are addressed from the teaching community\u2019s perspective. \nThis study is grounded in the view that a better understanding of teachers and their daily work-related activities must be a central element in any programs aimed at enhancing the use of technology in teaching. This research begins with a review of literature on teachers\u2019 professional community, teachers\u2019 professional development, the opportunities that online communities are providing in the evolution of a professional development community for teachers and the challenges that lie ahead. Then, through qualitative research methodology, this study attempts to (a) better understand the social aspects surrounding the use of information technology in a school setting and (b) analyze barriers and supporting structures for using and learning technology practices among teachers.\nThe analysis of how the school teachers in a particular school are using and learning to use technological artifacts for their daily work practices has helped uncover useful findings - for policy makers, school leaders, teachers, providers of professional development and designers of information technology innovations for education.

The mechanical flexibility of currently used batteries is reduced because of the use of liquid electrolytes, which require a rigid casing. Therefore, scientists are turning to replacing the liquid electrolyte with a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE), thereby eliminating the need for the casing. SPEs contain a polymer host such as polyethylene oxide (PEO) and a lithium salt, which provides the cation. Ionic conductivity in SPEs is coupled to the polymer mobility. The cation is solvated by ether oxygen atoms (EO) and the lithium moves by hopping from one EO-rich site to another. This movement is aided by the segmental mobility of the polymer. However, high anion mobility contributes to conductivity and results in reverse electrode polarization which degrades battery life. We therefore use single ion conductors (ionomers) where only the cation conducts. In this case a sulfonate anion is covalently bonded to a PEO backbone through an isophthalate comonomer unit. We use the nomenclature PEOx-Y %M for these ionomers (e.g. PEO400-50%Li). These samples allow us to vary the degree of sulfonation (Y, the percentage of sulfonated isophthalate groups), the spacer length (x, molecular weight of PEO between isophthalate groups) and the cation identity (M, which could be Li+, Na+ and Cs+). \n\nWe use quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) to study the PEO backbone dynamics of these ionomers as a function of ion content and ion identity. The ion content, defined as the molar ratio of cations to EO atoms, can be changed in two ways - by varying the degree of sulfonation (Y in [0,100]), and by changing the MW of the spacer (x = 400, 600, or 1100). When we compare the dynamics of nonionic polymers (i.e. no acid groups - PEO600-0%) to that of pure PEO, we observe that the isophthalate group reduces the mobility of its neighboring atoms. Therefore, the overall dynamics is composed of two fractions - a fast fraction in the mid-region of the spacer away from the effect of the isophthalate group (bridge atoms), and a slow fraction which neighbors the isophthalate group (anchor atoms). When we introduce ions by increasing the degree of sulfonation (PEO600-Y%Na), no new relaxations are observed, but the two fractions are affected differently. The bridge atoms appear to saturate at a low ion content of 0.01. In contrast, the anchor atoms have considerably reduced mobility when the ion content is above 0.01 due to crosslinking between ionic groups at the isophthalate units. Correspondingly, the anchor atom relaxation determines the glass transition temperature of the ionomer. We also compare the results to the PEO/LiClO4 system, by comparing both polymer dynamics and conductivity as a function of ion content.  The optimal ion content for ionomers is half that of the salt system, which we explain based on the differing behavior of polymer dynamics in the two systems. We further investigate the effects of changing ion content on the component dynamics by changing the spacer length (at 100% sulfonation). The trend in bridge and anchor atom dynamics depends mainly on the absolute ion content, and not on the way it is varied. On comparing the dynamics and conductivities of two samples which have similar ion content, we conclude that it is better to achieve a particular ion content by varying the spacer length (at 100% sulfonation) rather than having partial sulfonation. \n\nUsing QENS to calculate the ionic composition of bridge and anchor atoms, we incorporate the findings of small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and present a visual schematic of the dynamic patterning of bridge and anchor atoms. SAXS measurements also show that formation of ionic aggregates is characteristic of these ionomers and in some cases microphase separation occurs. \n\nWe also study the effect of different cations (Li+, Na+ and Cs+) on the bridge and anchor atom dynamics of PEOx-100 %M ionomers. The ion content of these systems is above 0.01, therefore, the bridge atom relaxation times are similar, and ion identity primarily affects the anchor atom relaxations. By correlating QENS data with SAXS measurements, we study the effect of aggregate size and extent of microphase separation on anchor atom dynamics. Li based samples have high extent of microphase separation, whereas Na and Cs based samples display a distribution of aggregate sizes. These morphological differences affect the nature of interaction between the cation and the anchor atoms. Based on the binding energies and atomic radii of these cations, we identify the factors which govern the anchor atom dynamics at different temperatures. We conclude that when the reduced temperature [T - Tg] is less than 60 C, the anchor atom dynamics are controlled by the cation coordination number (number of EO atoms that solvate a cation in a PEO environment). Comparatively, when [T - Tg] is greater than 60 C, the dynamics are controlled by the cation-EO binding energies. Using QENS data, we further investigate the effect of spacer length on the degree of microphase separation in these samples.\n\nWe conclude by identifying conditions that are favorable for conductivity in single ion conductors. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on PEO600-100%Na show the existence of string like aggregates which assist in charge transfer. We recognize that to improve the conductivity of single ion conductors and solid polymer electrolytes in general, we need to focus on both favorable cation coordination states (like string like aggregates) as well as high polymer host mobility. While the presence of favorable cation coordination states help in charge transport, amorphous polymer domains are necessary for ion transport from one coordination state to another. We finally propose a sample design that allows this partial decoupling of ion transport and conductivity. This design can help us create string like aggregates as a function of several variables (such as length, concentration, chain length etc.). By studying the effect of such factors on dynamics and conductivity, we can build better single ion conductors.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3586], "author_name_tesi": "Sinha, Kokonad ", "last_name_ssi": "Sinha", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kokonad", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janna Kay Maranas", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Michael John Janik", "Scott Thomas Milner", "James Spiro Vrentas", "James Patrick Runt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janna Kay Maranas, Dissertation Advisor", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Chair", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Scott Thomas Milner, Committee Member", "James Spiro Vrentas, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymer conduction", "solid polymer electrolytes", "single ion conductors", "ionomers", "quasi elastic neutron scattering", "polymer dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Hot Halo Gas in Numerical Simulations of Galaxy Mergers", "id": "9052", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4436", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Galaxy merger simulations have explored the behavior of gas within a galactic disk, yet the dynamics of hot gas within the galaxy halo has been neglected. We report on the results of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of colliding galaxies with hot halo gas. We explore a range of mass ratios, gas fractions and orbital configurations to constrain the shocks and the dynamics of the gas within the progenitor halos. We find that : (i) A strong shock is produced in the galaxy halos before the first passage, increasing the temperature of the gas by almost an order of magnitude to ~ 10^{6.3} K. (ii) The X-ray luminosity of the shock is strongly dependent on the gas fraction. It is >= 10^{39} erg/s for gas fractions larger than 10%. (iii) We find an analytic fit to the maximum X-ray luminosity of the shock as a function of merger parameters. This fit can be used in semi-analytic recipes for galaxy formation to estimate the total X-ray emission from shocks in merging galaxies.

In addition to the normal operation, startup of a PEFC from subzero temperatures, commonly referred as \u201ccold-start\u201d, is of great importance especially for automotive applications. The water present in the membrane and porous layers, i.e. catalyst layer (CL), micro porous layer (MPL) and GDL, may freeze at a subzero temperature and makes the startup of a PEFC difficult or impossible. To alleviate the cold-start problem, a fuel cell is typically purged with gas to remove residual water prior to engine shutdown. Liquid water transport in a PEFC GDL during gas purge sets up the initial condition of the water distribution in PEFC for cold start, and hence significantly affects the cold-start characteristics of a PEFC. In spite of its importance, liquid water transport in a GDL during gas purge is scarcely researched.\nIn this thesis, multi-scale investigations are carried out to obtain a fundamental understanding of liquid water transport in PEFC GDL, taking GDL microstructure and wettability into account, during flooding and gas purge. Extensive pore-network models are developed to elucidate the role of microstructure and wettability distribution on GDL flooding. The role of capillary fingering in GDL liquid water transport is discussed. The ensuing concave shaped-saturation profiles can not be explained by two-phase Darcy&#8223;s law based model.

Detailed macroscopic purge model is developed to elucidate the gas purge mechanisms, and key factors influencing purge effectiveness are highlighted. The model predictions are compared with experimental results under various purge conditions. A good match with experiments is obtained at higher purge temperatures, whereas some differences in the HFR profiles are observed at lower temperatures.

The layer-by-layer material addition approach gives designers access to the entire volume of a part, enabling embedding of foreign, multi-functional components in printed parts. The typical embedding process for AM involves i) designing the cavity for the embedded component, ii) interrupting the build process when the top layer of the cavity is reached, iii) manually inserting the foreign component, and iv) resuming the build process. While build process interruption during printing is a requirement for embedding, interruptions can also be caused by power outages, system errors, or material shortages. However, the influence of this interruption on AM manufactured parts is not well understood. This thesis discusses the effects of the embedding process on the material properties of material extrusion parts by addressing two different factors: i) the time duration of process interruption in a print and ii) the material transition between the embedded component and the build material when resuming the print after embedding. The information on how these two factors influence material properties can provide crucial information for designers to make design and process decisions for embedding in AM. For this purpose, the tensile strength of 3D-printed specimens with embedded elements were tested in this study, subjected to different pause time intervals, and with or without shape converters. In order to counteract any weakness due to pausing, specimens in additional testing were reheated at the paused layer immediately prior to resuming, and tensile strengths were analyzed to observe any improvements. The findings from these investigations are used as design guidelines for redesign and manufacturing of a multifunctional cross brace structure of a three unit CubeSat.

The heat treatment produces a uniform microstructure of acicular ferrite and carbon-stabilized austenite, known as \u201cAusferrite,\u201d with graphite nodules. ADI exhibits grade material properties including a high strength-weight ratio, good ductility and toughness, high fatigue strength, and wear resistance. It is also approximately 10% less dense than steel with similar strength levels and three times stronger than aluminum at only 2.5 times the mass. These material properties make ADI an attractive alternative for applications that require light weight flexible designs, where density matter and the maintaining of high strength and toughness are important. However, the difficulties experienced when machining ADI remain one of the major restricting factors in the growth of the market for ADI. In many cases, because of the high strength and hardness values, manufacturers have deemed ADI un-machinable.\n \nThe main objective of this study was to assess the machinability of ADI grades 900, 1050, and 1200 (GR900, GR1050, GR1200) in order to establish cost-effective processing conditions for the machining of ADI. This was accomplished by conducting face and end milling studies for a range of machining conditions. More specifically, the effects of cutting speed on tool life and surface roughness in face milling were investigated as well as the effects of chip load on cutting force and cutting stiffness during end milling. The face milling operations were carried out on 25 mm thick plates using the following cutting conditions with a three tooth, 80 mm face milling tool: constant chip load of 0.08 mm/tooth and depth of cut of 1 mm, with varying cutting speed of 120-360 m/min, 240-480 m/min, and 240-480 m/min for GR1200, GR1050, and GR900, respectively. A Taylor tool life model was also developed, using the five cutting speeds, for the GR900, GR1050, and GR1200. In addition, end milling operations were carried out on 25 mm thick plates using the following cutting conditions with a single tooth 19 mm end milling tool: constant cutting speed of 15 m/min and depth of cut of 1 mm, with varying chip load of 0.05-0.15 mm/tooth. In addition to the analysis of machinability of the grades of ADI, the machinability was compared to that of AISI/SAE 4340 steel (S-4340), under similar cutting conditions. \n\nThe cutting stiffness of the grades of ADI were found to be generally in the expected cutting stiffness range for hardened steels, such as S-4340, during conventional milling. Empirical testing also showed that high cutting speeds accelerate the rate of tool wear, decreasing tool life and increasing surface roughness when machining ADI. In general, GR900 exhibited the best tool life, surface finish, and cutting stiffness with higher machinability than the higher strength grades of ADI. Furthermore, Taylor tool life models were developed that represented 95%, for GR1200 and GR1050, and 85%, for GR900, of the tool life data collected.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9627], "author_name_tesi": "Sinlah, Abibu I", "last_name_ssi": "Sinlah", "middle_name_ssi": "I", "first_name_ssi": "Abibu", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chris Saldana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chris Saldana, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Machinability", "milling", "Austempered Ductile Iron (ADI)", "AISI/SAE 4340 steel", "tool life", "surface roughness", "cutting stiffness"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Distributed Data Fusion Across Multiple Hard and Soft Mobile Sensor Platforms", "id": "16157", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7766", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One of the biggest challenges currently facing the robotics field is sensor data fusion. Unmanned robots carry many sophisticated sensors including visual and infrared cameras, radar, laser range finders, chemical sensors, accelerometers, gyros, and global positioning systems. By effectively fusing the data from these sensors, a robot would be able to form a coherent view of its world that could then be used to facilitate both\nautonomous and intelligent operation. Another distinct fusion problem is that of fusing data from teammates with data from onboard sensors. If an entire team of vehicles has the same worldview they will be able to cooperate much more effectively. Sharing worldviews is made even more difficult if the teammates have different sensor types. The final fusion challenge the robotics field faces is that of fusing data gathered by robots with data gathered by human teammates (soft sensors). Humans sense the world completely differently from robots, which makes this problem particularly difficult. The advantage of fusing data from humans is that it makes more information available to the entire team, thus helping each agent to make the best possible decisions.\n\nThis thesis presents a system for fusing data from multiple unmanned aerial vehicles, unmanned ground vehicles, and human observers. The first issue this thesis addresses is that of centralized data fusion. This is a foundational data fusion issue, which has been very well studied. Important issues in centralized fusion include data association, classification, tracking, and robotics problems. Because these problems are so well studied, this thesis does not make any major contributions in this area, but does review it for completeness. The chapter on centralized fusion concludes with an example unmanned aerial vehicle surveillance problem that demonstrates many of the traditional fusion methods.\n\nThe second problem this thesis addresses is that of distributed data fusion. Distributed data fusion is a younger field than centralized fusion. The main issues in distributed fusion that are addressed are distributed classification and distributed tracking.\nThere are several well established methods for performing distributed fusion that are first reviewed. The chapter on distributed fusion concludes with a multiple unmanned vehicle collaborative test involving an unmanned aerial vehicle and an unmanned ground\nvehicle.\n\nThe third issue this thesis addresses is that of soft sensor only data fusion. Soft-only fusion is a newer field than centralized or distributed hard sensor fusion. Because of the novelty of the field, the chapter on soft-only fusion contains less background information and instead focuses on some new results in soft sensor data fusion. Specifically, it discusses a novel fuzzy logic based soft sensor data fusion method. This new method is tested using both simulations and field measurements.\n\nThe biggest issue addressed in this thesis is that of combined hard and soft fusion. Fusion of hard and soft data is the newest area for research in the data fusion community; therefore, some of the largest theoretical contributions in this thesis are in the chapter on combined hard and soft fusion. This chapter presents a novel combined hard and soft data fusion method based on random set theory, which processes random set data using a particle filter. Furthermore, the particle filter is designed to be distributed across multiple robots and portable computers (used by human observers) so that there is no centralized failure point in the system.\n\nAfter laying out a theoretical groundwork for hard and soft sensor data fusion the thesis presents practical applications for hard and soft sensor data fusion in simulation. Through a series of three progressively more difficult simulations, some important hard and soft sensor data fusion capabilities are demonstrated. The first simulation demonstrates fusing data from a single soft sensor and a single hard sensor in order to track a car that could be driving normally or erratically. The second simulation adds the extra complication of classifying the type of target to the simulation. The third simulation uses multiple hard and soft sensors, with a limited field of view, to track a moving target and classify it as a friend, foe, or neutral.\n\nThe final chapter builds on the work done in previous chapters by performing a field test of the algorithms for hard and soft sensor data fusion. The test utilizes an unmanned aerial vehicle, an unmanned ground vehicle, and a human observer with a laptop. The test is designed to mimic a collaborative human and robot search and rescue problem. This test makes some of the most important practical contributions of the thesis by showing that the algorithms that have been developed for hard and soft sensor data fusion are capable of running in real time on relatively simple hardware.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7699], "author_name_tesi": "Sinsley, Gregory ", "last_name_ssi": "Sinsley", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gregory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lyle Norman Long", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "David Miller", "David J Hall", "John Yen", "Joseph Francis Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lyle Norman Long, Dissertation Advisor", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Chair", "David Miller, Committee Member", "David J Hall, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member", "Joseph Francis Horn, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["sensor data fusion", "information fusion", "soft sensor data fusion", "random set theory", "particle filter"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Individual and Contextual Influences on Early Adolescent Girls' Disordered Eating\n\n", "id": "7110", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4286", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Abstract\n\tResearch aims were to 1) use cluster analysis to examine patterns of disordered eating risk (weight status, weight concern, and depression) in age 9 girls, 2) examine associations between cluster membership and multiple disordered eating indicators at ages 11 and 13, 3) examine stability in cluster variables over time and the influence of pubertal development on such risk, and 4) examine if clusters were influence by broader developmental factors within the family environment.

This work focuses on nanowires with diameters between 30 and 300 nm, made of metal or silicon.  For many of the applications investigated here, Au and Ag striped nanowires (NWs) were used.  One problem with Ag is that it can degrade in aqueous environment.  Chapter 2 describes the use of citrate, a mild reducing agent, as an additive to prevent Ag degradation.  We studied NWs stored in high salt hybridization buffer for undisturbed and continuously agitated samples.  We found that NWs stored in high salt buffer were significantly degraded after two weeks, and much faster when agitated.  The NWs were unidentifiable in less than one week when continuously agitated.  We found that adding 40 mM citrate increased the stability of Ag NWs by 17 weeks over those stored in hybridization buffer.  When the NWs were continuously agitated in citrate buffer, they remained stable for over two weeks.  Derivatization of the NWs with biomolecules adds some protection.  NWs coated with rhodamine tagged DNA attached via neutravidin-biotin chemistry are stable for 12 days in hybridization buffer.  When 40 mM citrate is added to the buffer, they are stable for at least 63 days.  Ag deterioration was coupled to loss of fluorescence of the labeled DNA and NW breakage.  \nIn chapter three, a simple, wet-chemical method for fabricating linear chains of Au and Ag nanoparticles by selectively etching alternating segments from striped metal nanowires is presented.  Nanowires composed of sacrificial Ni segments as well as Au and/or Ag segments were prepared by templated electrodeposition in the pores of alumina membranes.  After removal from the membrane, wires were coated with silica, and selective etching revealed the nanoparticle chains.  Extinction spectra are presented as a function of interparticle spacing for nanoparticle chains of diameter ~100 and ~33 nm. \nChapter 4 builds on the results of chapter 3.  Silica coated Au nanoparticle chains were studied for use as surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) substrates.  NP chains were vortexed with bis pyridyl ethylene (BPE), a Raman active molecule.   Raman intensity of BPE was measured for Au NP dimers and chains with diameter of ~100 nm.  The chemistry of the silica coating was adjusted by mixing tetra ethoxy silane (TEOS) with a small amount of Bis (trimethoxysilyl ethyl) benzene (BTEB).  This made the silica more hydrophobic, which allowed the hydrophobic molecule BPE to penetrate the coating.  NP chains with diameters of ~33 nm were coated with TEOS/BTEB silica and BPE was adsorbed.  Large differences in the Raman signal were recorded for the bare NWs, silica coated, and etched NP chains.  There was also a large dfference in the Raman intensity for NP chains with large spacing (420 nm) and small spacing (30 nm).  \n\tIn chapter 5, striped metallic nanowires (NW) have been coated with a silica shell of controllable thickness (6 \u2013 150 nm), and the performance of coated vs. uncoated has been compared.  We find that the SiO2 coating does not interfere with identification of the metal striping pattern, and protects Ag segments from oxidation, extending the range of assay conditions under which barcoded NW can be used.  Much higher and more uniform fluorescence intensities were observed for dye-labeled ssDNA bound to SiO2-coated as compared to uncoated NW. Simultaneous, multiplexed DNA hybridization assays for three pathogen-specific target sequences on SiO2-coated NW showed good discrimination of complementary from noncomplementary targets.  Application of SiO2-coated NW in discrimination of single base mismatches corresponding to a mutation of the p53 gene was also demonstrated.  Finally, we have shown that thiolated probe DNA resists desorption under thermocycling conditions if attached via siloxane chemistry to SiO2-coated NW, but not if it is attached via direct adsorption to bare Au/Ag NW.\nFinally, in chapter 6, the surface chemistry of Si and Rh NWs was investigated for the attachment of DNA probes for incorporation of cantilever arrays for mass based biosensing.  Experiments were performed on bare and silica coated AuAg striped NWs to determine the optimum conditions of DNA probe attachment, hybridization of DNA and RNA target, and tagging the target with either fluorescently labeled DNA, or Au:DNA conjugates.  It was found that RNA could be detected on bare and silica coated NWs with both fluorescent and Au:DNA tags even with its larger size and secondary structure,.  The Au:DNA conjugates ranged in size from 12 to 50 nm, with the more massive NPs desired for their mass amplification abilities.  The surface coverage of 50 nm Au:DNA conjugates was measuread as a function of NaCl concentration in the final buffer rinse.  Resonant frequency measurements were made of SiNW before and after addition of 50 nm AuNP with 11-mercapto undecylamine.  Finally, mass changes due to the binding of target DNA and Au:DNA conjugates to RhNW cantilevers were measured by resonant frequency changes.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2531], "author_name_tesi": "Sioss, James ", "last_name_ssi": "Sioss", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Mary Beth Williams", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Williams, Committee Member", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanowires", "silica coating", "optical properties", "biosensors"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Examining the effects of message type and framing on transportation, attitudes, and behavioral intentions\n\n\n\n", "id": "10192", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "937", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-10-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Individuals are often exposed to risk messages in the media, be it through print, broadcast, or film.

The mediation results for the subliminal presentation condition suggest that biased processing of shame-relevant information may occur without conscious awareness, which could set into motion a theorized series of processes (i.e., misinterpretation of ambiguous social stimuli as representing imminent rejection, avoidance and/or externalization of negative affect to protect self-image) that ultimately lead to IPV perpetration.

In the context of a second language (L2), mastery of grammar and lexicon are critical for the purpose of comprehensibility (e.g., Saito, Trofimovich, & Isaacs, 2015), yet they are highly complex systems and therefore typically present difficulty to L2 learners at all stages of proficiency. In communicative and content-based L2 classrooms, teachers can address this issue by providing learners with form-focused instruction and corrective feedback on grammatical structures and vocabulary during interactions that are otherwise primarily focused on meaning. In the context of peer interaction within communicative and content-based classrooms, however, learners typically focus almost exclusively on meaning and rarely shift their attention to linguistic forms (e.g., Adams, Nuevo, & Egi, 2011). Consequently, peer interaction is a useful pedagogical intervention for the purpose of fluency development, but not necessarily for the purpose of linguistic accuracy (Sato and Lyster, 2012).\nThe goal of this dissertation is to explore the effectiveness of form-focused instruction and peer corrective feedback to improve linguistic accuracy and thereby maximize learning opportunities during peer interactions that focus primarily on meaning. The study used a mixed-methods design to collect both quantitative data that provided information on the effectiveness of the intervention and qualitative data to gain insights into learners\u2019 beliefs about the intervention. Two experiments were conducted: The first one was designed to promote the acquisition of grammatical structures and the second to promote the acquisition of vocabulary.\nIn experiment 1, 87 third-semester learners of German were assigned to a PI group (peer interaction only), PI FFI group (peer interaction and form-focused instruction), or PI FFI CF group (peer interaction, form-focused instruction, and peer corrective feedback). During an instructional treatment over three consecutive class periods, participants in all three groups engaged in the same peer interaction activities that revolved around the city of Munich. However, only the PI FFI group and the PI FFI CF group received form-focused instruction on the grammatical target structure, the German present perfect tense, which includes auxiliary verb selection and past participle formation. Critically, only the PI FFI CF group was trained to provide corrective feedback to peers. A pretest and two posttests measured the effectiveness of the intervention, all of which included an oral production task and an error correction task. Results showed that the PI FFI group outperformed the PI group on all of the four auxiliary measures, but on none of the four past participle measures, whereas the PI FFI CF group outperformed the PI group on all auxiliary measures and two past participle measures. The PI FFI CF group outperformed the PI FFI group on one past participle measure, but on none of the auxiliary measures.\nIn experiment 2, 77 third-semester learners of German were assigned to one of the same three groups as in experiment 1 and engaged in peer interaction activities that revolved around the discussion of the movie Almanya \u2013 Welcome to Germany during an instructional treatment over four consecutive class periods. Only the PI FFI group and the PI FFI CF group received form-focused instruction on vocabulary relevant to the movie, which were 25 German nouns along with their gender and plural forms, and only the PI FFI CF group received training on how to correct peers\u2019 vocabulary mistakes. Results from a pretest and two posttests showed that both the PI FFI and the PI FFI CF group outperformed the PI group on seven of eight measures assessing productive and receptive vocabulary knowledge, as well as knowledge of grammatical gender and plural forms. The PI FFI CF group outperformed the PI FFI group on three of four measures of productive and receptive vocabulary, but on none of the four measures of grammatical gender and plural forms.\nOverall, the findings of the two experiments suggest that peer interaction was most effective when combined with form-focused instruction, and even more effective when peer feedback training was also provided to learners, suggesting that peer corrective feedback is a useful pedagogical intervention in foreign language classrooms. These findings are complemented by qualitative data from semi-structured interviews, that showed learners held positive beliefs about peer interaction and peer corrective feedback, regardless of the treatment group they had been assigned to, although learners from the PI and the PI FFI group were more likely to withhold peer corrections due to social considerations. Qualitative data further showed that the noticing of mistakes, as well as peer corrective feedback, was most likely to occur in the PI FFI CF group. These findings are discussed within the context of the interaction approach (Long, 1983a, 1996; Gass & Mackey, 2015) and the noticing hypothesis (Schmidt, 1990, 2001).

The GO phenomenon occurs when molecular gates in the structure expand/contract in response to the activation/de-activation of a system variable e.g. temperature, pressure or gas. Sharp discontinuities in the isotherm leading to S-shapes and large adsorption-desorption hysteresis are typical of this phenomenon. This study investigates the kinetics and thermodynamics of the GO behavior by combining adsorption measurements and analytical modeling of adsorption kinetics and capacity as a function of adsorbate, GO pressure, and temperature. Basic understanding of GO mechanism will help harness GO-MOF\u2018s as adsorbents for gas separations and storage.\nExperiments were performed on two precharacterized MOFs with verified GO behavior. These are (1) Zn2(bpdc)2(bpee), which expands from a relative amorphous to crystalline structure and (2) Cu[(dhbc)2(4,4\u2018-bpy)]H2O, a mutually interdigitated 2-D structure (bpdc = biphenyldicarboxylate, bpee = 1,2\u2010bipyridylethene; DMF = N,N-dimethyl formamide, dhbc= 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, bpy=bipyridine). Both sub- and super-critical adsorption data were collected using three adsorption units: a standard low-pressure volumetric adsorption unit, a commercial high-pressure gravimetric analyzer and a custom-built high-pressure differential volumetric unit. Collected laboratory data were combined with published adsorption rate and isotherm data for analysis to broaden the range of data collection. The accuracy of the high-pressure differential unit was improved by over 300-fold by changing analytical methods of processing data to establish a reliable null correction. A pronounced effect of the allowed experimental time was found at cryogenic temperatures on (1). Tightening the stability criteria used by the adsorption equipment to determine equilibration increased the experimental time from the order of minutes to >60 hours, and this in turn, led to a ~300 fold increase in capacity, convergence of capacities at similar reduced temperatures (critical temperature being the reducing parameter), discontinuities in the isotherms, lowering of gate-opening pressures, changes in the isotherm shapes as well as width of hysteresis loops. Although an experimental time effect was also seen for H2 adsorption at 77K, H2 showed no discontinuity in the adsorption isotherm, adsorption-desorption hysteresis was much less pronounced, and equilibration required significantly less time. The significant difference in rates of adsorption by different gases was attributed to an activated configurational diffusion regime in which the diffusing species moves through a corrugated surface potential when the diameter of the adsorbate approaches that of the pore. A concentration-dependent diffusion model coupled with insufficient equilibration time provides an alternate explanation to describe the stepwise adsorption behavior in GO-MOFs and the changes in capacities. A sigmoid shape of adsorption rate data at cryogenic temperatures is atypical of simple Fickian diffusion, suggesting a more complex mechanistic explanation is required to explain adsorption kinetics to GO-MOFs. Extending the unreacted shrinking core model from the field of catalyst deactivation suggests that relaxation will be much faster relative to diffusion when temperature is increased even by just 10K. From a thermodynamic perspective, adsorption isotherms on (2) demonstrate universality when pressure and temperature are scaled/reduced according to those at critical conditions. At similar reduced conditions, isotherms of gases on (2) converged and both capacity and pressure points of discontinuities showed a predictive behavior. Discrete levels of capacities were found which decrease in temperature. Existence of a universal parameter of heat of gate-opening is calculated and the heats of adsorption and structural expansion are shown to be separable. This adsorption universality suggests a means to predict adsorption capacity and GO pressure at a particular temperature-pressure for a given adsorbent to other adsorbates at other temperatures and pressures. Such predictive analysis is useful for setting up mass balance and heat balance equations during adsorptive bed design and saves a lot of experimental and computational time.

There exists, however, a need for empirical data for energetic particle combustion in environments of extreme pressures and temperatures.  In order to meet that need, a novel device, a ballistic compressor, has been modified to create the experimental capability needed to obtain such data.  A test section was designed and fabricated to withstand pressures of up to 690 MPa (100,000 psi) while allowing optical access to the combustion event.  In order for the combusting particles to be visible to diagnostic equipment, an electrostatic levitation system was developed to lift the particles into the field of view of the optical diagnostics.  The developed test section was validated through inert gas system checkout and energetic particle ignition and combustion tests.  The ballistic compressor was shown to be capable of observing the combustion of energetic particles, and recording their temperatures over time, for tests with a maximum pressure of approximately 414 MPa (60,000 psi).  Preliminary test results suggest that even without using the levitation system, the light emitted from the combustion of energetic particles inside the test section is visible to the diagnostic instrument.  If the levitation system were unnecessary, it could lead to significant simplifications of the device\u2019s design and operation.

Various sources of unconventional gas such as coalbed methane, shale gas, and gas hydrate have been exploited. This work primarily focuses on shale gas reservoirs which are source rocks for conventional reservoirs. Like other unconventional reservoirs, shale has extremely low permeability in nanodarcy range.\n\nHorizontal well is widely used in the production of shale gas due to its higher wellbore length exposed to the formation resulting in higher gas production rates and ultimate recovery. Hydraulic fracturing which is commonly used in tight formations is a process of pumping high pressured fluid mainly composed of water into the formation. Hydraulic fracturing creates fractures serving as high-permeability pathways that allow gas that is stored further away to flow into the wellbore. To produce natural gas at economic rate, hydraulic fracturing technique is implemented to increase production and, therefore, ultimate recovery.\n\nReservoir simulation is one of the most important techniques in exploration and production. Reservoir simulator can be used in history matching, production forecast, and field optimization. Unfortunately, utilizing numerical reservoir simulator in field optimization can be time-consuming as reservoir modeling and computation could take several hours for each scenario and the optimal cases could be overlooked. In reservoir simulation, shale gas reservoirs can be represented with dual-porosity, single-permeability model with adsorbed gas on shale surface.\n\nConventional representation in reservoir simulation and design of hydraulic fracturing is transverse fracture planes. Each transverse plane represents a single-stage hydraulic fracturing. For horizontal wells, multi-stage hydraulic fracturing is implemented to create multiple transverse vertical planes perpendicular to the wellbore length. This transverse hydraulic fracture representation is widely used in the design of hydraulic fracturing and reservoir modeling. However, microseismic field data show that high pressured fluid creates a hydraulically fractured zone instead of transverse fracture planes. Therefore, in reservoir simulation, an alternative representation for hydraulic fracturing called \u201ccrushed zone\u201d hydraulic fracture representation is proposed. This crushed zone can be represented by an elliptical zone of high fracture permeability and smaller fracture spacing instead of high-permeability transverse fracture planes. Difficulty lies in the characterization of hydraulic fracturing whether which model is more representative and what are their equivalent representations.\n\nArtificial neural network (ANN) is a widely used technology in science and engineering because of its capability of computing highly non-linear relationships. Due to its ability to provide simulation results in seconds, ANN can serve as a powerful tool in reservoir simulation. Several studies at The Pennsylvania State University involving hydrocarbon recovery have been completed using ANNs. In this study, two ANNs based models are developed. The first ANN called \u201cPerformance Prediction ANN\u201d can instantly predict production profile of a hydraulically fractured horizontal well completed in shale gas reservoirs with an error less than 10% from numerical reservoir simulation. The second ANN called \u201cEquivalency ANN\u201d is developed to establish equivalent hydraulic fracture representations between transverse hydraulic fracture representation and crushed zone representation. The equivalent representation from ANN when run with numerical reservoir simulator yields cumulative gas production within \u00b115% error compared to results obtained via conventional simulation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4758], "author_name_tesi": "Siripatrachai, Nithiwat ", "last_name_ssi": "Siripatrachai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nithiwat", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin", "Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor", "Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multi Stage", "Shale", "Hydraulic Fracture", "Horizontal Well", "Artificial Neural Network", "ANN", "Expert System", "Gas"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Development of a Multi-mechanistic Triple-porosity, Triple-permeability Compositional Model for Unconventional Reservoirs", "id": "cn69m413j", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12996", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Most existing compositional reservoir simulators often model fractures using local grid refinement, unstructured-grid, or fine-grid models. Modeling different scales of fractures requires a large number of grid blocks to capture the heterogeneity of the formation. Using a large number of grid blocks presents computational challenges, even with today\u2019s powerful processors. An enhanced matrix permeability on the grid block that hosts short-scale fractures is commonly used to eliminate natural fractures and simplify the model. Additionally, several existing multi-porosity models may not be able to capture heterogeneity and flow behavior in different porosity domains. Sequential flow assumption is frequently made in their models. Flows between different porosity types are not fully coupled, and in some model, a simplified inter-porosity transmissibility function is used for any porosity pairs. \n\nThe oil and gas reserves and flow of reservoir fluids are strongly dependent on phase behavior. Large capillary pressure values are encountered in tight formations such as tight-rocks and shales. The tiny pore throats in these formations result in large capillary pressure. The effect of capillary pressure in tight formations can significantly impact the fluid phase behaviors in the reservoir during production and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) processes. Not incorporating this effect into the simulation can result in an inaccurate estimation of ultimate recovery as well as inefficient design and implementation of EOR techniques. In spite of this, the effect of capillary pressure on phase behavior in tight reservoirs has not been well studied using compositional simulation, especially for hydraulically fractured reservoirs.\n\nIn this research, a fully implicit, multi-mechanistic, fully coupled, triple-porosity, triple-permeability compositional model has been developed for unconventional reservoirs. The hydraulically fractured tight rock and shale reservoir is treated as a triple-porosity system consisting of matrix blocks, natural fractures (micro fractures), and hydraulic fractures (macro fractures). Small-scale fractures are handled by a dual-continuum model. An embedded discrete fracture model is used to effectively and efficiently capture the flow dynamics of hydraulic fractures at any orientations, honoring the complexity and heterogeneity of the fracture networks. The triple-porosity model enables us to assign reservoir properties corresponding to the porosity type. The flows in three porosity types are fully coupled without making the assumption of sequential flow. The inter-porosity fluid transfer honors the geometry of the intersecting porosity pair. The development of the proposed numerical model incorporates the effect of capillary pressure on phase behavior. The transport of hydrocarbon follows a multi-mechanistic flow mechanism that is driven by pressure and concentration fields. \n\nThe simulator has been validated with analytical solutions and a commercial reservoir simulator for a single-porosity model and a dual-porosity, dual-permeability model, both with and without grid refinement. With the proposed model, we can accurately capture major physics of transport phenomena that have been done to date and have the most realistic modeling of fluid flow in hydraulically fractured tight rock and shale reservoirs. The simulator is used in parametric studies to investigate the production performance from hydraulically fractured reservoirs under different modeling techniques and the effect of capillary pressure on phase behavior on reserves and ultimate recovery. The simulator is used to study the impact of inter-porosity transport on the recovery and fluid transport and phase behavior in hydraulically fractured tight rocks and shale formations under high capillary pressure.

In particular, we propose an architecture for network reconfiguration in a supply chain network operating under risk. Such a reconfigurable supply chain network has the ability to respond to risks as they arise and adjust its configuration accordingly to avoid catastrophic failure. To achieve a reconfigurable supply chain, three main components have been developed including an uncertain parameter database in which knowledge about the effects of risks is stored, a stochastic network optimization module that is responsible for determining long-term supply chain network configuration using a two-stage stochastic programming model, and a network configuration controller used to facilitate operations among supply chain nodes. Specifically, the information system of this reconfigurable supply chain network is based on the principle of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), such that heterogeneous nodes with diverse enterprise software platforms can communicate and integrate with each other seamlessly. \nThe first section focuses on obtaining knowledge about the effects of risk on a supply chain. This section proposes a Multi-Agent-base Simulation (MAS) model based on the well-known Gaia methodology and Unified Modeling Language (UML) standard and details it use in simulation experiments to gather knowledge about the network design parameters of the supply chain. In the second part, the knowledge obtained from the MAS model is used to formulate a two-stage stochastic programming model to redesign a supply chain network under risk in the stochastic network optimization module. The Sample Average Approximation (SAA) and L-Shaped decomposition methods are used to solve this supply chain network redesign problem efficiently. Additionally, three different sampling techniques are used to generate random numbers to the SAA method including Simple Random Sampling (SRS), Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), and Sobol\u2019 sequence technique. Results from numerical experiments showed that the LHS technique are the most efficient for solving small problems, whereas, Sobol\u2019 sequence technique is more efficient for addressing moderate or large problems. In the third section, the network configuration obtained from the stochastic network optimization module is implemented on a reconfigurable supply chain network developed based on the SOA principle. The results from simulation experiments show that the network reconfiguration framework via the use of the SOA enables discoverability and interoperability in the supply chain and is capable of improving the supply chain performance in the presence of risk.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6089], "author_name_tesi": "Sirivunnabood, Satama ", "last_name_ssi": "Sirivunnabood", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Satama", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Soundar Kumara", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara", "David Arthur Nembhard", "Sandeep Purao", "Tao Yao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Soundar Kumara, Dissertation Advisor", "Soundar Rajan Tirupatikumara, Committee Chair", "David Arthur Nembhard, Committee Member", "Sandeep Purao, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supply Chain", "Network reconfiguration", "Risk", "Service-Oriented Architecture"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Novel Ti based mixed metal oxide systems for adsorptive desulfurization: A combined ab initio and experimental study", "id": "23109", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10481", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This work examines the mechanism for the adsorptive desulfurization of liquid hydrocarbon fuels over TiO2 based adsorbents. The adsorbent was doped with several metals for enhanced adsorption performance. The undoped and the doped adsorbents were modeled and analyzed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore structure and functional correlations of these systems. Experimental evidence is also offered to support the theoretical results.\nThe TiO2 based systems were chosen as adsorbent materials because of their adsorption capacity and selectivity towards sulfur. Ce doping is shown to have improve the adsorption capacity and selectivity using batch and flow experiments. Herein, the stable facets of the TiO2 crystal are used to model the adsorption of thiophene and its derivatives. Doping was carried out by substituting a surface Ti atom with another metal atom (Ce, Zr, Fe, Mo, etc.). Substitutional doping not only affected the physical properties of the crystals (surface area, pore size), but also affected the electronic properties, leading to variations in the adsorption capacity. The changes in the performance are studied in detail and a unique adsorbent for superior adsorption performance was predicted using DFT and validated through experiments.\nThe presence of oxygen in the atmosphere during the adsorption process leads to a significant increase in adsorption capacity. Experimental characterization determined that the oxidation of thiophenes was the source of the increase. To this effect, three different oxidation states of surface Ti atoms were modeled. A stoichiometric surface having Ti atoms in a 4+ oxidation state, an O-poor surface with surface O-vacancies having Ti atoms in a 3+ state and an O-rich surfaces with an extra O-molecule on the surface were constructed. Results showed that the oxygen rich surfaces have higher affinity towards the thiophenes than the other types of surfaces, due to the formation and adsorption of a sulfone species on such surfaces. Though these sites contribute to improved adsorption, they cannot be formed spontaneously under reaction conditions. Further mechanisms to form such sites are explored and a novel adsorption cycle which allows continuous adsorption of thiophenes is proposed. The mechanism proposed uses surface O-vacancies as active sites for activating the oxygen molecules for oxidation of the thiophenic molecules. The vacancy sites are then regenerated by the formation of a sulfone. Each step in the mechanism is analyzed using DFT and dopants are screened based on the energetics for the critical steps in the cycle viz. vacancy formation, oxygen adsorption and sulfoxide formation. Experimental evidence is provided to validate the predicted adsorbents. This work paves the way for characterization and design of doped metal oxide adsorbents capable of adsorbing high amounts of sulfur selectively. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10133], "author_name_tesi": "Sitamraju, Siddarth ", "last_name_ssi": "Sitamraju", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Siddarth", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Chunshan Song", "Chunshan Song", "Michael John Janik", "Xiaoxing Wang", "Jonathan P Mathews"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Chunshan Song, Dissertation Advisor", "Chunshan Song, Committee Chair", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Xiaoxing Wang, Committee Member", "Jonathan P Mathews, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DFT", "Titania", "Anatase", "Adsorptive desulfurization", "Air promoted desulfurization"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Regeneration Stocking in Harvested Forest Stands", "id": "9089", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3483", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Stocking equations, normally used to evaluate stands of saw-timber sized trees, were adapted and applied to younger trees in the post-harvest environment of regenerating stands.

At all intervals following harvest, regeneration stocking levels were significantly different between stands harvested via clearcut versus those harvested by a shelterwood treatment, with few shelterwood stands exhibiting positive regeneration progress at year seven.

However, the rates and mechanisms of saprolite formation are poorly understood.  Basalt weathering advance rates at scales from laboratory to watershed were compiled.  Four of the 7 orders of magnitude variability in these weathering advance rates can be attributed to the fractal nature of surface area.  Fractal dimensions were derived and used to predict weathering advance rates at any spatial scale from weathering advance rates in laboratory experiments.  \n\tChemical weathering is studied in weathering rinds formed on basalt clasts from Costa Rica.  Conceptually these weathering rinds are small scale saprolites, developed in the absence of erosion, that provide information about the mechanisms and rates of saprolite formation.  Chemical and physical characterization of changes associated weathering rind formation were combined with weathering advance rate and methods from chapter 2 to calculate one of the first field basalt weathering rates not influenced by erosion.\n\tPorosity changes associated with weathering can induce changes in fluid transport rates and thus potentially the overall chemical reaction rates.  Computed tomography data demonstrate increases in total and effective porosity with weathering.  A critical porosity of ~12% was observed that must be achieved before increases in effective porosity are measured.  Archie\u2019s Law, commonly used to estimate effective diffusion coefficients from total porosity, was modified to incorporate the critical porosity.  This modified Archie\u2019s Law predicts measured effective diffusion coefficients better than the original Archie\u2019s Law.  The simplest reactive transport model that predicts 4 important features of the weathering system includes the modified Archie\u2019s Law and variable surface area of primary minerals.  \n\tWe hypothesize that the reaction front thickness is related to heterogeneity size in any given system.  Reaction front thickness in the Costa Rica basalts is apparently controlled by plagioclase grain size indicating that the largest heterogeneity that influences chemical weathering at the clast scale is grain size.  In watersheds, heterogeneities such as fracture spacing, or variations in erosional regime and topography should have greater influence over reaction front thickness.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [193], "author_name_tesi": "Sitchler, Alexis K", "last_name_ssi": "Sitchler", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Alexis", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley", "Eric Kirby", "Jennifer Macalady", "Derek Elsworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Chair", "Eric Kirby, Committee Member", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["chemical weathering", "basalt", "porosity", "diffusion", "scaling", "reactive transport modeling", "weathering rinds"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Substrate Positioning and Channeling Of Escherichia Coli Quinolinate Synthase", "id": "16050", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8031", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-10-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The essential cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is consumed in many metabolic reactions in the cell, necessitating the need to synthesize NAD.  In most bacteria, the de novo pathway to form NAD begins with two unique enzymes that have been extensively studied herein.  The first enzyme in the pathway, L-aspartate oxidase, performs a two-electron oxidation of L-aspartate to form iminoaspartate.  This flavin containing enzyme can undergo multiple catalytic turnovers given the oxidants, fumarate or molecular oxygen, to afford the oxidized form of the enzyme.  The second enzyme in the pathway, quinolinate synthase or NadA, condenses iminoaspartate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to form quinolinic acid, the backbone of the pyridine ring of NAD.  \nMany have postulated that these two enzymes can operate as an enzyme complex, yet no substantial evidence of this complex has been demonstrated.  Investigations to examine the possible protein-protein interactions of the two enzymes were carried out, yet no obvious interaction was seen by the techniques employed.  The oxygen-sensitive nature of Fe/S cluster of NadA and the kinetics of NadB prevented gathering data to conclude a concrete finding.     \nThe mechanism of NadA is still unknown despite discovering its requirement for a [4Fe-4S] cluster for activity over seven years ago.  While it was speculated and now shown by others, that the Fe/S cluster acts a Lewis acid to aid in the final dehydration of a reaction intermediate to form quinolinic acid, no evidence exists with native substrates coordinating to the Fe/S cluster.  The advanced spectroscopic techniques, EPR and ENDOR, were employed to examine NadA with various substrates.

Also, this research intends to shed new light on the major factors contributing to the occurrence of median crossover accidents, which are particularly severe.  Furthermore, the research aims to lay out methodologies that provide significant improvements in frequency predictions.  The entire highway network of Washington State is used as the empirical setting.  The database was developed over several years of observations and includes median crossover accident data, geometric and traffic volume information as well as weather data.  In traffic accident databases that are comprised of cross-sectional panels, unobserved effects or heterogeneity, correlation due to shared unobserved effects through accident counts, and excess zero problems are common issues in the estimation of accident count models.  I establish various model structures through classical frequentist and Bayesian approaches to explore these issues.  Several hundred modeling specifications were assessed to determine the most meaningful and robust specifications.  In the final analysis, the same set of specifications was used to compare the results across model structures.  Preliminary results showed variabilities in statistical significance of key parameters; but the parameters themselves do not change significantly.  Much of the variability in the standard errors of parameters results from error structure assumptions.  For example, hierarchical structures, or multiplicative structures that are specified exogenously through Bayesian methods help improve predictions.  The major contribution of this dissertation is the development of modeling taxonomies where assumptions under frequentist and Bayesian methods are incorporated through examination of model equivalencies.  Such taxonomies are helpful in illustrating with greater clarity the relative usefulness of frequentist and Bayesian methods as they relate to all types of accident frequencies.  In this sense, this dissertation offers a general framework.  In addition, from a programming standpoint, the efficiency and consistency of highway safety prioritization can be broadly addressed through this framework.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6021], "author_name_tesi": "Sittikariya, Sittipan ", "last_name_ssi": "Sittikariya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sittipan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar", "Martin T Pietrucha", "Thorsten Wagener", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Venkataraman Shankar, Committee Chair", "Martin T Pietrucha, Committee Member", "Thorsten Wagener, Committee Member", "Evelyn Ann Thomchick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Median crossover accidents", "Heterogeneity", "Negative Binomial", "Random effects Poisson", "Bayesian modeling"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Language of Lithography in Mati\u00e8re et M\u00e9moire: Jean Dubuffet's Critique of Henri Bergson\n\n\n", "id": "9565", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3728", "abstract_tesi": "Substantial research has been lacking on French artist Jean Dubuffet in the English language, especially on his printed works.

In May of 1933, a new Act created the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to build a series of dams in the Tennessee River watershed that spanned seven states. From its inception, the TVA was controversial because it changed the influence that private business had over water rights, and paved the way for government regulation of electricity prices. This dissertation situates the visual dissemination of the TVA dams project through an examination of the role of its publicity as a modernizing tool in mid 20th - century America. Much scholarly work has explored the Tennessee Valley Authority from the perspective of its socio-economic effects and its contentious ecological ramifications, yet the Authority\u2019s rich visual culture has escaped prolonged scholarly engagement. This is surprising considering that the TVA was an explicitly visionary enterprise, time and again enlisting photographers to illustrate articles and books that would reach and teach citizens of the Tennessee Valley, the country, and other nations, about the modernizing goals of the project. \nThe TVA promoted its projects via posters, documentary photographs and film, paintings, post cards, museum exhibitions, fair exhibitions, journals and newspaper articles. As the images shifted, so did the understanding and approval of the project, but the images needed to change frequently to keep up with public opinion. Public perception altered the way the TVA sought out a targeted audience in order to gain approval for a project that was constantly fighting legal battles in the Supreme Court (and more emotional battles in the impoverished and segregated rural south). The TVA blossomed during and after the Great Depression, but its endeavors in the fine arts and visual culture resonate beyond the immediate context of the New Deal. These activities point to a re-thinking of the very concept of modernization.

Despite its importance for plate boundary fault processes, quantitative constraints on pore pressure \u2013 especially within fault zones - are rare. In this paper, we combine laboratory measurements of permeability for core samples taken from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 190 with a model of loading and pore pressure diffusion to examine the evolution of pore fluid pressure within underthrust sediment at the Nankai accretionary complex. Constraints based on recent estimates of pore pressure up ~20 km from the trench, borehole data, and permeability measurements made over a wide range of stresses and porosities allow us to make projections of pore pressure within the underthrust section to greater depths and distances from the trench than in previous studies, and to directly quantify pore pressure within the fault zone itself, which acts as the upper boundary of the underthrusting section. Our results suggest that excess pore pressure (P*) along the d\u00e9collement ranges from 1.7 \u2013 2.1 MPa at the trench to 30.2 \u2013 35.9 MPa by 40 km landward, corresponding to pore pressure ratios of &#955;b = 0.68 \u2013 0.77 (  = 0.30 \u2013 0.60). For friction coefficients of 0.30 - 0.40, the resulting shear stress along the d\u00e9collement remains < 12 MPa over the front 40 km of the accretionary complex. When non-cohesive critical taper theory is applied using these values, the required pore pressure ratios within the wedge are near hydrostatic (&#955;w = 0.41 - 0.59), implying either that pore pressure throughout the wedge is low, or that the fault slips only during transient pulses of elevated pore pressure. In addition, simulated downward migration of minima in effective stress during drainage provides a simple, quantitative explanation for observed down-stepping of the d\u00e9collement that is consistent with observations at Nankai.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5260], "author_name_tesi": "Skarbek, Robert Maurice ", "last_name_ssi": "Skarbek", "middle_name_ssi": "Maurice ", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Demian Saffer", "Demian Saffer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Demian Saffer, Thesis Advisor", "Demian Saffer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["marine hydrogeology", "marine geology and geophysics", "subduction zone processes"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Supporting the use of technology in organizations over time\n", "id": "9514", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "242", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the current research, I introduce a multidimensional construct, system support climate (SSC), and predict that different dimensions of this construct are more or less influential across different stages of the lifespan of a technology in the workplace.

A current strategy, approved by the FDA, for breast cancer prevention is the daily administration of selective estrogen receptor modulators(SERMS), tamoxifen and raloxifene.  These SERMS have proven to be effective at reducing breast cancer incidence in women that are at high risk by 50% and 38%, respectively. However, these agents are poorly accepted as oral chemopreventives even by women at high risk for breast cancer because of concerns of side effects which include thromboembolic events and an increase in endometrial cancers. Furthermore, both agents are ineffective against the more aggressive estrogen receptor negative tumors.  A series of experiments have been conducted in our laboratories to test the hypothesis that chemoprevention can be improved by combining SERMS with agents with different mechanisms of action.  Such an approach can allow the use of low doses of SERMS and thus reduce their side effects.  Literature data provide some support of the protective effects of omega-3 fatty acids against the development of several cancers, including breast cancer. However, the results remain inconsistent which could be due to confounding variables. These confounding variables which have been reported by our group include omega-3:omega-6(n-3:n-6) ratio and caloric intake.  A previous study conducted in our laboratories showed that high ratios of omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids(25:1 n-3:n-6) are required to inhibit mammary carcinogenesis in the rat and such high ratios of omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids potentiated the chemopreventive efficacy of tamoxifen.  \n\tStudies conducted in Chapter 2 were aimed to test the hypothesis that by using a proteomics approach, novel proteins can be identified that can provide insights into the molecular mechanism by which high ratios of omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids inhibit mammary carcinogenesis.  We further hypothesize that proteins identified in a minimally invasive fashion can be used for early detection and to monitor the efficacy of the chemopreventive agents.\n\tWe used an isobaric Tagging for Relative and Absolute Quantitation (iTRAQ) method to provide insights into the mechanism, at the protein level, responsible for the chemopreventive action of the high omega-3:omega-6 fatty acid ratios in the absence and presence of tamoxifen in the 1-methyl-1-nitrosourea(MNU)-induced mammary tumor model in the rat; selective proteins were further validated by western blotting.  Compared to control (n-3:n-6, 1:1) diet, both 10:1 and 25:1 n-3:n-6 diets upregulated plasma vitamin D binding protein, gelsolin, and 14-3-3 sigma, reported to have tumor suppressive effects, whereas alpha-1B-glycoprotein which has been reported to be elevated in the serum of breast cancer patients was decreased.  Compared to 25:1 n-3:n-6, the 25:1 n-3:n-6 plus tamoxifen diet downregulated apolipoprotein E, haptoglobin, and inter-alpha-inhibitor H4 heavy chain.  Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) determined that the trends of specific proteins were related to lipid metabolism in the 25:1 n-3:n-6 group whereas the 25:1 n-3:n-6 plus tamoxifen group included proteins involved in cancer and inflammation.  Collectively, our results show that several proteins were altered in a manner consistent with chemoprevention. \n \tThe Western diet is composed of a 15:1 n-6:n-3 ratio and would be impractical for women to consume high omega-3:omega-6 ratios on a daily basis.  The chemopreventive efficacy of the high omega-3:omega-6 ratios suggests that a component of omega-3 fatty acids(eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) or one of its metabolites which is present in small amounts could account for the chemopreventive effects observed in the rat.  Furthermore, considering the superior efficacy of DHA over EPA, in preclinical mammary carcinogenesis models as reported in the literature provided a strong rationale to focus our studies on DHA.  However, the highly unsaturated structure of DHA makes it susceptible to oxidation by aqueous medium, therefore a liposomal formulation of DHA would be ideal for oral administration, which is considered an appropriate route for chemoprevention studies.\n\t In Chapter 3, we hypothesize that an ether lipid based nanoliposome delivery system of DHA would protect DHA from oxidation and fluctuation in pH of the gastrointestinal system, resulting in an ideal oral delivery system. Oral delivery is the appropriate route for chemoprevention studies. We further hypothesize that liposomal DHA will be more efficacious than free DHA at providing an anti-cancer effect in vitro, specifically in both estrogen receptor positive and estrogen receptor negative human breast cancer cell lines.  Our results indicated that our liposomal formulation of DHA(size: 136nm, charge: -1.3mV) protected DHA from oxidation and acidic pH, as determined by dynamic light scattering. Our liposome also had a 60-80% encapsulation efficiency as determined by LC-MS/MS.  Furthermore, liposomal DHA was found to be more efficacious at reducing cell viability, and increasing apoptosis in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. In addition, western blot analysis revealed that liposomal DHA was more efficacious at altering protein markers (P-AKT, P-S6, p21, cleaved PARP, BCL-2) of cell viability, the cell cycle, and apoptosis in human breast cancer cell lines in a manner consistent with chemoprevention.  \n\tWe decided in Chapter 4 to test our hypothesis that the oral administration of our acid stable liposome formulation of DHA would protect DHA from oxidation and acidic pH and thus increasing the bioavailability of DHA and its metabolites in the serum and at the mammary fat pad. To test our hypothesis, it was crucial to initially demonstrate whether our oral liposomal formulation was capable of delivering DHA and its metabolites to the circulation and mammary fat pad.  Female rats (21-day old) were gavaged with liposomal DHA and sacrificed at 1, 3, and 6 hours and tissues and serum were collected at each time point.  Fatty acids were extracted with a solution ethyl acetate/hexane and methylated using a solution of acetyl chloride, butylated hydroxytoluene, and methanol.  Detection and quantification of DHA (expressed as % of administered dose) were achieved using Gas Chromatography Flame Ionization Detection(GC-FID), and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy(LC-MS/MS). The lipoxygenase (LOX) metabolites of DHA, known to play a role in anti-inflammation, were quantified using LC MS/MS.  Following the oral administration of liposomal DHA, a significantly higher amount of DHA was found in the mammary fat pad (15-20%), 2-3 fold higher, than in the serum (4.5-6%).  The LOX metabolites 4-hydroxy DHA, 14-hydroxy DHA, and 17-hydroxy DHA were also detected in both the serum (0.14%) and mammary fat pad (0.45%).  \n\tIn summary, we demonstrated that high omega-3 fatty acids ratios(25:1) with and without tamoxifen were able to alter plasma proteins in a manner consistent with chemoprevention.  Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time the successful formulation of liposomal DHA for oral delivery of DHA.  Our formulation protected DHA from acidic pH and oxidation and in vitro and in vivo results provided experimental data demonstrating the potential utility of liposomal DHA in the prevention of breast cancer initially in preclinical models and ultimately in the clinic.  Future studies (detailed in Chapter 5) will be aimed at comparing the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and chemopreventive efficacy of liposomal DHA and free DHA in the rat.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11304], "author_name_tesi": "Skibinski, Christine G", "last_name_ssi": "Skibinski", "middle_name_ssi": "G", "first_name_ssi": "Christine", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karam E El Bayoumy", "Arunangshu Das", "Thomas E Spratt", "Andrea Manni", "Mark Kester"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karam E El Bayoumy, Dissertation Advisor", "Arunangshu Das, Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member", "Andrea Manni, Committee Member", "Mark Kester, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Docosahexaenoic Acid", "Liposome", "Breast Cancer Prevention"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "The Pulsation of Ventilated Supercavities", "id": "18680", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9184", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-11-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Supercavity pulsation is a self-excited resonance phenomenon that destabilizes a supercavity and leads to the periodic release of gas pockets at the tail of the cavity. Previous literature suggests that this phenomenon requires a free surface to occur and that the blockage from a narrow, rigid wall tunnel would not allow for the cavitation number, \u03c3, to be sufficiently low for pulsation to be initiated. Utilizing the 0.305 m and 1.212 m diameter water tunnels at ARL Penn State, an experimental study on both the pulsation phenomenon and the effects of tunnel blockage has been conducted. In parallel to this study, a computational study on the same topics has been conducted using the CFD code, UNCLE-M. This thesis presents a summary of the investigation performed on pulsating ventilated supercavities and the effects of blockage on their formation. Pulsating supercavities were generated in the 0.305 m water tunnel in both a fully filled and a partially filled condition. It was found that the rigid walls of the tunnel served to shrink the envelope of conditions over which pulsation could occur, but they did not inhibit pulsation entirely. The effects of blockage were examined and distinct differences in closure regimes were observed at identical test conditions depending on whether the experiments were performed in the 0.305 m or 1.212 m water tunnel. The twin vortex closure regime was found to be dominant in the 0.305 m water tunnel, whereas the re- entrant jet closure regime was found to exist over a much wider range of conditions in the 1.212 m water tunnel compared to the 0.305 m water tunnel. Finally, a previously undocumented hybrid closure regime was discovered; a stable, hybrid twin vortex and pulsating cavity closure regime characterized by traveling surface waves propagating down the hollow vortex tubes of the twin vortex closure.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9005], "author_name_tesi": "Skidmore, Grant Marston", "last_name_ssi": "Skidmore", "middle_name_ssi": "Marston", "first_name_ssi": "Grant", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jules Washington Lindau V", "Timothy A Brungart", "Robert Francis Kunz"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jules Washington Lindau V, Thesis Advisor", "Timothy A Brungart, Thesis Advisor", "Robert Francis Kunz, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supercavitation", "Pulsation", "Cavitation", "Oscillation", "Resonance", "Ventilated Supercavities", "Two Phase Flow"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "The mitigation of pulsation in ventilated supercavities", "id": "28966", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12370", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "It is desirable to use ventilated supercavities to reduce the drag created by underwater bodies and obtain velocities much higher than those that are possible with fully wetted bodies. Ventilated supercavities, however, are prone to an autoresonant phenomenon known as pulsation where the supercavity radius and length oscillate with time. These oscillations in radius and length are oftentimes severe enough to cause issues with body stability and control. In this dissertation, a method to mitigate pulsation in ventilated supercavities is presented. The method, which modulates or adds a sinusoidal component to the ventilation rate, is shown to suppress pulsation numerically, experimentally, and computationally. Additionally in this dissertation, the near-field acoustic characteristics of twin vortex, re-entrant jet, and pulsating ventilated supercavities are studied experimentally. This study is then repeated computationally, with a focus on the generation and mitigation of pulsation in ventilated supercavities. \n\nThe study of the near-field radiated noise from supercavities shows that pulsating supercavities generate noise that is two orders of magnitude (i.e., 40 dB) greater in level than that from comparable twin vortex and re-entrant jet supercavities. For pulsating supercavities, it is found that the interior cavity pressure and near-field radiated noise are both monotonic in frequency, with said frequency being related to the freestream velocity and the length of the dominant waves on the supercavity air/water interface. For pulsating supercavities, it is also found that, at the pulsation frequency, the cavity interior pressure spectrum level is related to the near-field and far-field noise spectrum level through spherical spreading of the sound waves from the supercavity interface. As a result, the cavity interior pressure can be used as a measure of the radiated noise. \n\nThe developed method for mitigating pulsation in ventilated supercavities is shown to transition the initially pulsating supercavities to the twin vortex closure regime. A wide range of ventilation rate modulation frequencies cause the pulsating supercavity to transition into twin vortex closure, typically within 0.25 seconds of modulation initiation. Accompanying the transition from pulsation to twin vortex closure is a reduction in the radiated noise, to the continuum at the pulsation frequency, oftentimes 35 dB or more. Other modulation frequencies do not suppress pulsation but are effective at changing the supercavity pulsation frequency. The numeric exploration of the methodology focuses on solving a modified Hill's equation which captures the basics of the modulation method, and is based on Song's supercavity model. The model adequately predicts those modulation frequencies that mitigate ventilated supercavity pulsation and those that do not. \n\nThe computational study utilizes 3D finite volume computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling, without a turbulence model, for the equations of fluid mixture motion. The gas is treated as isothermal and compressible, and the water is treated as isothermal and incompressible. The interface is captured using the High Resolution Interface Capturing (HRIC) scheme. Utilizing these models allows for the re-entrant jet, pulsating, and twin vortex closure regimes to be delineated and computationally resolved, including the expected hysteresis. To validate the use of these models, computational and experimental pulsating supercavities are generated at similar conditions. A detailed comparison of these supercavities show that the computational supercavity is able to capture the behavior of the experimental supercavity favorably. The computational exploration of the pulsation mitigation methodology was performed at conditions that not only matched those of the water tunnel experiments, but at a Froude number much larger than those explored experimentally. The computational study demonstrated that by appropriately modulating the ventilation rate, it is possible to suppress pulsation and transition the cavity to either the twin vortex or re-entrant jet closure regime at velocities much higher than those examined in the water tunnel experiments.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11743], "author_name_tesi": "Skidmore, Grant Marston", "last_name_ssi": "Skidmore", "middle_name_ssi": "Marston", "first_name_ssi": "Grant", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jules Washington Lindau V", "Jules Washington Lindau V", "Timothy A Brungart", "Robert Francis Kunz", "Jonathan S Pitt", "Toan Nguyen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jules Washington Lindau V, Dissertation Advisor", "Jules Washington Lindau V, Committee Chair", "Timothy A Brungart, Committee Chair", "Robert Francis Kunz, Committee Member", "Jonathan S Pitt, Committee Member", "Toan Nguyen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Supercavitation", "Cavitation", "Pulsation", "Ventilated Supercavities", "Multiphase Flow", "CFD", "Noise", "Acoustics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF PRE- AND POST-BREAKUP LIQUID JETS", "id": "9525", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1439", "abstract_tesi": "The formation and disintegration of liquid jets has been studied for over 150 years due to its importance in many engineering applications including the nuclear reactor.

This edge-on orientation of ionically conducting layered oxides is of interest for practical applications in batteries and fuel cells.  The consistent direction of orientation of the lamellar oxides studied can be rationalized in the framework of a quantitative bond anisotropy model previously developed by Uyeda (Phys. Chem.

Calcite dissolution, one of the most important subsurface reactions, has been studied since late 19th century with a sole focus on homogeneous systems. First studies of more realistic heterogeneous systems started in the past couple of years. \nThis work examines the effects of geochemical heterogeneity on calcite dissolution rates with variable permeability contrasts, flow rates, and inlet pH. The investigation consisted of the two major parts: column experiments for dissolution data and reactive flow modeling by the use of CrunchFlow software that simulated the laboratory set-up. Two pairs of 10 cm long and 2.5 cm in diameter columns were wet packed with inert quartz and reactive calcite. The sets\u2019 permeability contrasts were 0.5 and 0.83. Each set contained a Mixed Column, representing a homogeneous system, and a One-Zone Column, a heterogeneous system with a cylindrical calcite insertion along the principal flow direction. The inlet solution was injected upwards through the columns at flow rates between 0.03 and 6.3mL/min with pH at 4 and 6.7. The effluent samples were collected at the outlet of the column up to 10 residence times with variable time steps. The modeling was performed via CrunchFlow reactive flow software package. CrunchFlow simultaneously solves systems of differential transport equations for each grid block of the discretized system representation for each primary species. The reactive flow model was calibrated based on laboratory obtained calcite effluent breakthrough data for the slowest and fastest flow rates. \nUnder low flow rates where the system reaches equilibrium, the column scale bulk dissolution rates varied between 1.02 and 1.55\u00d710-11 mol/ m2/s, producing effluent calcium concentrations between 1.43 and 2.17\u00d710-4 mol/L. The rates of the Mixed Columns were on average 1.25 times higher than those of the corresponding One-Zone Columns. At higher flow rates, under prevalent kinetic regime with transport rates higher than reaction rates, the dissolution rates increased up to 10-9 mol/ m2/s order of magnitude. The calcium concentration ranged between orders of magnitude 10-5 mol/L for One-Zone Columns and 10-4 mol/L for the Mixed Columns. The dissolution reaction occurred mostly at the interface of calcite and quartz the One-Zone Columns, leading to significantly lower rates than those in Mixed Columns, where all calcite and quartz grains were well-mixed. After matching the experimental data, more simulations were carried out under an array of was flow rate conditions between 0.03mL/min and 13mL/min with permeability contrasts between 0.01 and 12. Model results showed that the discrepancy of the dissolution rate of One-Zone Columns in comparison to the corresponding Mixed Columns increased with increase in flow velocity. The simulations also showed that that under conditions where permeability of calcite zone is lower than that of the quartz and where flow rates are high, the calcite the interface is most influential in determining the dissolution rate. \nThe effective surface area of the system increased with increasing flow rate and permeability contrast, which occurred due to the increase in flow through the reactive calcite zone of the column. The simulations show that the dissolution rate strongly depend on effective surface area instead of the total surface area of the columns. This proves that degree of system\u2019s heterogeneity directly affects its dissolution capacity.\nThese results imply that in heterogeneous carbonate formations, mineral spatial pattern must be taken into account during reservoir simulation or treatment design. The present study identified discrepancies in dissolution rates between homogeneous and heterogeneous systems on a relatively small spatial and time scales. Theses discrepancies are magnified in natural subsurface systems due to the systems\u2019 size and time of operation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9416], "author_name_tesi": "Skocik, Mariya ", "last_name_ssi": "Skocik", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mariya", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Li Li", "William Arthur Groves", "Mark Stephen Klima", "Dr Luis Ayala"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Li Li, Thesis Advisor", "William Arthur Groves, Thesis Advisor", "Mark Stephen Klima, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Luis Ayala, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Carbonate Heterogeneity", "Dissolution Rate", "CrunhFlow"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Bio-inspired and Neuromorphic Machine Vision System for Analyzing Three-dimensional Data", "id": "28656", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12240", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-02-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates neuron models, which are the basic units of computation in many bio-inspired data analysis systems; neural networks, which are used for abstract pattern storage and reconstruction; and neural systems, which process data to identify patterns. Binary, continuous activation, and spiking neuron models are investigated, and neural circuits composed of spiking neuron models that perform various mathematical operations are proposed. These mathematical operations are useful in simulating neural networks and neural systems. The Hopfield and grandmother cell models, which are basic artificial neural networks for modeling biological memory systems, are investigated and compared on their capacities, and a hybridized model is proposed that performs comparably. A machine vision system for analyzing three-dimensional data,  which is inspired from the human visual processing neural system, is proposed and evaluated on its ability to identify actions from videos, detect pulmonary nodules from computed tomography scans, and predict Alzheimer\u2019s disease progression from magnetic resonance images.

The vibronic coupling defined as the Hamiltonian matrix element between the reactant and product mixed electron-proton vibronic wavefunctions significantly impacts the rates, kinetic isotope effects and temperature dependences of proton-coupled electron transfer reactions. The relative timescales of the electrons and tunneling proton can span the range from adiabatic, where the electrons respond instantaneously to the motion of the proton, to nonadiabatic, where the electrons and proton move on similar time scales. To calculate quantitatively accurate proton tunneling splittings and vibronic couplings and thereby obtain meaningful insights, methods that avoid the Born-Oppenheimer separation of transferring protons and electrons are necessary. We have developed a capable molecular orbital-based nonadiabatic method within the nuclear electronic orbital framework for calculating proton tunneling splittings and proton-coupled electron transfer vibronic couplings and have also implemented an alternative semiclassical grid-based method.  We have applied the semiclassical method to two hydrogen self-exchange systems that are exemplary of electronically nonadiabatic and electronically adiabatic proton transfer. The benzyl-toluene system is an example of the electronically adiabatic limit, in which the proton transfer proceeds on the adiabatic electronic ground state surface.  The phenoxyl-phenol system provides an example of the nonadiabatic limit, in which the proton transfer proceeds through a nonadiabatic transition between two diabatic electronic states. Our analysis of these two systems provides insights into the fundamental physical principles underlying PCET reactions. For the phenoxyl/phenol system, quantitative agreement between the molecular orbital based nuclear electronic orbital nonothorogonal configuration interaction method and the three-dimensional semiclassical grid based approach is observed providing a level of validation for both methods. Additionally we use both methods to analyze the effects of substituents on the vibronic coupling and hence the transfer rate in the phenoxyl/phenol self-exchange reaction.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2706], "author_name_tesi": "Skone, Jonathan H", "last_name_ssi": "Skone", "middle_name_ssi": "H", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sharon Hammes Schiffer", "James Bernhard Anderson", "Mark Maroncelli", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sharon Hammes Schiffer, Committee Chair", "James Bernhard Anderson, Committee Member", "Mark Maroncelli, Committee Member", "Kristen Ann Fichthorn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electronically nonadiabatic", "nonorthogonal configuration interaction", "tunneling splitting", "proton-coupled electron transfer", "vibronic coupling", "kinetic isotope effect", "semiclassical method", "proton transfer"]}]
