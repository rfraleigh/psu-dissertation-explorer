To maintain the integrity and function of the skin, immune cells in the skin are tightly regulated to allow tolerance to harmless antigens but mount effective response to dangerous assaults, and their dysregulation might increase incidence of skin diseases. Balanced presence of different types of immune cells in the skin is critical in protecting against foreign assaults and preventing inflammatory  damage.  However,  how  immune  cell  homeostasis  is  established  and maintained in skin is not well understood.   \n\nCCR10,  with  its  ligand  CCL27  expressed  by  keratinocytes,  are  the  most  skin-specific chemokine/receptor pair implicated in the skin T cell migration and inflammatory diseases. Skin-resident  T  cells  are  unique  populations  of  immune  cells  with  memory  cell\u2013like properties. Among them, recently identified skin-resident CD8+ memory T (Trm) cells play \nan important role in providing faster immune responses to skin infection than those from the circulation.  However,  it  remains  elusive  that  how  these  cells  persist  in  the  skin  and whether/how they regulate other immune cells in the local tissue. \n\nUsing  CCR10  knockout/EGFP  knockin  mice,  I  determined  the  role  of  CCR10-mediated migration  of  memory-like  CD8+  cells  and  the  maintenance  of  immune homeostasis  in  the skin.  I  found  that  CCR10-/-  mice  had imbalanced  numbers  and  dysregulated  functions  of \nskin-resident effector and regulatory T (Teff and Treg) cells associated with enhanced innate and memory skin immune responses to antigen stimulations. The enhanced immune response in CCR10 -/- mice allowed them to clear the skin Leishmania major (L. major) infection more efficiently than wild type (WT) mice did. I also found that that skin-resident CCR10+ CD8+ T cells  are important in  the  homeostasis  of  resident  ILCs  and  CD4+ T cells  by  promoting  the maintenance of regulatory T (Treg) cells in the skin through the B7.2/CTLA-4 axis to promote immune  homeostasis  and  control  immune  responses.  Specifically,  impaired  establishment  of \nCCR10-knockout CD8+ resident T cells in the skin results in enhanced immune responses to both T cell antigen specific and non-specific challenges. The over-active response is associated with altered balance of resident Treg and CD4+ effector T (Teff) cells. Further studies found that B7.2 expressed on CD8+ T cells is involved in supporting Treg cells in the skin through interaction \nwith  CTLA-4  highly  expressed  on  skin  Treg  cells.  These  findings  provide  novel  insight  into mechanisms regulating immune homeostasis and responses in the local tissue that could help in areas such as vaccine development and therapeutic design for treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases.

The heat transfer regime of interest is high temperature film boiling and the transition point at the minimum film boiling temperature, Tmin. The large superheat temperature and heat flux are able to sustain a vapor blanket that prevents the bulk liquid from direct physical contact with the heated surface. Experiments focused on varying the initial rod temperature, liquid subcooling, and surface conditions through oxidation to study their influence on Tmin and the boiling curve. These initial conditions were varied for two series of quenching experiments. The first varied the rod and bath temperatures and the second held these temperatures constant for sequential tests to build an oxide layer. A stainless steel cylindrical rod fitted with embedded thermocouples was heated to a temperature well in the film boiling regime and quickly inserted in an otherwise quiescent pool of distilled water. The superheated surface is quenched when the liquid comes into contact after the collapse of the vapor film. The embedded thermocouples were connected to a data acquisition system to record temperature-time traces. Additionally, video was recorded during the quenching process for visualization of the vapor film. Quenching curves were used to calculate the heat flux and construct the boiling curve. The minimum film boiling temperature was calculated by finding the minimum heat flux associated with Tmin. Data reduction was performed by using an inverse heat conduction code (DATARH) to calculate surface temperature and heat flux. It was found that, similar to the majority of previous research, the liquid subcooling strongly influences the minimum film boiling temperature. In addition, the vapor film thickness and the behavior of the liquid-vapor boundary layer is closely linked to the liquid subcooling. The initial surface temperature had little effect on Tmin compared to the large effect of liquid subcooling. The duration of the entire quench process however, was extended when the initial surface temperature was increased. A second series of tests to investigate the effects of oxidation were also undertaken. When several tests were completed in succession without restoring the rod surface to bare conditions, Tmin changed subtly after the first oxidized test. The effect did not become more pronounced with subsequent tests. However when the rods were given multiple hours to oxidize, Tmin did not stay constant. This suggests that although stainless steel is resistant to changes to the oxide layer during short term heat cycles, extended heat influences the oxide layer.\nThe current findings were used to observe the effectiveness of a correlation produced by Peterson and Bajorek. As the surface conditions of the oxidized rod were unable to be quantified, the basic form of the correlation was used.

Because of this proximity to blood flow, they are continuously exposed to mechanical forces that exhibit a wide range of spatial and temporal scales and directions.  Among the key sensing mechanisms of the cell are focal adhesions (FA), and the plasma membrane.  Dynamic and elusive in nature, membrane rafts have not been associated with being mechanosensitive, nor of being mechanically coupled to other mechanosensors. However, there is mounting evidence that focal adhesion formation and stability is sensitive to membrane composition.  In order to test the hypothesis that membrane rafts participate in mechanosensation we developed a technique where single endothelial cells were deformed via FAs induced at the tip of a fibronectin (FN)-functionalized nanoelectrode probe.  The dynamics of nascent FA assembly was assessed using time-lapsed fluorescent images of transfected RFP talin.  We further hypothesized that membrane rafts, by virtue of their attachment to the cytoskeleton and high mobility in the plasma membrane, were mechanically coupled to FAs.  To determine the kinetics and sequential order of raft and talin mechanosensitivity, time lapsed confocal fluorescent images were taken of cells during mechanical manipulation of a single induced FA by the nanoelectrode probe.  Remote mechanosensing by rafts, sequential kinetics, and long term reversible accumulation was observed. These results demonstrate that rafts are directly mechanosensitive, mechanically coupled to focal adhesions, and that raft mobility may enable the earliest events related to FA mechanosensing.  To better understand adhesion and the role of membrane composition, an optical trap was used to manipulate a FN functionalized bead near a cell in order to monitor dynamic adhesion events and  particle tracking of DIC images was used to assess surface fluctuations and adhesion. Cholesterol depletion, which disrupts membrane rafts, reduced adhesion time, suggesting a role of the membrane in adhesion.  Additionally, an increase in effective diffusion of functionalized beads upon early contact points to the importance of membrane fluctuations in adhesion.  Together, these findings provide us with insight to a new mechanosensor, the membrane raft, as well as a more holistic understanding of adhesion that involves adhesion proteins, their dynamics, and the role of the plasma membrane in their transport and accessibility.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1361], "author_name_tesi": "Fuentes, Daniela E.", "last_name_ssi": "Fuentes", "middle_name_ssi": "E.", "first_name_ssi": "Daniela", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter J Butler", "William O Hancock", "Siyang Zheng", "Sulin Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter J Butler, Dissertation Advisor", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Siyang Zheng, Committee Member", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mechanotransduction", "endothelial cell", "focal adhesion", "membrane raft", "adhesion"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Exploring Pre-service teachers' historical thinking through the Cooperative Biography: A Design-based Research Study", "id": "14545", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7211", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Through Design-Based Research (Cobb, et al., 2003), this study explores the intended outcomes and processes of the Cooperative Biography project.  This research provides an iterative analysis (Cobb, et al., 2003) of how pre-service teachers experienced history while engaged in a Cooperative Biography, in a teacher-education setting.  This includes analysis of observations, interviews, and survey data to offer deductive and inductive themes present in the learning ecology (Biesta & Burboles, 2003).  Exploring and analyzing key concepts related to historical thinking, the study offers a re-conceptualization of the project goals and contributes to the fields of Social Studies, history education, and elementary teacher education, by offering examples of how participants used artifacts and sources to interpret and re-tell history. \n\tThe study addresses pre-service teachers\u2019 epistemic beliefs about history, which can be seen as a major force driving the ways they plan to teach history in the future (Evans, 1994; Jaeger & Davis, 1996).  Research on teaching and learning history has pointed to teachers\u2019 historical understanding, historical consciousness and knowledge as the basis for the development of historical thinking among their students (Jaeger & Davis, 1998).  Research on learning history has been reported over the past few decades, particularly, historical understanding and historical consciousness have been examined through several studies (Downey & Levstik, 1991; Armento, 1991; Carretero & Voss, 1997).  However, much less research exists that posits the relationship between epistemic stance and historical thinking at the level of the individual as this study does.  Research in historiography, historical understanding, and consciousness has opened the door to conduct epistemological investigations that seek to unfold the relationship between individual beliefs and epistemic stances.  The current study will offer insights into pre-service teachers\u2019 beliefs about history, and will paint a picture of participants\u2019 experiences within the Cooperative Biography.  \nThe study will begin to fill a void in the literature surrounding the multiplicity of epistemological beliefs that form the basis of pre-service teachers\u2019 beliefs about history.  Whereas, Evans (1989) painted pictures of teacher typologies, a move to understand the intersections of various typologies, where one begins to meet the next, or where, when, and why one triumphs over another, may mark a move toward further understanding the complexity of pre-service teachers\u2019 beliefs about history.  Employing current theoretical frames, such as Design-Based Research (DBR), in the process of investigating pre-service teachers\u2019 historical thinking and beliefs about history will fill a gap in the literature that exists today.  Moreover, this study provides themes and representations\u2014explanations that go beyond \u2018fitting\u2019 a mold, making room for ways in which the data are anomalous, which may move the field towards a more nuanced understanding of the ways pre-service teachers\u2019 think historically. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7201], "author_name_tesi": "Fuentes, David Andres", "last_name_ssi": "Fuentes", "middle_name_ssi": "Andres", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephanie Cayot Serriere", "Stephanie Cayot Serriere", "Scott Alan Metzger", "Patrick Willard Shannon", "Esther Susana Prins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephanie Cayot Serriere, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephanie Cayot Serriere, Committee Chair", "Scott Alan Metzger, Committee Member", "Patrick Willard Shannon, Committee Member", "Esther Susana Prins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Historical thinking", "Historical understanding", "pre-service teachers' perceptions of history", "design-based research", "history education"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FUNCTIONS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS SH AND P PROTEINS\n", "id": "11130", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5681", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of pediatric hospitalizations due to lower respiratory tract infections. Immunocompromised and elderly patients can also develop severe respiratory illness.  Immunoprophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies against the RSV fusion protein is the only currently available treatment option.  Although research is ongoing to develop a safe and effective vaccine against RSV, no vaccine is available yet.  Understanding the way RSV uses the cell for survival and proliferation is an important step towards finding effective infection prevention methods.  \n\nSome members of the Paramyxoviridae family, which includes RSV, encode for a small hydrophobic (SH) protein of unknown function.  Previous studies by our lab show that the SH protein of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) inhibits apoptosis through the TNF-alpha pathway.  The mumps virus SH protein was found to be a functional counterpart of the PIV5 SH despite the lack of sequence homology between these proteins.  To understand the function of the RSV SH protein, a recombinant PIV5 containing the RSV SH protein in place of the PIV5 SH protein (PIV5&#8710;SH - RSV SH) was generated.  Analysis showed that the RSV SH could functionally replace the PIV5 SH protein since infection of cells with this virus did not induce apoptosis.  Expression of the RSV SH protein in the absence of all other viral proteins was sufficient to inhibit the TNF-alpha pathway that leads to NF-kB activation.  An RSV&#8710;SH mutant was generated in a different approach at understanding the role RSV SH protein during infection.  The RSV&#8710;SH virus induced apoptosis in A549 cells, a human lung epithelial cell line.  Interestingly the levels of TNF-alpha in the media of RSV&#8710;SH infected A549 cells were not sufficient to induce apoptosis in this cell line, suggesting that the RSV SH has a different mechanism of inhibiting apoptosis in A549 cells.\n\nThe RSV SH is an accessory protein involved in RSV pathogenesis but not necessary for virus growth.  In contrast, the RSV phosphoprotein (P) is necessary for viral RNA synthesis and a P deletion mutant is not viable.  The P protein is an integral part of the polymerase complex involved in transcription and replication and it is the major phosphorylated species of the virus.  The role of P protein phosphorylation for the proteins function is not completely understood.  Recent studies in our lab suggest that the cellular kinase Akt is important for the RNA synthesis of non-segmented negative-sense RNA viruses.  To study the role of Akt in RSV RNA synthesis, Akt activity was inhibited with small molecule inhibitors, siRNA and dominant negative constructs.   Inhibition of Akt reduced RSV RNA synthesis, protein production and RSV titers.  In addition, a small molecule inhibitor of Akt activation also reduced P protein phosphorylation, suggesting that P is a target of Akt.  Only one serine was identified as the Akt phosphorylation site in vitro.   Mutation of that serine to an alanine significantly reduced P protein phosphorylation by Akt in an in vitro kinase assay.  These results suggest that Akt inhibitors could be developed for RSV theurapeutics.  Identification of the site of Akt phosphorylation in P during RSV infection could lead to a new strategy in the development of an RSV vaccine.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5677], "author_name_tesi": "Fuentes, Sandra M", "last_name_ssi": "Fuentes", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Sandra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pathobiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Biao He", "Biao He", "Anthony Paul Schmitt", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Michael N Teng", "Avery August"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Biao He, Dissertation Advisor", "Biao He, Committee Chair", "Anthony Paul Schmitt, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Michael N Teng, Committee Member", "Avery August, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["apoptosis", "small hydrophobic protein", "RSV", "AKT", "P protein phosphorylation"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Ph.D. in Health Policy and Administration", "id": "13200vaf5057", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13200", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-08-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation encompasses three studies.

These advances stress the need for a conception of environmental justice that incorporates not just maldistribution, but lack of recognition of affected parties as possessing equal human rights, and consequent lack of access to environmental decision-making.

With the FORC distribution, the dielectric properties were calculated using Preisach model.\nThe FORC distribution of PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 thin films was characterized as a function of film thickness. It was found that the thickness dependence of the small field dielectric constant is due primarily to differences in the domain wall contributions to the properties. The irreversible FORC distribution decreased and the switching fields increased as the thickness decreased. Prediction of the polarization-electric field curves and the ac field dependence of the dielectric constant were found to give a good fit to the experimental results.  Some discrepancies remain in the high field dielectric constant, probably caused by its definition. \nThe dielectric nonlinearity of BaTiO3 ceramics with grain sizes from 1.2 to 76 \u00b5m was investigated.  Defect dipoles in samples with large grains led to pinching of minor polarization \u2013 electric field loops as well as a threshold field in the ac field dependence of the dielectric constant and loss. For samples with small grains, a sublinear ac field dependence was observed. The irreversible FORC distributions characterizing the responses showed two strong and narrow peaks for large-grained samples and a weak, broad peak centered near the origin for samples with small grains. As the grain size decreased, the reversible FORC distribution at zero-bias field increased. No grain size dependence of the reversible FORC distributions was observed at high dc electric fields. These results indicate that the grain size dependence of the small field dielectric constant is attributable to a domain wall contribution and long-range domain wall motion suppressed while short-range domain wall motion enhanced as the grain size decreased.\nThe effect of the oxygen vacancies on the dielectric nonlinearity of formulated and undoped BaTiO3 ceramics was investigated by changing oxygen partial pressure during firing. For the formulated ceramics, the dielectric constant of both oxygen and air fired samples increased almost linearly with the amplitude of the ac driving field. Formulated BaTiO3 samples sintered in a reducing atmosphere produced a sub-linear increase in the permittivity with the ac field amplitude. For undoped BaTiO3 ceramics, the dielectric constant increased sub-linearly over a wide range of oxygen partial pressures during firing. It is proposed for the formulated ceramics that the dopant \u2013 oxygen vacancy defect dipoles in the shell region accounted for the curvature in the field dependence of the permittivity.  These defects appear to add a concentration of weak pinning centers to the potential energy profile through which domain walls move.\nFORC distributions as well as the ac field dependence of the dielectric constant were investigated for model BaTiO3 \u2013 based multilayer ceramic capacitors with dielectric layer thicknesses from 2.2 \u00b5m to 8.6 \u00b5m and those in which the grain size of the dielectrics varied from 0.28 \u00b5m to 0.39 \u00b5m while the layer thickness was held constant.  In both cases, core-shell microstructures were observed.  It was found that as the dielectric thickness decreased, the small and high electric field dielectric constants decreased, as did the peaks near the origin in the irreversible and reversible parts of the FORC distribution. The reversible FORC distributions of all the parts did not converge at high bias. These results indicate that the thickness dependence is attributable to a low dielectric constant interfacial layer and/or Schottky depletion layer at dielectric \u2013 electrode interfaces. \nIt was also found that the high field dielectric constant, the peak in the irreversible FORC distribution at the origin, and the reversible FORC distribution at zero bias decreased as grain size decreased, as was observed for the undoped ceramics. The reversible FORC distribution of all the parts converged at high biases, indicating the grain size dependence was influenced by domain wall contributions. Dielectric contributions from the core and shell were estimated based on the temperature dependence of the permittivity.  Not unexpectedly, the relative response of the core decreased while that of the shell increased as the grain size decreased.  A Preisach model using the measured FORC distribution gave a good fit to the experimental polarization-electric field loops as a function of grain size and dielectric layer thickness.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2464], "author_name_tesi": "Fujii, Ichiro ", "last_name_ssi": "Fujii", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ichiro", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Clive A Randall", "Wenwu Cao", "Leslie Eric Cross"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Wenwu Cao, Committee Member", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ferroelectrics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Story-Based Pedagogical Agents: A Scaffolding Design Approach for the Process of Historical Inquiry in a Web-Based Self-Learning Environment\n", "id": "10585", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6286", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-03-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this research was to design and evaluate a web-based self-learning environment for historical inquiry embedded with different types of instructional support featuring story-based pedagogical agents. This research focused on designing a learning environment by integrating story-based instruction and pedagogical agents as a means to deliver the problem context and learning tasks as well as to embed instructional support in an engaging way. Versions of the lesson modules were designed and tested iteratively to determine the impact of pedagogical agents on learners' performances and perceptions regarding the inquiry learning activity. \nA design research approach applying a mixed study of quantitative and qualitative research methods was taken. Quantitative and qualitative data in terms of student performances and perceptions of the learning activity were collected through the four rounds of experiments. A multiple-choice comprehension test and essay writing test were assigned to detect different levels of learning performance, and learners\u2019 perceptions were collected through a self-report questionnaire.\nThe initial study indicated that the story elements and mediation of the pedagogical agent did not have an impact on learning performance, although they succeeded in gaining the interest and enjoyment of learners. The instructional supports were modified to enhance learning performance by providing examples, domain heuristics, and practice opportunities through the interactions with the mentor and peer learner agents. \nAs a result, while the impact on student enjoyment, interest, and attention held steady, significantly more students delivered situational arguments using multiple perspectives than did those in the control condition. It was also found in the following study that more difficult exercises lacking adequate instructional support may hinder learning performance. \nA notable finding of this research was that the use of story-based pedagogical agents impacted students\u2019 ways of interpreting historical sources and making arguments, which was observed in the essay writing task. As previous studies on pedagogical agents have not performed this type of measurement, this study contributed a novel finding. The result also suggested that the story elements have to be incorporated with necessary instructional design considerations in order to foster learning performance while sustaining student interest in the learning activity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6286], "author_name_tesi": "Fujimoto, Toru ", "last_name_ssi": "Fujimoto", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Toru", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Brian K Smith", "Dr Brian K Smith", "Priya Sharma", "Dr Susan Land", "Gregory James Smits"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Brian K Smith, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Brian K Smith, Committee Chair", "Priya Sharma, Committee Chair", "Dr Susan Land, Committee Member", "Gregory James Smits, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["story-based instruction", "inquiry learning", "history education", "pedagogical agent"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Theoretical Investigations of Partnership Turnover and of Money", "id": "13702hzf110", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13702", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation consists of four chapters. The first chapter examines the turnover of multiperiod partnerships. The turnover of multiperiod partnerships such as marriages, labor contracts, and joint ventures varies over time and across countries. A model is set out in which these different observations arise as multiple equilibria. In a random pairwise matching model, players are heterogeneous in time preference and each pair plays a prisoners' dilemma game with random payoffs from mutual cooperation. Two steady states are constructed: in one, non-myopic players cooperate even when a match has low payoffs from mutual cooperation; in the other, they cooperate only when a match has high payoffs from it. Transition dynamics across the two steady states are studied. For a numerical example, it is shown that a transition in either direction is an equilibrium.\n\nThe last three chapters are contributions to monetary economics. In the second chapter, written jointly with Yu Awaya, a counter-example to the notion that money is memory is provided---one that relies on incomplete information. For it, there exists an implementable allocation with money which is not implementable with memory. The result arises because money conveys only a limited amount of information about past actions which can be beneficial in settings with incomplete information.\n\nIn the third chapter, I examine a necessary condition for fiat money to be essential. Fiat money, an intrinsically useless object, is said to be essential if some good allocations are achieved with it but not without it. It is shown that imperfect monitoring is necessary for money to be essential in a large class of economic environments. This provides a guide for the construction of models in which monetary trade achieves good outcomes.\n\nIn the fourth chapter, written jointly with Yu Awaya, it is shown that a seemingly strong condition is not sufficient for money to be essential. Money is thought to be essential when it is difficult to monitor others' behavior. We provide a counterexample to the view. For it, it is shown that even if there is no monitoring, money is inessential---the first best allocation can be attained without money (or any other form of monitoring).", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13829], "author_name_tesi": "Fukai, Hiroki ", "last_name_ssi": "Fukai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Hiroki", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Neil Wallace", "Neil Wallace", "Russell Cooper", "Kalyan Chatterjee", "Anthony Kwasnica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Neil Wallace, Dissertation Advisor", "Neil Wallace, Committee Chair", "Russell Cooper, Committee Member", "Kalyan Chatterjee, Committee Member", "Anthony Kwasnica, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["partnership", "turnover", "money", "essentiality of money"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Use of Web-Based Tools in Musical Communities from Three Perspectives", "id": "14361lzf121", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14361", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of this multi-project research was to explore uses of web-based technologies in musical communities from three perspectives. I wanted to learn how those technologies impacted musical collaboration, tools for teaching, and communication between orchestra directors. The first study was an examination of how high school string players, from an existing chamber group, viewed online music collaboration. This case study revealed that these high school students preferred to utilize technologies with which they were familiar, in particular, Facebook and Spotify. The second study determined which mobile apps Pennsylvania music teachers used in their classrooms. The questionnaire returned results from 342 app users, and 392 app non-users. In addition to a robust list of apps being actively used by K-12 music teachers, I also gained an understanding of why more than half these teachers did not use apps in their classrooms. The third study investigated uses of the Youth Orchestra Directors Facebook page and explored user perceptions of the (researcher created) page. This case study revealed that there was great interest in this Facebook page, but the page needed more activity to be helpful for the population. In addition, I gathered personal and professional attributes (via questionnaire) from these group members to learn more about who made up the youth orchestra director community. These three exploratory studies helped me understand perceptions of technology in the orchestra community from students, teachers, and youth orchestra directors. These studies also helped me recognize how much work we, as music educators, need to do to understand the impact technology has on our classrooms, particularly as technology advances rapidly.

However, the methods traditionally used to perform this characterization in low-speed flows present significant difficulties when applied to supersonic and especially hypersonic wind tunnels. The design and theory of a focusing laser differential interferometer (FLDI) instrument, originally invented by Smeets at the Institut Saint-Louis in the 1970s and used recently by Parziale in the CalTech T5 shock tunnel, is presented. It is a relatively-simple, non-imaging common-path interferometer for measuring refractive signals from transition and turbulence, and it has a unique ability to look through facility windows, ignore sidewall boundary-layers and vibration, and concentrate only on the refractive signal near a pair of sharp beam foci in the core flow. The instrument\u2019s low cost and ease of implementation make it a promising alternative to traditional hot-wire anemometry and particle-based methods for turbulence characterization. Benchtop experiments using a turbulent supersonic air jet demonstrate its focusing ability, frequency response, unwanted signal rejection, and ease of use. The instrument is used to optically interrogate the flow in the Penn State University Supersonic Wind Tunnel and USAF AEDC Hypervelocity Tunnel 9 for measurement of the overall intensity and spectra of freestream disturbances. Precise characterization of the strength and spectral content of the disturbances provides insight into their nature and potential effect upon boundary layer transition.

Bayesian inversion of paleoclimatic and instrumental observations with an AIS model also samples some of this uncertainty. This thesis focuses on combining the intuition from expert assessments, observations, and an AIS model in order to quantify deep uncertainty.\n\nThe research presented in this thesis illustrates a framework for combining expert assessments with instrumental and paleoclimatic observations in a coupled probabilistic-Bayesian inversion with a simple AIS model. The research demonstrates that probabilistic inversion of an expert assessment can be used to inform the prior probability distributions of model parameters. Adding instrumental and paleoclimatic observations to an expert assessment in a coupled probabilistic-Bayesian inversion sharpens the posterior probability distributions of model parameters. The results show that the different interpretations of the expert assessment are consistent with the instrumental and paleoclimatic observations as well as the simple AIS model.

A variety of evolutionary forces, including selection, mutation, recombination and drift, shape the structure of this genetic variation and the resulting molecular pattern can be used to infer the evolutionary dynamics of natural populations. Questions regarding the origin and maintenance of genetic traits in natural populations have historically been a central focus to the field of evolutionary biology. Traditionally however, researchers have been limited by the amount, breadth and resolution of genetic data available to address theoretical models of how variation is expected to change over time. Recent advances in high throughput sequencing technologies yield a powerful method to inexpensively generate sequence data across entire genomes, yet at the resolution of individual nucleotides. Here, a high throughput sequencing approach is used to investigate genetic variation in the model organism Drosophila pseudoobscura and the non-model organism Apis mellifera. In this work, I find that stabilizing selection acts on synonymous codon usage and shapes the nucleotide composition of gens in D. pseudoobscura. Furthermore, I develop a series of publically available tools to perform tests of positive selection in A. mellifera and identify several genes with signatures of adaptive evolution. Additionally, I demonstrate chromosomal inversions in D. pseudoobscura are likely favored because of their indirect effect of suppressed recombination. Lastly, I suggest a novel role for segregation distortion in the process of speciation and find evidence for cross-species introgression enabled by an association with a selfish genetic element. Together, this work reveals the complex interaction of different evolutionary forces that influence the structure of genetic variation across genomes and populations.

Oxide nanoparticles are known to improve conductivity in solid polymer electrolytes; however, the mechanism\nis not well understood. We measure semi-crystalline and amorphous samples over a range of lithium and nanoparticle concentrations.\nUnfilled samples are prepared with ether oxygen to lithium ratios of 4:1, 8:1, 10:1, 14:1, 30:1 and 100:1, where 10:1 is the eutectic concentration. Filled samples are prepared with Al2O3 nanoparticle concentrations of 5, 10 and 25wt%, at LiClO4 concentrations of 8:1, 10:1 and 14:1.\n\nPrevious X-ray diffraction results show that three crystalline phases can form in this system depending on the LiClO4 concentration and temperature: (PEO)3:LiClO4, pure PEO and (PEO)6:LiClO4. We use small-angle neutron scattering [SANS] to determine that the (PEO)3:LiClO4 phase forms cylinders with radius 125Ang., and\nlength 700Ang.  We measure the amount and size of pure PEO lamellae by exploiting the neutron scattering contrast that arises because of\ncrystallization, and we learn that nanoparticles do not affect the extent or crystal structure of pure PEO. We also learn that crystalline (PEO)6:LiClO4 does not form immediately, but\nrequires several days if the sample is dry, or weeks if the sample is exposed to moisture.\n\nIt is generally accepted that ion mobility is maximized in amorphous polymer electrolytes, because polymer mobility (and therefore ion\nmobility) is faster in amorphous regions. However, conductivity through the (PEO)6:LiX crystal structure, where X is the anion,\nhas been reported to exceed that through the amorphous equivalent.  Improved conductivity is\nattributed to the formation of cylindrical PEO channels that direct ion transport. The channels are formed by two PEO chains wrapped around a column of lithium ions at an ether oxygen to lithium ratio of 6:1.  The channels are highly conductive at low PEO molecular weight where the SPE is a powder. When the molecular weight is\nincreased to create a flexible solid, the crystalline channels misalign and the conductivity plummets.  We measure structure and\nmobility in dry samples at high molecular weight where the (PEO)6:LiClO4 crystal phase has not formed; however, remnants of this structure are known to persist in the liquid phase.  In fact, our SANS results yield scattering consistent with concentration fluctuations that may represent the remnants of (PEO)6:LiClO4 in the liquid phase.\n\nWe use quasi-elastic neutron scattering [QENS] to learn more about the molecular-level mobility of the (PEO)6:LiClO4 remnants, and our data reveals two dynamic processes.  The first process at short times, is attributed to the segmental mobility of PEO, and the\nsecond process at longer times, is attributed to the restricted rotation of protons around the lithium ions. The type of motion and\nthe radius of rotation are consistent with the cylindrical remnants of (PEO)6:LiClO4.  By comparing structure, mobility and conductivity results on all the unfilled samples, we determine that a semi-crystalline sample (concentration of 14:1) has the highest\nconductivity at 50C, despite being less mobile, partially crystalline, and having less charge carriers than amorphous samples at the same temperature.  This result suggests a decoupling of ionic conductivity and polymer mobility.  It is possible that the pure crystalline PEO in the 14:1 sample stabilizes the conductive (PEO)6:LiClO4 remnants, allowing them to persist long enough for conduction to occur.\n\nWhen nanoparticles are added, the rotation of the\n(PEO)6:LiClO4 remnant becomes more restricted at an ether oxygen to lithium ratio of 8:1, suggesting a direct interaction\nbetween the ether oxygen atoms in (PEO)6:LiClO4 and acidic sites on the nanoparticle surface. The rotation is unaffected by nanoparticles at a concentration of 10:1, where crystalline nuclei of pure PEO and (PEO)6:LiClO4 are present at the eutectic temperature of 50C.  We suggest that pure PEO and (PEO)6:LiClO4 form alternating layers extending away from the nanoparticle surface - consistent with the structure expected at a eutectic.  This could provide a conductive pathway for lithium ions, accounting for the improved conductivity at this concentration. Above the eutectic temperature, the layers can fluctuate and rearrange easily, and are likely stabilized by the nanoparticle surface.  These results suggests a new mechanism for increased lithium-ion transport in nanoparticle-filled solid polymer electrolytes.\n\nWhen water is introduced to the electrolyte (30 - 50% relative humidity), the crystallization of (PEO)6:LiClO4 is delayed by an additional two weeks, and pure PEO does not crystallize. It is known that multiple water molecules bind to the lithium ions, and the delayed crystallization likely results from the formation of Li+/H2O complexes that hinder the chain folding required for crystallization.  An additional high-temperature melting feature also arises in the presence of water, and could possibly represent the formation of the lithium hydrate, LiClO4*3H2O.\n\nWater boosts the conductivity in both filled and unfilled samples. This is attributed to the fact that water increases the segmental motion of the polymer, and therefore the ion mobility.  When\nnanoparticles are added, the conductivity boost is unaffected at the 8:1 concentration, whereas nanoparticles decrease the conductivity boost at a concentration of 10:1.  While we do not know for certain, it is possible that the 8:1 sample undergoes phase-separation into regions rich and poor in Li+/H2O, with nanoparticles located\nin the Li+/H2O-poor regions.  Conduction will occur in the Li+/H2O-rich regions, meaning that nanoparticles will have no influence on the conductivity-boost with water.  In contrast, it is likely that the 10:1 sample will not phase separate, owing to that fact that it is at the eutectic concentration where the energies of all phases are equivalent. In this case, Li+/H2O will be dispersed throughout the sample, including those regions were nanoparticles are located. Thus, ion transport could be affected by\nthe fact that nanoparticles will absorb water at their surfaces, decreasing the conductivity-boost with increasing nanoparticle concentration.\n\nThe results of this study suggest that structure could play an important role for improving ionic conductivity in solid polymer electrolytes, despite the fact that ion transport through structure is often dismissed in favor of transport through purely amorphous\nregions. We suggest that nanoparticles improve conductivity by stabilizing and aligning the conductive (PEO)6:LiClO4 remnants. Understanding transport through the (PEO)6:LiX\nstructure is important for designing a solid polymer electrolyte with adequate conductivity to operate a portable device at room\ntemperature.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5638], "author_name_tesi": "Fullerton Shirey, Susan Karen", "last_name_ssi": "Fullerton Shirey", "middle_name_ssi": "Karen", "first_name_ssi": "Susan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Janna Kay Maranas", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Ralph H Colby", "James Patrick Runt", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Janna Kay Maranas, Dissertation Advisor", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Chair", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dielectric spectroscopy", "nanocomposite", "QENS", "SANS", "neutron scattering", "Al2O3", "LiClO4", "battery", "conductivity", "nanoparticle", "polyethylene oxide", "nanoparticle aggregation", "concentration fluctuations"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Mapping Early Jewish Tradition:  The Case of MT and LXX Nehemiah 11-12\n\n", "id": "12545", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1517", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-08-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is an examination of the MT and LXX versions of Nehemiah 11-12.   Nehemiah 11-12 includes material that focuses on the people who settled in Jerusalem, a catalog of settlements around the region of Judah, and lists of temple personnel in Jerusalem.  These chapters in Nehemiah also contain a narrative of the dedication of the walls as well as a description of the people connected to the dedication ceremony in Jerusalem. Scholars have noted that the lists in Nehemiah 11-12 are particularly problematic when compared to other lists in Ezra and Nehemiah, such as Ezra 2//Nehemiah 7, and Nehemiah 3, since much of the material is unique to these two chapters.  Thus, several scholars have attempted to reconcile the textual discrepancies between Nehemiah 11-12 and other lists in Ezra and Nehemiah.  \nLittle is said, however, concerning the textual divergences that are present within Nehemiah 11-12. The material is preserved in the Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT) of Nehemiah and the Greek Septuagint (LXX) of 2 Esdras, of which the MT preserves the longer version. These textual divergences are significant since Nehemiah 11-12 contain names and positions of temple personnel, areas of settlement, and a narrative of the events surrounding the rededication of the walls, which are commonly used in modern scholarly discussions of Jerusalem during the Persian period.  In fact, any discussion of the cultic institutions in Jerusalem, during this important period in Judean history, must consider the lists in Nehemiah 11-12. \nIn this study, I examine the lists in MT and LXX Nehemiah 11-12 for the purpose of ascertaining the base lists, or what reflects the earliest traditions of these different types of lists and genealogies.  This investigation has two main components:  A detailed study of the texts and a detailed study of the archaeological sites. As a result of this analysis, I argue that the various lists within Nehemiah 11-12, as fully developed in the MT, reflect a Maccabean reality retrojected into Persian Period Judah. The LXX retains aspects of late-Persian and Hellenistic period lists since key genealogies continue for several generations.  But ultimately, the LXX preserves the earlier material.  This research is significant for any scholars studying lists in Ezra and Nehemiah.  It is also significant for any scholarly examination attempting to reconstruct the composition of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah.  \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1502], "author_name_tesi": "Fulton, Deirdre Noelle", "last_name_ssi": "Fulton", "middle_name_ssi": "Noelle", "first_name_ssi": "Deirdre", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Gary Knoppers", "Gerald Neil Knoppers", "Baruch Halpern", "Paul B Harvey", "Ann Eloise Killebrew", "Kenneth Gale Hirth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Gary Knoppers, Dissertation Advisor", "Gerald Neil Knoppers, Committee Chair", "Baruch Halpern, Committee Member", "Paul B Harvey, Committee Member", "Ann Eloise Killebrew, Committee Member", "Kenneth Gale Hirth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Early Judaism", "Textual Criticism", "Persian Period", "Hebrew Bible", "Hellenistic Period", "Jerusalem"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Interpreting Nitrogen Isotope Excursions in the Sedimentary Record\n", "id": "10683", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2855", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-09T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation presents an examination of the biological and chemical processes that determine the nitrogen stable-isotope compositions of organic matter (OM)-rich sediments.

Widespread anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and denitrification in anoxic waters near the chemocline (interfaces between oxygenated and anoxic waters) are expected to have led to fixed-N deficiencies that favor cyanobacterial N2 fixation.  Such conditions have also been identified in modern meromictic water bodies, most notably the Black Sea.  I present sedimentary scytonemin data from the Black Sea that indicate that cyanobacterial growth in the Holocene Black Sea was variable and responded to climate-induced changes in salinity stratification.  The sediment intervals with scytonemin also have low d15Ntot values, indicative of cyanobacteria using N2 as a substrate.  Green sulfur bacterial (GSB) pigments in Black Sea sediments correlate inversely with scytonemin, leading to a phytoplankton productivity model whereby strong density stratification inhibits mixing of high phosphate, low N:P waters to the sea surface.  This model may be applied to ancient marine settings, such as the Paleotethys Ocean during the Permian-Triassic oceanic anoxic event.\nFGL has a shallow (~20 m) chemocline that allows purple sulfur bacteria (PSB) to thrive.  This compares with a Black Sea chemocline at 80-100 m, which allows GSB growth but inhibits PSB.  A similar shallow chemocline may have been present in the Mesoproterozoic ocean, as PSB biomarkers have been identified in the ancient sediments.  Pigments from PSB and GSB are abundant in the chemocline and sediments of FGL.  Sedimentary intervals with high PSB pigment concentrations correlate with low bulk d15N and d13Corg values, supporting my assertion that an increased proportion of PSB biomass causes the low stable-isotope values.  Low water-column particulate d15N and d13C values at the chemocline support this model.  I also analyzed d13C and d15N values of specific pigments to examine responses of chemocline productivity to elevated mixolimnion productivity.  These data demonstrate that sedimentary PSB and GSB pigments were derived from the chemocline, and they provide a ~500-year record of d13CDIC surface-deep gradients and deep water ammonium d15N values. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2851], "author_name_tesi": "Fulton, James Mark", "last_name_ssi": "Fulton", "middle_name_ssi": "Mark", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Allan Arthur", "Michael Allan Arthur", "Katherine Haines Freeman", "Lee Kump", "John Michael Regan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Allan Arthur, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael Allan Arthur, Committee Chair", "Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Chair", "Lee Kump, Committee Member", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["purple sulfur bacteria", "cyanobacteria", "nitrogen cycle", "Black Sea", "Green Lake"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATIONS OF FLUID FLOW AND HEAT TRANSPORT RELATED TO THE STRENGTH OF THE SAN ANDREAS FAULT\n", "id": "8888", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4930", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-07-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The shear strength of faults is an important factor in earthquake hazard assessment, and in understanding the earthquake process and the forces that drive tectonic deformation.  However, on the basis of both geomechanical and thermal observations, many plate boundary faults, including the San Andreas Fault (SAF) in California, have been interpreted to slip at shear stresses considerably less than predicted by laboratory-derived friction laws and for hydrostatic fluid pressures.  An understanding of whether plate-boundary faults truly are \u201cweak\u201d and the potential causes for such weakness are thus key unknowns in the physics of faulting.   In the first section of this thesis, I evaluate whether thermal and hydrologic effects might disturb heat flow data which are used to interpret the strength of the SAF.  Using numerical models of coupled fluid flow and heat transport, and by comparing model results with observational constraints, I show that redistribution of heat by groundwater flow is an unlikely explanation for the lack of a near fault increase in heat flow that would be associated with frictional heat generation on a strong fault (i.e. one that supports large shear stresses).  I also show that the effects of topographic and subsurface refraction may account for previously unexplained spatial scatter in heat flow data around the fault, but even with these effects the data are most consistent with little or no frictional heat generation.  \nIn the second section of this thesis, I evaluate hypotheses invoking regional sources of fluid resulting from metamorphic dehydration reactions within the crust or upper mantle as mechanisms that generate large fluid overpressures within the fault zone required to explain the apparent weakness of the SAF.  I calculate reasonable fluid source terms for both crustal and mantle dehydration following the creation of the SAF.  I show that crustal dehydration sources are too small and short-lived to generate large overpressures, but it is plausible that a source of mantle-derived water contributes toward generating large overpressures.  The results also illustrate how different fault zone hydraulic architectures affect overpressure generation, and highlight the role of dipping country rock permeability anisotropy in fluid pressure localization. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4907], "author_name_tesi": "Fulton, Patrick Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Fulton", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Patrick", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Demian Saffer", "Chris J Marone", "Kamini Singha", "Derek Elsworth", "Barbara A Bekins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Demian Saffer, Committee Chair", "Chris J Marone, Committee Member", "Kamini Singha, Committee Member", "Derek Elsworth, Committee Member", "Barbara A Bekins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["fault strength", "overpressure", "fluid pressure", "heat flow", "San Andreas Fault", "fluid flow", "heat trnasport"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "FROM FOUNDERS TO FIRMS: AN EXAMINATION OF THE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF CEO SOCIAL CAPITAL\n", "id": "8293", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "771", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-03-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation provides a new theoretical framework introducing the concept of social capital transfer and explains how and when it occurs among individuals and organizations.

Many of the major novels in this period were considered by contemporary readers to be satires or at least to contain strong satiric elements, yet few scholars have attempted to explain how these novels use satire. Critics of individual novelists have, to varying degrees, treated their subjects as satirists\u2014Smollett is frequently read as a satirist, as is Peacock. But these studies often do not give a sense of the sheer variety and diversity of this period\u2019s novelistic satire. Though many works were thought to be satiric, they use satire in vastly different ways for various purposes. How much of a relationship exists between the satire of Smollett, Burney, and Bage, for instance? These novelists all write works containing satire, but they diverge in both tone and aim. In this study I want to provide a map of possibilities for narrative satire in this period, describing both the kinds of distinct satiric goals novelists pursue and the range of techniques they use to achieve them.\n\nBesides demonstrating variance in satiric aim and method, I also want to argue against the notion that satire and the novel are antithetical forms, and that novelistic satire declines after the mid-eighteenth century. Scholars of satire and the eighteenth-century novel have tended to argue that as the novel form grows in popularity, satire decays. The novel is often said to be incompatible with satire; critics have argued that novelists are too concerned with developing the realism of their plots and characters to make effective satiric attacks. The problem here is that these scholars have conceived of satire in narrow ways, not taking into account the breadth of satiric techniques novelists employ throughout this period. Just because few novelists in the late eighteenth century attempt to write novels similar to Smollett\u2019s or Fielding\u2019s does not mean that novelistic satire declines.\n\nIn the first part of my study I discuss how satire has been conceived both by modern scholars and eighteenth-century readers, and I make the case that satire can have varying aims. I also develop a rhetorical approach to novelistic satire, focusing especially on how novelists attempt to control the judgments of their readers. In the four chapters of the second part, I focus on four major satiric aims: entertainment, instruction, pessimistic expression, and attack. As the examples in each chapter demonstrate, each of these satiric aims is a distinct enterprise.\n\nAs satire is so often a central element of the novels of the period, understanding the multifarious ways in which it operates is important for our interpretations of these works. Where my predecessors see satire as a very specific genre that declines as the novel grows in popularity, I see a vibrant mode that is incorporated into the novel for a wide array of purposes. My goal is to give my readers a sense of this diverse and exciting range.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11058], "author_name_tesi": "Fung, Julian ", "last_name_ssi": "Fung", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Julian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Hume", "John Thomas Harwood", "Nicholas A Joukovsky", "John Philip Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Hume, Dissertation Advisor", "John Thomas Harwood, Committee Member", "Nicholas A Joukovsky, Committee Member", "John Philip Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["satire", "novel", "james hogg", "richard graves"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "genome and transcriptome architecture shaped by short tandem repeats: comparison of RNA-DNA differences, \nreverse transcription errors, and sequencing errors in short tandem repeats", "id": "28825", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11888", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-09-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) of 1\u20136 bp DNA motifs are prevalent in genomes and have several interesting properties, including high mutation rates and a tendency to form secondary non-B DNA structures. Due to the high variability of these repeats, STRs have been commonly used as markers in population genetics and forensic science. Several STR loci have medical implications, especially long tri-nucleotide STRs. To date, more then 40 neurological disorders have been reported to involve repeat expansions/contractions of STRs.\nMy dissertation focuses on the following three questions pertaining to the role of STRs in genome and transcriptome instability: 1) What is the contribution of STRs to genome instability, when other genomic features are also considered? 2) How to distinguish genetic variation of STRs from sequencing and bioinformatics errors, and 3) What are the relative levels of RNA\u2014 DNA differences and transcription errors at STRs, and how to distinguish biological transcription variation from technical errors? To address these questions, I separated the thesis into three phases.\nFirst, I identified the genomic features that contribute to chromosome fragility and analyzed the relative contribution of STRs in the presence of other genomic features. I chose the aphidicolin-induced Common Fragile Sites (aCFSs), which is the largest class of human chromosome fragile sites available for performing such an analysis. aCFSs tend to locate in R- bands far from centromeres. They also have low CpG islands density but high DNA flexibility, high content of mononucleotide STRs, and high content of Alu repeats. Also, the fragility level of aCFSs increases with the density of evolutionary conserved breakpoints.\nSecond, to profile STR length from Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data , I developed the STR-FM pipeline (Short Tandem Repeat profiling using Flank-based Mapping approach) and used our pipeline to estimate sequencing errors of Illumina data from standard and PCR-free library preparation protocols. I found that the STR sequencing errors increase exponentially with STR length and the number of repeats. STR sequencing errors have strong contraction bias. I build the genotyping model that takes into account sequencing errors. My genotyping model has high prediction accuracy in both diploid and genetically heterogeneous samples. I also used STR-FM and the genotyping model to estimate de novo germ-line mutation rates from a three-generation trio. In contrast to NGS sequencing errors, the germ-line mutations have similar levels of STR expansion and contraction.\nThird, I estimated the RNA-DNA Difference (RDD) rates and Reverse Transcription (RT) error rates using two different approaches. Initially, I created a Maximum Likelihood Model to calculate the most likely RDD and RT error rates and their directions using replicated cDNA sequencing data. The RT error rates are approximately one order of magnitude higher than RDD rates. Next, we verified our RDD and RT errors estimation using barcoded RNA sequencing data, which is the current standard gold to detect RDDs and RT errors. The estimated RT rates from both approaches are comparable and they both suggest that RT errors have expansion bias, which is the opposite of the STR sequencing errors (they have contraction bias). In addition, I proposed the RNA inferring model to estimate the most likely RNA length profile after correcting for sequencing errors and RT errors.\nThis dissertation builds a platform that allows us to explore biology of STRs from NGS data. Besides, it illuminates the impact of STRs on genome and transcriptome stabilities.

Tottering mice display stress-induced attacks of a movement disorder due to a P/Q-type calcium channel mutation and cerebellar L-type calcium channel upregulation.L-type calcium channels were assessed in studies of calcium uptake, radioligand binding and in situ hybridization in tottering mice. These studies confirmed the increase in tottering cerebellar L-type calcium channels.  Mutant mice also exhibited unique responses to repeated exposure to an L-type calcium channel antagonist (nimodipine) and agonist (BAY K8644).  These studies provide further evidence of L-type calcium channel misregulation in the tottering mouse cerebellum.\n\tIn developing tottering mice, restraint stress did not produce motor attacks until twenty-two days of age; attack frequencies at p22 were similar to adults.  A second phenotype, aberrant cerebellar tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA expression, was not detected until after the onset of stress-induced motor attacks. These studies more precisely define the temporal relationship between these phenotypes, suggesting that aberrant calcium-responsive gene expression is a consequence of the intense cerebellar activation associated with motor attacks. \n\tIn adult tottering mice, attacks were reliably precipitated by stressful environmental disturbances, caffeine and alcohol administration; these agents are widely known triggers in human episodic disorders. Thus, tottering mice provide an excellent model to study common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying trigger phenomena in ion channelopathies. As activation of hormonal systems is a common feature of tottering mouse triggers, the influence of stress hormones on tottering mouse attacks was assessed. Glucocorticoids were neither necessary nor sufficient for the expression of this behavior; pharmacological blockade of the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type 1 (CRF-1) did not prevent stress-induced motor attacks. Potential therapeutics including ethosuximide, phenytoin and carbamazepine failed to prevent motor attacks. However, L-type calcium channel antagonist nimodipine prevented caffeine- and alcohol-induced attacks, and the glutamatergic antagonist MK-801 was effective in preventing attacks induced by restraint stress. The results of these studies suggest that abnormal ionic signaling triggered through calcium-dependent mechanisms in cerebellar networks produces periods of hyperexcitability in the tottering mouse brain. The unique neurocircuitry of the cerebellum may amplify these abnormal signals once they are produced. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [665], "author_name_tesi": "Fureman, Brandy Ellen", "last_name_ssi": "Fureman", "middle_name_ssi": "Ellen", "first_name_ssi": "Brandy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ellen J Hess", "Theresa L Wood", "Robert G Levenson", "Robert J Milner", "Melvin Lee Billingsley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ellen J Hess, Committee Chair", "Theresa L Wood, Committee Member", "Robert G Levenson, Committee Member", "Robert J Milner, Committee Chair", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["mutant mouse", "tyrosine hydroxylase", "nimodipine", "dyskinesia", "trigger", "voltage-dependent calcium channel", "development", "BAY K8644", "animal model", "behavior", "paroxysmal", "movement disorder"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Capturing Complexities: A Sequence Analysis to Investigate Patterns of Family Planning for Young Couples in Malawi", "id": "23410", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10105", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Decisions surrounding family planning are complex, influenced by social and relational contexts and life course events.

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in particular, is experiencing enormous growth in access to and use of technology, although it is well documented that the region lags behind the rest of the world in mobile phone ownership and Internet use. Within SSA nations, the relationship between social ties, socioeconomic status, and the ownership and use of mobile phones lacks attention. In this dissertation, I investigate the digital divide in Malawi, a country in Southeastern Africa. I focus on mobile phones, given that mobile phones in Malawi are more common than other information and communication technologies and are the primary way people access the Internet. In the first paper, I leverage data from the CELL Project to look at the way tech inequality unfolds in women\u2019s day-to-day life through social interactions. I draw on longitudinal data from the Tsogolo la Thanzi project in the second paper and I model the mobile phone ownership and use as a hierarchy. I assess a woman\u2019s position in the hierarchy over time and the patterns of movement or stability she experiences. In the third paper, I leverage a follow-up dataset to assess the structure of the mobile phone hierarchy four years later and examine the relationship between network externality and mobile phone ownership and use. I find that (a) women who own mobile phones tend to have more dispersed interaction networks; (b) at the beginning stages of diffusion, women in Malawi experience stable non-use and unstable ownership and device sharing; (c) at later stages of diffusion, device sharing emerges as a way that women gain access to mobile phones and individuals with higher network externality are more likely to own or borrow a phone than to not use one; and (d) the experience of the digital divide is categorically different at different levels of the mobile phone hierarchy. My findings unearth shifting levels of technology access and the social and economic factors that predict them. Mobile phones are a powerful tool that connect individuals to people and ideas. Differentials in access and use of mobile phones not only stratify regions, nations, and communities, but also at the individual-level, the nature and level of mobile phone ownership and use is tied to one\u2019s social context and social ties.

The use of technological applications for teaching pragmatics is on the rise (Taguchi & Sykes, 2013), in part because those applications are well-suited to the types of awareness-raising tasks that support Schmidt's (1993; 2001) noticing hypothesis. However, the potential for technology in the instruction of routine formulas has yet to be examined. Furthermore, there has thus far been no research on the intersection of pragmatics and technology in the instruction of Russian. Russian pedagogical materials rarely present routine formulas, which communicate pragmatic meaning in social interaction, in a thorough manner. This dissertation reports on the impact of an awareness-raising, corpus-referred instructional website on L2 Russian learners' acquisition of nine routine formulas, selected with reference to analyses of corpus data and popular textbooks of Russian. Intermediate and advanced L1 English learners of Russian were assigned to either an experimental (n = 18) or control (n = 16) group. An oral proficiency assessment and background questionnaire were used to collect information on participants. Pre-/post-/delayed post-tests assessed knowledge and aural recognition of the targeted routine formulas. Experimental group participants completed online instructional modules that provided information on the form, function, and typical contexts of these formulas, along with authentic examples of usage (Russian National Corpus excerpts and film clips) and opportunities for practice. Data on the experimental group participants' experience with the routine formulas and reactions to the instructional website were collected via an online feedback form and retrospective interviews. Results indicate that the intervention had a durable effect on learners' knowledge of the targeted routine formulas. However, aural comprehension was not affected.

Although small-town Main Streets are a part of the larger urban system, they have often been neglected in academic scholarship on urban places. This dissertation utilizes several commonplace data sources for Main Street businesses to reveal and analyze connectivity patterns for several small-town communities in upstate New York from the 1880s through the first decade of the twentieth century. Rather than regarding small-town communities as merely being \u2018linked\u2019 in one direction as part of a metropolitan hinterland, evidence illustrates that each of these places also had their own webs of connectivities with many regional and distant places. These webs of connectivity helped shape the networks of commerce and sociability that often define small-town America. Hotel registers, store invoice records, local newspaper columns outlining travel into and out of local communities, and invoice data each offer very detailed individual-centered information that have remarkable spatial and temporal attributes. In addition to these place-based sources route books for traveling salesmen, circuses, and other entertainment troupes also reveal how places are connected through circuits of exchange at all levels of the urban system.

The first essay considers an order promising problem in the presence of pseudo order information in an Available-to-Promise (ATP) production-inventory system. We develop a Markov framework that captures lumpiness, non-stationarity and volatility, three key characteristics of pseudo order information. We characterize the structure of the optimal order acceptance policy for both capacity and inventory constrained cases by a sequence of thresholds. Our characterization has the features of a  simple policy form and computational efficiency. We also characterize the effects of lead time and demand variability on the system performance and the policy parameters. We numerically compare the performance of three commonly used policies with that of the optimal policy. Our results show that ignoring pseudo order information and resource rationing can severely jeopardize the performance and profitability of the system. In the second essay, we study a joint dual sourcing/promotion problem with information updates in an inventory system where two suppliers have different lead times, purchase costs and capacity. We formulate a two stage stochastic programming with the first stage dealing with capacity reservation and the second stage dealing with sourcing and promotion decisions via a Markov Decision Process. We numerically characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We find that information updates, if appropriately utilized, can  strengthen the effectiveness of other management levers, and improve the profitability of the system. In particular, information updates can reduce system inventory and promotion frequency, two major sources for emph{bull-whip} effect. Our results show that promoting optimally (based on both supply and demand information) can significantly outperform the strategies in which promotion is determined exogenously. Our study also highlights the importance of coordination between marketing and operations functions. In the third essay, we investigate a class of inventory control problem with retail pre-packs. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy for both single stock keeping unit (SKU) case and multiple SKU case. For single SKU case, the optimal policy is of a \"band\" form. We characterize the distribution of the steady state for the uniform demand case. We numerically investigate the impact of demand variability and demand correlation. Finally, we identify the situations under which simplified policies severely deteriorate system profitability by comparing their performances with that of the optimal policy.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3830], "author_name_tesi": "GAO, LONG ", "last_name_ssi": "GAO", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "LONG", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan H Xu", "Douglas J Thomas", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin", "Tao Yao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan H Xu, Committee Chair", "Douglas J Thomas, Committee Chair", "Dennis Kon Jin Lin, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["INVENTORY", "INFORMATION UPDATES", "ATP", "MDP"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "OPTIMIZING YIELD DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT PLANNING\n", "id": "7558", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2395", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-01-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Forest yield estimates are an essential component of linear programming forest planning models since the volume of the forest and the classification of analysis areas or land base are usually derived using this type of data. Forest yield is normally acquired by a forest inventory or using growth and yield models that predict future yields. Since forest inventories and growth and yield models are often subject to multiple errors, when this information is used as input in the planning models the assumption of certainty for LP models is not accomplished. In this framework, a trade-off develops since underlying the acquisition of data is the belief that better data leads to better decisions and at the same time obtaining better data costs money. In regard to yield data from forest inventories and growth and yield models, and their utilization for forest planning, some research questions arise concerning the relationships between the yield information and the decisions that are adopted using uncertain yield data. \n\nThis work uses a harvest scheduling linear programming model to calculate optimal inventory and growth and yield modeling efforts. The harvest scheduling model maximizes the net present value of harvest plus the value of the forest remaining after the planning horizon. Special formulations of the harvest scheduling models are built (True or Augmented Real Model) using several formulations of other harvest scheduling models (Perturbed Models, where sub-samples of inventory plots and experimental plots were used to build a yield table and an age-site class distribution of forest areas), and a reference formulation (Real Model, where all of the available inventory and experimental plots information is used to build the yield table and the age-site distribution). This Augmented Real Models were used to calculate the value of the Loss variable that is considered to be a measure of monetary losses as a result of the use of imperfect yield information in prescribing optimal harvest policies. Loss was used to estimate the trade-offs between making better decisions \u2013 i.e., harvest policies \u2013 when better information is available and the cost of obtaining better information. The value of Loss and the costs of acquiring the yield data were used to fit and empirical relationship between the amount of information (number of inventory and experimental plots, and size of the inventory plot) used in the harvest scheduling models and the total costs, i.e., Cost+Loss, in order to derive optimal inventory sampling sizes, optimal inventory plot size and the optimal number of experimental plots. An example was developed with radiata pine information in southern Chile. \n\nResults from the minimization of the Cost-plus-Loss functions indicate that when the expected monetary losses are considered, sampling sizes for the inventory are much larger than the current practices in Chile and the number of experimental plots is much smaller than the current system used in the example although the growth models were simpler than the current models used for radiata pine management in chile. The results were inconclusive in regard to the size of the inventory plot. \nThe Cost-plus-Loss approach indicate that the number of inventory and experimental plots used for harvest planning purposes should be increased until the marginal value of the information provided by these plots equals the marginal cost of collecting the data. This is an alternative approach to the current statistics-oriented criteria for inventory planning.  The analysis of the Loss function indicates that inventory information is more important for harvest scheduling purposes, than experimental plots information.\n\nFinally, the potential distribution and value of the objective function of the harvest scheduling model is dependent on the yield information used to develop the yield table and the distribution of forest area in age-site classes. The results indicate that there are statistical significant differences on the mean value between different sampling sizes for the inventory and for the experimental plots.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2379], "author_name_tesi": "GILABERT, HORACIO ", "last_name_ssi": "GILABERT", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "HORACIO", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Forest Resources", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marc Eric Mcdill", "Wayne Lawrence Myers", "Michael Gregory Jacobson", "Terry Paul Harrison"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marc Eric Mcdill, Committee Chair", "Wayne Lawrence Myers, Committee Member", "Michael Gregory Jacobson, Committee Member", "Terry Paul Harrison, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["growth modeling", "linear programming", "inventory optimization", "forest management", "decisions-information relationships"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Phase-field Modeling of Flexoelectric Effect in Perovskite Ferroelectrics", "id": "23321", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10615", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-09-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ferroelectrics are multifunctional materials that have many applications in devices such as actuators, sensors, memory storage, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and others. The multifunctionality derives from the couplings among internal order parameters, such as ferroelectric polarization and spontaneous strain, and external thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, stress, and electric field. Although the thermodynamics of such couplings has been well established, the coupling among order parameters and their gradients is much less well-understood. The main goal of the dissertation is to fundamentally understand the role of flexoelectric effect, the coupling between polarization and the gradient of strain, in the ferroelectricity of a crystal, e.g., domain structures, polarization distributions across domain walls, and domain switching.  \nThere are sufficient experimental evidences showing that the flexoelectric effect, which is small and generally ignored in macroscopic systems, may become significant or even dominant in nanostructures, particularly in ferroelectric materials which exhibit strong dielectric properties. However, there are few well-developed theories, especially mesoscale models, available to explain or to further predict the flexoelectric effect-induced phenomenon in ferroelectrics. In this dissertation, a phase-field model of ferroelectric domains incorporating flexoelectric contribution is developed. The flexoelectric effect in ferroelectric single crystals is investigated using the developed model. \nThe present phase-field model of ferroelectric domain structures and switching is extended to include the flexoelectric effect by adding the flexoelectric coupling terms to the total free energy. The semi-implicit Fourier-spectral method is modified to solve the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation with anisotropic gradient energy coefficients. Then by calculating the domain wall profiles of BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 and comparing with other numerical solutions, this model is validated.\nIn order to incorporate the interactions of different soft modes or order parameters, many new terms, including biquadratic coupling, trilinear coupling and flexoelectric coupling, are introduced to the classic Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire (LGD) theory of ferroelectrics. However, it is still unclear how each of these terms modifies the domain wall structures and its thermodynamic stabilities. As a matter of fact, it is also uncertain whether the continuum LGD theory can be used to study domain walls, which may be as thin as one unit cell. From phase-field simulations, it was found that polar domain walls of incipient ferroelectric CaTiO3 are likely to be induced by flexoelectric coupling. The polarization component parallel to the twin walls shows an even distribution; while the polarization normal to the walls has an odd distribution. The peak value of the induced polarization is on the magnitude of 1 \u03bcC/cm2. The simulation results of domain wall structures agree very well with existing experimental observations and other computational predictions. Thus, the developed phase-field model, which is based on LGD theory, can be used to study the nano scale domain structures at least qualitatively. \nThe pure ferroelectric (180\u00b0) domain walls of tetragonal ferroelectrics have long been believed to be Ising type and charge neutral. However, recent theoretical studies show that the wall exhibits additional Bloch-like or N\u00e9el-like features. Using the phase-field simulations, it is demonstrated that the wall has Ising-Bloch-N\u00e9el characters. The new features are strongly anisotropic and are entirely due to the flexoelectric effect. From thermodynamic analysis, it is shown that the polarization at the domain wall is determined by the competition between the flexoelectric field and the depolarization field. The flexoelectric effect-induced polarization shows an odd distribution at the domain walls with the peak values on the magnitude of 0.1 \u03bcC/cm2. \nFlexoelectricity can be regarded as a mechanical analogue to the electric field, which can modify the free energy profile of a ferroelectric material asymmetrically. Therefore, the flexoelectric effect can be used to switch ferroelectric domains if large enough. By approximating its geometry as a spherical indenter, an AFM tip is shown to induce a strong flexoelectric effect to an ultrathin BaTiO3 film (~5 nm) under a 1000 nN load. The radius of contact area is 10 nm. The flexoelectric field is on the magnitude of 107 V/m, which is well above the coercive field and thus can induce 180-degree switching. The stresses under the AFM tip, on the magnitude of several GPa, are also larger than the coercive stresses which can induce nucleation of new domains. Due to the strong compressive biaxial strain exerted by SrTiO3 substrate, only flexoelectricity induced (180-dgree) domain remains after unloading. This process which can induce 180-dgree switching, is more similar to electric field-induced switching rather than the conventional mechanical switching via piezoelectricity. From the simulations, it is also shown that this type of mechanical switching is only possible in nanoscale films with the upper bound for the film thickness on the order of ~25 nm. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10252], "author_name_tesi": "GU, YIJIA ", "last_name_ssi": "GU", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "YIJIA", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen", "Long Qing Chen", "Venkatraman Gopalan", "Clive A Randall", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry", "Qiang Du", "James Chen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Long Qing Chen, Dissertation Advisor", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Chair", "Venkatraman Gopalan, Committee Member", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Susan E Trolier Mckinstry, Committee Member", "Qiang Du, Committee Member", "James Chen, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Flexoelectric effect", "ferroelectrics", "phase-field method"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Behavioral Pattern Identification for Structural Health Monitoring in Complex Systems\n", "id": "7062", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6063", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Estimation of structural damage and quantification of structural integrity are critical for safe and reliable operation of human-engineered complex systems, such as electromechanical, thermofluid, and petrochemical systems. Damage due to fatigue crack is one of the most commonly encountered sources of structural degradation in mechanical systems. Early detection of fatigue damage is essential because the resulting structural degradation could potentially cause catastrophic failures, leading to loss of expensive equipment and human life. Therefore, for reliable operation and enhanced availability, it is necessary to develop capabilities for prognosis and estimation of impending failures, such as the onset of wide-spread fatigue crack damage in mechanical structures.\n\nThis dissertation presents information-based online sensing of fatigue damage using the analytical tools of symbolic time series analysis (STSA). Anomaly detection using STSA is a pattern recognition method that has been recently developed based upon a fixed-structure, fixed-order Markov chain. The analysis procedure\nis built upon the principles of Symbolic Dynamics,\nInformation Theory and Statistical Pattern\nRecognition. The dissertation demonstrates real-time fatigue damage monitoring based on time series data of ultrasonic signals. Statistical pattern changes are measured using STSA to monitor\nthe evolution of fatigue damage.\n\nReal-time anomaly detection is presented as a solution to the forward (analysis) problem and the inverse (synthesis) problem.\n\n1) the forward problem - The primary objective of the forward problem is identification of the statistical changes in the time series data of ultrasonic signals due to gradual evolution of fatigue damage. \n\n2) the inverse problem - The objective of the inverse problem is to infer the anomalies from the observed time series data in real time based on the statistical information generated during the forward problem.\n\nA computer-controlled special-purpose fatigue test apparatus, equipped with multiple sensing devices (e.g., ultrasonics and optical microscope) for damage analysis, has been used to experimentally validate the STSA method for early detection of\nanomalous behavior. The sensor information is integrated with a software module consisting of the STSA algorithm for real-time monitoring of fatigue damage. Experiments have been conducted\nunder different loading conditions on specimens constructed from the ductile aluminium alloy 7075-T6.\n\nThe dissertation has also investigated the application of the STSA method for early detection of anomalies in other engineering disciplines.

Several preliminary investigations are considered to evaluate these parameters in beam and building bay models.  Insight from these models were applied to full building models to investigate the collapse performance of the building subject to two load cases: the DOD (2009) collapse design load combination and a critical pedestrian load case representative of emergency occupant egress on the damaged structure.\nResults indicate that building model behavior is sensitive to all of the aforementioned modeling parameters as well as computational analysis procedures.

Treatment rations contained a specific CP:ME ratio, 48.3, 59.1, 67.5, and 76.5 g of crude protein (CP) per Mcal of metabolizable energy (ME) with non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) to rumen degradable protein (RDP) ratios (NSC:RDP; g of NSC per g of RDP) of 4.15 for the 48.3 CP:ME ratio, 3.30 for the 59.1 CP:ME ratio, 2.75 for the 67.5 CP:ME ratio, and 2.32 for the 76.5 CP:ME ratio.

Feeding a CP:ME ratio of 63.3 at 2.0% BW as DMI to Holstein heifers produced less calculated microbial N than higher CP:ME ratios (69.4 and 77.3), but achieved a better synergistic relationship of dietary protein to energy (CP:ME and NSC:RDP ratios) resulting in greater total tract apparent DM digestibility.\n\tFrom the results of the second experiment, it was hypothesized that greater calculated microbial N received from higher CP:ME ratios (69.4 and 77.3) than the 63.3 CP:ME ratio occurred due to increased quantities of RDP or specific RDP fractions.  In the third experiment, four prepubertal Holstein heifers (148 to 190 kg BW) fitted with rumen cannulae were used to evaluate a specific CP:ME ratio, with altered soluble (AB1) and potentially rumen degradable (B2B3) protein fractions on nutrient utilization.  A 4\u00d74 Latin square design with a 2\u00d72 factorial arrangement of treatments was used.  Heifers were fed treatment rations at 2.0% BW as DMI containing a CP:ME ratio of 62.1 g of CP per Mcal of ME with altered AB1 fractions (33.6 or 40.6% AB1 as a percent of CP) and B2B3 fractions (20.9 or 28.2% B2B3 as a percent of CP).  Non-structural carbohydrate to RDP ratios ranged from 3.92 to 3.12 for treatment rations.  Increased intakes of AB1 increased rumen ammonia but decreased total volatile fatty acid concentrations.  Increased intakes of B2B3 tended to increase total volatile fatty acid concentrations while increasing molar proportions of propionate.  Nitrogen utilization was not affected by increased intakes of AB1 or B2B3.  Feeding a CP:ME ratio of 62.1:1 at 2.0% BW as DMI to Holstein heifers with increased potentially rumen degradable protein (28.2 versus 20.9 % B2B3 as a percent of CP) affects rumen fermentation but has no overall effect on N utilization.\nIn summary, results from three experiments indicate that Holstein heifers, between 125 and 234 kg BW, receiving a diet at 2.0% BW as DMI containing a CP:ME ratio between 60:1 to 69:1 achieved improved feed efficiency, structural growth, and nutrient utilization.  Optimum performance resulted when a 63:1 CP:ME ratio, in comparison to lower and higher CP:ME ratios evaluated, contained 16% dietary CP and 2.6 Mcal of ME per kg of DM.  The 16% dietary CP of the 63.1 CP:ME ratio should consist of 34% AB1 and 31% B2B3, resulting in a RDP of 65% as a percent of dietary CP.  It also appears NSC:RDP ratios should range between 3.30 and 2.66, but is contingent on protein fractions of the RDP.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4356], "author_name_tesi": "Gabler, Matthew Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Gabler", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James George Beierlein", "Peter R Tozer", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "Lawrence Dean Muller", "Lisa Holden"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James George Beierlein, Committee Member", "Peter R Tozer, Committee Member", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Committee Chair", "Lawrence Dean Muller, Committee Member", "Lisa Holden, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["growth", "digestibility", "protein to energy ratios", "dairy heifers"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "SYNTHESIS-STRUCTURE-PROPERTY-PERFORMANCE RELATIONSHIPS OF TiN, CrN, AND NANOLAYER (Ti,Cr)N COATINGS DEPOSTIED BY CATHODIC ARC EVAPORATION FOR HARD PARTICLE EROSION RESISTANCE", "id": "9136", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "734", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hard particle erosion due to sand particles can cause significant damage to metallic turbine engine components.

The comparison is not to find or demonstrate a statistically significant difference but to identify values indicative of differences observed via TEM. \nThe SIDI engine used in this research is a fuel-neutral, single-cylinder, four-stroke research engine which is built into a Ricardo Hydra block. The engine is a 549 [cc] with a flat-top piston, fueled by Tier II EEE. Working in collaboration with GM and PNNL, a clean baseline engine operating condition was established and repeatability at this condition was ascertained. This baseline condition is specified as 2100 rpm, 350 kPa IMEP, 280 [\u00b0bTDC] end of injection (EOI), and 25 [\u00b0bTDC] ignition timing. Engine operational conditions included lean and rich conditions, a high-load case and an advanced ignition, each relative to a reference condition.\n\nCharacterization techniques involved physical structure (microscopy) and chemistry (spectroscopy), both electron and optical based. Physical size and structure characterization that include aggregate size and morphology, primary particle size and internal nanostructure, were analyzed by TEM and subsequent image analyses. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) partial oxidation runs were conducted with intermediate study by HRTEM to estimate the degree of burnout for but one sample.

The aggregates formed for the conditions with lesser mixing appeared to be more compact with a higher level of tortuosity. Significantly FTIR provided a volumetric measure of the chemical composition as manifested by the functional groups. XPS showed that there are significant differences in composition between the five different engine-operating conditions. High resolution spectra over the C 1s regions showed that the soot particulates surface mostly consisted of graphitic carbon with some organic content. Corresponding relative peak intensities suggest that organics observed by FTIR-ATR are not concentrated in a surface film. Taken with FTIR-ATR measurements, this serves as strong evidence for matrix distributed organic content. A small (< 20%) surface oxygen content was observed by XPS, consistent with FTIR suggesting that the organic content is mainly alkyl hydrocarbons rather than oxygenated species. Compared to diesel engine produced soots, aggregate fractal morphologies (both fractal dimension and root form factor) were significantly lower while primary particle sizes were of similar size range.  The composite of these analyses illustrates the heterogeneity of species incorporated into soot particles implies a non-uniform growth environment with respect to time, temperature, and gas-phase chemistry during the combustion cycle.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7062], "author_name_tesi": "Gaddam, Chethan Kumar", "last_name_ssi": "Gaddam", "middle_name_ssi": "Kumar", "first_name_ssi": "Chethan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Fuel Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Randy Lee Vander Wal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Randy Lee Vander Wal, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["HRTEM", "nanostructure", "tortuosity", "SIDI engine", "carbon lamella", "fractal dimension", "root form factor"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Electron Microscopic and Spectroscopic Characterization for Soot Source Differentiation by Laser Derivatization", "id": "26310", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11548", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-22T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Combustion produced soot is highly variable with nanostructure and chemistry dependent upon combustion conditions and fuel. Previous studies have shown soot nanostructure to be dependent upon the source via quantification of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images for nanostructural parameters. In principle this permits identification of the soot source and its contribution to any particular receptor site. Yet many structural aspects are subtle, and the chemistry of lamellae is unaddressed for reasons of poorly resolved or differentiated nanostructure and insufficient sample quantity for traditional analytical methods. This characterization gap then leads to the formative question prompting this study: how best to bring out small differences in nanostructure and other seemingly subtle differences in chemistry? A process of pulsed laser annealing is proposed to highlight compositional and structural differences thereby distinctively and uniquely identifying the source of the soot. The operative premise being that small variations in nanostructure and unresolved differences in chemistry exist and are specific to the particular combustion process. The overall goal is then to develop the laser-based heating as an analytical tool by identifying the process conditions and operational parameters for optimal derivatization. Specific objectives directed towards achieving this goal include: \n1)\tIdentifying optimal laser operational parameters for derivatization. \n2)\tDefining the dependence upon nanostructure and molecular composition using model soots while also identifying variability and range of outcomes. \n3)\tDemonstrating differentiation upon combustion derived soots from real engines, e.g. diesel, gasoline, gas-turbines, combustors, etc.\n4)\tApplying image processing algorithms to the laser heated soots to quantify and differentiate the transformed carbon nanostructures.\nFor laser derivatization, a sample-housing chamber was custom built using a commercial optical grade quartz tube. Depending on the sample quantity, two different sample support systems were designed. Soot was laser-heated while in an inert (Ar) atmosphere using a pulsed Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm. A laser beam dimension of ca 9 mm in diameter ensured that the entire sample area received uniform irradiation. To identify the optimal laser fluence, pulsed laser heating was applied at three different laser fluences to three carbon samples. Laser heating at these short timescales produced partially graphitized structures comprised of extended graphitic layers (>1 nm), and voids as material is rearranged. While laser heating the material with additional pulses did further graphitize the material, multiple pulses were not particularly beneficial for laser derivatization as this repetitive exposure decreased the degree of differentiation between the test samples. Based on visual HRTEM observations and quantified fringe analysis, a single pulse laser fluence of 250 mJ/cm2 (~2800 K, determined from multi-wavelength pyrommetry) produced the best derivatization without causing fragmentation or material ablation. \nFor demonstrating the uniqueness of the laser-derivatized (nano)structure as dependent upon source and combustion conditions, the laser derivatization technique was validated by comparing different synthetic carbons, selected soots from transportation and residential combustion sources, and laboratory flames, each with recognizable nanostructure. After laser heating, the direction of nanostructure evolution of the synthetic carbons (possessing C:H > 10:1) appeared to be governed by their initial nanostructure as shown by HRTEM images. As illustration of chemistry\u2019s role, though nascent R250 carbon black showed structural similarity across multiple particles, laser heating led to either hollow shells or particles with internal structures. These differences were attributed to the chemistry of construction, i.e., the sp2/sp3 bonding as quantified by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), showing significant differences between particles as large as 60%. \nThe nanostructure of soots from different transportation sources (such as diesel, jet and gasoline engines) evolved distinctively upon laser annealing. Laser derivatization of soot collected from same platform (engine-type) revealed that fuel commonality leads to similar nanostructure for the same class of combustion source, whereas, fuel dependence and ensuing chemistry differences were prominently illustrated by comparison of laser-annealed soots originating from ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) and an oxygenated fuel blend. The origin for this dependence was identified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), revealing a significantly lower sp2/sp3 carbon bonding for the oxygenated fuels compared to their pure hydrocarbon fuels. As another example, laser annealing of residential boiler soot produced highly intertwined lamellae; this was attributed to inherent chemistry differences relative to the biodiesel (B100) soot that similarly lacked recognizable nanostructure. These observations suggest that the initial soot nanostructure in conjunction with the chemistry of construction governs the material transformation under pulsed laser annealing. \nImage processing algorithms were applied to quantify and differentiate the carbon nanostructural changes after laser annealing. A \u201crecognition key\u201d approach using a combination of present quantification algorithms: 1) fringe analysis, 2) stacking distribution, and 3) void dimension was reported for two laser-heated carbons, as examples. A second, method, using the radial intensity profile generated from the Fourier-Transformed bright field image was implemented to identify soot source upon laser derivatization against a reference set of values in a database. This semi-automated analytical method involves conversion of HRTEM images into the frequency domain, band-pass filtering, radial intensity profiling, and identification by least squares comparison with an empirically set limit for the sum of residuals. To illustrate the analytical methodology for source identification, a mixture of three soots was analyzed by laser derivatization. Laser heating led to visual differences; further quantification and comparison to the database identified the respective sources.

This is the premier technique to identify and quantify components of interest from a complex mixture. However, the current GC systems are bulky and expensive. Microfabricated gas chromatographic columns (\u00b5GCs) have been developed to miniaturize the state of the art systems, allowing for removal of the large and inefficient ovens as well as fabrication of a micro-total analytical system (\u00b5TAS) for on-site detection. The \u00b5GC devices also provide a platform for creation of novel geometries and stationary phases unique to microfabricated devices. Although there has been considerable success in development of \u00b5GC columns and \u00b5TAS devices, currently microfabricated devices have not matched the performance of commercial columns in a number of areas. Firstly, microfabricated columns have temperature limitations much lower than that of commercial columns. To date, microfabricated columns have not operated at temperatures above 250 \u00b0C due to the epoxies used in the world-to-device connections, while standard commercial columns operate at temperatures up to 350 \u00b0C. The thermal limitations of the \u00b5GC devices prevent the use of these devices with a large number of compounds typically separated using gas chromatography. Additionally, the separation efficiency of the microfabricated columns have not matched that of commercial columns and no direct comparison of \u00b5GC columns to commercial columns has been made. Finally, there is a need for a seamless world-to-device connection to eliminate detrimental dead space and improve column efficiency. Here we address the problems listed above. We have developed novel microfabricated channel designs capable of improved chromatographic performance and allowing for high throughput and lengths up to 10 meters. To operate at high temperatures (up to 400 \u00b0C) we have fabricated interfacing and packaging techniques enabling microfabricated columns and have demonstrated the first high temperature separation with a \u00b5GC column. We have optimized the world-to-device microfluidic interconnection removing dead volume at the inlet. We have benchmarked the performance of the microfabricated column against commercially available conventional columns and displayed a clear solution to improve the separation efficiency of microfabricated columns.

Specifically, our goal was to develop this biosensor to quantify creatinine in human urine samples. Further, we sought to develop a sensitive and robust calorimeter, in which the enzyme containing cartridge could be quickly removed and replaced.

The high-temperature sensitivity of the quartz resonator enables a sensitive calorimetric system despite the separation between the fluid of interest and the sensor through 100 \u03bcm gap of air.

The formation of giant vesicles arrays, in turn, can permit high-throughput investigation of these membrane processes.

Next, these patterned deposits were used to produce giant vesicles through electroformation. Through the variation of stamp feature size, the size and number of vesicles formed at each stamped location could be prescribed. The versatility of this technique was demonstrated by forming vesicle arrays from stamped proteoliposome solution, stamped membrane fragment, and in physiologically relevant solutions.

Therefore, we have studied a novel molecular system that has the potential to address all of these concerns. Our design goal was to develop a reversible polyvalent molecular system to enhance specific cell capture on a substrate, release the captured cells reversibly under physiological conditions, and amplify the specific molecular signal on the surface of a captured cell.  To test this hypothesis, we designed a novel polyvalent DNA scaffold that can, in principle, be functionalized with any molecule or used to functionalize any substrate.  Our data have shown that that this scaffold can be synthesized on the surface of a device or cell. Specifically, the polyvalent DNA scaffold displaying multiple nucleic acid aptamer ligands was capable of more CTC capture than monovalent controls. Additionally, a molecular trigger complementary to the polyvalent scaffold can be utilized for the non-invasive release of CTCs, providing the potential for downstream analysis of rare cell populations.

Through 19F NMR it was determined due to reactivity ratio differences of BTFE in comparison to previously explored copolymers, BTFE during synthesis is much more likely to link with itself.  This results in long runs of BTFE-BTFE defects along with isolated single defects.  These long runs are found to have dramatic effects on the distribution of chain conformations determined from FTIR, the melting temperature and total crystallinity determined by DSC, and the crystallite size, lattice spacing, and crystalline phase as determined by XRD.  These results indicate that P(VDF-BTFE) has a mix of both included (single) and excluded defects (runs of defects) that rapidly inhibit crystallinity and alter phase.  The dielectric analysis also confirmed this by a broadening of the Tg peak in the temperature dependent dielectric spectroscopy with increasing BTFE content in the monomer feed indicative of expansion of the interlamellar region due to defect exclusion.\n\tChapter 3 explores P(VDF-BTFE) copolymers for capacitive energy storage.  Due to the rapid decrease in crystallinity only low concentration copolymers (>2 mol %) BTFE were used.  This was ultimately a result of stretching being required for high energy density to be exhibited.  The 0.5 mol% BTFE copolymer samples was found to possess a discharge energy density of 20.8 J/cm3 at 750 MV/m along with the highest breakdown strength of any reported PVDF based copolymer.  It was found that for this small amount of defect monomer the \u03b3 phase of PVDF was stabilized and mixed with \u03b2 phase and along with small crystallite size accounted for the high breakdown strength and energy density.  Additionally, by utilizing only a small amount of defect monomer the decrease in crystallinity and melting temperature observed in previously examined PVDF copolymers was avoided.\n\tChapter 4 examines a terpolymer of VDF, trifluoroethylene (TrFE), and chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE).  The terpolymers of VDF have gained extensive interest as the use of the two defect monomer increases the dielectric constant to 40+ along with altering the polarization behavior from a normal ferroelectric to a relaxor ferroelectric characterized by a slim hysteresis loop.  The current understanding of this behavior suggests that only the size of the third bulky monomer (CTFE in this case) determines whether a single hysteresis (SHL) or double hysteresis loop (DHL) will develop.  This chapter shows that for a single composition of the terpolymer normal ferroelectric, SHL, and DHL behavior can be tuned through processing of the film.  This was rationalized as films give long times to crystallize developed large ferroelectric domains within a paraelectric matrix resulting in the DHL behavior due to reversible switching of these domains.  While if these films were stretched below the Tc SHL behavior was observed as this had the effect of dispersing these domains within the crystal.  \n\tChapter 5 changes focus to high temperature performance of polymer capacitors.  The primary strategy to enable high temperature polymer capacitors has been the utilization of high Tg polymers because of their thermal stability.  While these polymers have demonstrated stable dielectric properties at low field and high breakdown strengths at elevated temperatures, the high field loss limits their use at even mildly elevated temperature well below Tg.  Additionally, these polymers are expensive, brittle, and difficult to process, essentially defeating some of the primary reasons for utilizing a polymer in the first place.  This chapter examines a commercially available, extrudable, high temperature fluoropolymer, known as polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE).  The same defect monomer discussed with PVDF above.  While this polymer showed comparable performance to BOPP at room temperature, it showed equally susceptible to high field loss at elevated temperature.  However, the chlorine of the monomers allow for crosslinking of this polymer by commercially used peroxide/co-agent chemistry.  Crosslinking lead to a substantial improvement of the crosslinked film over the pristine polymer, and superior energy density to the commercial high Tg polymers up to 150 \u00b0C.  The reason for the improvement was found to be the formation of chemical defects produced during the crosslinking that were excluded from the crystalline phase.  Through TSDC it was found that these defects concentrated in the interlamellar region led to a substantial enhancement of the charge trapping properties of this relaxation.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10693], "author_name_tesi": "Gadinski, Matthew Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Gadinski", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Qing Wang", "Dr Qiming Zhang", "Michael T Lanagan", "Zoubeida Ounaies"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Qing Wang, Dissertation Advisor", "Dr Qiming Zhang, Committee Member", "Michael T Lanagan, Committee Member", "Zoubeida Ounaies, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polymers", "polymer dielectrics", "PVDF", "energy storage", "capacitors"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Poetry, Drama, and Fiction in the London Marketplace, 1737-1749", "id": "21243", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10019", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project addresses major gaps in our understanding of the mid-eighteenth century book trade and the imaginative literature it produced.

However, though much work has been done exploring this construct, studies frequently suffer from several limitations.  First, few studies operationalize conflict as it is defined.  Second, there is a paucity of research exploring conflict between visitors and land managers.  Finally, a visitor\u2019s awareness of management goals (i.e., situation awareness) has not been looked at in detail regarding conflict.  This study attempts to close some of those gaps.  A metacognitive situation awareness model was used to explore park visitors\u2019 awareness about management goals and objectives, and comparisons were made between visitor situation awareness and recreation conflict.  Conflict was assessed by first identifying visitor goals, then determining the extent to which those goals had been reached.  Finally, when goals were not fully met, the source of the goal interference was examined.  If the interference could not be attributed to another group or individual, it was classified as circumstantial goal interference rather than conflict.  If the source of interference was attributable to other park visitors or park managers/staff, it was classified as visitor-visitor or visitor-manager conflict, respectively.  A two-phase study design was used whereby qualitative, key informant interviews with land managers and recreational visitors (Phase One) were used to inform the development of a quantitative on-site survey tool (Phase Two).  Phase Two surveys were administered to recreational visitors at Beech Fork State Park and an adjoining Wildlife Management Area between May and September of 2015.  Data reveal that when these new techniques were used to measure conflict, considerably more goal interference was present at the study site as compared to previous research.  Further, visitor-manager conflict appears to be much more prevalent than visitor-visitor conflict, though previous research has only explored the latter.  Finally, while few significant relationships were found between situation awareness and recreation conflict, it is likely due in part to limitations in the study design.  Further exploration of situation awareness is warranted.

Si is a desirable substrate material for GaN heteroepitaxy due to the low cost of production, large wafer sizes available, and current widespread use in the electronics industry.  The growth of GaN/Si devices suffers from the lattice and CTE mismatches between GaN and Si and therefore multiple methods of strain reduction have been employed to counter these effects.  In this work we presented two novel methods of substrate modification to promote the growth of device quality GaN on Si.\nInitial work focused on the implantation of AlN/Si(111) substrates with N+ ions below the AlN/Si(111) interface.  A reduction in the initial compressive stress in GaN films as well as the degree of tensile stress generation during growth was observed on implanted samples.  Optical microscopy of the GaN surfaces showed reduced channeling crack density on implanted substrates.  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies showed a disordered layer in the Si substrate at the implantation depth which consisted of a mixture of polycrystalline and amorphous Si.  Evidence was provided to suggest that the disordered layer at the implantation depth was acting as a compliant layer which decoupled the GaN film from the bulk Si substrate and partially accommodated the tensile stress formed during growth and cooling.  A reduction in threading dislocation (TD) density on ion implanted substrates was also observed.\nAdditional studies showed that by increasing the lateral size of AlN islands, the tensile growth stress and TD density in GaN films on ion implanted substrates could be further reduced.  XRD studies showed an expansion of the AlN lattice on implanted substrates with larger lateral island sizes.  The final tensile growth stress of films on implanted substrates was further reduced by utilizing thinner buffer layers and increasing the implantation depth of N+ ions.\nFinal studies were presented on a method of etching Si(001) substrates in order to fabricate trenches with Si{110} sidewalls.  It was shown in these studies that GaN could be preferentially grown on Si{110} sidewalls such that GaN(0002)//Si{110}.  The result was non-polar GaN \u201cfins\u201d which vertically overgrew Si(001) ridges.

These patterns can be especially complex in areas with heterogeneous terrain and frequent precipitation, which can result in many potential water sources for vegetation. The aim of my dissertation research was to characterize current patterns in tree water use in order to improve empirical estimates for hydrologic process models. This work focused on three main studies: effective rooting depth for tree water uptake, temporal dynamics of water use, and characterizing and predicting the tree water isotopic landscape. Each study took place at the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory, in a first-order catchment with mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania. \n\nWe concluded that the majority of water uptake during the dry part of the growing season occurred at less than 50 cm soil depth throughout the catchment. While there were some trends in depth of water uptake related to slope position, tree genus, and tree size, water uptake was more uniformly shallow than we expected. Secondly, we showed tree water transport velocities between 1 and 18 m d-1, and tree water residence times of up to about 3 weeks for four hardwood tree species on a ridge top site during the peak of the growing season. There was no evidence of longer residence times in the larger trees. We found that the soil-to-leaf driving force appeared to be a strong determinant of tracer velocity across species. Lastly, we found that a simple model including tree canopy height and degree of slope as predictors of tree water \u03b418O compositions in the catchment, explained over half of the variance in tree water \u03b418O composition. \n\nCollectively, these results provide a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between tree water sources and the temporal dynamics of tree water use, in the context of catchment topography. The conclusions of these studies can inform and improve hydrologic modeling applications and have implications for the connections between trees, streamflow, and contaminant transport.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10649], "author_name_tesi": "Gaines, Katie Palanjian", "last_name_ssi": "Gaines", "middle_name_ssi": "Palanjian", "first_name_ssi": "Katie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Eissenstat", "David Eissenstat", "Frederick C Meinzer", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian", "Matthew David Hurteau"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Eissenstat, Dissertation Advisor", "David Eissenstat, Committee Chair", "Frederick C Meinzer, Special Member", "Margot Wilkinson Kaye, Committee Member", "Armen Ricardo Kemanian, Committee Member", "Matthew David Hurteau, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["forest ecology", "tree physiology", "tree water use", "rooting depth", "Critical Zone Observatory"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "LEVERAGING DIVERSITY AND TECHNOLOGY FOR TEAM PERFORMANCE: THE ROLE OF VARIETY, DISPARITY, VIRTUALITY AND KNOWLEDGE SHARING \n\n\n\n", "id": "9823", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5320", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation examined how diversity and virtuality impact team performance.

I tested this theoretical framework using a sample of 168 teams via a four-wave, longitudinal (panel) study.

Finally, knowledge sharing transmits the effects of diversity (perceived variety, leadership status disparity and self-status disparity) and team communication configuration (face-to-face and virtual communication) on performance.  Findings from this study indicate two key insights.  First, capitalizing on diversity requires managing the dilemmatic effects of variety and disparity on knowledge sharing.

The main challenge is the speed at which frames from the video are processed. Most of the well-known pattern recognition techniques do not address the issue of processing speed, thus making them ill-suited for working with live video input. What is needed is a means to improve the processing speed of these video-based facial recognition techniques so that they can handle such input.\n\nGraphics Processing Units (GPUs) are an ideal method to accelerate recognition processing. GPU architectures are powerful because they support a large number of cores that can process large amounts of data in parallel.

The increased runtime performance allows more frames from a live video stream to be processed, reducing the likelihood of recognition and tracking errors.\n\nWe develop a facial recognition method to operate on the central processing unit (CPU), and then accelerate several components of the method to operate on the GPU.

The underlying mechansims connecting epigenetic mechanisms to the conflict resolution that helps to sustain social homeostasis are still unclear, however, this research presented in this dissertation establishes a solid foundation for futures studies to bridge the gap between epigenetics and their impacts on behavior, development, and immunity within social insect colonies.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10935], "author_name_tesi": "Galbraith, David Asher", "last_name_ssi": "Galbraith", "middle_name_ssi": "Asher", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christina M Grozinger", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster", "Heather M Hines", "Istvan Albert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christina M Grozinger, Dissertation Advisor", "Diana Lynn Cox Foster, Committee Chair", "Heather M Hines, Committee Member", "Istvan Albert, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Epigenetic mechanisms", "honey bees", "queen/worker interaction", "antiviral immunity", "allele specific expression", "DNA methylatation"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "The Effects of Socially Relevant Representations on Learning, Social Presence and Interaction for Students in Online, Self-Directed Learning Settings", "id": "7931", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2616", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-10-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Effects of Socially Relevant Representations on Learning, Social Presence and Interaction for Students in Online, Self-Directed Learning Settings", "semester_ssi": "", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2609], "author_name_tesi": "Galbraith, Joel David", "last_name_ssi": "Galbraith", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Joel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Instructional Systems", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Hoadley", "Barbara L Grabowski", "S.

The component specific detector, a mass spectrometer detector, provides excellent results for binary polymer-solvent systems, but it is particularly valuable because it can be readily applied to multicomponent systems.  \nIn this work a new inverse gas chromatograph (IGC) apparatus was developed combining a mass spectrometer detector with a traditional gas chromatograph.  Results for a number of infinitely dilute solvents in poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) are reported over a range of temperature from  60 to 150\u00b0C to benchmark the unit.  A good agreement with other IGC source was found.  The use of a mass spectrometer detector allows one to obtain reliable results for experiments when a mixture of several components was injected into the column at infinite dilution.\nResults are also reported for finite concentrations of toluene and methanol in PVAc from 60 to 110\u00b0C.  In addition, the technique was applied to study the effect of finite concentrations of toluene on the diffusion coefficients of THF and cyclohexane in PVAc.  The experimental data compare well with literature values for both infinite and finite concentrations, indicating that the experimental protocol described in this work is sound.\nThe study of true multicomponent systems in which the polymer was saturated with finite concentrations of two solvents was conducted.  The experimental chromatographs consisted of two independent responses, one for each of the solvents.  This allows one to compare these profiles with theoretical models to obtain the thermodynamic and transport properties.  Two models were used to calculate solubility and diffusivity in ternary mixtures:  a binary model that was used to fit independently each of the two elution profiles and a ternary model which fits simultaneously both peaks in a ternary experiment.  The results are promising showing good agreement for solubility with prediction obtained from the UNIFAC-FV theory for ternary systems.  Some discrepancies between the experimental data and the prediction were found at higher solvent concentrations, where some of the model\u2019s assumptions break down.  The main diffusion coefficients for toluene and THF were obtained in the ternary systems.  No important differences were found in diffusivity and solubility between the models.  The diffusion coefficients were found to follow the expected trend with composition.  This work provides the theoretical and experimental basis to analyze the complex multicomponent systems from a practical point of view, and for the first time in inverse gas chromatography it can be used to obtain diffusivity information.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3048], "author_name_tesi": "Gald\u00e1mez Pe\u00f1a, Jos\u00e9 Rom\u00e1n", "last_name_ssi": "Gald\u00e1mez Pe\u00f1a", "middle_name_ssi": "Rom\u00e1n", "first_name_ssi": "Jos\u00e9", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney", "Ronald Paul Danner", "Janna Kay Maranas", "Narayan Ramesh", "Paul C Painter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrew Zydney, Committee Chair", "Ronald Paul Danner, Committee Chair", "Janna Kay Maranas, Committee Member", "Narayan Ramesh, Committee Member", "Paul C Painter, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Diffusivity", "Multicomponent", "Inverse Gas Chromatography", "Solubility", "Polymer"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Human Subcalcaneal Fat Pad Mechanical Properties", "id": "21171", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8704", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The human heel pad is located inferior to the calcaneus and functions to decrease local stress on this bone, decrease the impact of heel strike transients, and act as a shock absorber.  It is approximately 15 mm thick and consists of dense fibrous septa which are filled with closely packed adipocytes to perform these functions.  The purpose of this dissertation was to examine the mechanical properties of the human heel pad to gain a greater understanding of the functional role of this tissue.  Three experiments were completed to address several issues:  1) are the mechanical properties of the human heel different when experiencing physiological rest times compared with non-physiological rest times, 2) are the mechanical properties of the human heel pad different when experiencing physiological forces compared with non-physiological forces, and 3) what effect does heel pad containment and exposure have on the mechanical properties of the human heel pad.\n\nExperiment 1 examined the effect of physiological rest times associated with running on the mechanical properties of the human heel pad.  Data collected on a group of runners revealed that these rest time intervals, the stride time intervals, demonstrated long-term correlations.  When loadings were applied to cadaveric heel pads using a material testing system, these timing fluctuations significantly changed the deformation and stiffness of the heel pad compared with the results from non-physiological loadings.  The results indicated some evolutionary adaptation in heel properties to the nature of physiological rest intervals between the loadings they experience.\n\nExperiment 2 examined the effect of physiological forces on the mechanical properties of the human heel pad.  Data collected on a group of runners revealed that physiological forces during heel impact demonstrated long term correlations.  When physiological forces were applied to cadaveric heel pads using a material testing system, the forces did not significantly affect the mechanical properties of the human heel pad.  It was hypothesized that the heel pad mechanical properties would exploit the variability found in physiological forces of runners, but this was not the case.\n\nExperiment 3 examined the effect of various amounts of heel pad containment and exposure on heel pad mechanical properties, in a similar fashion to different shoe designs.  For the purpose of this experiment, containment was defined as the act of heel pad confinement by an external device.  Exposure was defined as the amount of heel pad that is not supported by an external device.  Using a custom external containment system heel pads were tested in a material testing system by loading with forces approximating those that the heel pad experiences during running, and using rest intervals reflecting those from gait.  For ten cadaver heel pad the peak deformation, hysteresis, and stiffness were determined.  These results indicate that the behavior of the human heel pad is altered in the presence of external containment.  Heel pads demonstrated significantly less maximal deformation expressed as a percentage of heel pad thickness and greater stiffness at body weight when compared with uncontained heels.  From the exposure perspective, the behavior of the heel pad is also altered by exposure.  The findings of this experiment have implications for footwear design.\n\nThe findings from these experiments indicate that the mechanical behavior of the human heel pad is different when experiencing physiological rest times during running gait, and that heel pad mechanical behavior is influenced due to the type of constraints found in shoes and orthotic devices.  The results of this study have implications for shoe and orthotic design and for the further examination of the behavior of the human heel pad under different simulated gait patterns.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8571], "author_name_tesi": "Gales, Daniel Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Gales", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Henry Challis", "John Henry Challis", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Neil Sharkey", "Andris Freivalds"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Henry Challis, Dissertation Advisor", "John Henry Challis, Committee Chair", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Member", "Neil Sharkey, Committee Member", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Biomechanics", "Mechanical Properties", "Heel Pad", "Fluctuation Analysis (DFA)", "Humans", "Material Testing System (MTS)", "Running"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATION OF DISPERSION AND ITS EFFECT ON THE SURFACTANT-POLYMER FLOODING PROCESS", "id": "15214eog5163", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "15214", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Surfactant-polymer (SP) flooding holds significant promise for enhanced oil recovery, but the procedure for determining the best choice of chemical slug sizes does not consider reservoir mixing. Reservoir mixing at pattern scale can affect optimal slug sizes, but to date there is a lack of understanding of its impact. This thesis examines the impacts of mixing on SP flooding, and to show how grid-block sizes can be optimized through characterizing dispersion. Through these contributions SP flooding can become closer to becoming an economically viable production technique in the field. \nIn this thesis, design selection relies on showing incremental efficiency (STB oil/chemical mass) as a function of both SP slug and polymer buffer sizes. Thousands of UTCHEM simulations give tertiary recovery results across a range of tested designs and key input parameters. Important dimensionless groups are tested for their effects, as well as optimum salinity. Permeability upscaling into effective grid-blocks isolates the dispersion contribution from heterogeneity, and extrapolation to a block size of zero gives an estimate of physical mixing in the reservoir by matching concentration histories to the convection dispersion equation. Grid selection allows the largest block size to represent physical mixing. Optimized grid selection is shown to decrease computational time and uncertainty in project design. Economic analysis multiplies oil and chemical costs by the incremental efficiency and is optimized for profitability. \nMixing is shown to affect the strength and sweep of the SP slug, polymer buffer and salinity slug in the reservoir. Similar to miscible gas flooding\u2019s minimum miscibility pressure and enrichment, surfactant\u2019s critical micelle concentration (CMC) and concentration are greatly impacted, specifically when injection conditions are close to the CMC and optimum salinity. Unlike gas flooding, the effects of mixing on recovery depend on mixing of several components injected in different slugs and key reservoir parameters. Dependent on the process design, mixing can be beneficial or detrimental to efficiency; beneficial when increased sweep effects dominate, and detrimental when concentration effects dominate. The design of maximum process efficiency is described while varying key values, including heterogeneity and an effective chemical cost ratio on a per mass basis. Economic analysis indicates a larger slug design than incremental analysis. An increasing trend is found between each component\u2019s endpoint mobility ratio and measured dispersivity. A new parameter is defined in the fluid dispersivity factor, which characterizes the nature of each injected component\u2019s impact to mixing, where the dispersivity of the component is divided by the dispersivity of a single-phase tracer. Favorable mobility ratios decrease mixing with a fluid dispersivity factor below unity, while adverse mobility ratios associated with components such as surfactant and gas in miscible gas flooding, increase the effective mixing with a dispersivity factor greater than unity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16833], "author_name_tesi": "Galimberti, Evan Barsness", "last_name_ssi": "Galimberti", "middle_name_ssi": "Barsness", "first_name_ssi": "Evan", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns", "Gregory R King", "Hamid Emami-Meybodi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Russell Taylor Johns, Thesis Advisor", "Gregory R King, Committee Member", "Hamid Emami-Meybodi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dispersion", "Surfactant-polymer", "Upscaling", "Enhanced Oil Recovery", "Incremental Efficiency"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "LATINO STUDENTS\u2019 MATH LEARNING TRAJECTORIES IN THE EARLY SCHOOL YEARS: THE ROLE OF ENGLISH ABILITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS", "id": "6863", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1038", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The rapid Hispanic population growth is significantly impacting the overall U.S population.  In addition, Hispanics are over-represented among individuals living in poverty and are considered a high-risk group within schools.\n  During the past twenty years, research has emphasized the relevance of the early school years for future life chances and learning experiences (Entwisle & Alexander, 1988; 1993; Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997; Farkas & Beron 2001).  First grade children learn ten times more than high school students (Jencks, 1985), they show positive dispositions toward learning (Entwisle & Alexander, 1994), and the literacy and numeric skills acquired during this period are strong predictors of school achievement years later (Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997; Farkas & Beron, 2001).   The early school years may be even more critical for Hispanic children who are predominantly children with foreign-born parents and are often raised in non-English speaking homes.\nThis study, taking a longitudinal approach, uses the ECLS-K database to examine Hispanic students\u2019 math learning trajectories between kindergarten and third grade.  Specifically, this study describes Hispanic students\u2019 math achievement patterns by Hispanic country of origin and generational status.  In addition, I investigate the relative importance of English ability and SES in shaping their learning trajectories.  A piecewise linear growth model is used to estimate learning growth during kindergarten, in first grade, and between first and third grade.  Hierarchical Linear Modeling is used to analyze two-level models \u2013assessments nested within students.\nThis study finds important variability in math outcomes among Hispanic subgroups; variability that is generally masked when Hispanics of different countries of origin and generations are aggregated within one pan-ethnic denomination.  Overall, Hispanic students could be clustered into two distinct groups.  First and second generation Mexican students, Puerto Rican students regardless of generation, and Central American students regardless of generation are included in the first group. These students start kindergarten with significant math disadvantages that persist until third grade.  The second group includes third+ generation Mexican, Cuban and South American students. This group show modest differences in average math scores at Kindergarten entry and similar growth rates between kindergarten and third grade. \nMoreover, SES and English ability effects on educational outcomes vary across school grades and Hispanic subgroup.  For instance, English ability alone is crucial in explaining math achievement gaps between White students and Cuban and South American students. English ability is also more important in explaining math achievement gaps at kindergarten entry and during kindergarten.  In contrast, SES is essential in explaining Mexican \u2013 White students\u2019 math achievement gaps during first grade and from first to third grade.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1028], "author_name_tesi": "Galindo, Claudia Lucia", "last_name_ssi": "Galindo", "middle_name_ssi": "Lucia", "first_name_ssi": "Claudia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Theory and Policy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Suet Ling Pong", "Sean Reardon", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto", "Salvador Oropesa"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Suet Ling Pong, Committee Chair", "Sean Reardon, Committee Chair", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto, Committee Member", "Salvador Oropesa, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Longitudinal Study", "Hispanics", "Math achievement", "ECLS-K", "Immigration"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "The Construction of Meritocracy within Mass Higher Education: Organizational Dynamics of Honors Programs at American Colleges and Universities", "id": "6530", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1911", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation explores the ideology of contemporary honors programs functioning at different types of higher education institutions and their impact on the overall stratification system of American higher education.

All of the recent research involving ER waves applied various wavenumber-frequency filtering algorithms on observational data sets to obtain statistical links between ER waves and tropical cyclogenesis.  We contend that the methodology employed in this study removes many of the limitations inherent in the previous work on ER waves and tropical cyclogenesis.  \n\nThe idealized simulations performed in this dissertation were broken down into two different sets of experiments - forced and initial-value simulations.  The forced simulations were the simpler of the two and utilized a forcing function centered on the equator in a no-flow background environment to excite ER waves of varying intensity.  The anomalous circulations associated with the ER wave relevant to tropical cyclone (TC) genesis (e.g. low-level vorticity, low-level convergence, and vertical shear) were quantified for each of the ER waves.  It was shown that the maximum low-level vorticity and low-level convergence associated with the ER wave were on the order of 2x10^-5 1/s and 1x10^-5 1/s, respectively.  While portions of the ER wave were favorable for genesis, it was shown that when the ER wave anomalies were combined into a single genesis parameter (GP), the values of the parameter were near, but below, a threshold value commonly associated with genesis.  \n\nBased on this result it was hypothesized that the magnitude of the anomalous circulations of the ER wave alone is usually insufficient to cause TC genesis; rather, only when an intense ER wave combines with a favorable background flow does the likelihood of genesis increase significantly.  The selected background flow for this study was a monsoon trough (MT), as this large-scale feature has been shown to play a prominent role in many TC genesis cases, especially in the North West Pacific Ocean.  A series of idealized MT structures were superimposed on the ER wave, and it was demonstrated that within certain portions of the wave, the GP exceeded the threshold value.  Not surprisingly, the most favorable conditions for genesis were observed for the most intense (largest amplitude) ER wave in combination with the most intense (large background cyclonic vorticity) MT.  The enhanced genesis region had a longitudinally-elongated, latitudinally-contracted, cigar-like shape within the area just equatorward of the ER wave gyre center.  This region also lies on the poleward side of the MT, in a region of large background cyclonic vorticity.  \n\nWhile the results from the forced idealized simulations demonstrated that the likelihood for genesis increased significantly for intense ER waves within a favorable background environment, owing to the experiential design, no genesis events within the ER wave were actually simulated.  For this reason, a series of initial value idealized simulations were conducted to study the genesis mechanism within an ER wave.  A three-dimensional (x,y,z), n=1, wavenumber 10 ER wave was inserted in the model initial condition within a no-flow background environment.  It was shown that resulting properties of the ER wave (e.g. phase speed, vertical structure, etc.) agreed relatively well with recent observations of convectively-coupled ER waves.  The quadrant located in the eastern half of the cyclonic gyre of the ER wave was the only quadrant associated with both cyclonic vorticity and low-level convergence.  Further, the anomalous circulations associated with the resulting simulated ER wave were compared to the ER wave anomalies from the forced simulations.  The magnitude of the low-level vorticity and low-level convergence fields agreed relatively well, while the vertical shear was larger in the ER waves from the forced experiments.  This wavenumber 10 ER wave was then used to initialize a series of simulations with different background idealized monsoon troughs.\n\nTwo different idealized MT flow configurations were simulated for a nine day period.  The first (second) had a strip of relative vorticity of 1$\times 10^{-5}$~s$^{-1}$ (2$\times 10^{-5}$~s$^{-1}$) between about 4.5dg~N and 10dg~N, and was zero elsewhere.  Both MT flows were shown to be relatively stable.  That is, while they did not breakdown, their relative vorticity structure remained quasi-steady over the course of the simulations.  The idealized MT flow configurations were then added to the ER wave.  For both MT cases, the ER wave structure quickly deformed within the background horizontal shear region of the MT.  A smaller-scale cyclonic circulation formed as a result of the wave-breaking process and was shown to have a horizontal length scale comparable to a TC.  The wave-breaking process was accompanied with a shift of the location of enhanced convection from east of the ER wave cyclonic gyre center to a region co-located with the TC-scale circulation.  The TC-scale circulation formed near the initial critical latitude in both cases.  This process was very similar to theoretical studies of the wave-breaking of Rossby waves in a horizontally-sheared flow, i.e. the formation of the so-called ``cat's eyes'.  \n\nThe primary difference between the two simulations was that the wave-breaking process occurred much faster in the stronger MT case.  Thus, a TC-scale circulation of sufficient intensity capable of intensifying via its own air-sea interaction formed on a much faster timescale in the stronger idealized MT case. By nine days, a TC of tropical storm intensity had formed in the strong MT flow plus ER wave, while only a weak tropical depression-strength disturbance formed in the weaker MT plus ER wave simulation. \n\nThe initial value idealized simulations were repeated, but with moisture and diabatic effects turned off.  The resulting ER wave propagated at a phase speed about 1~m~s$^{-1}$ faster when compared to the moist ER wave.  While no TCs formed when the idealized MT environments were added to the dry ER wave, the ER wave was observed to break regardless of moisture and diabatic effects in the vicinity of the critical latitude.  As was the case in the moist simulations, the TC-scale circulation was stronger for the case of the stronger MT flow configuration.  \n\nIn the final part of the study, real-data simulations were performed in which an ER wave was inserted into a more realistic background environment.  Two TC genesis cases from the real-data simulations were examined in much more detail; one case (Case 1) in which an ER wave promoted TC genesis and the other (Case 2) in which the ER wave suppressed TC formation relative to the control simulation.  For both cases, the local conditions prior to and at the time of genesis were documented.  The large-scale environment in Case 1 was associated with anomalous cyclonic low-level vorticity, anomalous low-level convergence, and weaker vertical shear relative to the CON simulation.  In Case 2, the large-scale environment featured much larger vertical shear and anticyclonic relative vorticity, owing to the circulations of the ER wave.\n\nResults from the various numerical experiments demonstrated that ER waves have the ability to both enhance and suppress TC formation.  In the case of ER wave-enhanced genesis, the anomalous low-level vorticity and convergence were the dominant factors.  For the case of ER wave-suppressed activity, vertical shear was much more important.  It appears that an anomalously intense ER wave is usually not sufficient on its own to initiate genesis.  However, an anomalously intense ER wave placed within a favorable background environment (e.g. monsoon trough) makes genesis much more likely.  The wave-breaking of the ER wave is a viable mechanism for the initial formation of the TC scale circulation.  The timescale of the formation of this circulation occurred over a much faster timescale for the stronger MT flow configuration when compared with the weaker MT.\n\nOwing to the uniqueness of the methodology of both the idealized and real-data simulations, there remains a plethora of unanswered questions that may provide numerous avenues for future research.  First, in the initial value idealized simulations, only a wavenumber 10 ER wave was considered.  We want to perform a suite of sensitivity studies in which the wavenumber, initial equivalent depth, and wave type are varied and examine how the phase speed as well as the convectively-coupled structure of the wave changes as a result of the varied parameters.  Second, we want to examine the effect of other background flow configurations on the structure and evolution of the ER wave.  Finally, we plan to map out the relationship of the two parameters - the critical latitude of the ER wave (if it exists) and the meridional absolute vorticity profile prior to genesis for ER wave-TC genesis events.  This observational study will utilize a large data set (e.g. Frank and Roundy 2006) of TC genesis events in which ER waves played a significant role.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2997], "author_name_tesi": "Gall, Jeffrey ", "last_name_ssi": "Gall", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William Menaul Frank", "William Menaul Frank", "Sukyoung Lee", "Dr David Stauffer", "Diane Marie Henderson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William Menaul Frank, Dissertation Advisor", "William Menaul Frank, Committee Chair", "Sukyoung Lee, Committee Member", "Dr David Stauffer, Committee Member", "Diane Marie Henderson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tropical cyclones", "hurricanes", "tropical meteorology", "rossby wave"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Recognition and Self...

The streamlined synthetic route allows for rapid interchange of tripeptide functionality as well as the potential for stream-lined expansion to oligopeptide length of 5-mer, 7-mer, 9-mer, etc.\nTripeptide sequences were designed to contain molecular recognition codes, whereby in the presence of a tetracoordinate metal (Cu2+, Zn2+), a bidentate bpy ligand will be self-complementary forming a [2 x 2] complex [M(bpy)2]2+, and a tridentate tpy will be complementary to monodentate py forming a [3 x 1] complex [M(tpy)(py)]2+. Studies included self-assembling monofunctional bpy-tripeptide, which formed a duplex upon addition of Cu2+ .\niv\nAddition of a series of monovalent anions showed large, polarizable coordinating anions, (I-, Br-) and tuned the metal center environment, perturbating the Cu2+ geometry from a distorted square planar environment, to tetragonal.\nHeterotopic ligand sequences, py-bpy-py (pbp) and tpy-bpy-tpy (tbt), were synthesized to form duplex structures from dissimilar strands, extending the metal-directed assembly and molecular recognition properties to more sophisticated behaviors present in natural systems. Additional tripeptides (py-py-py, ppp; bpy-py-bpy, bpb) were synthesized and used in addition to previously synthesized tripeptides to explore binding selectivity in the presence of the Cu-saturated tbt complex.\nThe final body of work focused on developing a functional, photoswitchable artificial oligopeptide scaffold. Azobenzene, a reversible, photoswitchable molecule, was inserted into the artificial oligopeptide backbone. A series of artificial oligopeptides containing bpy- and acetyl (ac-) substituted aeg monomers connected via an azobenzene diamide (b(azo)b, ac(azo)ac, bb(azo)bb) were synthesized. Reversible photoswitching behavior was observed for the single strand. Addition of metal (M= Zn2+, Cu2+) resulted in two switchable structures: mono-metallic hairpin [M(b(azo)b)]2+ and dimetallic duplex [M2(b(azo)b)]4+. Irradiation to promote isomerization reversibly controlled the conformation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8994], "author_name_tesi": "Gallagher, Joy Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Gallagher", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Joy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Squire J Booker", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mary Elizabeth Williams, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Squire J Booker, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Self-Assembly", "Supramolecular", "Copper", "Palindromic", "Biomimetic", "Artificial Oligopeptide", "Inorganic Architectures"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Simultaneous Human Detection And Ranging Using A Millimeter-wave Radar System Transmitting Wideband Noise With An Embedded Tone.", "id": "17699", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8709", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis describes a millimeter-wave (mm-wave) radar system that has been constructed to range humans concealed in light foliage at distances up to 213 meters and detect human Doppler response up to 90 meters away.

Circuit components such as diodes, amplifiers, and mixers are known to exhibit nonlinear behavior. In the case of diodes and mixers, their nonlinear properties can be exploited to perform meaningful tasks. For example, the nonlinear properties of diodes can be used to rectify signals, and the nonlinear properties of mixers can be used to upconvert and downconvert signals from one frequency to another. Since the 1970s, nonlinear effects in circuits have been exploited for remotely detecting the presence of electronic circuits. This is done by actively probing a circuit, at a standoff distance, and processing the received nonlinear signals produced by the circuit. A nonlinear radar tailored to a set of RF electronic responses would allow security personnel to detect unauthorized radio electronics in restricted areas, or enable first-responders to pinpoint personal electronics during emergencies.\n\nThe advantage of using nonlinear detection over traditional detection techniques is that most naturally occurring objects, like trees, bushes, rocks etc., do not exhibit nonlinear behavior. Therefore, a nonlinear radar system will ignore any natural linear clutter and detect only targets possessing nonlinear properties. The challenge of nonlinear radar is that it requires a high power density impinged on the target, and a highly linear, high dynamic range receiver to capture the weak nonlinear returned signal. \n\nMany groups have studied the problem of detecting nonlinear junctions at a distance. These systems have been restricted to the use of a single frequency waveform and a single transmit and receive antenna. With this type of configuration only detecting the presence of nonlinear targets is possible. These systems offer no ranging, tracking or imaging. The use of a single frequency also greatly simplifies the system hardware requirements, as it is much easier to build filters, amplifiers ect. at a single frequency or narrow bandwidth. Designing and developing a nonlinear radar system with a wide bandwidth or ultra wide bandwidth is far more difficult. Without utilizing bandwidth for resolution and an aperture for cross range resolution locating the position to nonlinear targets is not possible.\n\nThis dissertation presents the construction of an ultra wideband linear/nonlinear radar system. This system has been experimentally tested, and validated. Linear and nonlinear radar data are presented to show the system\u2019s ability to range, track, image and classify nonlinear targets. The radar system consists of a highly linear transmitter and a highly linear, high dynamic range receiver. In this dissertation, the challenges in constructing the radar system are discussed. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of linear and nonlinear targets using both linear and nonlinear radar data are presented. The SAR images demonstrate the clutter suppression capabilities of nonlinear radars. Receive power vs. frequency data are used as features to classify five different nonlinear targets. Classification results for five different electronic targets are presented. Data were taken of a slow moving nonlinear targets, and range Doppler plots are presented. Data is presented showing a nonlinear target 25 feet from the radar with more than 20 dB signal to noise ratio. This data is used to estimate the maximum detection range of the system to be at least 50 ft.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11380], "author_name_tesi": "Gallagher, Kyle A", "last_name_ssi": "Gallagher", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ram Mohan Narayanan", "Timothy Joseph Kane", "James Kenneth Breakall", "Karl Martin Reichard", "Anthony F.

These devices are used to bridge a patient to transplant or even recovery, and as a method for stand-alone long-term survival. For cases in which long-term VAD use has allowed for the recovery of the patient\u2019s heart, it is desirable to wean a patient from the VAD and allow the heart to strengthen and function on its own again. Stroke volume reduction is a promising way to reload the heart gradually and wean a patient from the device. \n     Since a much smaller volume of research exists for pediatric VADs compared to the larger adult VADs, serious complications persist in their use. Past research has shown that certain flow conditions can promote or reduce occurrences of thrombosis. To yield a better understanding of the factors that cause complications with pediatric VADs, this study analyzed the fluid dynamics in the 12 cc Penn State pediatric VAD.\n     Changes in both stroke volume and hematocrit have been shown to influence the fluid dynamics within the pediatric VAD. While hematocrit, or the ratio of packed red blood cells to whole blood, remains constant for adults at 40%, pediatric hematocrit ranges from 20%-60%. This study examined the effect of hematocrit on the fluid dynamics in the Penn State pediatric VAD during a stroke volume reduction weaning protocol. The experiments used a mock circulatory loop and blood analog fluid to mimic cardiovascular conditions and blood behavior, respectively. To cover the range of pediatric hematocrit, fluids mimicking blood at 20%, 40%, and 60% were used, with the 20% hematocrit fluid being the least viscoelastic fluid and the 60% hematocrit fluid being the most viscoelastic fluid. Stroke volume conditions of 100% (12 cc), 80% (9.6 cc), and 60% (7.2 cc) were created to simulate a stroke volume reduction weaning protocol. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to image the flow fields within the VAD, with the results producing quantitative velocity data describing the flow conditions within the VAD for all three hematocrits at each step of the weaning procedure. \n     The flow patterns for each set of conditions followed a similar sequence: inflow began at the start of diastole, inflow transitioned to a solid body rotation through diastole, and rotational flow dissipated as outflow began in systole. Varying the hematocrit and stroke volume, however, created specific dynamic differences in the flow characteristics. Increased viscoelasticity led to delayed formation of flow patterns, including the inlet jet and the rotational flow. A more viscoelastic fluid also created a stronger inflow, a stronger, late-diastolic rotational flow, and a stronger outflow. A reduction in stroke volume led to flow at lower speeds and more areas of stagnation throughout the cycle.\n     Favorable flow patterns persisted with the use of 40% and 60% hematocrit fluids through all three steps of stroke volume reduction. The 60% hematocrit fluid created the strongest flow and the longest-lasting solid body rotation with the most potential for thrombus reduction. The 20% hematocrit fluid, however, created weaker rotational flow that lasted into systole, dissipated sooner and left more areas of low flow and stagnation. Care should be taken with patients with low hematocrit that adequate flow and wall washing is occurring throughout the cycle to prevent occurrences of thrombosis and patient complications.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14364], "author_name_tesi": "Gallagher, Maureen Brenna", "last_name_ssi": "Gallagher", "middle_name_ssi": "Brenna", "first_name_ssi": "Maureen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Keefe Manning", "William Hancock", "William Weiss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Keefe Manning, Thesis Advisor", "William Hancock, Committee Member", "William Weiss, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PVAD", "PIV", "artificial heart", "pediatric", "hematocrit", "weaning", "ventricular assist device", "cardiovascular fluid dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "The View through the Wind: X-ray Observations of Broad Absorption Line Quasi-Stellar Objects\n\n\n", "id": "5944", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5533", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-02-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The 2-10 keV bandpasses and unprecedented sensitivity of modern X-ray observatories\nhave enabled new insights into the immediate environments of Broad Absorption\nLine (BAL) QSOs.

In addition, Appalachian Pennsylvania has one of the highest percentages of late stage breast cancer diagnoses within the Appalachian region; 35% of breast cancer cases were diagnosed at late stage, when treatment is less effective. This area is characterized by a high prevalence of risk factors for breast cancer, including obesity, physical inactivity, no recent screening mammograms, and limited availability of preventative health care. Methodology: This study was a multiple-site (n=9) intervention study that delivered the proven StrongWomen strength-training program with a breast health component (StrongWomen: New STEPS) to 139 women at least 40 years of age who resided in Appalachian Pennsylvania. Participants completed the pre- and post-StrongWomen Personal Fitness Evaluation and the StrongWomen Process Evaluation. Results: A total of 113 completed the program. In all, 82% of participants increased upper body strength, 87% increased lower body strength, 43% increased upper body flexibility and 71% increased lower body flexibility. A total of 75% of participants indicated improved general health as a result of the program. A total of 5% of participants increased their mammography habits with 77% maintaining their yearly mammography habits before and after the program (n=91); 18% increased their annual clinical breast exam habits by varying degrees while 74% maintained (n=89); and 4% increased breast self exam habits by varying degrees with 39% maintaining (n=87). There were 38% of participants who increased their idea of the importance of early detection while 62% stayed the same as a result of the program. Women reported the StrongWomen program most beneficial due to 45% attitude. Conclusion: StrongWomen: New STEPS shows promising outcomes and may be a potential model to address breast cancer prevention, early detection, and survivorship among women residing in rural Appalachia Pennsylvania counties.

However, the use of RT to index global processing speed is confounded by the presence of poor fine and gross motor skills in this population.  Thus, it remains uncertain whether the slower/ variable RTs found in those with ADHD indicate slower central processing speed, or whether they are instead primarily indices of impaired peripheral motor coordination. One promising alternative to motor RT is vocal articulation speed, which has been found to predict better verbal as well as visuospatial WM performance.  Additionally, distributions of reaction time trials are non-normal, and typically better described with an ex-Gaussian distribution, including parameters of mean (mu), variance (sigma), and skew (tau).  \nThe current study compares the distributions of reaction times from both traditional motor and speech-based reaction time tasks in children with and without ADHD.  Findings indicate that regardless of diagnostic status, larger tau (indicating a greater number of exceedingly slow responses) for preparatory interval and motor reaction time were associated with worse verbal and non-verbal working memory span. When the ex-Gaussian parameters for preparatory interval, speech rate, and motor speed were all combined in a factor analysis, only the factor representing the shared variance of tau from all 3 measures of processing speed predicted performance on the verbal and visuospatial complex span tasks.  \nCombining measures using multiple assessment techniques reduces the effects of possible methodological confounds, resulting in a more \u201cpure\u201d measure of cognitive processing speed.  The association between tau, but not mu or sigma, and WM suggests that observed WM deficits may largely be due to lapses in attention during encoding, rather than truly slower processing.

To survive and flourish in natural environments with fluctuant physiochemical properties and nutrient availabilities, cyanobacteria have evolved multiple strategies to regulate their photosynthetic apparatus that contains three large, multisubunit complexes: photosystem (PS) I, PS II, and phycobilisomes (PBS). In this work, the acclimative remodeling of cyanobacterial photosynthetic apparatus in response to far-red light and iron deficiency was studied. A previously unknown, acclimative response, far-red light photoacclimation (FaRLiP), was discovered for the first time in cyanobacterium Leptolyngbya sp. JSC-1 (hereafter JSC-1). The FaRLiP response includes synthesis of red-shifted Chls d and f in addition to Chl a and substitution of core subunits of PS I, PS II, and PBS with products of gene variants from a 21-gene cluster, which confers upon strain JSC-1 the ability to grow photoautotrophically in far-red light. The key components controlling FaRLiP have been proposed to be a red/far-red knotless phytochrome and two response regulators that are expressed from an apparent operon within the 21-gene cluster. Comparative genome analysis identified gene clusters similar to the 21-gene cluster of JSC-1 in twelve additional strains that belong to all five taxonomic sections of the phylum Cyanobacteria. Synechococcus sp. PCC 7335 was experimentally confirmed to perform FaRLiP, and both Chls d and f were detected in four additional strains after cells were grown in far-red light. Therefore, FaRLiP occurs in a group of cyanobacteria that inhabit niches enriched in\nfar-red light, and these cyanobacteria contain specific, common features in their genomes. Additionally, under iron-limitation stress, JSC-1 cells up-regulate the expression of multiple Chlbinding IsiA proteins and a novel IsiC protein (a fusion of domains similar to IsiA and PsaL), and assemble a PS I-IsiA-IsiC supercomplex that has enlarged chlorophyll-based, light-harvesting antenna. The studies in this thesis demonstrate the remarkable versatility of cyanobacteria forremodeling their photosynthetic apparatus to acclimate to specific environmental challenges. The FaRLiP response should be very important for cyanobacteria that grow in terrestrial environments (soil, microbial mat communities, shade, and blooms), which are enriched in far-red light wavelengths due to filtering by Chl a and Chl b or by wavelength-dependent light scattering effects.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10286], "author_name_tesi": "Gan, Fei ", "last_name_ssi": "Gan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Bryant", "Ying Gu", "Jennifer Macalady", "John H Golbeck", "B Tracy Nixon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Bryant, Dissertation Advisor", "Ying Gu, Committee Member", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member", "B Tracy Nixon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cyanobacteria", "photosynthesis", "acclimation", "far-red light", "iron stress"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Optimized production strategies for improved oil recovery in a caronate oil field", "id": "14548", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7250", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "LCC field is a conventional oil field producing from the Smackover carbonate formation at a depth around 12,000 ft and was discovered in the state of Alabama in 1994.

Fracture properties may be significantly altered due to fluid transport, heat transfer, and chemical reactions. The constitutive relationships governing the transport of mass, heat, deformation, and chemical reaction are defined by various parameters, including permeability, porosity, temperature, and local stress state. One of the purposes of this study is to investigate the principal factors including the thermal, hydraulic, and mechanical effects in inducing the reactivation of pre-existing fractures. The seismicity induced from the reactivation of fractures and faults is influenced and triggered by different processes at different length and timescales. We explore these effects related to the timing of seismicity and the roles or effective stresses and thermal stresses in fractured reservoirs including the use of reactivation to control permeability evolution in a manner beneficial to thermal recovery in EGS reservoirs.\nThis dissertation comprises four chapters and an appendix.\nIn Chapter 1 we explore the propagation of fluid pressures and thermal stresses in a prototypical geothermal reservoir containing a centrally-located critically-stressed fault from a doublet injector and withdrawal well to define the likelihood, timing and magnitude of events triggered by both fluid pressures and thermal stresses. We define two bounding modes of fluid production from the reservoir. For injection at a given temperature, these bounding modes relate to either low- or high-relative flow rates. At low relative dimensionless flow rates the pressure pulse travels slowly, the pressure-driven changes in effective stress are muted, but thermal drawdown propagates through the reservoir as a distinct front. This results in the lowest likelihood of pressure-triggered events but the largest likelihood of late-stage thermally-triggered events. Conversely, at high relative non-dimensional flow rates the propagating pressure pulse is larger and migrates more quickly through the reservoir but the thermal drawdown is uniform across the reservoir and\niv\nwithout the presence of a distinct thermal front, and less capable of triggering late-stage\nseismicity.\nIn Chapter 2 we develop a dimensionless model to predict the thermal drawdown response, and\nquantify the relationship between the timing and magnitude of late stage seismic event and the\ninduced thermal stress from thermal drawdown. We evaluate the uniformity of thermal drawdown\nas a function of a dimensionless flow rate D Q that scales with fracture spacing s (m), injection\nrate q (kg/s), and the distance between the injector and the target point L\uf02a ( 2 / D Q qs L\uf02a \uf0b5 ). By\nassuming the dominant heat transfer by heat conduction within the fractured medium, this model\nis either capable to predict the timing of induced seismicity by the thermal stress by the analytical\nformula.\nDue to the significant influence of fracture network geometry in heat transfer and induced\nseismicity, a discrete fracture network model is developed (Chapter 3) to couple stress and fluid\nflow in a discontinuous fractured mass represented as a continuum by coupling the continuum\nsimulator TF_FLAC3D with cell-by-cell discontinuum laws for deformation and flow. Both\nequivalent medium crack and permeability tensor approaches are employed to characterize preexisting\ndiscrete fractures. The evolution of fracture permeability accommodates stress-dependent\naperture under different stress states, including normal closure, shear dilation, and for fracture\nwalls out of contact under tensile loading.\nThis discrete fracture network model is applied (Chapter 4) in a generic reservoir with an initial\npermeability in the range of 17 10\uf02d to 16 10\uf02d m2, fracture density of ~0.09m-1 and fractures oriented\nsuch that either none, one, or both sets of fractures are critically stressed. For a given reservoir\nwith a pre-existing fracture network, two parallel manifolds are stimulated that are analogous to\nhorizontal wells that allow a uniform sweep of fluids between the zones. The enhanced\nconnectivity that develops between the production zone and the injection zone significantly\nv\nenhances the heat sweep efficiency, while simultaneously increasing the fluid flux rate at the production well. For a 10m deep section of reservoir the resulting electric power production reaches a maximum of 14.5 MWe and is maintained over 10 years yielding cumulative energy recoveries that are a factor of 1.9 higher than for standard stimulation. Sensitivity analyses for varied fracture orientations and stimulation directions reveal that the direction of such manifolds used in the stimulation should be aligned closely with the orientation of the major principal stress, in order to create the maximum connectivity.\nIn the appendix, we explore a new mechanism in determining the breakdown pressure. Experiments on finite-length boreholes indicate that the breakdown pressure is a strong function of fracturing fluid composition and state as well. The reasons for this behavior are explored including the roles of different fluid types and state in controlling the breakdown process. The interfacial tension of the fracturing fluid is shown to control whether fluid invades pore space at the borehole wall and this in turn changes the local stress regime hence breakdown pressure. Interfacial tension is modulated by fluid state, as sub- or supercritical, and thus gas type and state influence the breakdown pressure.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11035], "author_name_tesi": "Gan, Quan ", "last_name_ssi": "Gan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Quan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth", "Jamal Rostami", "Shimin Liu", "Tong Qiu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Derek Elsworth, Dissertation Advisor", "Jamal Rostami, Committee Member", "Shimin Liu, Committee Member", "Tong Qiu, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Geothermal reservoir", "thermal front", "induced seismicity", "permeabiltiy evolution", "breakdown pressure"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "REGULATION OF HERG POTASSIUM CHANNELS: IMPLICATIONS OF GATING MODIFICATION FOR CANCER THERAPY\n", "id": "10448", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5517", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "HERG (Human ether-a-go-go Related Gene) potassium channel is well established as a regulator of cardiac repolarization. Many drugs were found to block HERG as an off target effect inducing unintended cardiac arrhythmias, resulting in their removal from the market. Therefore, HERG block is now being screened for all therapeutics going through drug development. Along with being a regulator of cardiac cycle, recent evidence has shown that HERG plays a role in cell proliferation and cancer progression in multiple tumor cell lines and primary tumor cells, making HERG an attractive target for cancer therapy. However, these multiple roles also present a challenge to find drugs that can block HERG in cancer cells, while not inducing cardiac arrhythmias. \nThis work is focused on two promising anti-neoplastic compounds, 1) R-roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that is in phase II clinical trials as an anticancer drug and 2) a sphingolipid, C6-ceramide, which due its pro-apoptotic effects, has shown promise in animals as a potential anticancer agent. Through a combination of electrophysiology, mathematical modeling, and biochemistry, the present study demonstrates that R-roscovitine, due to its extremely fast kinetics of HERG inhibition and open channel selectivity, can inhibit HERG current without an apparent increase in cardiac arrhythmias. C6-ceramide can also inhibit HERG, but via different mechanisms than R-roscovitine.  C6-ceramide has dual effects of i) inhibiting HERG and ii) affecting its gating kinetics. The gating changes involve acceleration of channel opening and closing and a hyperpolarzing shift in the voltage dependence of activation, and these changes are mediated by a movement of the channels into the membrane lipid rafts, which are structured lipid microdomains that co-localize important signaling proteins. While the HERG inhibition presumably contributes to ceramide\u2019s anticancer potency, the combination of gating effects and inhibition may reduce the potential negative effect of C6-ceramide on cardiac rhythm. \nThese two different molecules, acting by two independent mechanisms, provide new perspectives in cancer therapy by demonstrating that HERG channels may be exploited as a target for anti-neoplastic treatment with little or no increase in negative cardiovascular side effects. Also, most high-throughput drug screening techniques utilize HERG inhibition as the criteria for the exclusion of the molecule from further drug development. This study demonstrates that along with HERG current inhibition, changes in gating kinetics also need to be taken into account. Gating changes may be able to offset the effects of HERG inhibition on the cardiac action potential, thereby providing the cancer selectivity.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5508], "author_name_tesi": "Ganapathi, Sindura B", "last_name_ssi": "Ganapathi", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Sindura", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Mark Kester", "Mark Kester", "Keith S Elmslie", "Blaise Peterson", "Melvin Lee Billingsley", "Kent Eugene Vrana"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Mark Kester, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Kester, Committee Chair", "Keith S Elmslie, Committee Chair", "Blaise Peterson, Committee Member", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["sphingolipids", "roscovitine", "lipid rafts", "patch clamp"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Tuning Filler Shape, Surface Chemistry and Ion Content in Nano-filled Polymer Electrolytes.", "id": "22394", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10094", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We investigate how nanofiller surface chemistry and aspect ratio affect the performance of nanofilled solid polymer electrolytes. Polymer-based electrolytes are an attractive alternative to the flammable, volatile, and toxic organic electrolytes currently used in lithium ion batteries. Despite their advantages, polymer electrolytes suffer from low room temperature ionic conductivities (10-8 to 10-6 S/cm, target for device applications ~ 10-3 -10-2 S/cm) and low modulus (1-10 MPa, target to prevent dendrite formation ~ 6 GPa). Spherical ceramic fillers are known to improve conductivity and mechanical properties of polymer electrolytes. However the mechanism by which nanoparticles enhance conductivity is not clearly understood. If we can understand this mechanism, we can tailor the filler-electrolyte design to obtain highly conducting matrices. \nTo understand this mechanism, we characterize acidic nanoparticle filled electrolytes and compare them to neutral particle-filled electrolytes previously measured in our lab. Dielectric spectroscopy measurements indicate that the highest increase in conductivity occurs at the eutectic composition (EO/Li=10) and is independent of filler surface chemistry. Because lithium ion conduction depends on polymer segmental dynamics, we measure PEO dynamics using quasi-elastic neutron scattering and do not observe any change in polymer dynamics with particle surface chemistry. When we examine the elastic incoherent structure factor associated with the rotational process, fillers are found to restrict the rotation of the highly conducting PEO6:LiClO4 tunnels. At the eutectic composition, these tunnels are stabilized at the filler surface even above PEO melting temperature. Marginal stability theory predicts formation of alternating layers of coexisting phases at the eutectic composition. To explain these trends, we propose a new mechanism, via stabilization of alternating layers of PEO and highly conducting PEO6:LiClO4 tunnels at the filler surface. \nWhen compared to spherical particles, more such structures would be stabilized at a filler surface with high aspect ratio. Consistent with this hypothesis, neutral gamma-Al2O3 nanowhiskers (2-4 nm in diameter and 200-400 nm in length) intensify the effect of neutral gamma-Al2O3 nanoparticles. The diameters of the two fillers are similar, but the change in aspect ratio (1 to 100) improves conductivity by a factor of 5. Interestingly, this enhancement occurs at battery operation temperatures! Although the change in aspect ratio does not affect thermal transitions and segmental dynamics at optimal whisker loading, the rotation of PEO6 remnants is distinct at the eutectic composition. Rotation geometry is described by a combination of two EISF models- one that describes more restricted layers immediately next to the whisker surface and the second pertains to the subsequent less-restricted layers. Thus multiple layers are stabilized at the longer whisker surface and provide larger increase in conductivity than the particles.  \nBecause the mechanism by which nanofillers enhance conductivity is related to stabilization of conducting structures at the filler-electrolyte interface, we determine the interface morphology using neutron reflectometry. For this, we spin-coat the unfilled electrolytes EO/Li = 8, 10 on sapphire substrate, which has the same surface chemistry as \uf061-Al2O3. When freshly-spin coated on sapphire substrate, the non-eutectic sample does not exhibit any segregation of layers. Interestingly, the freshly spin-coated eutectic sample forms layers with alternating high and low salt concentrations, very similar to the eutectic lamellae predicted by the marginal stability theory for eutectic solidification. Surprisingly, such lamellae do not develop further when the sample is annealed at eutectic temperature and the salt concentration in the polymer decreases gradually away from the surface of sapphire.\nTo take fullest advantage of the surface mechanism and obtain larger increases in conductivity we tailor the aspect ratio of high aspect ratio fillers. Commercial availability of alumina nanowhiskers is limited to neutral surface chemistry and aspect ratio of 100, cellulose nanowhiskers provide a model system where a wide range of surface chemistries may be accessed with variable aspect ratio. We synthesized cellulose whiskers of two different aspect ratios [cotton whiskers: aspect ratio \u0334 10, acetobacter whiskers: aspect ratio \u0334 200] and tested their influence on conductivity and morphology of polymer electrolytes. Similar to all fillers studied in this work, both types of cellulose whiskers provide highest increase in conductivity at the eutectic composition, with the longer acetobacter whiskers providing a marginally higher increase than the cotton whiskers. Although both cellulose whiskers do not alter the crystallinity or glass transition temperature at the optimal 1 wt% loading, they amplify the faint cold crystallization behavior observed in the unfilled eutectic electrolyte without changing the overall crystallinity. At the non-eutectic compositions, cellulose whiskers behave similar to the acidic nanoparticles. \nTo determine the function of nanofillers in entire composition range of the phase diagram, we extend the range of measurements on the nanofilled PEO+LiClO4 electrolyte to EO/Li = 4 to 100. Because PEO+LiAsF6 electrolytes have similar phase diagram as the PEO+LiClO4 electrolytes, we augment the study of nanofilled PEO+LiAsF6 complexes to the PEO+LiClO4 electrolytes. At compositions near the high and low ends of the phase diagram, the effect of nanofillers on conductivity is governed by reduction in crystallinity of PEO and PEO-salt complexes. In the absence of PEO6, fillers interact directly with PEO and suppress crystallization. This is consistent with our findings from reflectometry experiment where sapphire surface prefers to interact with the salt-rich layers. Around the eutectic composition fillers restrict the highly conducting PEO6 complex at their surface and any increase in conductivity is due to stabilization of these conducting tunnels. For room temperature applications, lithium hexafluoroarsenate seems to be the better salt than lithium perchlorate. At temperatures higher than the eutectic temperature (50 \u2103), conductivity levels off at the value set by the eutectic composition. \nTo sum up, we suggest a mechanism by which nanoparticles increase conductivity of polymer electrolytes in a range of compositions, and extend this mechanism to obtain high room temperature conductivities via high aspect ratio fillers.\n", "semester_ssi":

of fundamental importance to human biology. Findings are unequivocal in linking the deficiency of selenium to conditions with increased oxidative stress and inflammation. Epidemiological studies suggest that supranutritional intake of selenium may be associated with a reduced risk of cancers. Many of these beneficial effects of selenium are thought to be due to the action of selenoproteins, which collectively form a part of the cellular antioxidant defense system. But the exact molecular mechanisms involved in these actions are still to be defined. The primary objective of this study is to understand the mechanisms associated with the anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic effects of selenium, which would form the basis for exploring the role of supplemental selenium as a potential therapeutic agent. \nUsing a combination of in vitro and ex vivo models, the anti-inflammatory action of selenium was dissected with a focus on the regulation of the arachidonic acid (AA) - cyclooxygenase (COX) metabolism pathway. Supplementation of macrophages with supra-physiological levels of selenium showed that the AA was preferentially metabolized to electrophilic metabolites of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). These include \u039412-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2, which are structurally classified as cyclopentenone PGs (CyPGs). Interestingly, these lipid metabolites impacted the expression of downstream PG synthases via the differential modulation of two transcription factors, nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) to activate the expression of hematopoietic PGD2 synthase (H-PGDS), and suppress that of microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1). As a result, LPS-stimulation of Se-supplemented macrophages produced high levels of CyPGs when compared to the Se-deficient macrophages, while the levels of pro-inflammatory PGE2 were suppressed. \nTo relate these effects in vivo, well-established models of murine leukemia were used, where the infection of progenitor cells with Friend erythroleukemia virus (FV), or expression of a fusion oncogene, BCR-ABL, in the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) led to the development of the disease through the formation of leukemic stem cells (LSCs). Se-supplemented mice were completely resistant to the disease, while Se-deficient and Se-adequate mice succumbed to leukemia. Treatment of Se-supplemented mice with a COX inhibitor, indomethacin, blunted the protective effect of selenium, while the administration of 15d-PGJ2 to these mice rescued them. Further analysis showed that supplementation with selenium selectively targeted the LSCs for apoptosis via p53 pathway activation, without any effects on normal HSCs. \nIn a related study to examine the role of electrophilic compounds of natural origin, a botanical with anti-inflammatory properties, gambogic acid (GA), was demonstrated to inhibit NF-\u03baB activation by forming covalent Michael adduct with 179Cys in a key enzyme, inhibitor of kappa B kinase \u03b2 (IKK\u03b2). This is similar to that previously reported with the endogenously produced 15d-PGJ2. \nTaken together, the studies included in this thesis suggest that anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds can activate pathways of resolution by shunting AA-COX metabolism towards increased production of CyPGs, which can potentially affect the survival and/or proliferation of LSCs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7184], "author_name_tesi": "Gandhi, Ujjawal Hitendra", "last_name_ssi": "Gandhi", "middle_name_ssi": "Hitendra", "first_name_ssi": "Ujjawal", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular Toxicology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kumble Sandeep Prabhu", "Robert Paulson", "Dr Jack Vanden Heuvel", "Shantu G Amin", "Dr Ramesh Ramachandran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kumble Sandeep Prabhu, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Dr Jack Vanden Heuvel, Committee Member", "Shantu G Amin, Committee Member", "Dr Ramesh Ramachandran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Selenium", "leukemia", "15d-prostaglandin J2", "gambogic acid", "arachidonic acid", "inflammation", "leukemia stem cell", "BCR-ABL", "H-PGDS"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Diffusion of Prescription Drugs for Alzheimer's disease among Medicare Beneficiaries\n\n\n", "id": "10279", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1236", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is centered on Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), the most common type of dementia that is characterized by memory loss and inability to carry on everyday activities. While there is no cure for AD, five drugs have been approved to date for the management of Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms. The first AD drug Cognex\u00ae, became available in 1993. Subsequent AD drugs, Aricept\u00ae, Exelon\u00ae, Reminyl\u00ae, and Namenda\u00ae were introduced in 1996, 2000, 2002 and 2003 respectively. New drug treatments for AD offer the opportunity to study diffusion of a new technology and its impact on health care disparities and health care costs. There is little nationally representative information available on individuals who use AD drugs. This study explored several issues related to AD prevalence, costs and treatment among older adults.\nThere were three main objectives of this dissertation. The first objective was to determine the trends in the prevalence of AD, the use of AD drugs, and spending by Medicare beneficiaries with AD. The second objective was to determine the factors influencing AD drug treatment of Medicare beneficiaries over time during the study period. The third objective was to determine the disparities in use of AD drugs among Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe data used for the study includes both survey and claims data of beneficiaries from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey from years 1993 to 2003. The conceptual models used included a modified version of the Roger\u2019s diffusion model and the Institute of Medicine\u2019s disparities model. Analysis for the first research objective was primarily descriptive. Linear probability models were used to estimate predictors of AD drug use and Oaxaca decomposition methods were used to estimate disparities in AD drug use among Medicare beneficiaries with AD.\nDescriptive analysis showed that beneficiaries who were diagnosed with AD grew by 70 percent between 1993 and 2003. The use of AD drugs among beneficiaries with AD grew 100-fold during the study period. Aricept\u00ae was the most widely used drug, and contributed to about 80 percent of the total AD drug use in 2003. The mean total spending on all prescription drugs (including AD drugs) by Medicare beneficiaries with AD was $2,308 in 2003, a three-fold increase over mean spending in 1993. The mean spending on AD drugs alone increased by 400 percent; from $157 in 1993 to $803 in 2003. \nRegression models determined that blacks, rural beneficiaries and those with higher incomes were not less likely to receive AD drug treatment compared with whites, urban beneficiaries and those with lower incomes, respectively. Analysis of time trends indicated that AD drug use is likely to increase over time among Medicare beneficiaries. Differences in AD drug use over time were observed by race and metro status across individuals. However, no significant differences were observed in AD drug use over time by income categories. Models estimating disparities in AD drug use indicated that significant racial and income disparities existed in AD drug use among Medicare beneficiaries. However, no significant rural-urban disparities in AD drug use were observed. \nThis dissertation provides health policy makers with an understanding of how health care access, technology, costs and disease prevalence may be related when using health care claims data. It has important implications for persons with AD and their families, disparities research, and government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid Health services researchers can build on this study and identify potential areas of research to influence policy decisions and health care practice.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1225], "author_name_tesi": "Ganesh, Chandrakala ", "last_name_ssi": "Ganesh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chandrakala", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis G Shea", "Dennis G Shea", "Pamela Farley Short", "Rhonda Belue", "Donna Marie Fick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis G Shea, Dissertation Advisor", "Dennis G Shea, Committee Chair", "Pamela Farley Short, Committee Member", "Rhonda Belue, Committee Member", "Donna Marie Fick, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Medicare", "Alzheimers disease", "diffusion", "prescription drugs"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Multipartite states and Luttinger liquids of composite fermions", "id": "15269", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7748", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Materials exhibiting exotic quantum phenomena at a macroscopic level are of great\n interest because of its intrinsic value to Physics, and also because of its potential\n applications in technology. Strongly correlated electronic systems form interesting\n examples of these. Exploring them calls for a good understanding of its physics,\n and development of new tools that are applicable to their analysis. Robustness\n of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) makes it an ideal stage to study\nstrongly correlated electron systems. The complexity of the FQHE problem stems\n directly from the strong interactions between the constituent particles and not\n from the specific nature of the material it is implemented in. This work attempts\n to gain a theoretical description of some of the less understood aspects of FQHE.\n \n\nFQHE in the lowest Landau level is well understood using the theory of weakly\n interacting emergent particles called composite fermions. Composite fermions\n formed in the second Landau level however appear to be strongly interacting.\n Of particular interest is the FQHE at 2 + 1/2 filling fraction, where the many body\n ground state is believed to be described by a paired state of composite fermions,\n represented by the Pfaffian wavefunction. Based on predicted properties of its\n excitations, there has been proposals for implementing topological quantum com-\nputations in this system. However a good understanding of the nature of these\n excitations is still lacking.\n \n\nThis thesis introduces a class of many body wavefunctions called \u201cbipartite\n composite fermion states\u201d that provide a unified description of all excitations of the\n paired state at 5/2. In the bipartite composite fermion (BCF) picture, constituent\n composite fermions split into two partitions which are correlated to each other.\n Within each partition, they fill the lowest composite fermion Landau level of its\n partition.\n \n\nProperties of the BCF state can now be related to the properties of the individual partitions, which are well understood in terms of the composite fermion\n theory. In particular, we show that the excitations of BCF states are obtained by\n creating excitations in the individual partitions. The paired state with odd number of composite fermions should have an unpaired composite fermion. The BCF\n model predicts that this unpaired composite fermion behaves as an exciton in the\n quasiparticle and quasihole are in separate partitions. We confirm this prediction\n numerically in finite size systems. Generalizations of bipartite composite fermion\n functions to other filling fractions especially 2 + 4/7 and 2 + 3/5 are also studied.\n \n\nIdea of bipartite composite fermions can be generalized to the case of more\n partitions. Specifically, we look at tripartite composite fermion states which are\n similar to the bipartite states, except that these have three correlated partitions\n instead of two. Tripartite states have a filling fraction of \u03bd = 3/5, and its particle\n hole conjugate is a candidate wavefunction for describing the \u03bd = 2 + 2/5 FQHE.\n Numerical comparisons of these \u201cmultipartite\u201d composite fermion states with exact\n spectrum of finite systems show that these states give a very good description of\n the low energy spectra of the corresponding systems.\n \n\nAnother interesting aspect of the FQH system is the realization of a chiral\n Luttinger liquid at the edge of an incompressible state. Effective field theory description of the system makes a non-trivial prediction that tunnelling exponents,\n which can be experimentally measured, are quantized. Starting from the composite fermion theory, we develop a microscopic model for the edge of the \u03bd = 2/5\n filling fraction. The 2/5 edge has composite fermions occupying lowest two composite fermion Landau levels each of which contributes to the edge excitations. The\n existance of two modes causes the edge spectrum to split into quasi-degenerate\n sectors of states with each sector representing a specific distribution of the composite fermions in the two levels. Calculations show that in the low energy limit,\n an electron tunnelling into the edge of the system enters as a composite fermion\n in one of the two composite fermion Landau levels, without moving any composite\n fermions between the two levels. This microscopic model is compared with an\n effective field theory description of the edge. With the assumption of a simplified\n edge dispersion relation, it is shown that the microscopic model is equivalent to\nthe effective two boson model in the thermodynamic limit.\n ", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7681], "author_name_tesi": "Ganesh Jaya, Sreejith ", "last_name_ssi": "Ganesh Jaya", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sreejith", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain", "Jainendra Jain", "Vincent Henry Crespi", "David Scott Weiss", "Murat Gunaydin", "Kirsten A Eisentrager"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain, Dissertation Advisor", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Chair", "Vincent Henry Crespi, Committee Member", "David Scott Weiss, Committee Member", "Murat Gunaydin, Committee Member", "Kirsten A Eisentrager, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FQHE", "Composite-fermions", "bipartite-composite-fermions"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Analysis of Bridge Performance under the Combined Effect of Earthquake and Flood-induced Scour\n", "id": "11865", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2107", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Earthquake in the presence of flood-induced scour is a critical multihazard scenario for bridges located in seismically-active, flood-prone regions of the United States. Bridge scour causes loss of lateral support at bridge foundations and results in increased seismic vulnerability of bridges. The present study evaluates the combined effect of earthquake and flood-induced scour on the performance of four example reinforced concrete bridges with different number of spans. For the analysis, Sacramento County in California is considered as the study region where the annual probabilities of occurrence of earthquakes and floods are reasonably high. The seismic hazard of the study region is considered through a suite of ground motion time histories which were generated for this region. Regional flood hazard is expressed in the form of a flood hazard curve that provides the annual peak discharges corresponding to flood events with various annual exceedance probabilities. Bridge scour, an outcome of the flood events, are calculated and used in the development of finite element models of these bridges. Nonlinear time-history analyses are preformed to evaluate the seismic performance of the example bridges having scour at bridge piers. In parallel, analyses are performed to evaluate bridge seismic performance in the absence of scour. Fragility curves are developed to represent the performance of example bridges under this multihazard scenario. Comparison of bridge fragility characteristics obtained in the presence and absence of scour presents the increased seismic vulnerability of the bridges in the presence of flood-induced scour.  The study identifies the most sensitive range of bridge scour for which the rate of degradation of bridge seismic performance is significant.\n\tA sensitivity study is performed to investigate the influence of various input parameters on the overall performance of the example bridges. For this, the 5-span example bridge is chosen to analyze under a 100-year flood event. Risk curves of this example bridge are developed that determine annual probability of exceeding different levels of societal loss arising from bridge seismic damage in the presence and absence of flood-induced scour. This societal loss is measured in terms of post-event bridge repair/restoration cost. Results show that the seismic risk of the example bridge may increase significantly in the presence of scour.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2088], "author_name_tesi": "Ganesh Prasad, Gautham ", "last_name_ssi": "Ganesh Prasad", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gautham", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Swagata Banerjee", "Dr Swagata Banerjee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Swagata Banerjee, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Swagata Banerjee, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["bridge scour", "reinforce concrete bridges", "Regional multihazard", "earthquake"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "A first-principles study of elastic and diffusion properties of Magnesium based alloys\n\n\n", "id": "11593", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5948", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, the influence of alloying elements on the elastic and diffusion properties of Magnesium (Mg) has been studied based on first-principles density functional theory.

The transverse extent of the absorbing structures are either smaller than the projected size of the UV continuum source or lie relatively close so that photons can be\nscattered around the absorber and into the line of sight.\n\nIt is likely that there has been evolution in the number density of strong associated systems such that they are largely absent at low redshift.

In radio-loud QSOs where the disk is oriented face-on (i.e, radio core dominated, flat radio spectrum), associated absorption only appears when the CIV emission line FWHM is large (>6,000 km/s). In radio-quiet QSOs, there is a significant excess of associated weak absorbers in the soft X-ray weak subset.\n\nIn the select few cases where high resolution spectra exist, it appears that the kinematics of strong and weak absorbers are different. Strong absorbers tend to have smooth troughs indicative\nof a wind. Weak absorbers tend to have structure implying that the absorbing medium is clumpy along the line of sight. Given the difference between strong and weak associated NALs, it is likely that these form different populations of absorbers.\n\nThere is likely to be a dynamical link between the gas producing intrinsic NALs and the gas producing the broad emission lines.

The healthcare domain is no exception. Healthcare organizations collect and maintain data from different stages of care provided to each and every patient. This starts with the collection of general demographic and disease history at patient check-in, followed by clinical and laboratory information during treatment and finally follow-up and medical histories. In addition to patient data, huge amounts of medical literature and genome-wide data such as DNA sequences, protein sequences etc. are maintained. Managing this enormous information content is a daunting task for healthcare organizations. In this dissertation, we explore two key challenges faced in healthcare data management: 1. Data Privacy, and 2. Data Warehousing. \n\nIn the first and primary part, we take up the problem of data privacy. Data collected by healthcare organizations consists of sensitive information such as disease diagnosis etc. which should not be used or made available for non-medical purposes. However, such data needs to be disseminated and distributed by healthcare organizations to promote research, disease studies etc. While the dissemination and distribution of this information is beneficial, patient privacy is of foremost concern. Hence, privacy preserving dissemination of information becomes an important problem. In this dissertation, we focus on privacy preserving mechanisms for two specific dissemination scenarios: a) Data publishing, and b) Data sharing. In data publishing, we consider the challenge posed by what has come to be known as emph{auxiliary information} in the research community. The problem occurs when sensitive data is published in an anonymized version, and a potential adversary uses this version of data to collect auxiliary information from other sources and then infers hidden sensitive information. Our contribution to this problem scenario is to introduce a new class of attacks based on auxiliary information called the emph{information fusion based privacy attacks}, where, an adversary fuses auxiliary information gathered with published anonymized releases to cause a privacy breach. We model two instances of such attacks: 1. Independent Release Based Attack, and 2. Web Based Attack. Our investigation on the effects of these attacks proves that a large class of existing solutions are indeed vulnerable in such scenarios. On the other hand, in the data sharing scenario, we consider the problem of privacy policy regulated data sharing among healthcare organizations. The problem here is that organizations may need to share sensitive data while following potentially conflicting privacy policies. We identify the properties of this problem with respect to the current healthcare system and design a solution based on the novel idea of sticky privacy policies. \n\nIn the second part, we take up the problem of data warehousing. Healthcare data is distributed among multiple organizational entities such as hospitals, clinical labs, research centers and government agencies that are controlled independently. This hinders the availability of such valuable data to researchers, who end up with only islands of data. This scenario poses a serious challenge for a global study of the disease. Furthermore, data mining and knowledge discovery on these islands of data leads to limited results as the data does not capture intrinsic relationships among these inter-related sources. This brings out the need for data warehouse platforms that offer single-point access to patient, clinical, and genomic data from multiple sources and fusion based knowledge discovery tools that mine multiple inter-related data sets through information fusion. In the final part of this dissertation, we present one such system, FUZEBASE, that delivers these functionalities for cancer research data as part of a consortium of cancer centers in the state of Pennsylvania.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5757], "author_name_tesi": "Ganta, Srivatsava Ranjit ", "last_name_ssi": "Ganta", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Srivatsava Ranjit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raj Acharya", "Raj Acharya", "Adam Smith", "Ganapati P Patil", "Robert Collins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raj Acharya, Dissertation Advisor", "Raj Acharya, Committee Chair", "Adam Smith, Committee Chair", "Ganapati P Patil, Committee Member", "Robert Collins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Information Fusion", "Anonymization", "Privacy", "Auxiliary Information"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "HEINER M\u00dcLLER AND THE GESCHICHTSDRAMA:\nSEARCHING FOR A NEW GERMAN IDENTITY\nIN THE POST-WORLD WAR II (GERMANIA TOD IN BERLIN) AND POST-REUNIFICATION ERAS\n(GERMANIA 3 GESPENSTER AM TOTEN MANN)", "id": "6635", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6242", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-04-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates Heiner M\u00fcller's search for post-World War II and post-reunification German identity as depicted in his GESCHICHTSDRAMEN, GERMANIA TOD IN BERLIN in Berlin (1956/1971) and GERMANIA 3 GESPENSTER AM TOTEN MANN (1996), respectively.

Classical ablation theory, which assumes intensive evaporation following a temperature rise up to about 2000K, does not explain meteoroid-produced ionization at high altitudes. Sputtering, however, has been proposed as an explanation of high altitude ionization and luminosity, which are not explained by the classical ablation theory. Sputtering is the direct ejection of the particles from the material due to meteoroid surface bombardment by energetic incoming particles in meteoroid frame of reference and is not connected with the surface heating. The data collected from April 15/16, 2010 observations appear to confirm the existence of such high altitude meteor events.\n      The Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO) main 50 MHz array radar system with multiple receivers was used to study meteors using various interferometric configurations. For such an array radar system to perform as desired, it is essential to precisely calibrate the amplitude and phase of each element channel as considerable amplitude and phase differences among the channels can occur. Thus, one of the major challenges in interferometry is to know the phase offsets and amplitude differences between each individual interferometric receiving channel-pairs. Undesired phase offsets and amplitude differences are intrinsic to any such system, and they could be caused by all of the RF hardware such as antenna elements, attenuators, amplifiers, dividers, combiners, switches, connectors, transmission lines, etc. \n      In response to investigating some ambiguous features in analysis of possible high-altitude meteor head-echoes, a \u201cnew\u201d calibration technique is presented here which employs satellites to produce accurate phase and amplitude calibrations. Since a satellite can generally be considered a point target, the characteristics of its return resemble those of a meteor head-echo in many ways. Thus satellite returns can be used to test characteristics of the JRO interferometry process, as the path of the satellite across the beam is a deterministic gravitational orbit. The satellite radar return across the radar beam yields a reliable source for phase and amplitude calibration of the beam.

Classical ablation theory, which assumes intensive evaporation following a temperature rise up to about 2000K, does not explain meteoroid-produced ionization at high altitudes where the atmosphere is rather thin. The mechanism for ionization at high-altitudes still remains an open question.\n\nWhen it comes to high-altitude radar meteors (HARMs) experiment, there are three types of ambiguity issues: range ambiguity, Doppler speed ambiguity, and angle-of-arrival ambiguity. Range and Doppler speed ambiguities are related to the length of Inter-Pulse-Period (IPP), but interconnected. Range ambiguity is proportional to the length of IPP. In order to increase the unambiguous range, the length of IPP must be increased. Doppler speed ambiguity, however, is inversely proportional to the length of IPP. Consequently, a tradeoff must be made between range and Doppler speed ambiguities in terms of choosing the length of IPP. A new technique employed in this HARM observation experiment\u2014Alternating Inter-Pulse-Periods (AIPPs)\u2014enables us the resolve these two problems at the same time, without compromising one or the other. Additionally, for radar system with interferometric baselines larger than half of its operating wavelength, such as at Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO), angle-of-arrival ambiguity is introduced in the determination of angular positions of detected targets. Therefore, high-altitude radar meteors are usually interpreted as sidelobe contaminations with large ranges but lower altitudes. A new unambiguous, multi-baseline interferometric technique was recently employed for meteor observations at JRO for the first time. It yielded the true angle-of-arrival of HARM events. All these advanced techniques facilitate more accurate data interpretation and better understanding of the physics behind meteor-related phenomena. \n\nThe data presented herein are collected from August 4/5, 2014 experiment utilizing novel observing strategies to confirm the existence of high altitude radar meteors.  In these observations a sequence of four alternating IPPs, 1723 \u03bcs, 1733 \u03bcs, 1747 \u03bcs, and 1759 \u03bcs, was used. The AIPP technique unambiguously recovered the instantaneous Doppler speeds of fast-moving meteor head echoes. The radar transmission was from two quarter-arrays sharing a common diagonal in the East-West direction. Signal reception was via three, quarter-array (Q) receivers and three adjacent (M) module receivers all of the same polarization. One extra quarter-array receiver of perpendicular polarization was also employed to monitor crosstalk. This arrangement offered the usual Q-Q and M-M interferometric baseline-pairs as well as new Q-M baselines that were rotated ~6\u00b0 from the Q-Q and M-M baselines. For relatively high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) meteors, this new radar configuration yields ambiguity resolution to the horizon and confirms the existence of HARM events.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13533], "author_name_tesi": "Gao, Boyi ", "last_name_ssi": "Gao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Boyi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John David Mathews", "John David Mathews", "Julio Urbina", "Victor P Pasko", "David Bradley Spencer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John David Mathews, Dissertation Advisor", "John David Mathews, Committee Chair", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "Victor P Pasko, Committee Member", "David Bradley Spencer, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["High-Altitude Radar Meteors", "Alternating Interpulse Period", "Multi-Basline Interferometry"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "PREHENSION SYNERGIES: \nSTATIC AND DYNAMIC EXAMINATIONS\n", "id": "6614", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1973", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The human hand is an amazing and delicate device; its beauty of dexterity deserves extensive study.

In this dissertation, customized manipulandums were used to explore the prehension synergy. The existence of prehension synergy was tested and examined in both static and dynamic tasks. The specific purposes of the investigation of static tasks were: (1) to examine digital force coordination when both external torques and object geometry are varied; (2) to develop and test an artificial neural network model to explore the theory on hierarchical control of prehension; (3) to examine a hypothesis on the principle of superposition in human prehension; (4) to examine if there is a multi-finger synergy stabilizing the direction of the total force. The specific purposes of the investigation of dynamic tasks were:  (1) to examine the differential effects of inertia and gravity forces on the grip force-load force relation under voluntary object manipulation; (2) to examine the internal forces acting on the object when the object is manipulated in different directions \u00a8C vertical, horizontal or diagonal; (3) to examine the control of finger forces and  rotational equilibrium during object manipulation with prescribed torques The following aspects associated with prehension synergy had been revealed: (a) prehension was organized in a hierarchical fashion; (b) changes of task parameters result in chain effects; (c) principle of superposition was valid in both static and dynamic tasks; (d) grip force was adjusted to the gravity and load forces differently; (e) internal force was coupled with manipulation force; (f) mechanical advantage hypothesis was supported in both static and dynamic tasks; (g) anticipation is a major characteristic feature of human prehension in self-generated actions.

(TGF?) is the prototype for a superfamily of related members.  TGF? family signaling controls various fundamental cellular functions, including cell proliferation and migration.  Alterations in the TGF? signaling pathways have been implicated in a vast array of human cancers and other diseases as well.  Despite advances in our understanding of TGF? signaling transduction, the mechanism of the multifunctional TGF? signaling is not completely clear yet.  Therefore, further studies are required for deeper understanding of its diverse biological responses.  DYNLRB1 was identified in the laboratory through a screen for TGF? receptor-interacting proteins, and it is also a dynein light chain.  Dynein is molecular motor that plays many important functions in the cell.  I hypothesized that DYNLRB family dynein light chains may play important specific functions in TGF? signaling.  In this thesis, we investigated the regulation of the function of DYNLRB dynein light chains by TGF? and their role in TGF? signaling in mammalian cells and in primary zebrafish (Danio rerio) ovarian follicle cells.\n\nThe experiments in Chapter 2 aimed to determine the involvement of DYNLRB1 in TGF? signaling and characterizing the function of DYNLRB1.  The results from this chapter have demonstrated that the phosphorylation of DYNLRB1 on serine residues is stimulated by TGF? in Cos-1 cells and requires T?RII.  It is further demonstrated that DYNLRB1 expression knockdown significantly impaired TGF?-induced fibronectin expression in MDCK cells.  TGF?-induced DYNLRB1phosphorylation has been shown to be responsible for its recruitment to the dynein motor complex.  Therefore, these results indicate a potential role for DYNLRB1 as a TGF? signaling intermediate, and its requirement in TGF? induction of fibronectin (a major component of the extracellular matrix), which plays important roles in cell adhesion, migration and differentiation.\n\nThe experiments in Chapter 3 was designed to test the hypothesis that DYNLRB2 might be involved in Smad3-dependent TGF? signaling.  Human DYNLRB2 is 77% identical to human DYNLRB1.  Results in Chapter 3 have demonstrated that TGF? induction of SBE2-Luc, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression in HaCaT cells and of Smad7-Luc in Hep3B cells, is significantly impaired, after blocking endogenous DYNLRB2 expression by siRNA.  It is known that the induction of these genes is Smad3-dependent signaling event.  However, similar blocking of DYNLRB2 expression does not inhibit the induction of ARE-Lux by TGF?, which has been demonstrated to be Smad2-dependent signaling event.  Therefore, these results suggest that DYNLRB2 is specifically required in Smad3-dependent signaling.  Further, it is demonstrated that TGF?-stimulated preferential interaction between DYNLRB2 and Smad3 may be the underlying mechanism for the requirement of DYNLRB2 in Smad3-dependent TGF? signaling.  In addition, results have shown that TGF? stimulated a rapid recruitment of the DYNLRB2 to the dynein complex, and the TGF?-induced phosphorylation of DYNLRB2 is responsible for this TGF? stimulated recruitment.  Collectively, results in this Chapter have demonstrated for the first time that DYNLRB2 is required for Smad3-dependent TGF? signaling.\n\nThe experiments in Chapter 4 tested our hypothesis that in zebrafish ovarian follicle cells the function of zDYNLRB might be regulated by TGF?, and zDYNLRB might play an important role in TGF? signaling in such cells.  It is shown that zDYNLRB is rapidly phosphorylated after TGF? stimulation, for which the T?RII is required.  In addition, it is shown that the phosphorylation of zDYNLRB facilitates its rapid recruitment to the dynein complex, which is stimulated by TGF?.  Knockdown experiments in zOFCs by morpholino have demonstrated that zDYNLRB was required for TGF? induction of TRE-Luc, 3TP-Lux and ARE-Lux.  Thus, the results suggest a potential role for zDYNLRB in TGF? signaling in zebrafish ovarian follicle cells.\n\nCollectively, the experiments in this thesis demonstrated for the first time a requirement of DYNLRB2 dynein light chain in Smad3-dependent TGF? signaling in mammalian cells, and a requirement of DYNLRB1 as a potential TGF? signaling component in TGF? induction of fibronectin, respectively, as well as potential role for zDYNLRB in TGF? signaling in zebrafish ovarian follicle cells.  However, the physiological significance of their functions needs to be addressed in vivo in the future.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2133], "author_name_tesi": "Gao, Guofeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Gao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Guofeng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Bronson", "Keith C Cheng", "Mark Kester", "Jiyue Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Bronson, Committee Chair", "Keith C Cheng, Committee Member", "Mark Kester, Committee Member", "Jiyue Zhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DYNLRB", "dynein light chain", "TGFbeta"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "ULTRASONIC GUIDED WAVE MECHANICS \nFOR COMPOSITE MATERIAL STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING \n", "id": "7515", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2269", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ultrasonic guided wave based method is very promising for structural health monitoring of aging and modern aircraft. An understanding of wave mechanics becomes very critical for exploring the potential of this technology. However, the guided wave mechanics in complex structures, especially composite materials, are very challenging due to the nature of multi-layer, anisotropic, and viscoelastic behavior. \nThe purpose of this thesis is to overcome the challenges and potentially take advantage of the complex wave mechanics for advanced sensor design and signal analysis. Guided wave mechanics is studied in three aspects, namely wave propagation, excitation, and damage sensing.  A 16 layer quasi-isotropic composite with a [(0/45/90/-45)s]2 lay up sequence is used in our study. \n First, a hybrid semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) and global matrix method (GMM) is used to simulate guided wave propagation in composites. Fast and accurate simulation is achieved by using SAFE for dispersion curve generation and GMM for wave structure calculation. Secondly, the normal mode expansion (NME) technique is used for the first time to study the wave excitation characteristics in laminated composites. A clear and simple definition of wave excitability is put forward as a result of NME analysis. Source influence for guided wave excitation is plotted as amplitude on a frequency and phase velocity spectrum. This spectrum also provides a guideline for transducer design in guided wave excitation. The ultrasonic guided wave excitation characteristics in viscoelastic media are also studied for the first time using a modified normal mode expansion technique. Thirdly, a simple physically based feature is developed to estimate the guided wave sensitivity to damage in composites. Finally, a fuzzy logic decision program is developed to perform mode selection through a quantitative evaluation of the wave propagation, excitation and sensitivity features. \n\tNumerical simulation algorithms are validated with both finite element analyses and laboratory experiments. For the quasi-isotropic composite, it is found that the ultrasonic wave propagation characteristics are not always quasi-isotropic. The directional dependence is very significant at high frequency and higher order wave modes. Mode separation between Rayleigh-Lamb type and Shear Horizontal type guided waves is not possible. In addition, guided wave modes along one dispersion curve line could have a significant difference in wave structure. Therefore, instead of using traditional symmetric, antisymmetric, and SH notation, a new notation is used to identify the dispersion curves in a numerical order. Wave modes with a skew angle larger than 30 degrees can exist in a quasi-isotropic composite plate, which is validated by both FEM and experiment. At low frequency, the first wave mode has higher sensitivity than that of the third wave mode. However, the attenuation of the first wave mode is higher than that of the third wave mode. The mode selection trade-offs are evaluated and recommendations are provided for guided waves used in long range structural health monitoring. \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2249], "author_name_tesi": "Gao, Huidong ", "last_name_ssi": "Gao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Huidong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Charles E Bakis", "Qiming Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Charles E Bakis, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FEM", "structural health monitoring", "nondestructive evaluation", "composite material", "guided wave", "ultrasonics", "SAFE", "global matrix method", "normal mode expansion"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "TOURISTS\u2019 USE OF EMOTION REGULATION STRATEGIES AND ITS IMPACT ON WELL-BEING", "id": "12579s24j", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12903", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Researchers have explored emotions in the travel context and have attempted to link emotions to well-being, yet they have done so with the underlying belief that emotions are static. According to emotion regulation theory, emotions are variable and can be regulated during their generative process. To test this notion, I examined: (1) what emotion regulation strategies (ERSs) tourists used during their vacations; (2) patterns of change in tourists\u2019 use of ERSs during a vacation; (3) the interaction between patterns of change in tourists\u2019 use of ERSs during a vacation and socio-demographic and travel behavior characteristics; and (4) the relationship between tourists\u2019 use of ERSs during a vacation and their perceived post-travel well-being. \nThe results are presented in three chapters (i.e., Chapters 2, 3 and 4), each of which was written as a separate manuscript. In the first manuscript (Chapter 2) I documented what ERSs tourists used during their travel experiences. Guided by the construct of emotion regulation, 11 key themes comprising 3 overarching categories of ERSs (i.e., self-focused, situation-focused and travel-member-focused) were uncovered. All results validated the appropriateness of using emotion regulation theory in the tourism context and contributed to tourism research by documenting the transient, dynamic, and variable nature of emotions.\nThe second manuscript (Chapter 3) focused on examining patterns of change in tourists\u2019 use of ERSs during a vacation as well as whether there were significant interactions between the patterns of change and socio-demographic and travel behavior characteristics. Using an on-line survey and travel diaries, 152 tourists exhibited significant patterns of change when using 6 ERSs with positive emotions and two ERSs with negative emotions over time during their vacations. Some socio-demographic and travel behaviors characteristics were found to play a significant role in explaining the patterns of change associated with using ERSs with positive and negative emotions over time.\nIn the third manuscript (Chapter 4) I explored the relationship between tourists\u2019 use of ERSs during a vacation and their perceived post-travel well-being. Tourists\u2019 use of ERSs was recorded daily while their perceived well-being was measured one day before and after their vacation. Results indicated that tourists\u2019 perceived well-being differ before and after a vacation. In general, they had significantly higher perceptions of well-being after a vacation than before a vacation. The results also revealed that tourists who used ERSs were more likely to perceive a higher sense of post-travel well-being compared with those who didn\u2019t use ERSs. \nAs a whole, the findings have significant theoretical and managerial implications. This dissertation introduced the construct of emotion regulation theory to the tourism field. By accounting for the generative process of an emotional response, this study takes the study of emotions a step further. Instead of recording and examining the status of emotions at a certain point in time, this study presents the possibility for tourists to manipulate their short-lived, subjective feeling, and how to regulate that feeling into positivity. This study also showcases how to extend emotion regulation research in tourism by using a longitudinal perspective through the use of daily diaries. In addition, the results provide a glimpse into how tourism and hospitality professionals should modify programs/experiences in response to tourists\u2019 ERSs.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12102], "author_name_tesi": "Gao, Jie ", "last_name_ssi": "Gao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Andrew Justin Mowen", "Benjamin D.

This asymmetric distribution is maintained by an aminophospholipid translocase which specifically transports PS from the outer to inner leaflet of the membrane. The gene encoding an aminophospholipid translocase (ATPase II or 1a) has been cloned and found to be a type IV P-type ATPase. In mammals, 14 type IV P-type ATPases have been identified. However, very little is known about them. The goal of this thesis is to elucidate the biochemical and physiological functions of one of these genes, the 2a gene. \n\n\n              Using probes generated from a rat 2a EST clone, a mouse brain cDNA library was screened, and overlapping clones containing the entire murine 2a ORF were isolated. The 2a ORF is 1047 aa dispersed in 28 exons, and codes for a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 118.8 kD. To detect expression of the 2a protein, polyclonal antibodies were generated against a 2a-specific peptide of 13 aa, and immunoaffinity-purified using BSA-peptide conjugates coupled to CNBr-activated sepharose beads. The 2a affinity-purified antibody specifically detected proteins of approximately the predicted molecular weight in microsomal fractions of rat PC12 cells and mouse brain.\n\n\n              In order to have enough enzyme to investigate what substrate the 2a gene product transports, the 2a ORF was cloned into a baculovirus expression system, containing a putative ribosome binding sequence to enhance expression, and a his-tag at the C-terminus to allow purification. The 120 kD protein expressed was purified to a single band by Ni-NTA column chromatography, and was specifically recognized by both the affinity-purified 2a antibody and a probe detecting his-tagged proteins. To further confirm that the protein at 120 kD is the 2a recombinant protein, the band was excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptide mixture analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry. The observed mass values of 31 peptides matched the masses expected from tryptic digestion of the 2a protein. The sequences of the 31 matched peptides span 36% of the 2a ORF, verifying that the purified protein at 120 kD is the 2a protein.\n\n              \n              Since only small amounts of the 2a protein could be solubilized from the microsomal fraction by the non-ionic detergent, polyoxyethylene 9 lauryl ether (C12E9), various concentrations of the non-ionic detergents, polyoxyethylene 8 lauryl ether, dodecyl maltoside (DDM), or octyl glucoside were tested for their ability to solubilize the 2a protein. 1% DDM in 4 mg/ml of microsomal protein produced the best solubilization, and solubilized 5 times more 2a protein than 1% C12E9. However, ATPase assays indicated that the 2a enzyme prepared in DDM had much lower specific activity than the enzyme prepared in C12E9. The addition of C12E9 partially restored the activity of the 2a enzyme prepared in DDM, suggesting that DDM might solubilize inactive 2a protein.\n\n\n              The ATPase activity of recombinant 1a aminophospholipid translocase is stimulated dramatically by PS. To investigate whether this is also true for the 2a enzyme, the ATPase activity of the 2a eluate purified by Ni-NTA column chromatography was tested in the absence or presence of PS. In the absence of PS, the specific activity of the 2a eluate was 1.8-3 nmol Pi/mg/min. In the presence of 250 uM defined, synthetic PS, the specific activity of the 2a enzyme was 3.1-3.9 nmol Pi/mg/min, indicating that PS stimulated the 2a enzyme activity by only 30-70%. This small stimulation by PS suggests that the 2a enzyme has different biochemical properties from the 1a enzyme, and that PS may not be the substrate of the 2a enzyme. \n\n\n               Since all P-type ATPases are vanadate-sensitive, 100 uM vanadate was used to test whether the PS-stimulated ATPase activity of the 2a eluate was vanadate-sensitive. Vanadate inhibited the PS-stimulated activity by 40-70%, suggesting that the activity inhibited may represent that of the 2a enzyme with the remaining activity representing vanadate-insensitive ATPase contaminants. If correct, then testing whether other amphipathic molecules can dramatically stimulate the 2a enzyme activity may identify its substrate. \n\n\n              However, it remains possible that the 2a enzyme is misfolded and inactive, and that the vanadate-sensitive activity results from other P-type ATPase contaminants. Since ouabain and EGTA were included in the ATPase assays, that the vanadate-sensitive activity was derived from the Na,K-ATPase or Ca2+-ATPase can be ruled out. To test whether the 2a protein was in a conformation able to bind ATP and thus potentially active if its substrate was present, photoaffinity labeling of the 2a eluates with (a-P32)ATP was performed. Although the protocol used labeled the Na,K-ATPase, another P-type ATPase, the 2a enzyme was not radio-labeled, and neither were any other ATPases which might contaminate the preparation. Thus, at present, it is not known whether the 2a protein is folded properly and can be activated by its substrate, or whether it is not folded properly and the vanadate-sensitive activity measured is that of other contaminating ATPases.\n\n\n              To reveal the physiological role of the 2a enzyme, the gene was disabled in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells in order to generate knockout mice. Genomic clones containing the first four exons of the 2a gene were isolated and sequenced. From these clones, a targeting vector, which contained a neomycin-resistant positive selection cassette replacing exons 3 and 4, a DT-A negative selection cassette to enrich for homologous recombination events, and 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 homologous regions was constructed. The targeting vector was linearized, and electroporated into BK4 and GS1 ES cells. Six homologous recombinant BK4 clones were identified from a total of 206 neomycin-resistant clones by Southern analyses with 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 hybridization probes outside the homologous regions. Six male and three female chimeras with less than 30% agouti coat color were produced from microinjection of homologous recombinant BK4 clones. To generate mice carrying one mutated ES allele, heterozygotes (+/-), the nine chimeras were bred to C57BL/6 mice. Three female and one male chimera were sterile, and a total of 369 pups with black coat color were produced from the other five male chimeras. That only wild-type offspring were obtained indicates that no germline transmission occurred in these chimeras, which might be due to the poor germline transmission ability of the BK4 cell line used at the PSU transgenic facility. Therefore, generation of knockout mice from another ES cell line, J1, was attempted. Eight homologous recombinant J1 clones were identified from 100 neomycin-resistant clones by Southern analyses. One female chimera with 25% agouti coat color and one male chimera with 85% agouti coat color produced from microinjection of the J1 homologous recombinant ES clones are being bred to C57BL/6 mice to generate heterozygotes (+/-). At present, a total of 46 pups with black coat color have been produced from these two chimera. Thus, although I have produced chimeras carrying ES cells in which one 2a allele was mutated, I have not been able to generate germline transmission mice to produce homozygous null mice. Further breeding and microinjection is required. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3862], "author_name_tesi": "Gao, Ling ", "last_name_ssi": "Gao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ling", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Allen Schlegel", "Ming Tien", "James Gregory Ferry", "Song Tan", "Cooduvalli S Shashikant"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Allen Schlegel, Committee Chair", "Ming Tien, Committee Chair", "James Gregory Ferry, Committee Member", "Song Tan, Committee Member", "Cooduvalli S Shashikant, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["class 2a", "Atp9a", "baculovirus expression", "ATPase", "knockout mice"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "COMPOSITION OF THE ENDOTHELIAL GLYCOCALYX AND ITS EFFECT ON TRANSVASCULAR EXCHANGE OF SMALL SOLUTES", "id": "11005", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3890", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The endothelial cell (EC) of the circulatory system is coated with a layer of macromolecules, composed of proteins and polysaccharides. It has been suggested that the endothelial glycocalyx in postcapillary venules contributes to the control of solute permeability, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties of the endothelium. These properties of the glycocalyx can be attributed to the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which\nis the major constituent of the endothelial glycocalyx. To elucidate the contribution of\nindividual GAG molecules to the structural and biological functions of the glycocalyx,\ntechniques of intravital microscopy were used to study its function in the mesenteric\nmicrocirculation of the rat.\nA new technique was developed to quantitatively measure the hydraulic properties of the glycocalyx layer to small solutes in normal and inflamed states. Using a modified indicator dilution technique under control and inflammatory state induced by topically application of 10-7 M formyl-met-leu-phe (fMLP), the transient dispersion of a\nbolus of the small fluorescent molecule, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), or FITC\nconjugated with 70 kDa dextran (FITC-Dextran70) through post-capillary venules in the\nmesenteric circulation was recorded and analyzed offline. The dispersion of the solute at\nradial positions normal to the microvessel wall was represented by a virtual transit time\n(VTT(r)) calculated from the first moment of the intensity-time curve of the bolus. The\nslope of VTT (&#61508;VTT/&#61508;r) in the near wall region was affected by the hydraulic hindrance\nof the glycocalyx layer. Numerical simulations of a FITC bolus flowing in a straight tube\nwere performed and showed that the &#61508;VTT/&#61508;r was principally determined by the permeability, thickness and effective diffusion coefficient of the solute in the glycocalyx layer.\nThe removal of GAGs was quantitated by labeling with the plant lectin BS-1 conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488. Enzymatic removal was compared to the shedding of glycans induced by stimulating the endothelium by 10-7 M fMLP. Thickness of the\nglycocalyx was assessed by infiltration of the glycocalyx with circulating FITC-Dx70 and measuring the distance from the dye front to the surface of the EC, which averaged 463 nm under control conditions. Reductions in thickness were 43.3%, 34.1% and 26.1% following heparinase, chondroitinase and hyaluronidase, respectively, and 89.7% with a mixture of all three enzymes. Diffusion coefficients of FITC in the glycocalyx were determined by comparison of measured transients in radial intensity of a bolus of FITC\nwith that of a 1-D diffusion model. Values of D were obtained corresponding to the thickness of the layer demarcated by Dx70 (DDx70), and a smaller sublayer 173 nm above the EC surface (D173). The magnitude of DDx70 was twice that of D173 suggesting that the glycocalyx is more compact near the EC surface. Chondroitinase and hyaluronidase significantly increased both DDx70 and D173. However, heparinase decreased DDx70, and\ndid not change the D173. These observations suggest that the three GAGs are not evenly\ndistributed throughout the glycocalyx and that they each contribute to permeability of the\nglycocalyx to a differing extent. The fMLP-induced shedding caused a reduction in the barrier thickness and decreased the whole layer permeability similar in magnitude to that\nof heparinase. This behavior suggests that the removal of heparan sulfate may cause a collapse of the glycocalyx which counters decreases in thickness to maintain a constant resistance to filtration.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3863], "author_name_tesi": "Gao, Lujia ", "last_name_ssi": "Gao", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lujia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herbert Herling Lipowsky", "Herbert Herling Lipowsky", "Cheng Dong", "Peter J Butler", "Andrew Zydney"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herbert Herling Lipowsky, Dissertation Advisor", "Herbert Herling Lipowsky, Committee Chair", "Cheng Dong, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Andrew Zydney, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Glycocalyx", "Inflammation", "Glycosaminoglycan"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Protecting Road Network Against Intentional Attacks By Near-optimal Interdiction Strategy", "id": "22630", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9936", "abstract_tesi": "In this study we investigate the vulnerability of road networks to interdictions.

Advanced Energy Retrofit (AER) projects can significantly reduce energy consumption in buildings. The construction process can significantly influence the success of AER projects.  It is important for a team to have a clearly defined process for delivering the construction, as a part of an integrated process, and understand information flows between the activities within the process. A challenge to the successful implementation of an integrated construction process which involves many disciplines is to deliver a smooth information flow in the process with an emphasis of integrated attributes. \n\nTo address this problem, this research is focused on the development of a process model for the construction phase of an energy retrofit building project. The process investigates construction activities at a building system level in an integrated fashion for the AER projects, which are beneficial to researchers and practitioners who are interested in studying the integrated construction process. The final process model contains key activities in the retrofit project construction process that can be implemented in the integrated approach. The model was developed and validated through literature analysis, interviews, and focus group discussions.\n\nThe developed model is one phase of the Integrated Building Lifecycle Process Map (IBLPM), which is focused on the development of the activities that occur throughout the entire lifecycle process for delivering an energy retrofit project.  The construction phase of the IBLPM can serve as a reference for project teams to collaboratively identify the key construction activities which are shown in a logical sequence and at a system level. Therefore, it allows people to clearly define the content of the construction process and help project team to make the right decision at the right time. In addition, the process model organizes the activities into an integrated construction framework, which will facilitate the collaboration of the various project participants. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10003], "author_name_tesi": "Gao, Ruo Yun", "last_name_ssi": "Gao", "middle_name_ssi": "Yun", "first_name_ssi": "Ruo", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Messner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Messner, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Construction", "Process Model", "Integrated"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "High Energy Neutrinos from Gamma-ray Bursts: Recent Observations and Models", "id": "22396", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10353", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-05-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Neutrino astronomy began with the detection of solar neutrinos, supernova neutrinos\n(SN1987A) and more recently the 37 events in IceCube which are very likely\nto be an astrophysical origin.
