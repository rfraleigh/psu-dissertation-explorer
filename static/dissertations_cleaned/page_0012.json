Scott Fitzgerald in St. Paul, Minnesota on January 4, 1915 there was instant chemistry between them.  That night in her diary, Ginevra exclaimed, \u201cScott perfectly darling am dipped about.\u201d  For his part, Scott was equally smitten with Ginevra; although he was due back in Princeton immediately, Scott stayed over an extra day to spend more time with the brunette debutante from Chicago.  Upon his return to Princeton, Scott immediately sent Ginevra a special delivery letter; according to the customs of the time, such a letter constituted Scott\u2019s formal declaration that he was interested in pursuing a correspondence with Ginevra. A vivacious and fun-loving girl, Ginevra was no stranger to the importance of a \u201cspecial delie\u201d and the epistolary game was afoot.  For the next two years, Ginevra and Scott carried on an postal romance filled with exuberance, idealism, misunderstanding and remarkable candor.  In the end, their letters could not bridge the distance: social, economic, and physical, that separated Ginevra\u2019s background from Scott\u2019s, but from the beginning of their relationship both Ginevra and Scott devoted considerable energy and time those ends.  Although Ginevra destroyed Scott\u2019s letters, at his request, in 1917 he carried copies of her letters with him for the rest of his life.  In more than 65 letters, Ginevra reveals both parties in ways that no previous biographer has fully understood.  Always complex and reflective, often funny and clever, Ginevra\u2019s letters to Scott offer readers a glimpse of teenage romance in the last days of letter-writing, a peek into the world of wealth and privilege depicted in Fitzgerald\u2019s writings, and the remarkable story of Ginevra\u2019s attempt to balance her desire for independence with the restrictions of the circles that circumscribed her life.  For more than 50 years, Ginevra King\u2019s existence has been little more than a footnote to Fitzgerald\u2019s biography and a point of speculation with respect to Fitzgerald\u2019s fiction.  Using a wealth of unpublished archival records and contemporary editorial methods, this project offers scholars the opportunity to experience Ginevra King\u2019s letters to Fitzgerald in a way that has been impossible until now.

However, little is known as to the longitudinal mechanisms at work in this relation. In particular, it is unclear whether variables related to employment, such as food eaten away from the home (FAFH), mediate the relation between maternal work hours and family weight status by contributing increased calories to the family diet.\n\nObjective: The aims of the current study were to 1) examine the associations between maternal employment and mothers\u2019 weight status; 2) examine the association between maternal employment and daughters\u2019 weight status; 3) determine the quality of food eaten away from home by daughters; and 4) assess whether daughters\u2019 food eaten away from home mediated the effects of mother work hours on daughter weight status.\n\nMethods: Subjects include 167 girls and their mothers from the Girls\u2019 NEEDS Study. Participants were enrolled in the study at age 5 and followed biennially for 10 years, until age 15. Primary outcomes of this current study were mothers\u2019 BMI and daughters\u2019 BMI-for-age percentiles (BMIp) obtained biennially through laboratory measures of height and weight. Other measures included the proportion of daughters\u2019 meals eaten away from home (FAFH) and macronutrient composition of those meals, as measured through 24-hour dietary recalls. Mothers\u2019 work hours was measured via self-report. Repeated measures analysis of variance (PROC MIXED) was used to assess the effects of maternal work hours and FAFH on maternal and daughter BMI change over 10 years. A mediation model tested whether the effect of maternal work hours on daughter BMIp was mediated by FAFH at ages 5 and 15.\n\nResults: Maternal work hours increased over the 10-year period. At each time point, mothers who worked more hours had daughters with lower BMIp. Women whose work hours increased over time tended to have children who ate more FAFH over time, before but not after adjusting for covariates. FAFH was not a significant predictor of daughter BMIp or of increases in BMIp across waves, indicating that FAFH is not a mediator of the relation between work hours and daughters\u2019 weight. However, meals eaten away from home were found to be higher in energy density, total and added sugars, and total fat. Greater work hours did not predict greater maternal BMI across waves.\n\nConclusions: As daughters developed from childhood into adolescence, maternal work hours increased. Work hours predicted daughters\u2019 BMI percentiles after controlling for family demographics. There was a trend for an interaction between work hours and wave in predicting daughters\u2019 FAFH intake, before but not after adjusting for covariates including maternal educational attainment. Maternal work hours were not predictive of maternal BMI, nor was daughters\u2019 FAFH intake predictive of daughters\u2019 BMI percentiles. While the mediation model could not be tested, FAFH foods were of lower dietary quality than foods eaten at home or school, indicating an opportunity to intervene in the diets of daughters of working mothers.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11205], "author_name_tesi": "Bleser, Julia Andrea", "last_name_ssi": "Bleser", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrea", "first_name_ssi": "Julia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leann L Birch", "Jennifer Savage Williams"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leann L Birch, Thesis Advisor", "Jennifer Savage Williams, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["obesity", "family", "employment", "diet", "nutrition", "child"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Better Understanding Influenza Vaccination in U.S. Children: Determinants, Family Impact, and Policy", "id": "cc08hf60z", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12880", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Child influenza vaccine uptake in the United States is substantially lower than that of other child vaccines and has plateaued despite high risk of complications in young children and affordable, safe, effective vaccines. This dissertation sought to better understand determinants, family impact, and policies for influenza vaccine uptake in US children. Chapter One outlines literature on influenza, its vaccines and why children under 5 (especially under 2) years are a high priority. Chapter Two presents analysis of provider-verified data nationally-representative of children under 2, focusing on those up-to-date on a large vaccine series except influenza. Major findings are that parental compliance with child vaccine recommendations and lack of vaccine hesitancy may not necessarily predict child influenza vaccination and maternal college education may not confer improved influenza vaccine behavior for Black and Hispanic children though it does for White children. Chapter Three presents analysis nationally-representative of working US adults on reduced illness-related work loss associated with household child influenza vaccination. Adults with sick leave and a vaccinated (versus not) household child may miss one less work day annually, an association five times larger than those without sick leave. Sick leave is distributed inequitably, suggesting those with lower pay or education bring influenza to work and are less able to care for themselves or their children with influenza. Chapter Four is an analysis of system-level policy alternatives states can use to improve influenza vaccination uptake of young children. The final recommendation is enactment of mandatory annual influenza vaccine requirements for children 6-59 months old for childcare and pre-school entry, allowing sufficiently rigorous-to-obtain religious exemptions. Lessons learned, best practices and mechanisms to incentivize states to enact such policy are discussed. Chapter Five ends with remarks on the overall contribution of the dissertation to better understanding influenza vaccination of US children, as well as on future research directions and a call-to-action for the Health in All Policies approach.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12539], "author_name_tesi": "Bleser, William Killington", "last_name_ssi": "Bleser", "middle_name_ssi": "Killington", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Health Policy and Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Patricia Y Miranda", "Patricia Y Miranda", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier", "Rhonda Belue", "Steven Andrew Haas", "Daniel Salmon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Patricia Y Miranda, Dissertation Advisor", "Patricia Y Miranda, Committee Chair", "Marianne Messersmith Hillemeier, Committee Member", "Rhonda Belue, Committee Member", "Steven Andrew Haas, Outside Member", "Daniel Salmon, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["influenza", "vaccination", "immunization", "influenza vaccination", "public health", "demography", "healthy policy", "health disparities", "health services disparities", "preventive health", "health services research", "social determinants of health", "health inequities", "intersectionality", "complex survey data", "population health", "United States", "child health", "vaccine policy", "work loss", "sick leave", "regression analysis", "policy analysis", "Health in All Policies", "preschool", "childcare"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Failure of the Freedom of Information Act: Addressing the Need for Statutory Change", "id": "22681", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9759", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Freedom of Information Act, passed in 1966, created the first enforceable right of access to federal agency records. This right challenged prevailing standards of bureaucratic secrecy and established that individuals have a legal right to government transparency. In the nearly fifty years since the FOIA was passed, the ability of the statute to provide the public with access to agency records has decreased considerably. Despite strong evidence that Congress intended for the FOIA to establish a level of government transparency, the federal courts, particularly the Supreme Court, have contravened the letter and spirit of the law. \n\nThis research addresses four questions. First, what role does government transparency play in fostering and maintaining democratic principles in a free and open society? Second, what is the legislative intent of the FOIA? In order to address how the FOIA is an inadequate route for transparency, this dissertation establishes what parameters Congress planned for the statute. The next step is to examine how the federal agencies and the Supreme Court define the FOIA\u2019s parameters, which leads to the third question. What is the trend of Supreme Court rulings on FOIA cases involving agency decisions to withhold requested records? Finally, the FOIA has been amended several times since 1966 in an attempt to address loopholes in the statute\u2019s original language or to nullify anti-disclosure Court opinions. Have the amendments been effective in achieving their objectives?  \n\nDecades of executive, legislative, and judicial abuse make clear that the FOIA is no longer an adequate avenue for access to federal agency records. This dissertation presents evidence that Congress intended for the FOIA to provide consistent and reliable access to government information. The federal agencies and Supreme Court have actively countered this effort at government transparency. The federal agencies continue to buck disclosure requirements, using the FOIA\u2019s exemptions to withhold records that should otherwise be released. The Supreme Court publishes judicial opinions that contravene the FOIA\u2019s purpose while expanding protections for these FOIA exemptions. Although Congress passed several FOIA amendments in response to these actions, the amendments have not successfully addressed the problems at the heart of the FOIA.  The end conclusion of this dissertation is that the FOIA, in its present form, is irrevocably broken. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9510], "author_name_tesi": "Blevins, Kathryn Michelle", "last_name_ssi": "Blevins", "middle_name_ssi": "Michelle", "first_name_ssi": "Kathryn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Martin Halstuk", "John Philip Christman", "Matthew Jackson", "James Ford Risley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Martin Halstuk, Dissertation Advisor", "John Philip Christman, Committee Chair", "Matthew Jackson, Committee Member", "James Ford Risley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FOIA", "Freedom of Information Act", "FOI", "freedom of information", "right to know", "FOIA exemption", "government transparency", "records"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 glucuronidation of the active tamoxifen metabolites\n", "id": "12439", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "367", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tamoxifen (TAM) is a non-steroidal selective estrogen receptor modulator that was approved by the FDA in 1977 for the treatment of breast cancer.  Although it is generally well tolerated, significant adverse effects have been reported, including severe hot flashes and an increased risk for venous thromboembolism and endometrial cancer.  The phase I metabolism of TAM is primarily performed by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5, resulting in the major, active metabolites N-desmethyl-4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (endoxifen) and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4-OH-TAM).  Interestingly, CYP2D6 variant genotypes that result in an inactive or less active phenotype results in greater levels of circulating endoxifen and is also associated with clinical outcomes.  However, despite adjusting for CYP2D6 genotype, large variability in the circulating levels of endoxifen are still observed, indicating that additional mechanisms, such as other metabolizing pathways, are involved.  The UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) are a super family of phase II metabolizing enzymes that conjugate a glucuronic acid moiety to a substrate, increasing the polarity and thereby facilitating excretion.  The present dissertation identified UGTs 1A8, 1A10, and 2B7 as the most active UGTs against trans-endoxifen, in vitro.  In addition, UGT2B7 genotype is associated with the glucuronidation phenotype of human liver microsomes (HLM) against both trans-endoxifen and trans-4-OH-TAM.  HLM specimens that were hetero- or homozygous for the polymorphic UGT2B7268Tyr allele exhibited a significant decrease in the glucuronidation of trans-endoxifen and trans-4-OH-TAM.  A previous study reported the phosphorylation of UGT2B7 by the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, which altered UGT2B7 enzyme activity against the endogenous substrate, 4-hydroxy-estrone.  Therefore, the effect of over-expression of Src in UGT2B7 cells on the glucuronidation of trans-endoxifen and trans-4-OH-TAM was examined.  Stable over-expression of Src in the wild-type UGT2B7 cells resulted in a significant decrease in the glucuronidation of both TAM metabolites, similar to the level observed in cell lines only stably expressing the polymorphic UGT2B7268Tyr.  Interestingly, over-expression of Src in the variant UGT2B7268Tyr cell line did not alter glucuronidation activity.  The evidence presented in this dissertation provides additional knowledge of the metabolism of TAM and specifically, how the pharmacogenetics of the UGT family of phase II metabolizing enzymes cause inter-individual differences in TAM metabolism.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [362], "author_name_tesi": "Blevins Primeau, Andrea Sascha", "last_name_ssi": "Blevins Primeau", "middle_name_ssi": "Sascha", "first_name_ssi": "Andrea", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Harriet C Isom", "Harriet C Isom", "Henry Joseph Donahue", "Melvin Billinglsey, Ph D", "John Peter Richie Jr.", "Thomas E Spratt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Harriet C Isom, Dissertation Advisor", "Harriet C Isom, Committee Chair", "Henry Joseph Donahue, Committee Member", "Melvin Billinglsey, Ph D, Committee Member", "John Peter Richie Jr., Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["pharmacogenetics", "drug metabolism", "breast cancer", "Src", "tamoxifen", "UGT", "polymorphisms"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATING EVOLUTION OF PLANT DEVELOPMENT\nIN BASAL ANGIOSPERMS\n\n", "id": "9049", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "686", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-09-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Understanding the evolution of modern plants requires integrating findings from several disciplines, including plant physiology and development, molecular genetics, and genomics. Observations from model and non-model plants are brought together in a phylogenetic framework to derive hypotheses about how plant development evolved to generate the abundant diversity we see today. Testing those hypotheses requires a plant model system with the appropriate phylogenetic perspective: that of a basal lineage. The greatest diversity of plants today is among the angiosperms (flowering plants), a lineage which arose only about 160 million years ago. The most successful of these are the monocot and core eudicot flowering plant lineages, from which current plant model experimental systems are derived. For questions about the evolution of angiosperm development, a plant model from among the basal lineages is required.\nIn addition to phylogenetic perspective, model systems possess features and degrees of availability, representation, and utility not found in other members of the taxa to which they belong. For all organisms, culturing requirements are central determinants of utility, but for studying the evolution of plant development, amenability to studies employing methods of genomics, genetics, molecular and developmental biology are also required. This dissertation describes the search for and selection of a proposed basal angiosperm experimental model, Aristolochia fimbriata, along with the development of initial technologies required for testing hypotheses about the evolution of plant development. Culturing, hand pollination, genetic transformation, and in vitro micropropagation and regeneration methods are described herein.\nGenes involved in flower form and architecture have been particularly important in the evolution of angiosperm diversity. The TCP gene family, so named for its founding members (TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1, CYCLOIDEA, PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR) has been shown to play important roles in evolution of form in both monocots and eudicots. Prior functional and phylogenetic analyses of this gene family revealed clades of TCP genes with two different kinds of gene function. Since then, additional sequence data from basal lineages and new studies providing insight into TCP gene function  have become available. Together, these warrant an updated phylogeny and review of this important gene family. Preliminary phylogenetic analyses of the TCP gene family is described as a foundation for conducting future expression and functional analyses. A. fimbriata has floral and vegetative features that will facilitate evaluating the role of TCP genes in evolution of angiosperm form, and advance the use of this species as a basal angiosperm model system.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [681], "author_name_tesi": "Bliss, Barbara Joanne", "last_name_ssi": "Bliss", "middle_name_ssi": "Joanne", "first_name_ssi": "Barbara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Hong Ma", "Hong Ma", "Claude Walker Depamphilis", "Siela Maximova", "Paula Mc Steen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Hong Ma, Dissertation Advisor", "Hong Ma, Committee Chair", "Claude Walker Depamphilis, Committee Chair", "Siela Maximova, Committee Member", "Paula Mc Steen, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["AAGP", "FGP", "horticulture", "TCP", "basal angiosperms", "Aristolochia fimbriata", "genome size", "transformation", "regeneration"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "PARENTAL KNOWLEDGE PROCESSES IN MEXICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES\n\n", "id": "9047", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4210", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To examine correlates of parental knowledge and sources of knowledge in Mexican American families, home and phone interviews were conducted with mothers, fathers, and their seventh-grade adolescents in 246 Mexican American families.

In addition, a dearth of literature has examined the role of parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 workplace culture for family life and adolescent adjustment.  The goal of the present study was to bridge the gaps in the literature by taking a systems approach to exploring the links between mothers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and fathers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work-family cultures, family life, and adolescent adjustment.  Dyadic level processes, including parent-adolescent intimacy, conflict, and time together, as well as family level processes, including coparenting and family time, were examined as aspects of family life expected to link parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 workplace culture to adolescent adjustment.  Data were drawn from a study on family relationships in dual-earner families in which information was collected from both parents and two adolescent siblings in each family, a design that allowed for the comparison of individuals within the family as well as the examination of both actor and partner effects of both mothers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and fathers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work-family cultures.  Descriptive analyses examined differences, as well as potential interdependence, between family members.  Structural equation models were used to model links between mothers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and fathers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work-family cultures, parent-child dyad and family processes, and adolescent adjustment for both older and younger siblings.  Results demonstrated that work-family culture did indeed have associations beyond the workplace and with family life.  Results were consistent with the idea that both dyadic and family processes serve as pathways through which parents\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work-family cultures are linked to adolescent adjustment.  Fathers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work-family culture appeared to play a particularly important role vis a vis affective components of parent-adolescent relationships, whereas mothers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work-family culture appeared to matter via temporal components of family relationships.

Moderation analyses tested whether or not the overall models varied based on adolescent gender, socioeconomic status, mothers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work hours, or fathers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work hours.  The role of the combination of mothers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and fathers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 work-family cultures was also tested.

While this was the first publicly noticed political action in a virtual world, others have been going on for several years now. As virtual worlds continue to grow in popularity, this type of protest of action becomes more common. The issues experienced by the different groups involved in the virtual protest actions bring to light several new questions about the increased use of technology in protest movements. In particular, what role does technology play in social protest movements in virtual environments? Although the study of protest and protest movements has a long history spanning decades of research, the virtualization of these protests creates opportunity for change in some of the fundamental aspects and assumptions of protest actions. This large question encompasses many smaller pieces including: \u201cIn what ways does technology use change many of the accepted standards for how a protest or collective action is organized?\u201d However, it is hard to narrow the many aspects of technology use and virtual protest into only a few questions and refinement of the research questions is inevitable in the future. \n\nThe data for analyzing these questions were drawn from two cases of protest actions in virtual worlds: a labor strike within Second Life and a corruption scandal in EVE Online. These two cases exemplify the differences in technology use and virtual world interaction that are often common in virtual world protests. In order to complete this study, mixed qualitative methods were used. The purpose of mixing methods was to increase validity and to cover the many aspects of protest in a virtual world. Case studies were used to develop fully-fleshed examples of virtual world protests. Computer-mediated discourse analysis of forum threads, and blogs relating to the case studies were used both to develop commentary from actual participants and a theory of how knowledge regarding the process of a virtual world protest. Five additional of interviews were conducted with protest organizers in order to better articulate the planning and changes which virtual world protest engendered. \n\nFrom the analysis of the collected data, a new framework for understanding how the process of virtualization changes protests emerged. A conceptual kit of  eleven dimensions were identified as important to virtual world protests: degree of virtualization, legality, shared identity, barriers to entry, cost of information, repression response, influence, message diffusion, framing, anonymity, and organization flexibility. Each of these dimensions underwent alterations when converted to use in a virtual world, and is discussed in detail before a synthesis of all variables is achieved.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [742], "author_name_tesi": "Blodgett, Bridget Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Blodgett", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Bridget", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andrea H Tapia", "Andrea H Tapia", "Mary Beth Rosson", "Angsana Techatassanasoontorn", "John David Mccarthy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andrea H Tapia, Dissertation Advisor", "Andrea H Tapia, Committee Chair", "Mary Beth Rosson, Committee Chair", "Angsana Techatassanasoontorn, Committee Member", "John David Mccarthy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Protest", "Virtual Worlds", "IBM", "Second Life", "EVE Online"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "CHARACTERIZATION OF RICIN BINDING TO MULTIVALENT BOVINE SERUM ALBUMIN-BASED NEOGLYCOCONJUGATES\n", "id": "8208", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4013", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-01-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ricin toxin is a potent type 2 ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) from the plant, Ricinus communis.  It has the potential to be used as a bioterrorism agent due to its high toxicity and the relative ease with which it can be obtained/purified.  Ricin is a heterodimeric protein consisting of 2 subunits.  The A-chain (RTA) is an N-glycosidase that halts protein synthesis by catalyzing the depurination of a specific adenine residue on ribosomal RNA.  RTA is linked to the B-chain (RTB) via a single disulphide bridge.  RTB is a lectin, containing 2 galactose binding sites ~70\u00c5 apart, that plays an essential role in mediating the binding and internalization of the toxin.\nWhile the binding of ricin to galactose has been studied, characterization of the binding of ricin to more complex carbohydrate ligands (i.e., glycoproteins and glycolipids) that might be present on the surface of a cell is lacking.  In contrast to the low affinity of RTB for monovalent galactose (reported to be between 0.28 and 3.5x     10-4M), its affinity for asialofetuin (ASF) is about 1,000 times greater than it is to monovalent galactose.  This observation supports the hypothesis that ricin exhibits multivalency when it adheres to ASF.\nThe goal of this work was to synthesize multivalent carbohydrate ligands, use them to determine whether ricin would bind to them in a multivalent fashion, and to identify general saccharide characteristics that affect binding.  To account for the distance between the two galactose binding sites on RTB, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was selected as the oligosaccharide carrier.  BSA-based neoglycoconjugates were synthesized and their efficacy as ligands for the toxin monitored using surface plasmon resonance (SPR).  The results indicated that ricin did exhibit multivalency when it interacted with appropriately derivatized BSA neoglycoconjugates and that it appeared to bind more efficiently to specific longer chain oligosaccharide ligands than to disaccharides.  These observations have important implications for the development of possible antidotes for the treatment of people inadvertently exposed to ricin, for the use of RTB in drug deliver, and for optimization of ricin biosensors.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3986], "author_name_tesi": "Blome, Matthew ", "last_name_ssi": "Blome", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cara Lynne Schengrund", "Ira Joseph Ropson", "Thomas E Spratt", "Mark Kester", "Michael Pishko"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cara Lynne Schengrund, Committee Chair", "Ira Joseph Ropson, Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member", "Mark Kester, Committee Member", "Michael Pishko, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["glycoconjugate", "asialofetuin", "surface plasmon resonance", "asialo-GM1", "ricin", "bovine serum albumin", "multivalent"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "The Subtle Exploitation and Patronization of Women in Masculine Domains\n\n", "id": "10040", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "758", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This research explored mechanisms driving subtly sexist behavior in the form of patronizing behavior and exploitation that can result in women\u2019s underrepresentation in masculine domains.  Because some women are stereotyped as warm but incompetent (e.g., housewives) while others are stereotyped as competent but cold (e.g., business women), discrimination may function differently for these different groups of women.  More specifically, women who display warmth should be stereotyped as belonging to the low competence-high warmth (LC-HW) group, and thus be perceived as incompetent, while women who display competence should be stereotyped as belonging to the high competence-low warmth (HC-LW) group, and thus be perceived as cold.  Based on links between competence and warmth and treatment of others, LC-HW women should be patronized (i.e., given praise but not valued tasks) (Vescio et al., 2005) while HC-LW women should be exploited (i.e. given valued tasks but not praise).  Men, on the other hand, are stereotyped as both competent and warm, and should be given both valued tasks and praise when they display only one characteristic.  One hundred thirty-three undergraduate participants were led to believe they would be the leader of a group in which they had to assign tasks and provide praise to group members.  They were provided with manipulated information about either competence or warmth (HC or HW) for female and male targets.  Results support a general halo effect for perceptions of competence and warmth such that women and men who were described as warm were assumed to be competent and those described as competent were assumed to be warm.  In addition, general patterns of gender stereotyping and discrimination were found: women were generally seen as warmer than men, and men were generally given more valued tasks than women.  Although not significant, findings support past research demonstrating patronizing behavior toward both HC and HW women, and possible exploitation toward HC men, as defined by giving valued task but less praise.

Fear of future personal deprivation could lead to a denial of or refusal to ameliorate social issues.  However, if individuals recognize an injustice, recognize that their privilege contributes to the injustice, and expand their scope of justice to those affected, they may not see the request to give up their privileges as a form of deprivation and, as a result, may be more likely to engage in positive social action.  The aim of this dissertation work was to 1) explore Anticipatory Relative Deprivation (ARD) as a psychological barrier to willingness to reduce one\u2019s own privilege, and 2) test whether ARD can be reduced, therefore increasing subsequent willingness to reduce one\u2019s own privilege by engaging in social action.  Specifically, people should no longer anticipate feeling relatively deprived and be motivated to engage in social action when they: 1) have expanded their scope of justice to others who are harmed (e.g., people who are impacted by climate change, animals, or the environment); 2) are aware that those within their scope of justice have been harmed; and 3) recognize that their privilege contributes to the harm.  Results across three studies indicate that ARD is conversely related to willingness to support a variety of social justice issues, that feelings of anticipated deprivation are relative to those who we compare ourselves with, and that ARD can be reduced by expanding scope of justice and relative comparisons to those with less privilege than the self, increasing willingness to engage in social justice.  In addition, the group to whom individuals compare themselves mattered: comparing oneself to animals was generally more likely to reduce ARD and increase willingness to engage in social action than comparing oneself to people in other countries and women in particular.  These results may have been due to beliefs about innocence and culpability in a particular group's circumstances, or may have been impacted by sexist or racist attitudes.

What seemed to be a universally supported water policy to build a major dam across the Delaware River precipitated instead to one of the most contentious regional fights over water policy and dam building in the East. Had the dam been built, it would have been the sixth largest dam project ever attempted by the Corps of Engineers. The resulting reservoir was slated to inundate approximately forty miles of valley along the Pennsylvania-New Jersey border, up to its border with New York State. In this densely populated and rapidly urbanized watershed basin, echoes of power struggles and environmental crisis rippled throughout the Atlantic seaboard from New York City to Washington D.C. Utilizing a mixed qualitative methodology that includes interviews, archival and legal research, and content analysis of multiple media sources, this dissertation examines how the Tocks Island Dam project came about, and how it fell apart after three decades of controversy, dissent, coalitions, propaganda wars, legal maneuvering, and chaos. provide a textural understanding of how the Delaware River became the nexus of conflicts between multiple and overlapping scales of water managers, large government institutions such as the Corps of Engineers and various alliances of Stakeholders within a unique location in time and space. Uniquely situated chronologically as well as geographically, the fight over the Tocks Island Dam occurred during the tumultuous decades before and after the landmark environmental legislation of the 1970s, and during\niv\nthe end of the Big Dam Era. The transition from the previous dam-centered era of water policy in America to the more eco-centric era of environmental protection produced the most radical change in national water management directions in the last century. And during this transformation in national policy, the fate of Tocks Island Dam and the Delaware River became entangled in, and contributed to those larger social changes. Today the resulting compromise of the decades-long struggle over water in the Delaware River, the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, is by far the most visited park east of the Mississippi River in the National Park system. However, the original dilemmas about flood control, drought control, drinking water, and water quality still lurk in the backdrop of water tensions and will most certainly reassert themselves in the future. \n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2132], "author_name_tesi": "Bloodworth, Gina ", "last_name_ssi": "Bloodworth", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Gina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Gregory Knight Professor Of Geography", "Deryck W Holdsworth Professor Of Geography", "James P Mc Carthy Assistant Professor Of Geography", "Stephen Beckerman Professor Of Anthropology"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Gregory Knight Professor Of Geography, Committee Chair", "Deryck W Holdsworth Professor Of Geography, Committee Member", "James P Mc Carthy Assistant Professor Of Geography, Committee Member", "Stephen Beckerman Professor Of Anthropology, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Environmental Conflict", "Qualitative", "Keywords: Water Resources", "Delaware River", "Resource Management"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Three Codes: A Collaged Analysis of Dress Codes\nand Art Class Assessments in a U.s.

Viewing the practices as aesthetic judgments that are regulatory and disciplinary, I layer and collage them in text form and in visual form, to analyze their effects within school. I interviewed young women to gather their memories of dress in high school. I also solicited stories about their use of drawings both inside and outside of art class. These stories create a narrative of how girls present themselves through dress and art production according to their perceptions of what is important within the school structure; but also how they use dress and drawings for their own purposes of pleasure, informal communication, and achieving goals. I interviewed art teachers to gather similar stories; to develop a picture of the ways teachers imagine their performance and appearance are judged by themselves and others, and how this relates to the judgment of their ability as a teacher. Layering the responses shows how teachers and students are enmeshed in practices of shaping each other\u2019s perceived value, partly through what I call school aesthetics. Using feminist methodologies allows questioning and disrupting of the traditional authoritarian position of the expert, and in turn of the teacher as expert. Pushing this disruption, I argue that the practices analyzed here produce divisions among students, and between teachers and students. Using Foucault\u2019s theories as a methodology of \u201cpointing-to\u201d areas I believe are useful to examine, I raise the question of whether these repetitive dividing practices are intrinsic to our systems of education: routines that continually re-form students into hierarchies of knowers and non-knowers, those who belong and those who are outliers, as the knowledge and behavior deemed essential shifts with the perceived need for divisions. The third code I explore regards the formal code of the dissertation.

The use of SIMS in biomedical applications is still a relatively young field. As such, work was devoted to pushing the boundaries of this technique to optimize conditions for single cell imaging using SIMS. It follows that proper sample preparation is of critical importance. The chemical and structural integrity of the sample must be maintained, while simultaneously allowing for compatibility in the ultra-high vacuum environment required for SIMS experiments.

However, confining local food system development to direct marketing limits its scope and potential effect.  Scaling up local food systems to meet growing demand may require alternative food movements to engage with the conventional food system, creating hybrid food networks that draw on heterogeneous resources and operating mechanisms.  This thesis serves as an initial inquiry into the theories and practices surrounding hybridity in local food networks.  I draw upon theories of economic sociology, particularly embeddedness theory and conventions theory, to provide a theoretical framework for understanding how actors balance competing priorities, with special attention to what I consider to be the \u201cprogressive political project\u201d of alternative food networks.  I then apply these theories to the value chain model, originally developed by Michael Porter and adapted to the agri-food field by Stevenson and Pirog (2008), which I argue serves as a framework for understanding how hybrid supply chains can be structured in ways that incorporate progressive values with conventional infrastructure.  The value chain structure and governance mechanisms are used as points of comparison for three qualitative case studies, located in rural, urban and exurban regions of Pennsylvania.  Each case study describes a hybrid food network that revolves around a conventional, wholesale produce distributor and explores the relationships that develop around their procurement and distribution of local produce.  Analysis of these case studies reveals the importance of a region\u2019s type of local food movement in determining whether local produce is differentiated, which in turn influences the value that it is assigned and how distributors regulate their relationships with producers. These case studies suggest the possibility that local food systems that combine conventional infrastructure with local production and consumption may draw upon industrial conventions of organization, despite their local embeddedness.  Participants in the urban hybrid food supply chain were better able to resist this industrial logic than those in the rural or exurban hybrid food supply chains, which allowed producers in the urban network to secure higher profit margins and negotiating capacity by marketing a specialized, niche product.  However, in the urban network the challenge that direct marketing initiatives face of making local produce more accessible remains unaddressed.  These findings suggest that in order to promote rural development by moving local produce through conventional food system infrastructure, additional strategies to generate and redistribute value are needed.  Fostering a wider range of local food system infrastructure, such as locally-owned and operated processors, could help to strengthen hybrid food networks and enhance their contribution to rural development, while also increasing the ability of local food supply chains to serve institutional buyers that may have limited on-site processing abilities.  In addition, support and facilitation of new business models based on shared ownership could strengthen hybrid food networks and provide producers and local communities more control over their local food systems.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2601], "author_name_tesi": "Bloom, J.

This dissertation focuses specifically on how the Wal-Mart Corporation\u2019s sustainability initiative is applied to the agri-food sector through its local produce sourcing program, and uses theories of governance to conceptually frame (1) how supermarket retailers\u2019 practices supersede governmental regulations in the areas of development and sustainability (2) how outside organizations facilitate the implementation of Wal-Mart\u2019s local produce sourcing program as a form of hybrid governance, and finally, (3) how this program operates on-the-ground by using theories of supply chain governance.  This dissertation used qualitative research methods, including semi-structured interviews with fifty-nine agricultural producers in Honduras and the US.  In addition, forty-three representatives from organizations that facilitate the integration of producers into Wal-Mart\u2019s local produce supply chains were interviewed.  Finally, store audits were conducted at 37 urban and rural grocery stores in the US to collect price data for local produce.  Analysis of public/private partnerships in Honduras found that when non-profits assumed a commercial role to facilitate producer access to supermarkets, it undermined their legitimacy and led to the exclusion of producers with limited capacities.  Relatedly, development projects were found to integrate food safety standards into agricultural outreach programs, thereby influencing perceptions of what constituted sustainable practices and extending corporate control beyond formal third party certification systems.  In the US, ecological modernization theory and theories of corporate culture illustrate how Wal-Mart\u2019s contextually-derived business strategies served as barriers to promoting local sourcing.  In addition, a spatial analysis contributes to a growing literature about corporate social responsibility and consumer impacts, and found few differences between Walmart and other store types in terms of the accessibility and availability of local produce in the US.   Overall, this dissertation finds that, absent a price premium, the value-added quality of being \u201clocal\u201d is subsidized by public, private and non-profit organizations.

Hairpins are the most common RNA secondary structures, and tetraloops are the most common hairpin loops.  UNCG and GNRA loop families are exceptionally stable with CG closing base pairs (cbp).  We propose that, despite significant structural differences, these loops present the same functionalities to the CG cbp.  Thermodynamic contributions of this molecular mimicry were investigated using nucleobase and functional group substitutions.  Effects of substitutions as well as the salt dependence of loop stability were consistent with molecular mimicry.  Nonlinear Poisson-Boltzmann (NLPB) calculations revealed that both loop families have increased surface charge density with a GC cbp, which leads to stronger interactions with solvent and salt, explaining the correlation between experimental and calculated salt dependencies.  The r(GNRA) tetraloops were also compared to d(GCA) triloops.  Effects of substitutions and salt dependence of loop stability were similar for the RNA and DNA loops and consistent with electrostatic interactions identified through NLPB calculations.  The similarity of loop-cbp interactions shows portability of the loop-cbp motif between DNA and RNA, and suggests convergence on similar molecular solutions for stability.  The molecular mechanism of how secondary structure stability affects stability of functional nucleic acids was investigated using an intramolecularly folding DNA triplex model system.   A tunable region adjacent to the triplex-forming portion of the helix allowed secondary structure strength to be modulated, and formation of C+\u2022GC base triples allowed control of folding cooperativity via pH.  We found a linear relationship between the free energy of folding of the functional structure and the stability of the tunable region, but only when folding of secondary and tertiary structure is cooperative.  The ability to increase the melting temperature of tertiary structure by strengthening base-pairing interactions separate from tertiary interactions provides a simple means for evolving thermostability in functional RNAs.  Preliminary experiments on the folding of tRNAs suggest that the model for thermophilic adaptation will be supported by tRNA melting, especially in the presence of molecular crowding agents that mimic cellular conditions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2940], "author_name_tesi": "Blose, Joshua Matthew", "last_name_ssi": "Blose", "middle_name_ssi": "Matthew", "first_name_ssi": "Joshua", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

More recently, scholars have begun to explore the application of specialized corpora, such as parallel corpora.  The application of parallel corpora in foreign language pedagogy remains relatively underexplored despite their apparent potential.  The unique bilingual aligned structure of parallel corpus texts suggests their specific value in aiding students in writing and reading comprehension.  These two aspects of language development are also key struggles for many second language learners of Chinese, as the complex nature of Chinese orthography makes the task of written language acquisition especially challenging.  The current study capitalizes on the unique features of parallel corpora in the creation of a new parallel corpus language-learning tool to assist learners in the development of Chinese language writing and reading comprehension. This parallel corpus presents learners with texts in four formats: Chinese characters, Chinese characters + tone marks, pinyin, and English.  The study then specifically addresses three primary issues: 1) if and how the parallel corpus aids learner development, 2) how both the students and instructor implement it, and 3) student opinion of the corpus tool.  The application of the corpus takes place in two beginning-level high school Chinese classrooms that were both exposed to the same treatment.  The study takes place over a three-month period, and analyzes participant assignments, exams, learning logs, a final questionnaire, screen-recordings of corpus use, and an instructor autoethnography through the Sociocultural Theoretical (SCT) framework to observe the affects of the implementation of the parallel corpus.  An overall positive learning outcome is observed, with participants experiencing marked development when approaching learning tasks conceptually and using the parallel corpus as directed.  The study not only demonstrates how a parallel corpus can promote the linguistic and conceptual development of learners, but also provides insight into how such technology can more effectively be incorporated and adapted in foreign language pedagogy. The results further inform the methodological practices of parallel corpus development and pedagogy by providing an innovative new approach to corpus design, application, and theoretical analysis.

The momentum of the exhausted propellant was transferred to the flexible beam by either a momentum trap or a deflection cone. The thrust stand used either a strain gauge or an optical distance sensor to measure the deflection of the flexible beam, which was ultimately converted into thrust measurements. The thruster was also optimized by parametrically testing a variety of different thruster components, including antenna depth, propellant injector cross-sectional diameter, nozzle material and throat diameter, and propellant gas type. Input powers ranging from 100 W to 350 W were used to induce electrical breakdown of the propellant gas (nitrogen, ammonia, and simulated decomposed hydrazine) and form a coalesced plasma.\nThe thrust stand configuration that used a strain gauge and momentum trap produced thrust values within 3% of the theoretically calculated thrust. However, this configuration could not measure low thrust values. The thrust stand configuration that used a strain gauge and deflection cone was able to measure low thrust values; however, the thrust measurement procedure illustrated measurement contradictions, producing thrust values within both 0.7% and 11% of theoretical thrust values. The thrust stand configuration using the deflection cone and optical distance sensor eliminated the measurement contradictions; however, the configuration continued to provide thrust measurements that differed from the theoretical thrust calculations by upwards of 12%.\nThe thruster configuration that achieved the highest specific impulse, thermal efficiency, and thruster efficiency is considered the optimal configuration. This experimentally determined optimal configuration used ammonia propellant and consisted of a two piece chamber separated by a separation plate; an antenna with a flat tip and a protruding depth 75% reduced from the baseline configuration; the smallest possible propellant injector diameter that does not choke the flow; and a stainless steel nozzle with a throat diameter 235% greater than the baseline nozzle throat diameter. This produced thermal and thruster efficiencies of approximately 75% and a specific impulse 33% higher than the highest specific impulse ever achieved by any microwave electrothermal thruster experiment using ammonia as the propellant.

The research reported in this dissertation focuses on the strong-field ionization behavior of small clusters composed of early transition metals, carbon, and oxygen.  Specifically, several Group IV, V, and VI transition metals have been bonded either with themselves or in combination with sufficient oxygen or carbon atoms to form a variety of small (fewer than 40 atoms) cluster species.  Following the ionization of these clusters via ultrashort laser pulses, observations are made regarding the ion products, their energies, and the mechanisms which led to their creation.  Time-of-flight mass spectrometry is used to obtain data on the resulting species.  \n\tA general overview of laser-matter interactions and strong-field ionization is provided in Chapter 1.  The experimental apparati, including a colliding-pulse, mode-locked dye laser, a laser ablation cluster source, and a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer, are described in Chapter 2.  In Chapter 3, strong-field ionization studies of transition metal (Ti, V, Cr, Nb, or Ta) oxide clusters are presented.  Trends relating the reported ionization energies of the component atoms and the observed maximum charge states of the ions are reported.  Discussion is offered relating the observed ionization behavior to the most commonly considered enhanced ionization mechanisms from the literature.  The results of the strong-field ionization of pure transition metal clusters are then reported in Chapter 4 and this data is compared to that obtained for the transition metal oxide species.  The maximum ionization states for the metal atoms in both the homo- and heteronuclear systems were identical and the ramifications of this phenomenon with regard to ionization dynamics are discussed.  Finally, Chapter 5 contains data and analysis of the strong-field ionization and subsequent Coulomb explosion of transition metal carbide clusters.  Remarkably, the maximum charge states for each constituent transition metal atom in both types of heteronuclear system, as well as the pure metal clusters, were identical following ultrashort laser ionization.\n\tStudies of these systems satisfy several specific goals in laser-induced Coulomb explosion research.  First, the theory regarding strong-field ionization of clusters in this size regime is somewhat lacking, and the reported ionization mechanisms are complex and not unambiguous.  The additional information regarding experimental values for maximum charge states with respect to not only cluster composition but also the ionizing laser conditions should prove beneficial to the advancement of theoretical models.  In that same vein, studies of heteronuclear, covalently-bound clusters have never been reported in the literature, and thus the information garnered from these experiments provides a perspective as yet unavailable.  Further, by systematically controlling the elemental composition of our cluster distributions, we have been able to observe trends in the ionization behavior with respect to the overall cluster composition and its effects on the individual atomic species contained with these species.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1357], "author_name_tesi": "Blumling, Daniel Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Blumling", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr.", "J B Anderson", "K E Mueller", "R Santoro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Albert Welford Castleman Jr., Committee Chair", "J B Anderson, Committee Member", "K E Mueller, Committee Member", "R Santoro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Coulomb exposion", "strong-field ionization", "transition metal clusters", "time-of-flight mass spectrometry"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Fuel Performance Code Benchmark for Uncertainty Analysis in Light Water Reactor Modeling", "id": "15519", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7861", "abstract_tesi": "Fuel performance codes are used in the design and safety analysis of light water reactors.

The experiments examined the degree to which L2 learners and proficient bilinguals are able to fully access grammatical and morphological features of the L2. The specific aim of the study was to identify the ability of intermediate and advanced English-German bilinguals to comprehend the assignment of grammatical gender and to interpret the meaning of compounds. Grammatical gender is a feature that is typically considered difficult to acquire in the L2. Particularly for those whose native language does not mark gender, such as English, the question has been raised whether full acquisition of gender can take place and under which circumstances. \n\nExperiment 1 set out to investigate the sensitivity of English-German and German-English L2 learners to grammatical gender and introduced the paradigm of translation recognition with simple nouns as a way to investigate gender processing. Results indicated that English-German participants had particular difficulties in rejecting correct noun translations with the wrong gender, and proficiency did not modulate these effects. In contrast, German-English participants showed robust gender effects, in which participants took longer to reject wrong translations whose gender matched the gender of the correct translation compared to translations whose gender did not match that of the correct translation. Results suggest that native speakers of German are sensitive to gender matches and mismatches across translations, and leave open the possibility that L2 learners of German who achieve native-like language competency may eventually begin to show sensitivity to gender using this task. Data from event-related potentials with English-German participants corroborated these findings, showing no statistical support for sensitivity to gender in noun processing, and underscoring the sensitivity of L2 learners of German to semantics in translation. Data from a metalinguistic gender assignment task, however, suggested that both English-German L2 learners and German-English L2 learners were sensitive to the phonological gender distribution in German, and L2 learners of German may use these distributions as a way to behaviorally approximate native-like gender use. In a final step, morphological processing in compounding was investigated, and results for both language groups revealed sensitivity in processing internal gender agreement in compounds, although the pattern of data were not in the predicted direction. Together, the results of these experiments confirm previous results on the difficulty of L2 gender processing in German (e.g., e.g., Sabourin, Stowe, & de Haan, 2006) and also appear to show dissociations between tasks that require more automatic processing and those that are under the participant\u2019s control.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5521], "author_name_tesi": "Bobb, Susan Christine", "last_name_ssi": "Bobb", "middle_name_ssi": "Christine", "first_name_ssi": "Susan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith Fran Kroll", "Carrie Neal Jackson", "Daniel J Weiss", "Maya Misra", "Paola Eulalia Dussias"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith Fran Kroll, Committee Chair", "Carrie Neal Jackson, Committee Chair", "Daniel J Weiss, Committee Member", "Maya Misra, Committee Member", "Paola Eulalia Dussias, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["critical period", "morphology", "bilingualism", "grammatical gender"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Toward the study of additively manufactured functionally graded materials: Experimental analysis of microstructure, phase composition, and mechanical properties", "id": "14681lvb5372", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14681", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Functionally graded materials (FGMs) are a class of material systems with intentional changes in elemental composition or structure within a single component, which result in location-specific properties that spatially change within the gradient zone.  Metallic FGMs with changes in chemistry are composed of two or more terminal elemental metals or alloys.  One method for fabricating metallic FGMs is through directed energy deposition (DED) additive manufacturing (AM).  In DED AM, a melt pool is created by a laser on a substrate, or previous layer, and powder is deposited into this melt pool.  When fabricating an FGM using DED, the relative fractions of two or more powders are varied as a function of position as they are deposited into the melt pool.  It is important to understand how different metals and alloys combine with this fabrication method.  This is assessed using a combination of experimental analysis and computational predictions used to evaluate the equilibrium phase diagram of a given FGM system.  By using an experimental and computational approach, it is possible to fully characterize the system as well as identify gaps in agreement between the two approaches.  Three FGM systems are investigated in this thesis: Ti-6Al-4V to Invar 36, Ti-6Al-4V to V to 304L Stainless Steel, and V to Invar 36.  Each of these FGMs failed either during fabrication or during post-processing machining, which makes further analysis of great importance in order to understand what led to these catastrophic failures.  The methodology for experimental characterization of these FGMs included elemental composition analysis, phase composition identification and analysis, and mechanical property analysis.  In order to confirm that the deposited composition matched with the planned composition, which is important for computational analysis, the elemental composition was analyzed through energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy.  To determine the reasons for failure of the FGMs, X-ray diffraction, electron backscatter diffraction, and transmission electron microscopy were performed in order to identify the phases.  Hardness was measured in order to determine how the secondary phases that formed in the gradient affected the mechanical properties of the system.  Through these experimental techniques, it was determined that the two causes for failure in these FGM systems were the formation of high volume fractions of intermetallic phases present in all three FGM systems, while additionally, a low melting point region was present in the Ti-6Al-4V to Invar 36 FGM.  Alternate gradient paths are proposed for future fabrication of these FGM systems that avoid the deleterious compositions resulting in failure.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16035], "author_name_tesi": "Bobbio, Lourdes Del", "last_name_ssi": "Bobbio", "middle_name_ssi": "Del", "first_name_ssi": "Lourdes", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Allison Michelle Beese", "Zi-Kui Liu", "Hojong Kim"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Allison Michelle Beese, Thesis Advisor", "Zi-Kui Liu, Committee Member", "Hojong Kim, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["functionally graded materials", "additive manufacturing", "thermodynamic calculations", "CALPHD", "titanium", "stainless steel", "invar"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "SECONDARY SCHOOL AGRICULTURE TEACHERS\u2019 PERCEIVED COMPETENCE LEVEL TOWARD EDUCATING STUDENTS WITH EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES\n", "id": "12530", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1867", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-10-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACT\nThe passage of Public Law 94-142 (the Education of All Handicapped Children Act) in 1975 established the rights of children with disabilities to a public school education in the least restrictive environment.  Fifteen years later, it was amended and renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) (PL 101-476, 1990), still intended to ensure that the educational needs of children with disabilities were being met and that students were receiving appropriate services.  In 2002, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) challenged state standards in reading and mathematics, requiring teacher re-orientation and focus.  This was followed by further modifications of IDEA in 2004 requiring more accountability at the state and local levels, and requiring school districts to provide adequate instruction and intervention for students.  These legislations required secondary school agriculture teachers to become competent in regard to educating students with educational challenges.\nThere were three objectives for this study. The first was to compare the perceived competencies in the professional roles and development, instructional roles, knowledge, and student leadership and organization skills of secondary school agriculture teachers in Pennsylvania and North Carolina.  Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine if 16 precise competencies clustered mathematically as specific latent constructs.  The second objective was to determine if a difference existed in the perceived competency levels of these roles and skills between secondary school agriculture teachers who received coursework in special education and those who did not receive coursework.  The third objective was to determine if a difference existed in the perceived competency levels of these roles and skills between secondary school agriculture teachers who participated in special education workshops and those who did not.\nA census of secondary school agriculture teachers from the Directory of Agricultural Education 2010-2011 for each state was used.  The design of the study was descriptive.  The data collection instrument was divided into the five areas: professional role and development, instructional role, knowledge, leadership and organization, and personal characteristics.  Participants were asked to rate their perceived levels of competency in each category using a Likert-type scale.  \nIn all, 597 questionnaires were sent by e-mail to secondary school agriculture teachers in Pennsylvania and in North Carolina.  A total of 218 teachers responded to the questionnaire, 112 from Pennsylvania and 106 from North Carolina.  An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine relationships between nominal variables.  \nAnalysis of the data showed that no significant difference existed in the perceived competency levels of teachers who received special education coursework and those who did not.  The data do suggest, however, a significant difference in perception among teachers who attended special education workshops and those who did not.  Significant differences were also noted in relation to the factors of age and years of teaching; these were significant for factor 5 (self-advocacy) and factor 6 (skills and abilities).  There were also significant differences apparent in the familiarity with laws applying to students with disabilities, to economically disadvantaged students, and to academically challenged students.  Moreover, there were significant differences in participant responses to completing IEPs for those students.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1850], "author_name_tesi": "Bobbitt, Erica ", "last_name_ssi": "Bobbitt", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Erica", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Extension Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Connie Devine Baggett", "Connie Devine Baggett", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Patreese Donette Ingram", "John Ewing", "Robert Clark"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Connie Devine Baggett, Dissertation Advisor", "Connie Devine Baggett, Committee Chair", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Patreese Donette Ingram, Committee Member", "John Ewing, Committee Chair", "Robert Clark, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["IEP", "Disability", "Teacher", "Educational Challenges"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Modeling Student Satisfaction and Implementation of the I-C-D Method to Improve the Industrial Engineering Undergraduate Course Experience ", "id": "24913", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11041", "abstract_tesi": "Improving engineering education is a widely researched topic in academia. However, little research exists that analyzes solely the Industrial Engineering classroom. The goal of this research is to identify and implement the significant factors of student satisfaction and motivation within the undergraduate industrial engineering classroom. A random sample of 107 junior Industrial Engineering students at Penn State was asked to complete a student satisfaction and motivation. Student satisfaction was found to be influenced by three main factors: Instructor interaction and Feedback, Classroom Environment, and Modes of Instruction. The three overarching factors were further described by individual models with multiple factors. After creating ordinal logistic regression models, the statistically significant factors were identified by analyzing p-values against a chosen significance level. For the Instructor Interaction and Feedback model, the following factors should be implemented into the classroom: provide detailed feedback on assignments and exams, be an approachable instructor, stress the importance of course material, and relate course material to student interest to increase student motivation and satisfaction. Within the classroom environment model, the use of real-world applications should be used, as well as applying skills to future career paths, relating all course activities, and encourage active participation in the classroom. Lastly, for the modes of instruction model, interactive PowerPoint lectures, problem-solving sessions, and group-work all significantly influence satisfaction. An approach to implementing the eleven significant factors was deemed the \u201cInteract, Cultivate, and Deliver\u201d method, also known as I-C-D. If the I-C-D method is implemented into the Industrial Engineering classroom, overall student satisfaction is predicted to significantly increase, leading to increased student satisfaction and motivation levels.

Currently, there is no known cause or medical cure of this often times debilitating disease and the reported estimated annual cost for medical treatment within the United States is $2 billion. In this study, we investigated the effects of a naltrexone (NTX), a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist, in two murine models of colitis. We compared the anti-inflammatory effects of high dose NTX (1.0 mg/kg) to that of the low dose NTX (0.1 mg/kg) therapy administered subcutaneously (SQ). We also compared the specific opioid delta receptor antagonists, naltrindole (NTI), a delta-1 receptor antagonist, and 7-benzylidenenaltrexone (BNTX), a delta 2-receptor antagonist, in order to study how selective blockade of the delta receptor affects colonic inflammation. A small subset of mice were used to examine whether inflammation was influenced by agonist effects of the delta receptor, and this was achieved by administering [D-Pen2, 5] - Enkephalin hydrate (DPDPE) SQ. For this purpose, male C57BL/6NCrl mice (15 to 20 g; age 6 to 8 wk.; n=110) and female Balb/cAnNCrl mice (15 to 20 g; 6-8 wk.; n=115) were used for the Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS) model (that mimics ulcerative colitis) as well as the 2, 4, 6-Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) model (that mimics Crohn\u2019s disease) respectively. Disease activity indices (DAIs) were used to quantitatively measure colonic symptoms and overall illness. We found that administration with NTX (0.1mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg) significantly improved overall scores in the DSS model of colitis on days 4 and 5 of therapy. The volume percentage of red blood cells within the blood, also known as hematocrit (HCT), is a good indicator when determining whether anemia or dehydration is present. BNTX and NTX therapy (0.1mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg) were shown to return HCT values closer to normal values. Therapy with NTX (0.1mg/kg) demonstrated improved colon length, which in active cases of colitis would otherwise be shortened.

Although a number of studies have explored multimodal metaphor, such research typically focuses on metaphor as a conceptual phenomenon decontextualized from the nexus of socio-cultural practices constructed by the promotional context. Being mostly case studies of relatively small number of commercials, i.e., 2 to 10 commercials at most, this research has been typically limited to the detection of the source and target domains of a particular conceptual metaphor and the analysis of modalities through which they are elaborated in thematically diverse commercials. In the present study, an alternative approach \u2013 a systematic bottom-up comparative analysis of multimodal metaphors viewed as both cognitive phenomena and a meditational means \u2013 is proposed in order to identify metaphoric complexes, their structural, discoursal, and socio-cultural aspects as well as the differences and similarities in the respective aspects across four promotional discourses: American beer and vodka commercials, Ukrainian vodka, and Russian beer commercials. The analysis relies on a transparent and systematic procedure for metaphor identification designed specifically for this study, although the procedure is expected to be functional for research in other multimodal domains as well. By approaching multimodal metaphor as both a conceptual and socio-cultural meditational means, this study uncovers the interaction between the conceptual structure of metaphor and social practices involved in the consumption of alcoholic products in the respective cultures. Specifically, the analysis of the metaphors contextualized in socio-cultural practices has revealed socio-cultural values indicative of the respective cultures as they are manifested in the analyzed commercials.

Increasing commonality can reduce costs by improving economies of scale while increasing variety can improve market performance, or in our robot family example, satisfy a wide range of different missions. Two metrics that have been developed to help resolve this tradeoff are the Generational Variety Index (GVI) and the Product Family Penalty Function (PFPF). GVI measures the amount of product redesign that is required for subsequent product offerings to meet new requirements, whereas PFPF measures the dissimilarity or lack of commonality between design (input) parameters during product family optimization. GVI is examined because it is the most widely used metric applicable during conceptual development to determine platform components. PFPF is used to validate GVI because of its ease of implementation for parametric variety, as used in this example. This work describes a product family trade study that has been performed using GVI for a robot product family and compares the results to those obtained by optimizing the same family using PFPF. Additionally, this work provides a first attempt to validate the output of GVI by using a complementary set of results obtained from optimization. PFPF optimization is made possible by a fast, comprehensive, and accurate mathematical model that is developed as part of this work to calculate design parameters and functional capabilities of a robotic ground vehicle. Additionally, a design method for iteratively populating the trade space with robots using this model is presented. The results of this study indicate that while there are sometimes similarities between the results of GVI and optimization using PFPF, there is limited correlation between them. Moreover, the platform recommended by GVI is not necessarily the most performance-optimized platform, but it can help improve commonality. In the same regard, PFPF may miss certain opportunities for commonality.

However, the technology of green design often greatly overshadows the history, theory, and connection behind reused elements, thus missing out on a potentially powerful aspect of design.  This thesis delves into the following question: Is there cultural history and meaning embodied in reused architectural elements, and if so, how can we expound upon their significance in terms of design?\n\tThe architectural elements reclaimed from older buildings and then reused in other structures act as symbols of their respective cultures.  An element\u2019s age, composition, origin, purpose, patina, and appearance tell a story about the people who created and employed it.  A reused item acts as an urban artifact that tells a story about a culture rather than just existing as a usable material.\n\tAs artifacts, these elements serve as links within the larger web of components that work to form and preserve the history of a culture.  Ferdinand de Saussure\u2019s theory of the sign helps with the understanding of how objects trigger mental associations, and reused elements act as Saussurian signifiers to provide a means of connection to memory, recollection, and culture.  So why incorporate reused urban artifacts into building design?  The practice provides unique opportunities in which individuals can immediately trigger an association to a building because some of its components are already connected to the people and their past.  This allows observers to remain intimately attached to those items which represent them, thus increasing the richness and meaning of a structure built with meaningful elements.\n\n\tAn examination of reuse in architecture is developed through the analysis of existing examples of reuse from ancient times through today.  Research is done to determine the difference between artifacts and materials, and how Saussure\u2019s theory of the sign can relate to reclaimed elements that are the embodiment of time, history, and culture.  These aspects of reuse are then explored through a design project sited in a neighborhood outside Panama City, Panama where there is extensive functional reuse of building materials.  The project is then evaluated based on a conceptual framework model.\n\tThrough the research and investigations presented in this thesis, the idea of reused elements acting as cultural signifiers can be applied to building designs in which both locally reclaimed materials are available and there is a desire for cultural attachment to the building.  The development of ties to reused elements is beneficial because it encourages integration of the building into its context on the community level and greatly improves the richness of green design.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4823], "author_name_tesi": "Boccadoro, Paul Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Boccadoro", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "Paul", "degree_name_ssi": "MArch", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Architecture", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architecture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jawaid Haider", "Jawaid Haider", "James Theodore Kalsbeek", "Darla V Lindberg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jawaid Haider, Thesis Advisor", "Jawaid Haider, Thesis Advisor", "James Theodore Kalsbeek, Thesis Advisor", "Darla V Lindberg, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["artifact", "signified", "signifier", "signs", "sign", "Saussure", "green design", "reclamation", "material", "reuse", "artifacts", "culture", "patina"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "The Impact of Instruction in Text Structure on Listening Comprehension in\nPreschool Age Students\n\n", "id": "7078", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1120", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Emergent literacy concerns the experiences children have with language prior to learning to read and write conventionally.

Due to the low-lying optic modes and scattering\nof phonons at domain walls, ferroelectrics make interesting candidates for thermoelectrics. The\nexample of (Srx,Ba1-x)Nb2O6-\u03b4 (SBN) is explored in detail due to a report of an impressive\nthermoelectric figure of merit in single crystals. The goal of this research is to understand the\nsource of the large figure of merit in SBN. In attempts to do this, the electron transport\nmechanism, the coupling between electron transport and ferroelectricity, the phase equilibria, and\nthe single crystalline thermoelectric properties were investigated under various reduction\nconditions.\n\nIt was found that the electron transport properties of a normal ferroelectric SBN can be\nwell explained by activation of electrons into the conduction band from a localized impurity\nband. SBN can be shifted between a normal and relaxor ferroelectric by changing the Sr:Ba ratio.\nThis property of SBN was utilized to study the effect of relaxor ferroelectricity on electron\ntransport. Within the relaxor ferroelectric regime, a change in the activation energy for\nelectronic conduction and an abnormal temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient were\nfound. These properties are attributed to Anderson localization caused by the relaxor\nferroelectricity. This is not thought to be the cause of the large thermoelectric figure of merit.\nThe electron transport-ferroelectric coupling was also studied in oxygen deficient\n(Bax,Sr1-x)TiO3-\u03b4 (BST). A metallic-like to nonmetallic transition occurs at the ferroelectric\ntransition, and the temperature of the metallic-like to nonmetallic transition can be shifted via Sr\ndoping. The temperature shift on Sr doping is equivalent to the shift in the paraelectriciv\nferroelectric transition temperature in unreduced samples, showing that the ferroelectric transition is the cause of the metallic-like to nonmetallic transition.\n\nThe presence of an impurity band in SBN points toward a large carrier concentration which is difficult to justify with oxygen vacancies alone, and this large carrier concentration is thought to provide the enhanced thermoelectric properties. To investigate the cause of the enhanced carrier concentration in reduced SBN, the defect chemistry and phase equilibria of the system under low oxygen partial pressure conditions was studied. A secondary phase of NbO2 was identified upon reduction, and was found to correlate with an increase in the (Sr+Ba):Nb ratio of the SBN matrix. It will be shown that if the assumption is made that the excess Sr and Ba remain in the SBN lattice, then the (Sr+Ba):Nb ratio of the SBN matrix can accurately predict the amount of NbO2 which forms. Additionally, the amount of NbO2 secondary phase decreases on increasing the Sr and Ba concentration of samples. Eventually a phase pure composition is formed when the (Sr+Ba):Nb ratio corresponds to a Sr and Ba site occupancy of 1, (Sr0.6,Ba0.4)1.2Nb2O6. Above this, a tertiary phase forms. These findings are consistent with the Sr and Ba sites being filled as a function of reduction. This A-site filling process is thought to be the source of the large thermoelectric figure of merit. To investigate the air-stability, thermogravimetric analysis was used to measure the oxygen absorption upon heating in air. The amount of oxygen which is absorbed was equivalent to the necessary amount to fully compensate the excess Sr and Ba. The resulting samples are insulating.\n\nThe thermoelectric properties of and the NbO2 formation in reduced SBN single crystals were also investigated. The formation of NbO2 was hindered due to the lack of grain boundaries which act as heterogeneous nucleation sites. The homogeneous nucleation energy prevented bulk NbO2 formation until 10-15 atm pO2 at 1300\u00b0C, two orders of magnitude below the oxygen partial pressure necessary in ceramics. This was overcome using a pre-anneal at 10-16 atm pO2 followed by a re-equilibration at lower pO2. The highest power factor measured at 600\u00b0C was 8.5 \u03bcW/cmK2 resulting in a zT of 0.38 if polycrystalline values of the thermal conductivity are assumed. The previously mentioned low-temperature Seebeck anomaly caused by Anderson localization was found to exist along the polar c-axis, but not the non-polar a-axis. This further strengthens the idea that perturbations to the electron transport are caused by the ferroelectric polarization.\n\nThese results show that the thermoelectric properties found in SBN upon reduction are due to a change from (Srx,Ba1-x)Nb2O6-\u03b4 toward (Srx,Ba1-x)1.2Nb2O6-\u03b4 and the resulting carrier concentration associated with the additional Sr2+ and Ba2+ cations on the A-site. Relaxor ferroelectricity perturbs the electron transport, but is not a cause of enhanced thermoelectric properties. This points toward A-site doped tungsten bronze materials in general as interesting thermoelectric materials.

It is sensible, though, to step back from this competition and to look on the new techniques and results with more skeptical eyes than before.  \n\nIn this dissertation we look at two aspects of initial data from new perspectives and find the waveforms generated from merging \bbh{} systems to be robust to significant errors in the initial data.  In the first study we find that, by adding tuneable auxiliary gravitational waves into a \bbh{} spacetime, up to 1\\% extra ADM{} energy can be added to a standard \bbh{} system before the waveforms are significantly altered.  While this study is based on observations of spurious radiation found in all standard initial data sets to date, the second study takes a more general approach.  With an eye towards setting up more complex \bh{} systems,  we find that evolutions of skeleton approximate initial data based on solutions to the ADM{} Hamiltonian with point sources also yield robust gravitational waveforms that are accurate enough for use in matched template searches for gravitational wave signals in the ligo{} band.  We also consider the interpretation of a possible class of constraint violations as an unphysical negative energy field that is absorbed by the \bh{s}.  Both of these studies show that the change in  ahz{} masses during the evolution is a good way to gauge the robustness of the extracted waveforms. \n\nAt the end of this dissertation we discuss ongoing work on evolving \bbh{} mergers embedded in gaseous clouds.  This is the first study with the new matter code scotch{} which couples a hydrodynamic matter field to the fully-nonlinear spacetime evolution code.  Evolving a wet \bbh{} system will gauge how robust gravitational wave templates are given that true astrophysical sources are not in vacuum.

HPVs are implicated in the etiology of a wide variety of hyperproliferative lesions, and particularly in cancer of the cervix.  Although much effort has been made to understand the mechanisms by which these agents can lead to the development of malignant carcinomas, much less is understood about the normal life cycle of HPVs.  It is clear that all of the major life cycle events of HPV are tied to the differentiation of keratinocyte host cells, including transcription, splicing, translation, replication, virion morphogenesis, and shedding.  As a step towards understanding the normal life cycle of HPVs, we have undertaken studies of the differentiation-dependent \u201clate\u201d promoter, p742.  Transcripts from this promoter become very abundant upon differentiation of the host cell.  We have mapped the core p742 promoter to a 150 base pair region in the E7 ORF and demonstrated that E6/E7 ORF region contains several positive and negative transcriptional elements, including at least one element that acts on the upstream promoter p99.  We have found that several differentiation-related transcription factors, including CDP, Skn-1a, and Tst-1 can repress transcriptional activity from p742.  The major differentiation response elements appear to reside in the area of the multiple start sites, and enhancer elements in the viral upstream regulatory region contribute to both basal and differentiation-dependent p742 activity.  The viral transcription factor E2 does not appear to regulate this promoter.  Using several techniques, we have discovered that productive viral genome replication, which is also differentiation dependent, is neither necessary nor sufficient for p742 activation.  Finally, we showed that p742 requires the PKCd signaling pathway, and replication requires tyrosine kinases and several of the PKC isoforms.  These studies shed light on the elements in the virus genome responsible for late promoter activity, the interaction between differentiation-dependent viral processes, and the signaling pathways in a differentiating cell to which the virus responds.

Unlike the conventional fields most oil companies are familiar with; these unconventional fields often require special recovery techniques that significantly elevate the project size and funds required. \n\nOne of the popular recovery method used that has proven highly successful is hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal wells. Sometimes referred to as \u201cfracjob\u201d, this process has seen extensive use in US shale gas reservoirs that were in the past regarded as non-recoverable sources.\n \nDue to the effectiveness of fracturing shale combined with horizontal wellbore, several reservoir models have been proposed to represent how these techniques would affect the characteristics of the reservoir. The particular model used in this thesis is the \u201ccrushed zone\u201d model that represents the effect of multiple stages of hydraulic fracturing as anelliptical shape around the horizontal well that sees an increased in fracture permeability and smaller fracture spacing.\n\nTo study the validity of this particular reservoir representation an artificial neural-network (ANN) is created using production data generated from a commercial simulator. This first network is then used to predict production performances over a period of 50 years. A second network is then required to establish a quantitative relationship between the crushed zone model and another hydraulic fracturing model called the \u201ctransverse fracture\u201d model. In addition, an error filter neural network has been created to improve upon the predictions of the second network.\n\nThe results of the network were all within the expected ranges and the ANN can then be used to predict new gas rates and equivalent transverse fracture representations for any reservoir that has its characteristics within the range of the training data\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3603], "author_name_tesi": "Bodipat, Kanin ", "last_name_ssi": "Bodipat", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kanin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["numerical model", "simulation", "hydraulic fracturing", "horizontal well", "shale gas", "neural networks", "ANN"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Data Science with Social Media for Epidemiology and Public Health", "id": "27087", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11964", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The emergence of large scale web data has opened the door to novel research questions to be answered in many fields. However, most work has been done based on either improving a user's experience with a service or increasing the likelihood of click-able advertisements with other fields both showing and receiving less interest in these big data web analytics skills. In this dissertation we apply this type of methodology to epidemiology and public health, a field which, aside from genomics and disease surveillance, tends to focus on traditional methodology such as field research, animal experiments, and mathematical modeling. \n\nWe begin with a review of previous work in this area and its shortcomings. Specifically, we consider modern web-based disease surveillance systems such as Google Flu Trends and related academic work. We find inconsistencies in the literature around how to measure the accuracies of the models, making cross-publication comparisons difficult. To address this, we reproduce several methods on our own datasets. We find inconsistencies in the expected performance, along with unusual results, and determine to develop a better, more validated approach.\n\nWe note that these papers do not actually focus on validated individual diagnoses, but instead with simply fitting the population's web behavior with the population's disease incidence. We address this by collaborating with a local health provider to obtain medical records related to patients that had been previously, professionally diagnosed with influenza. We then obtained approximately all Twitter data related to  these patients. We then developed classifiers based on this data that could accurately determine if the patient had influenza or not at a given time. \n\nWe then applied this classifier to a multi-million user dataset consisting of approximately 10 terabytes of Tweets covering a four year span of users located in the United States. To scale to this size, we developed a map-reduce version of the classifier implemented with Apache Hadoop and stored the results in Apache Hive. We used this information to (1) build a novel disease surveillance system that works at any arbitrary geographic scale and (2) to analyze geographic spread of influenza.\n\nWith this information about disease transmission, we then considered a separate public health question of how to efficiently spread accurate information about a disease. To do this, we studied the spread of information on Twitter related to three public health events: the detection of a novel strain of influenza (H7N9), a measles outbreak related to vaccine refusal, and Autism Awareness Month. As with actual diseases, we start with a network analysis of the spread of information. We then extend these traditional spreading models to include information about the content of the Tweet and the type of person spreading it to develop a more accurate model of information spread.\n\nFinally, we conclude with a discussion of future paths that this research could follow such as employing deep learning artificial neural networks to increase the accuracy of our disease diagnosis system or performing experimental manipulation of Twitter users to encourage healthy activities.

I examine the determinants and the consequences of concerted cultivation among white and African American students. I measure concerted cultivation using a scale of 21 items covering the following topics: parents\u2019 perceptions of their responsibilities towards their child, leisure-time activities scheduled for the child, relationships with the child\u2019s school, and learning-related resources available in the home. I also include measures of parental educational expectations, student behaviors, and socio-demographic control variables. I employ two distinct measures of achievement \u2013 reading test scores, and the teacher\u2019s judgment of the student\u2019s language and literacy skills. In support of Lareau\u2019s theory, I found that parental SES is positively and strongly associated with concerted cultivation for both African American and white students. All three SES dimensions (parental education, occupation and family income) exert significant positive effects on all outcomes, with parental education showing the strongest effect. Further, concerted cultivation positively contributes to learning-related behavior among white and African American students, which is one of the most important predictors of achievement. In addition, African American students benefit more than white students from concerted cultivation when the outcome is the teacher\u2019s judgment of their language and literacy skills. However, my findings contradict Lareau\u2019s argument that concerted cultivation is associated with social class, but not with race. Although social class explains about two thirds of the relationship between race and concerted cultivation, even after controlling for social class, African American parents are less engaged in the process of concerted cultivation of their children than white parents. I present possible explanations for this finding, using both Bourdieu\u2019s cultural capital theory and ethnographic studies of African American communities (Carter, 2005; Patillo-McCoy, 1999).  \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3600], "author_name_tesi": "Bodovski, Katerina ", "last_name_ssi": "Bodovski", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Katerina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Marion Kathryn Hood", "Suet  Ling Pong", "Paul Amato", "George Farkas"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Marion Kathryn Hood, Committee Member", "Suet  Ling Pong, Committee Member", "Paul Amato, Committee Member", "George Farkas, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["concerted cultivation", "early schooling", "inequality", "school achievement"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Planning For A Wind Farm\u2019s End-of-life: A Detailed Cost Analysis Of Decommissioning Practices And Suggested Project Planning Strategies\n", "id": "20008", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9328", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-12-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The United States\u2019 wind industry is beginning to show signs of maturation, with some of the earliest constructed wind turbines reaching their end of useful life and the larger mega-watt scale turbines not trailing far behind.

Dynamic and reconfigurable control of nanoparticle assemblies are increasingly important for the development of functional materials. Electric field directed assembly is particularly promising because of the inherent ability to control particle placement and to anneal the resulting structure, resulting in fewer defects. This dissertation explores the driving forces that govern electric field directed assembly of metal nanowires and the characterization of the emergent optical properties of ordered nanoparticle assemblies.\nMetallic nanowires were synthesized through templated electrodeposition and sol-gel silica coating methods. Lithographically patterned electrode geometries were designed and fabricated to assemble nanowires within an alternating current (AC) electric field and optical microscopy was used to investigate the particle assembly behavior.\nThe assembly mechanism of solid gold and partially etched nanowires in an AC field is explored in Chapter 2. We found that dielectrophoretic forces concentrated wires between electrode gaps, with their long axes aligned parallel to the field lines, resulting in particle dense, ordered nanowire lattices. This result was the first 2D lattice of metal particles of its kind. Multiphysics simulations showed that the formation of the lattice was driven by field-induced dipolar interactions and mutual dielectrophoresis between neighboring nanowires. We were able to tune the resulting 2D structures in three distinct ways: (1) frequency-dependent dipolar coupling, which varied lattice periodicity in real time, (2) particle striping pattern, which fixed the periodicity for different particle types at a given field condition and, (3) switching the field off/on which converted between lattice and smectic arrangements.\nThe demonstration of a reconfigurable broadband polarizer, designed to exploit the optical anisotropy of the gold nanowires is detailed in Chapter 3. Simulations of the lattice indicated excellent discrimination between polarized light aligned parallel vs. perpendicular to the long axes of the nanowires. A dual electrode design was developed to realize a reconfigurable polarizer in the near-infrared by utilizing two orthogonal interdigitated electrodes to rotate the lattice by 90\u00b0 in situ. The corresponding optical response was investigated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In good agreement with theory, the nanowire lattice was transparent to incident light whose polarization was perpendicular to the nanowires within the lattice, but highly reflective for the orthogonal polarization. Unlike polarizers fabricated by top down methods that have static optical properties, these electric field assembled structures can be reorganized after assembly, switching the nanowire orientation by 90\u00b0 and consequently selecting for a different polarization. The demonstrated broadband nanowire polarizer provides potential for electrically reconfigurable photonic devices such as ultra-compact polarization components, electro-optic switches, and on-chip modulators. Smart windows are an exciting practical application for these nanowire polarizers, where varying levels of transparency and thermal absorption/reflection could be controlled to decrease energy consumption.\nA different type of hybrid top-down/bottom-up approach from those detailed above is presented in Chapter 4. Here, the effect of patterned topography on nanowire assemblies in electric fields was studied. Particle-particle, particle-field and particle-substrate interactions were investigated using silica-coated gold nanowires assembled in AC electric fields along with complementary multiphysics simulations. Solid gold nanowires were assembled in aqueous solution, between top and bottom electrodes, where the bottom electrode was patterned with cylindrical dielectric posts. Dielectrophoretic forces were manipulated through frequency and voltage variation, organizing nanowires parallel to the field lines, i.e., standing perpendicular to the substrate surface. We investigated the effects of patterned feature diameter and spacing as well as the effects of particle striping pattern on the assembly behavior. Due to the substrate topography altering the electric field gradient profile, particle placement and organization could be controlled. Varying the applied frequency enabled reconfiguration of the assembly between nanowire organization around post perimeters and in clusters between neighboring posts. The observed clustering behavior of the nanowires in the field was studied in detail.\nThe assembly of partially etched nanowires with small gold segments in AC field is studied in Chapter 5. We observed a positive to negative dielectrophoretic transition for striped nanowires with small gold segments as a function of applied frequency. This observation was unexpected due to the high polarizability of gold, which typically prevents metal particles from experiencing negative dielectrophoresis (DEP). Very few examples of negative DEP assembly of metal particles have been demonstrated. We designed striping patterns to elucidate the particle parameters that dictate the assembly behavior. Multiphysics simulations were employed to map out a larger phase space of particle types that do and do not assemble via the aforementioned behavior.\nOverall conclusions and future directions are presented in Chapter 6. The vertical assembly of nanowires in shallow microwells is described and potential applications are offered. In order to build materials with switchable modality, the ability to form and rapidly reconfigure assemblies of functional particles at predetermined locations is essential. It should be possible to transfer the knowledge gained from this dissertation to other systems where reconfigurable particle assemblies are desired for switchable material functionality.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13783], "author_name_tesi": "Boehm, Sarah Jane", "last_name_ssi": "Boehm", "middle_name_ssi": "Jane", "first_name_ssi": "Sarah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine D.

Dysregulation of these processes can lead to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson\u2019s disease.  While both of these diseases are related to dysfunction in dopamine signaling, genetic analyses have shown no alterations in the genes encoding dopamine receptors in patients with these diseases.  In addition, the mechanisms underlying aberrant dopaminergic signaling in these neuropyschiatric disorders remain enigmatic.  Available treatments relieve the primary symptoms of these neurological disorders, but introduce a new host of unwanted side effects.  Therefore, it is important to identify new targets new treatments for these patients.  In order to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in these neuropathogies, it will be crucial to have a valuable animal model system.  \n\nZebrafish have emerged as an important vertebrate model system not only to identify new genes and determine their function, but also as a high throughput model to identify new drugs and their targets.  The main goal of our research is to identify and characterize the D2-like dopamine receptors in zebrafish.  Furthermore, we hypothesize that the identification and characterization of the molecular components of the DA system in zebrafish will lead to new insights regarding regulation of dopamine signaling.\n\nThe zebrafish model system provides several advantages for identifying and characterizing genes and their function.  The zebrafish embryo develops ex utero and is transparent, which allows for gene expression analysis using whole-mount in situ hybridization.  Zebrafish are amenable to rapid forward and reverse genetic techniques.  Mutant zebrafish can be screened morphologically and behaviorally to identify new genes and their function.  Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides make it possible to knock down expression of any specified gene during the first several days of development, in order to determine its function.  Zebrafish display a cohort of behaviors related to DA signaling, including locomotion and conditioned place preference.  Additionally, chemicals and drugs can be added directly to the water, which makes zebrafish an attractive model system for toxicology and drug screening. \n\nThis work has focused on two families of G-protein-coupled receptors; the D2-like dopamine receptors and the A2-like adenosine receptors.  Both families of receptors have been implicated in dopamine-related neurological disease.  To better understand the function of these genes, we have cloned and characterized these genes in zebrafish.\n\nIn order to identify dopamine receptor genes, we performed searches of the zebrafish genomic sequence database, which yielded contigs containing segments of several D2-like dopamine receptor genes.  From these sequences, we amplified full-length cDNAs encoding three D2, one D3, and three D4 receptor subtypes via RT-PCR.  The predicted proteins ranged from 57-72% amino acid identity when compared to the human dopamine receptors.  Zebrafish dopamine receptor genes were mapped by using the T51 radiation hybrid panel.  With the exception of drd2b and drd4b, the remaining dopamine receptor genes mapped to positions found to be syntenic to regions of human chromosomes containing the orthologs of these dopamine receptor genes.  To further characterize these genes, whole-mount in situ hybridization was used to investigate their expression during development.  All of the receptor genes were found predominantly throughout the central nervous system and exhibit distinct but overlapping expression patterns during embryogenesis.  \n\nIn order to analyze the function of the dopamine receptors identified, we examined the effect of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine (a D4R antagonist) on swimming behavior of zebrafish larvae.  Clozapine produced a rapid and profound sedative-like effect on the fish.  This response was dose-dependent and reversed by ABT 724 (a selective D4R agonist), but was not reversed by quinpirole (a D2/D3R agonist).  The response of zebrafish to clozapine provides a novel platform for performing genetic screens designed to identify genetic components involved in D4-mediated dopaminergic signaling.\n\nIn the final chapter, we explore the mechanism of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which is commonly used to model Parkinson\u2019s disease in various laboratory animals.  Zebrafish are susceptible to MPTP, which induces the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons.  Caffeine, an A1/A2a adenosine receptor antagonist, has neuroprotective properties against the toxicity of MPTP in mammals.  In order to determine whether caffeine is neuroprotective in zebrafish, embryos were co-incubated with MPTP and caffeine.  The presence of the dopamine transporter gene, which specifically labels dopaminergic neurons, suggests a neuroprotective effect of caffeine against MPTP in zebrafish embryos.  This assay suggests zebrafish can be used to screen drugs with potential neuroprotective activity.  Neuroprotection of caffeine is believed to be mediated through the direct antagonism of the A2a adenosine receptors.  In order to determine whether these receptors exist in zebrafish, we performed searches of the zebrafish genome database which lead to the identification and cloning of two A2a and one A2b AR genes.  These studies suggest that a similar mechanism of dopaminergic neuroprotection may exist in zebrafish.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6481], "author_name_tesi": "Boehmler, Wendy Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Boehmler", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Wendy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson", "Victor Alan Canfield", "Keith C Cheng", "John Ellis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert G Levenson, Committee Chair", "Victor Alan Canfield, Committee Member", "Keith C Cheng, Committee Member", "John Ellis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["zebrafish", "dopamine receptor", "mRNA expression", "behavior", "adenosine receptor"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Multi-objective particle swarm optimization of a modified Bernstein polynomial for curved phased array synthesis using B\u00e9zier curves, surfaces, and volumes\n", "id": "6326", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1624", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation develops the multi-objective particle swarm optimization of a modified Bernstein polynomial for curved phased array synthesis. Chapter 1 states the goals of the dissertation, discusses the background and current state of the art, and outlines the original contributions. Chapter 2 defines the far field patterns and the aperture efficiency of a curved array, and develops performance criteria for sidelobe level and main beam quality. Chapter 2 also introduces the novel modified Bernstein polynomial, which provides a new way to specify a variety of smooth, realizable, and unimodal array amplitude distributions using just five parameters. On curved arrays, the modified Bernstein polynomial outperforms Taylor weights. Chapter 3 introduces particle swarm optimization, a relatively new method of evolutionary optimization only recently applied to electromagnetics. A method is shown where the particle swarm optimizer constrains the aperture efficiency to a specified value while finding the array distribution providing the best sidelobe and main beam performance. This optimization is extremely efficient because the optimizer need only determine five parameters. Chapter 4 combines the independent sidelobe optimization outcomes for various aperture efficiencies to implement e-constraint multi-objective optimization, providing the modified Bernstein polynomial parameters for the best sidelobe performance as a function of aperture efficiency. Either the optimized parameters or the resulting weights can be interpolated to provide smooth transitions between optimized distributions and generate intermediate solutions. A convenient way to represent the array weights as a function of aperture efficiency is with a B\u00e9zier surface. This is a new approach, both for phased array synthesis and multi-objective optimization in general. Chapter 5 extends this approach to two independent variables, optimizing the best sidelobe performance for a given aperture efficiency and scan angle. In this case the optimized array weights as a function of aperture efficiency and scan angle can be represented with a B\u00e9zier volume. Chapter 6 adds the dimension of array curvature and Chapter 7 adds the variable of element spacing. Chapter 7 also illustrates the various trends and interactions among these four independent parameters.

This makes biogenic carbonates valuable inventories of climate proxy records, but also makes them challenging to interpret. Carbonate formation from carbon dioxide via the unequilibrated CO2 hydration and hydroxylation reactions is one process that may impact stable C, O and clumped C-O isotope ratios in carbonate minerals, particularly carbonate minerals formed by corals. This dissertation reports calculation of the isotopic influence of the CO2 hydration and hydroxylation reactions using computational chemistry models. Results are compared with observed isotopic trends in corals to determine whether these reactions are consistent with the observed vital effects in corals. Methodological considerations for the application of computational chemistry to the calculation of aqueous isotopic fractionation are reported.\nWe analyzed several computational chemistry schemes for their ability to predict gas-phase isotope fractionation between CO2 and H2O. We also tested their ability to predict several other experimentally observable properties and whether success predicting each property correlated with success predicting isotope fractionation. Only successful prediction of harmonic vibrational frequencies correlated with successful prediction of isotopic fractionation; neither energies nor bond distances are good indications of a model chemistry useful in calculation of isotopic fractionation. B3LYP and X3LYP coupled with Pople triple-zeta basis sets were selected for application to fractionation in aqueous DIC species.\nStable C and O isotope partitioning constants were calculated for both equilibrium fractionation between aqueous CO2 and H2CO3/HCO3- and for kinetic fractionation during the CO2 hydration and hydroxylation reactions. Predicted equilibrium fractionation agrees well with experimentally determined values. The CO2 hydration reaction is predicted to discriminate against both 13C and 18O by 10-11\u2030, while the CO2 hydroxylation reaction is predicted to discriminate against 13C by 13-16\u2030 and against 18O by 19-21\u2030. When calculating aqueous fractionation factors, it was necessary to analyze the H-bonding environment and interpolate to the expected H-bond environment experienced by each aqueous species, as individual H-bonds were found to have substantial effects on equilibrium and kinetic isotope fractionations, often of magnitude >1\u2030 and occasionally of magnitude >3\u2030 absolute deviation in predicted fractionation factor. H-bonds to hydroxyl groups from H2O always reduced the amount of 13C and 18O entering reaction products, while other H-bonds increased the amount of 13C and 18O entering reaction products when effects were statistically significant, except for H-bonds from attacking OH- during CO2 hydroxylation. Fractionation during CO2 hydration and hydroxylation is able to explain most but not all of the isotope disequilibrium observed in the skeletons of shallow-water corals.\nIsotope clumping between 13C and 18O was calculated during the CO2 hydration and hydroxylation reactions. When accounting for H-bond environment, hydration and hydroxylation increase clumping in product carbonates by 0.10\u2030 and 0.12\u2030 respectively. These results are consistent with the increased clumping observed in some shallow-water corals relative to other carbonates. All H-bonds are predicted to decrease the clumping in product carbonates except for H-bonds from water to an attacking OH- during CO2 hydroxylation. H-bond effects on clumping and single stable isotope fractionation are not consistent with a simple model of stiffer bonds favoring incorporation of both heavy isotopes and clumped isotopologues.\nFormation of transient carbonate precursor phases may also affect the isotopic composition of coral skeletons and other biogenic carbonates; however, isotopic compositions of these precursor phases are currently unknown. Synthesized amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) observed under XRD, FTIR, and Raman bears similar structural features with biogenic stable and transient ACC, depending on concentration of metasilicate stabilizer used. The isotopic composition of ACC is affected by Ca2+ and CO32- concentrations in a manner different than calcite. The isotopic composition of ACC is unlikely to explain the anomalous isotopic composition observed in coral calcification centers.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16117], "author_name_tesi": "Boettger, Jason Daniel", "last_name_ssi": "Boettger", "middle_name_ssi": "Daniel", "first_name_ssi": "Jason", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley", "Susan Louise Brantley", "Matthew S Fantle", "Katherine Haines Freeman", "Lasse Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley, Dissertation Advisor", "Susan Louise Brantley, Committee Chair", "Matthew S Fantle, Committee Member", "Katherine Haines Freeman, Committee Member", "Lasse Jensen, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["isotopes", "computational chemistry", "isotope fractionation", "carbonate", "coral"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Close Encounters of Black Holes, Stars, and Gas in Galactic Nuclei: A Study of the Observational Signatures\n\n", "id": "7240", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6315", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We have investigated two different physical scenarios in which massive black holes interact with stars or gas. In the first scenario we have\nmodeled the time-variable profiles of the Balmer alpha emission line from the non-axisymmetric disk and debris tail created in the tidal disruption of a solar-type star by a million solar mass black hole. Two tidal disruption event simulations were carried out using a three dimensional relativistic smoothed-particle hydrodynamic (SPH) code, to\ndescribe the early evolution of the debris during the first fifty to ninety days. We have calculated the physical conditions and radiative processes in the debris using the photoionization code Cloudy. We model the emission line profiles in the period immediately after the accretion rate onto the black hole became significant. We find that the line profiles at these very early stages of the\nevolution of the post-disruption debris do not resemble the double peaked profiles expected from a rotating disk since the debris has not yet settled into such a stable structure. As a result of the uneven distribution of the debris and the existence of a \"tidal tail\" (the stream of returning debris), the line profiles depend sensitively on the orientation of the tail relative to the line of sight. Moreover, the predicted line profiles vary on fairly short time scales (of order hours to days). Given the accretion rate onto the black hole we also model the Balmer alpha light curve from the debris and the evolution of the Balmer alpha line profiles in time.\n\n\nIn the second scenario we model the electromagnetic emission signatures of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with an associated\ngas component. The method comprises numerical simulations of relativistic binaries and gas coupled with calculations of the physical properties of the emitting gas. We calculate the accretion powered UV/X-ray and the Balmer alpha light curves and Balmer alpha emission line profiles. The binary plus gas simulations are carried out with a modified version of the parallel tree SPH code Gadget. The heating, cooling, and radiative processes have been evaluated for three different physical scenarios, where the gas is approximated as a black body, a hydrogen-helium gas or a solar metallicity gas. The calculation of the spectrum of the solar-metallicity scenario is carried out with the photoionization code Cloudy. We investigate\ngravitationally bound, sub-parsec, intermediate phase binaries which are assumed to have gone through dynamical friction phase and scattering due to stars but have not yet entered the gravitational radiation phase. The results from the first set of calculations, carried out for a co-planar binary and co-rotating gas disk around the more massive black hole, suggest that both emission sources, associated with the accreting black holes, lit up after the accretion on the two black holes becomes significant. Periodical outbursts in the X-ray light curve are pronounced and can serve as a fingerprint for this type of binaries. In the case of counter-rotating binaries, the activity of the system at any given time is most likely determined by its orbit and evolutionary phase. The Balmer alpha emission-line\nprofiles also offer strong indications of a binary presence and may be used as a criterion for selecting MBHB candidates for further monitoring from existing archival data. The orbital period and mass ratio of a binary, and in some cases individual black hole masses and parameters of the binary orbit, could be determined from the\nBalmer alpha light curves and profiles of carefully monitored candidates. At the sub-parsec orbital separations considered here (~0.01 pc) the\ninteractions with the gas are still the dominant mechanism for dissipation of orbital angular momentum. These interactions could significantly expedite the binary merger if they persist at the same level over many orbits. Although systems with the orbital periods studied here are not within the frequency band of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), their discovery is important for understanding of the merger rates of MBHBs and the evolution of such binaries through the last parsec and towards the detectable gravitational wave window.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6315], "author_name_tesi": "Bogdanovic, Tamara ", "last_name_ssi": "Bogdanovic", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tamara", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Astronomy and Astrophysics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Michael Eracleous", "Steinn Sigurdsson", "Mercedes Richards", "Peter Istvan Meszaros", "Lee S Finn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Michael Eracleous, Committee Chair", "Steinn Sigurdsson, Committee Member", "Mercedes Richards, Committee Member", "Peter Istvan Meszaros, Committee Member", "Lee S Finn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["tidal disruption of a star by a massive black hole", "massive black hole binaries", "observational signatures"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Continuous Adjoint Approach to Design Optimization in Multiphase Flow", "id": "17403", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8265", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-02-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Continuous adjoint methods are developed for design optimization in multiphase flow based on two homogeneous multiphase mixture models for cavitating flow --- a barotropic model and a transport-equation-based model.\n\nThe barotropic model consists of variable-density mass and momentum equations and uses an equation of state for the density that depends on only the local static pressure and the vapor pressure of the liquid.  In that case, the primary equations are homogeneous, and a conventional hybrid multistage explicit method based on central differencing and second- and fourth-order scalar artificial dissipation can be applied to solve both the primary and adjoint systems. Results are presented for both surface- and volume-based vapor minimization cost functions for a two-dimensional cavitating hydrofoil in which the geometry is parameterized using B-splines.

A high-resolution fluctuation-splitting method with wave limiters is used to discretize the non-conservative, variable-coefficient linear system of equations, where the preconditioning matrix from the primary algorithm is included in the adjoint system to render it hyperbolic.

Nevertheless, with careful cost function design and the use of a low-memory quasi-Newton descent method, the cost functions are minimized or significantly decreased in every case.

The few previous studies that have investigated vocabulary learning in monolinguals vs. bilinguals have reported a clear advantage for bilinguals (e.g., Kaushanskaya, 2007; van Hell & Mahn, 1997), a result that is somewhat at odds with the conclusion that lexical knowledge and retrieval is compromised in the presence of more than a single language. \n\nThe current study examined this apparent paradox in a group of adults learning new vocabulary that was equally unfamiliar to monolingual and bilingual participants. Sixty-four Dutch words were taught to three groups of participants with different language backgrounds: native English speakers who were functionally monolingual, native English speakers who had learned Spanish as their second language (L2), and Mandarin Chinese speakers who had learned English as their second language (L2). The words were either Dutch-English cognates (hotel in Dutch means \"hotel\" in English), Dutch-English false cognates (room in Dutch means \"cream\" in English), or unambiguous Dutch control words with no overt orthographic or phonological relationship to English. In the first session, participants studied the Dutch words twice and were subsequently given tests of translation recognition. In a second session several days later, participants studied the training set a third time, and were given a Dutch lexical decision task in which they had to respond 'yes' if the item was a Dutch word. Participants then came in for a third and final session several weeks later to repeat this same test of Dutch lexical decision. Results from the tests of translation recognition\u2014which were administered just after the training phase\u2014demonstrated that native language (i.e., English) was a better predictor of faster and more accurate performance than bilingualism. This suggests that for initial tests in foreign-language learning, learning of the unfamiliar language via one\u2019s L1 rather than one\u2019s L2 predicts success. In the first test of Dutch lexical decision, few differences existed between the groups in terms of accuracy, although the cognates were the most accurate word type for all participants, and speed only differed for the Chinese-English bilinguals, who were slower overall. At the second test of Dutch lexical decision, however, both bilingual groups demonstrated an advantage in retention of the words, which was reflected in their accuracy performance. These results provide additional support for the notion that bilinguals as experienced language learners have an advantage over monolinguals when learning new words in an unfamiliar language. The implications of these findings for claims about the advantages and disadvantages of bilingualism for lexical performance are discussed, as well as the possibility of both a general and a specific bilingual advantage in foreign-language learning, depending on the time of test. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [899], "author_name_tesi": "Bogulski, Cari Anne", "last_name_ssi": "Bogulski", "middle_name_ssi": "Anne", "first_name_ssi": "Cari", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith Fran Kroll", "Judith Fran Kroll"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith Fran Kroll, Thesis Advisor", "Judith Fran Kroll, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["language acquisition", "bilingual", "vocabulary", "cognition", "inhibitory control"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Are bilinguals better learners?: A neurocognitive investigation of the bilingual advantage", "id": "19741", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9414", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The general cognitive consequences of bilingualism is a recent topic of intense research interest.

A recent study by the U.S. Department of Energy indicates the energy consumption of about 1,246 trillion Btu (365 billion kWh) annually. The continuous global increases in energy demand, energy prices as well as the environmental impact relating to CO2 emissions represent a substantial challenge for the industry. \nCurrently, coal mines use state-of-the-art technology integrated into sophisticated systems that monitor production and equipment performance in real-time. However, frequent data acquisition results in multiple, unrelated, data storages simultaneously inducing an industry-wide problem of being data rich and information poor. \nThis dissertation presents the results of research work on the development of an integrated data environment system for analysis and control of energy (IDE-ACE) consumption in a surface coal mining operation.  \nThe IDE-ACE is able to provide answers to the crucial questions of when, where, and how much energy is being used in the mining production chain. A high energy consumer (equipment) can be isolated by the integrated analytical processes and data recorded in a centralized database. The system integrates additional features that utilize the existing real-time data sources in order to optimize equipment working parameters, lower production costs, and reduce energy consumption and CO2 emission. A case study on an operating surface coal mine is carried out to demonstrate the practical application of the developed system. The methodology developed in this dissertation can be used as a benchmark for calculation of energy consumption in surface coal mining. Additionally, the results of the study indicate that a case study mine is likely to benefit in energy savings of approximately quarter million dollars on the annual basis.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1573], "author_name_tesi": "Bogunovic, Dragan ", "last_name_ssi": "Bogunovic", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Dragan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mining Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vladislav Kecojevic, Associate Professor Of Mining Engineering", "R Larry Grayson, Professor Of Energy And Mineral Engineering", "Maochen Ge, Associate Professor Of Mining Engineering", "Dongwon Lee", "Yaw D Yeboah, Professor Of Energy And Mineral Engineering"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vladislav Kecojevic, Associate Professor Of Mining Engineering, Committee Chair", "R Larry Grayson, Professor Of Energy And Mineral Engineering, Committee Member", "Maochen Ge, Associate Professor Of Mining Engineering, Committee Member", "Dongwon Lee, Committee Member", "Yaw D Yeboah, Professor Of Energy And Mineral Engineering, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Integrated Data Environment", "Energy Consumption", "Coal Mining Process Improvement", "Carbon Dioxide Emissions"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW CHANNEL PHASED ARRAY\nFOR MATERIAL DEFECT IMAGING\n\n", "id": "8292", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3949", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "As lighter, stronger, and more affordable materials are available for industrial applications in hazardous environments, the effect of the environment on the material during operations must be studied. A material must perform adequately and degrade gracefully. Sudden failure is unacceptable. Current methods to qualify materials are expensive and do not provide real-time results. A method to monitor material characteristics and degradation while the material is in the hazardous environment is desirable.\nDevelopment of a Non-Destructive Evaluation device that can function inside a high temperature, high pressure environment would provide a tool for monitoring a material specimen in real-time. A limitation is that the number of inputs to the environment should be minimized. The device should provide real-time data on the specimen\u2019s degradation. Surface and interior defects such as film growth, blistering, cracking, and corrosion should be able to be characterized. In addition, geometric changes such as shape, size, and warping should be monitored.\nAn ultrasonic linear phased array provides the capability to examine a specimen without mechanical scanning. Linear phased arrays are essentially multiple ultrasonic transducers that are arranged along a line. Electronic time-delays provide the ability to scan a beam of acoustic energy across the specimen. Reflected pressure waves are received by the array and are used to produce real-time images of the specimen. In order to limit the number of inputs to the environment, a stepped linear phased array design was used. A physical offset is designed into the device between multiple linear phased arrays. Wire inputs to the environment connect an element on each step of the array.\nThe physical offset allows for the signals of each step to be separated in time. This allows additional sets of elements so that additional portions of a material specimen can be investigated with the same number of wires.\nThree prototype devices were manufactured. Each has four channels; four piezoelectric elements on each step forming a linear phased array. Prototype 1 has four steps and its elements have a central frequency of 2.25 MHz. Prototype 2 has four steps and a central frequency of 10 MHz. Prototype 3 has six steps and a central frequency of 10 MHz.\nThe ability of the prototypes to monitor degradation of a material specimen is examined through bench-top experiments modeling defects and geometric changes to a material specimen. Beam steering and focusing were simulated using a ultrasonic phased array simulation program, Field II, to determine optimum array dimensions.\nThe current prototypes cannot sufficiently monitor a specimen for defects. Large surface defects can be detected but smaller individual surface defects cannot be sufficiently resolved. The prototypes were unable to detect internal defects. Warping or bending of the specimen in the vertical plane has been able to be examined by the prototypes.\nThe stepped linear phased array design parameters can be optimized to develop a device that can provide all the functionality desired. The higher frequency of Prototypes 2 and 3 did not show a marked increase in resolution or effectiveness. Sparse arrays and data analysis may be required to further optimize the stepped linear phased array design.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3922], "author_name_tesi": "Bohenick, Mark Adam", "last_name_ssi": "Bohenick", "middle_name_ssi": "Adam", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernhard R Tittmann"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernhard R Tittmann, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["stepped", "linear phased array", "non-destructive evaluation", "NDE", "high temperature", "defect detection", "high pressure"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Accommodation change during bypass across a late stage fan in the shallow Auger Basin\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "9110", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1205", "abstract_tesi": "Fan 1 in the Shallow Auger Fan System records the transition from ponded deposition in the Lobe Complex to bypass at the top of the Channel Complex.

The transition from ponded to bypass is recorded by increasing gradients along the four channels within the Channel Complex.  The slope accommodation is filled as these channels aggrade at the sediment entry point.  In the proximal reaches, the channels are characterized by thick levee deposits and minimal incision.

Recently, both OFM and CM have developed resistance to organophosphates and other commonly used insecticides that have been the major tools for control in the past.  One new method to control the CM/OFM complex is through the implementation of mating disruption (MD) tactics.\nThese studies focused on the interaction between monitoring trap placement height and MD dispenser placement height within the tree canopy.  The efficacy of several new MD technologies was also investigated.  The effectiveness of several dispenser densities of the CheckMate\u00ae Duel MD technology was also evaluated in commercial apple orchards in Pennsylvania for CM and OFM.\nThe goal of trap placement height versus dispenser placement height study was to understand the effect on moth captures between trap placement height and MD dispenser placement height.  Traps were placed at a height of 1.8 m or 4.5 m in the tree canopy within plots that were 3 rows wide X 3 trees long.  MD dispensers were placed at 3.2 m within the tree canopy in the MD treated plots while the other plots were treated with only insecticides.  Capture of CM adults in monitoring traps was highest in traps placed at 4.5 m in the canopy in both treatment plots with and without MD.  OFM adult capture in 2007 was lowest in traps placed at 1.8 m in plots treated with MD dispensers.  In 2008, capture of OFM was highest in traps placed at 4.5 m in both MD and no MD treatments.\nThe goal of the MD efficacy study was to determine the effectiveness of several new MD technologies for control of CM and OFM when compared to the standard MD technology in Pennsylvania - Isomate\u00ae CM/OFM TT\u00ae, and insecticides only.  The study consisted of replicated orchard plots about 2 ha in size of Isomate CM/OFM TT, TRE #9940 and Cidetrak\u00ae OFM, and Disrupt\u00ae Micro-Flakes for CM and OFM at their recommended rates.  The Isomate CM/OFM TT technology was the most effective MD treatment for controlling CM.  The TRE #9940 technology was also effective for CM control, while the Disrupt Micro-Flake technology was not as effective as the previous two MD technologies at reducing CM adult populations.  Also, all three MD technologies reduced the number of CM captured in monitoring traps in 2008 from the number captured in 2007.  The Cidetrak OFM, Isomate CM/OFM TT and Disrupt OFM Micro-Flake MD technologies were all effective at reducing OFM capture.\nThe dispenser density study was intended to further our understanding of the effectiveness of several dispenser densities of the CheckMate Duel MD technology that is currently used by growers in apple orchards for the control of CM and OFM.  The CheckMate Duel technology was placed at densities of 250, 375, and 500 dispensers/ha in replicated plots (&#8776; 2 ha) on several commercial farms in 2007 and 2008.  In 2008, a replicated (plots &#8776; 0.1 ha) trial with CheckMate Duel dispenser densities of 250, 375, 425, and 500 dispensers/ha was also placed in a commercial orchard.  In 2007, the most effective dispenser density of the CheckMate Duel at reducing CM capture in monitoring traps was the low density of 250/ha.  However in 2008, the CheckMate Duel dispenser density of 500/ha was the most effective density at reducing CM adult capture and live larvae in fruit.  In the small plot study, the CheckMate Duel densities of 425/ha and 500/ha were the most effective densities for reducing adult capture of CM.  The CheckMate Duel density of 250/ha did not shutdown adult OFM capture in monitoring traps as effectively as the higher dispenser densities in 2008.\nFrom these experimental studies, MD dispensers should be placed as high as possible in the tree canopy, while monitoring traps should also be placed high in the tree canopy but lower than the MD dispensers for effective monitoring of both CM and OFM in a MD environment.  Also, the Isomate CM/OFM TT technology, and the combination of the TRE #9940 technology and the Cidetrak OFM can be used effectively by growers to control CM and OFM.  The Disrupt Micro-Flake technology is currently only effective for the control of OFM, not CM.  The effectiveness of MD increases the longer (i.e., across years) this tactic is used to control CM populations.  Furthermore, the higher dispenser densities (425 and 500/ha) of the CheckMate Duel will have the greatest effect on both CM and OFM populations.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1874], "author_name_tesi": "Bohnenblust, Eric ", "last_name_ssi": "Bohnenblust", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Larry Allen Hull", "Larry Allen Hull", "Grzegorz Krawczyk"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Larry Allen Hull, Thesis Advisor", "Larry Allen Hull, Thesis Advisor", "Grzegorz Krawczyk, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["mating disruption", "oriental fruit moth", "codling moth"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Biotechnology and insect management in field crop agroecosystems", "id": "21221", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9666", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since the introduction of genetically modified crops in 1996, the majority of grain growers in the US have adopted the technology (e.g., currently about 93% of the US soybean acreage is genetically modified for glyphosate resistance).  Initially, these transgenic crops were expected to increase yields and simplify farming by reducing pesticide applications.  Indeed, the widespread adoption of insect-resistant crops modified to express Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins has improved yield by reducing injury caused by lepidopteran pest species.  In addition to these yield increases, these crops have also reduced insecticide usage, and populations of some target pest species to historical lows.  Whereas, the implementation of herbicide resistant crops has not improved yield; instead, widespread adoption of glyphosate-resistant crops and subsequent overuse of glyphosate in these systems has selected for 16 of the 25 glyphosate-resistant weed species worldwide, which has resulted in increased herbicide usage.  To combat this resistance epidemic, the agricultural industry has developed crops resistant to dicamba and 2,4-D, two synthetic auxin herbicides that are highly volatile and prone to causing non-target damage.\nMy research with genetically modified crops had two foci. One involved assessing non-target effects of the herbicide dicamba on insects and their communities. Because herbicides are the dominant pesticide applied in agroecosystems, herbicides may pose significant ecotoxicological risks to non-target plants and insects.  To understand these risks, we used a combination of field- and laboratory-based experiments exploring direct and indirect effects of dicamba on aphids, caterpillars, and bees. The other focus evaluated efficacy and value of transgenic, insect-resistant field-corn hybrids for controlling two target caterpillar species,  European corn borer (ECB), (Ostrinia nubilalis [Hubner]) and corn earworm (CEW) (Helicoverpa zea [Boddie].  Over three years, we performed large scale field trials with Bt and non-Bt corn hybrids at 29 locations across Pennsylvania. We also worked with moth capture data from the PestWatch pheromone trapping network (pestwatch.psu.edu) and GIS mapping software to determine if the number of moths captured, or land-use variables related to in-field damage from caterpillars.\nDespite limited usage, the herbicides dicamba and 2,4-D commonly cause herbicide-drift damage to non-target plants.  Now with dicamba and 2,4-D primed to be more widely used in association with pending transgenic crop varieties, there is a pressing need to understand the influence of these synthetic auxin herbicides on insects and their communities.  To understand the effects of dicamba on two common lepidopteran species, we applied several sub-lethal, drift-level rates of dicamba to soybean (Glycine max L.) and nodding plumeless thistle (Carduus nutans L.) and evaluated on dosed plants growth and survival of H. zea and Vanessa cardui (L.) larvae, respectively.  In the laboratory with several rates of dicamba, we also performed direct toxicity bioassays on the two caterpillar species.  Dicamba was not directly toxic to larvae of either species, and H. zea showed no negative effects when feeding upon soybeans dosed with dicamba. I did, however, detect significant negative, indirect effects of higher rates of dicamba on V. cardui larval and pupal mass, thistle biomass, and total plant nitrogen. Notably, in the absence of caterpillars, thistle biomass was not related to dicamba dose, suggesting that the additional herbivore stress was necessary to reveal costs of sub-lethal exposure to dicamba. \nWe also evaluated whether drift-level doses of dicamba on soybeans can influence soybean aphids and the soybean insect community. We found that when soybean aphid populations were high, population densities started to decrease on plants dosed with rates above 0.56 g/ha (particle drift levels). When aphid population densities were low, however, we did not find any relationship between dicamba dose and aphid populations. During field studies, we found evidence that as dicamba dose increased populations of ants, mirids, nabids, spiders, opiliones, Orius, and lathridids increased; these largely predaceous taxa may have responded to changes in plant structure caused by herbicide injury.\nWhile effects of dicamba were inconsistent on soybeans and thistle, when I evaluated effects of dicamba on flowering and pollinator visitation on two other broadleaf plant species, effects were clearer.  We found that higher doses of dicamba (> 5.6 g/ha) delayed flowering of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and common boneset (Eupatorium perfoliatum L.).  Similar rates of dicamba (> 0.56 g/ha) also reduced flowering of E. perfoliatum. In alfalfa, we found fewer honey bees and no floral visitation by honey bees in plots where dicamba dose substantially decreased flowering.  Moreover, visitation by all pollinators to E. perfoliatum flowers was also lower on plants dosed with high rates (> 0.56 g/ha) of dicamba.\nWhile herbicide-resistant crops have helped select for problematic herbicide-resistant weeds that are difficult to control, widespread adoption of transgenic insect-resistant Bt hybrids has been beneficial because it has driven ECB populations to historic lows in many parts of the US.  Similar to the Midwest, we found that ECB injury in Pennsylvania was generally low across the state.  In fact, the ECB damage we measured was much lower than that reported just ten years ago suggesting that widespread adoption of Bt hybrids by farmers may have suppressed ECB populations.  As expected, Bt hybrids continue to be very effective for controlling ECB; however, the yield benefits from Bt hybrids were inconsistent and, because of higher seed costs, higher yields of Bt varieties rarely translated into higher profits.  We also found that ECB damage to ears and stalks can be predicted by the number of ECB moths captured in traps in the PestWatch network.  This finding provides farmers with another tool to help determine if they may benefit from planting Bt hybrids; larger annual populations of moths in pheromone traps would indicate a higher risk of damage and a potentially better return on investment for Bt hybrids in subsequent years.\nContrary to what has been found in the southeastern US, we found that CEW damage was low across Pennsylvania; CEW damaged less than one kernel per corn ear at 21 of 26 sites.  Moreover, the percent of ears damaged by CEW was less than 15%, much lower than in the Southern US where CEW damage can reach 30 kernels per ear.  At sites with the highest damage levels, Bt hybrids suppressed corn earworm damage relative to non-Bt hybrids, and all of the various Bt traits provided similar control.  The CEW damage prevented by Bt hybrids in the field corn plots we sampled was typically worth less than $4.00/ha, an amount that does not support the use of Bt to target CEW.  Similar to my results with ECB, moth captures through July in PestWatch effectively predicted in-field CEW damage at the end of the season. \nAt two sites where we assessed ECB and CEW populations, we found in both Bt and non-Bt corn hybrids larvae of the corn pith weevil Geraeus penicillus (Herbst).  Geraeus penicillus is a stem boring weevil that is not of economic concern.

Most algorithms, however, have been designed for \textit{homogeneous} data where the algorithm works on a uniform set of attributes that represent the data objects. Real-world datasets, on the other hand, are richer in structure and contain multiple levels of connectivity among the data objects, such as hyperlinks in web pages, textual annotations or text contexts surrounding images on the web and citations and authorship information of scientific literature. Utilizing only a single information source provides a narrow focus of view into the real nature of the relationships between data objects. Each additional dimension of connectivity increases our understanding of the semantic characteristics of the collection and improves our ability to detect distinct groups of objects where the objects in each group exhibit similar properties.\n\nThis thesis presents three algorithms that merge multiple sources of information for clustering and topic discovery in collections of academic papers. The first algorithm combines textual content of academic papers with the information extracted from the citation relationships between the papers for finding scientific topic clusters in the data collection. The second algorithm integrates authorship information of documents into the text-based clustering process to yield improved clustering solutions. Based on the validation from these two algorithms that it is possible to improve topic discovery by utilizing additional dimensions of similarity among data objects, we provide a generative model that merges citation relationships, authorship information, user queries, user tags and the timestamps of documents for discovering scientific topics in collections of academic papers. Further, the generative process can effectively model the evolutionary characteristics of document collections and can discover the change of the popularity of scientific topics over time. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3825], "author_name_tesi": "Bolelli, Levent ", "last_name_ssi": "Bolelli", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Levent", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Lee Giles", "Wang Chien Lee", "Padma Raghavan", "Alan Maceachren", "Raj Acharya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Lee Giles, Committee Chair", "Wang Chien Lee, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Alan Maceachren, Committee Member", "Raj Acharya, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Clustering", "Heterogeneous Data Clustering", "Data Mining", "Machine Learning"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Nitrogen Credit Trading as a Mechanism for Riparian Buffer Establishment on Pennsylvania Farmland", "id": "xs55mc046", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12545", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nutrient pollution from agricultural sources has been a large contributor to the decline in the health of the Chesapeake Bay.

Today, cooperating robots are used in unstructured environments such as hazardous waste remediation and space-based construction. Multiple robots are now often connected in series and/or in parallel to accomplish their goal. Long-reach flexible manipulators may require bracing to reduce oscillations and increase accuracy. Dynamic simulation of such systems is complicated by the numerous contacts made by the robots as they interact with one another and their surroundings. Most current simulation algorithms are not well suited to the treatment of multiple contacts and require substantial reprogramming when new system tasks or configurations occur. Even algorithms which are inherently suitable for systems with time-varying topologies are limited in the classes of contacts which they allow.\n\nThis dissertation presents the development and validation of a Modular Robot Dynamic Simulation (MRDS) algorithm. In response to these increasing complexities exhibited by modern, multi-robot systems, this algorithm has been developed to be as general as possible and, as a result, is capable of handling serial, parallel, and hybrid series/parallel topologies for both open-chain and closed-chain systems. The modularity of the approach is achieved by decomposing complex systems into individual physical components such as robots, end effector tools, payloads, obstacles, or other similar objects and devices. This modular nature allows the open chain dynamics of all system models to be performed independently and simultaneously. This is true also for each module\u2019s Forward Kinematics problem and for the computation of several position dependent inertia matrices used to incorporate contact constraints. Consequently, the use of parallel processing is ideal for this algorithm, as one (or more) modules may be treated per processor. This results in increased computational efficiency and real-time capability.\n\nContacts in the system are represented using a general joint/contact model which describes the structure of the contact force and relative motions between a pair of contacting bodies. These contact models are used to connect modules to one another, to fixed boundaries, and to themselves in the case of a module forming or having in its design a single closed loop. With this modelling technique, the MRDS algorithm can be used for contacts that are either holonomic or non-holonomic. In addition, contact modes may be constant or vary with time.\n\nThe operational space inertia matrix is used to project the dynamics of each module to the operational frame associated with each externally contacted body. A multi-point operational space inertia matrix is also used here for the treatment of modules subject to multiple concurrent contacts. Special \u201crelative forms\u201d of the Jacobian matrix and various inertia matrices are also developed and used for efficiency in treating modules which have a locally closed loop.\n\nSpecial attention is paid to the connection of two (or more) modules in series, as this ability to serially connect objects dynamically without the need to rederive and re-code new equations or coupling terms is new in the literature on robot dynamic simulation. The algorithm effectively formats serial connections so that they can be treated no differently than parallel connections. However, additional options available for serial connections are discussed, including special methods for Forward Kinematics and the complete elimination of constraint violations. For the general case, constraint violation suppression is discussed and used successfully for both serial and parallel connections.\n\nThe MRDS algorithm is also shown to be applicable to constrained, structurally flexible manipulators. Issues related to second order strain and kinematic effects are discussed, including appropriate linearization schemes. These linearization and second-order modelling issues have been explored in other works for open chain systems. Here, these topics are examined for both open loop and closed loop constraints and for their place in the operational space dynamic formulation and the MRDS algorithm.\n\nValidation of the modular algorithm is achieved through the simulation of various multi-module, structurally flexible systems. These include parallel cooperations, serial cooperations, base-excitation, and macro/mini formulations. Simulation predictions compare extremely well with those of Working Model\u00ae 2D. Results from the example systems also demonstrate the success of the constraint violation suppression system and the effect of the chosen linearization schemes on open and closed loop operations.\n\nWith the features and capabilities described, the MRDS algorithm is especially well suited for the constrained motion dynamic simulation of complex, multi-robot, reconfigurable systems like those used in space applications. The modular nature allows alternate configurations of the same system components to be simulated quickly and easily without the need to derive new dynamic equations or coupling terms. Nor is there any need to make substantial changes to existing simulation coding. The MRDS algorithm is also computationally efficient, open-ended, and general, making it particularly valuable for the treatment of the increasingly more complex robot systems in use today.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1202], "author_name_tesi": "Bonaventura, Clifford S.", "last_name_ssi": "Bonaventura", "middle_name_ssi": "S.", "first_name_ssi": "Clifford", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathryn Weed Jablokow", "H Joseph Sommer Iii", "Kon Well Wang", "David J Cannon", "Keith W Buffinton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathryn Weed Jablokow, Committee Chair", "H Joseph Sommer Iii, Committee Member", "Kon Well Wang, Committee Member", "David J Cannon, Committee Member", "Keith W Buffinton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["robotics", "forward dynamics", "dynamic simulation", "constrained motion"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "POWER, IDENTITY, CREDIBILITY & COOPERATION: EXAMINING THE DEVELOPMENT OF COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AMONG VIOLENT NON-STATE ACTORS\n\n", "id": "11071", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3370", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Much of the empirical and theoretical work on the external politics of violent non-state actors (VNAs) has focused on either their conflict behaviors or their potential for cooperation with state actors.

I find that power characteristics have a relatively small practical impact on both the likelihood of cooperation onset and the likelihood that a given dyad will choose to institutionalize their relationship.  Comparatively however, power characteristics matter much more for explaining variation in design than variation in onset.  Additionally, while identity characteristics play a large role in determining the development of inter-VNA cooperation, I find that while these actors may choose their arrangement partners based largely on socio-political affinities, they more often choose institutional designs in response to patterns of past cooperative (or non-cooperative) behavior.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3358], "author_name_tesi": "Bond, Kanisha D", "last_name_ssi": "Bond", "middle_name_ssi": "D", "first_name_ssi": "Kanisha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas William Lemke", "Douglas William Lemke", "David Scott Bennett Jr.", "Glenn Hunter Palmer", "Stephen Matthews", "Navin Bapat"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas William Lemke, Dissertation Advisor", "Douglas William Lemke, Committee Chair", "David Scott Bennett Jr., Committee Member", "Glenn Hunter Palmer, Committee Member", "Stephen Matthews, Committee Member", "Navin Bapat, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["alliance politics", "international cooperation", "violent non-state actors", "institution-building"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Synthesis of early transition metal and non-equilibrium intermetallic nanoparticles using n-butyllithium", "id": "14630", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7458", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past decade, the role of inorganic nanomaterials has become an essential cornerstone for modern research applications.

Elemental analysis by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and refinement of electron diffraction patterns confirmed Au3Fe1-x with a composition of approximately Au3Fe0.7.\n\nThe 3d transition metal deficiency in the non-equilibrium Au3M1-x phases was studied by reacting Au nanoparticle seeds with n-butyllithium.  The reaction yielded the thermodynamically stable phase Au3Li, a polar intermetallic which adopts the L12 structure type.  Interestingly, the Au3Li nanoparticles decompose in water to regenerate Au.  The Au3Li phase gives insight to a plausible template-driven reaction pathway for the non-equilibrium Au3M1-x phases.  The synthetic achievement of both non-equilibrium phases and polar intermetallics shows that n-butyllithium is capable of affecting nucleation kinetics and lithium intercalation.\n\nFinally, \u00acn-butyllithium was used as a strong reducing agent in the solution-based synthesis of elemental Mn nanoparticles.  The particles were synthesized using air-free techniques by reacting n-butyllithium with MnCl2 and oleic acid in diphenyl ether.  The nanoparticles were found to adopt the \u03b1-Mn structure and contained a thin amorphous MnO layer bound by oleate ligands to help render them air-stable.  Unlike antiferromagnetic bulk Mn, the as-made nanoparticles were paramagnetic.  With little modification, crystalline Mo and amorphous W nanoparticles were synthesized using the same n-butyllithium procedure.  Using the thermal decomposition of metal-carbonyls was shown to yield W, Mo-based alloys, and tetrapod-like MnO nanoparticles.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7402], "author_name_tesi": "Bondi, James Fumiya", "last_name_ssi": "Bondi", "middle_name_ssi": "Fumiya", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "John V Badding", "Mary Beth Williams", "Michael Anthony Hickner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "John V Badding, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Williams, Committee Member", "Michael Anthony Hickner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanoparticle", "n-butyllithium", "early transition metal", "non-equilibrium", "intermetallic", "solid state"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Modeling, design and testing of a multi-cell periodic fluidic flexible matrix composite device", "id": "26726", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11880", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vibrations have been a growing concern in recent years. Previously considered as a by-product of performances, they are now seen as an important topic to satisfy customer requests for comfort. Therefore, a lot of effort has been put in the reduction of such incommodities.\nVibrations are mechanical waves that are produced by virtually any physical phenomenon. They usually transport a low amount of energy, but the human body perceives them extremely sensitively up to a few thousand Hertz. Over time, they can also provoke fatigue phenomenon in material that can lead to failure. Making the vibrations completely disappear is impossible. Instead we try to reduce them to such a level that their impact becomes negligible.\nMitigating vibration effects is easy if you do not have too many constraints on the final product. However, our case will emphasize on helicopter applications, especially noise in the cabin.\nOne could think that shielding the cabin with layers and layers of elastomeric materials would do the trick, but helicopters are very sensitive about their weight budget. Therefore, we look for devices that would reduce the vibrations with a minimal weight penalty.\nThe present work is extending our knowledge of some fluidic devices called F2MC tubes, standing for Fluidic Flexible Matrix Composite tubes. They consist of a highly anisotropic Flexible Matrix Composite (FMC) laminate that surround a working fluid. The FMC is a composite shell having reinforcement oriented with a specific angle with respect to the longitudinal axis. These tubes have proven to be efficient at reducing vibrations in some specific configurations, being able to be tuned to target a given frequency quite accurately. As a consequence, the next move has been to try to miniaturize these tube so that they could be part of a meta-material, providing interesting structural stiffness and vibration damping abilities. The idea would be to connect back to back a given number of small sized F2MC with a small inertia track, called \"cell\", in a periodic structure. The damping effect would them sum up and produce a band gap centered on a frequency of choice, determined by the properties of cell.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11333], "author_name_tesi": "Bondoux, Alexandre Franck", "last_name_ssi": "Bondoux", "middle_name_ssi": "Franck", "first_name_ssi": "Alexandre", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward C Smith", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward C Smith, Thesis Advisor", "Christopher Rahn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["F2MC", "vibrations", "helicopters", "acoustic", "periodic"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Linking Paleobiological Patterns Across Geographic Scales: An Example Using Upper Mississippian Fossil Assemblages From The Illinios And Appalachian Basins, USA", "id": "8690", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2957", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "    A fundamental goal of evolutionary paleobiology is to understand how the composition, structure, and diversity of biotic assemblages have varied through space and time, in response to physical and/or biological perturbations.  Historically, research on this topic has focused on reconstructing and understanding global biotic patterns throughout the Phanerozoic. This research program has greatly improved our understanding of the global history of marine biodiversity and helped to identify intervals of major biotic turnover throughout the Phanerozoic Eon.  However, global level analyses mask important variability in the timing or magnitude of biotic change among regions or habitats and preclude an understanding of the processes that control faunal dynamics at regional and local levels. Work that integrates biotic patterns across spatial scales is needed to better understand the processes that combine to drive long-term ecological and evolutionary trends.  \n    Here, I analyze regional patterns of marine taxonomic and ecologic diversity, turnover, and ecosystem structure across the onset the Late Paleozoic ice age (LPIA), using data that were collected within a highly resolved stratigraphic framework from the Illinois and Appalachian basins. In Chapter 2, I explore how global patterns of biotic turnover are expressed in the structure and stability of regional biotic gradients from the Illinois Basin during the LPIA - an interval noted for low global rates of faunal turnover. Gradient analyses reveal a marked shift in the structure of biotic gradients across the onset of the LPIA: in the pre-LPIA interval, depositional environments are clearly distinguished by ordination analyses and are dominated by distinct associations of taxa with modest habitat ranges. However, during the LPIA interval depositional environments are only weakly differentiated by ordination and are dominated by similar associations of taxa that had broad habitat ranges. Comparisons reveal that the structure of successive LPIA biotic gradients is nearly identical. Our results are consistent with findings from global level studies, which indicate that broadly adapted taxa (eurytopes) increased in importance following the start of the LPIA.  However, unlike the global level, the regional increase in eurytopy was not linked to the extinction of narrowly adapted taxa in response to climate change.  Instead, eurytopy increased as the geometry of the Illinois Basin shifted from a flat carbonate ramp, comprised of shallower water, higher stress environments in the pre-LPIA interval, to a steeper ramp comprised of deeper water, more stable habitats in the LPIA interval. Because eurytopic taxa tend to be extinction resistant and have lower rates of turnover their increased importance in late Paleozoic assemblages likely drove: (1) a previously documented pattern of decrease in regional-level turnover during the late Paleozoic and (2) a perceived pattern of greater persistence in late versus early Paleozoic biotic gradients.\n    In Chapter 3, I focus on regional taxonomic richness and compare regional diversity trends for the Illinois Basin to global patterns that have been reported previously in the literature. Sample standardized estimates of regional taxonomic diversity and guild diversity remain nearly constant across the onset of the LPIA, despite a documented 28% decline in global diversity. The transition to the LPIA is also associated with very low levels of turnover: 76% to 92% of taxa persist from pre-LPIA sequences into the ice age interval.  The onset of glacially driven high amplitude eustasy failed to affect significantly levels of regional diversity and faunal turnover during the LPIA interval. These results suggest that: (1) global and regional diversity patterns were decoupled across the onset of the LPIA and the timing or magnitude of extinction may have varied geographically across the globe; and (2) the major transition to the LPIA and associated high amplitude glacio-eustasy failed to strongly influence levels of regional diversity and turnover in the Illinois Basin. Thus, faunal persistence, not diversification or extinction, appears to be the normal biotic response to glacio-eustasy in the region, during the LPIA interval. \n    Chapter 4 provides the first study of its kind to compare geographic and temporal patterns of taxonomic richness, turnover, faunal composition, and ecosystem structure within and between correlative sequences in two separate depositional basins.  This chapter builds upon the results displayed in chapters 2 and 3 by providing an important and comparable dataset from the Appalachian Basin, against which Illinois Basin faunal patterns can be compared.  Therefore, this chapter makes a significant first step toward understanding the meaning of global LPIA biotic curves by resolving spatial complexity in faunal patterns between regions. Results from rarefaction and faunal turnover analyses indicate that taxonomic diversity, community structure, and faunal turnover did not vary significantly with geography, within or between depositional sequences.  I suggest that interregional phenomena, including open connectivity between basins and the presence of similar environmental settings in each region, allowed for the establishment of comparable faunas in each basin; in turn these biotas responded in parallel ways to eustatic fluctuations between sequences. Following my discussion, I outline a research agenda for future regional studies that I believe will enrich the understanding of the biotic consequences of the LPIA and the meaning of LPIA global diversity data.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2950], "author_name_tesi": "Bonelli, James Rocco", "last_name_ssi": "Bonelli", "middle_name_ssi": "Rocco", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark E Patzkowsky", "Peter Daniel Wilf", "Timothy Bralower", "Alan Walker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark E Patzkowsky, Committee Chair", "Peter Daniel Wilf, Committee Member", "Timothy Bralower, Committee Member", "Alan Walker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["paleoecology", "paleobiology", "late Paleozoic Ice Age", "biofacies", "paleo-biodiversity"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Gravitational radiation with a positive cosmological constant", "id": "14161bpb165", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14161", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Gravitational radiation is well-understood in spacetimes that are asymptotically flat.\nHowever, our Universe is currently expanding at an accelerated rate, which is best described by including a positive cosmological constant, $\\Lambda$, in Einstein's equations.\nConsequently, no matter how far one recedes from sources generating gravitational waves, spacetime curvature never dies and is not asymptotically flat.\nThis dissertation provides first steps to incorporate $\\Lambda$ in the study of gravitational radiation by analyzing linearized gravitational waves on a de Sitter background.\n \nSince the asymptotic structure of de Sitter is very different from that of Minkowski spacetime, many conceptual and technical difficulties arise.\nThe limit $\\Lambda \\to 0$ can be discontinuous:\nAlthough energy carried by gravitational waves is always positive in Minkowski spacetime, it can be arbitrarily negative in de Sitter spacetime.\nAdditionally, many of the standard techniques, including $1/r$ expansions, are no longer applicable.\n \nWe generalize Einstein's celebrated quadrupole formula describing the power radiated on a flat background to de Sitter spacetime.\nEven a tiny $\\Lambda$ brings in qualitatively new features such as contributions from pressure quadrupole moments.\nNonetheless, corrections induced by $\\Lambda$ are $\\ord (\\sqrt{\\Lambda} t_c)$ with $t_c$ the characteristic time scale of the source and are negligible for current gravitational wave observatories.\nWe demonstrate this explicitly for a binary system in a circular orbit.\n \nRadiative modes are encoded in the transverse-traceless part of the spatial components of a gravitational perturbation.\nWhen $\\Lambda=0$, one typically extracts these modes in the wave zone by projecting the gravitational perturbation onto the two-sphere orthogonal to the radial direction.\nWe show that this method for waves emitted by spatially compact sources on Minkowski spacetime generically does not yield the transverse-traceless modes;

In this experimental investigation, a cylindrical shell with a smooth internal surface is subjected to TBL excitation from water in fully developed pipe flow at 6.1 m/s. The cylinder\u2019s vibration response is used to inversely determine low wavenumber TBL surface pressure and shear stress levels. A three-dimensional experimental modal analysis is also conducted on the water-filled cylindrical shell to determine structural parameters used to extract these levels.\nThe cylinder\u2019s radial vibration response for certain lightly damped modes is used to determine TBL surface pressure at lower streamwise wavenumbers than previously reported (k1/kc < 0.01). The nearly constant low wavenumber pressure level determined from these measurements is roughly 40 dB below the convective peak level. This level falls midway between the Smol\u2019yakov (2006) and Chase (1987) TBL models and is roughly 25 dB lower than the Corcos (1964) model. The current data is a few decibels below the lower bound of related measurements in air by Farabee and Geib (1975) and Martin and Leehey (1977). Simple wavenumber white forms for the TBL surface pressure spectrum at low wavenumber are discussed.\nLow wavenumber fluctuating shear stress levels in both the cross-flow and streamwise directions are determined using directionally uncoupled low-order cylinder modes in the circumferential and axial directions. This data addresses a critical gap in available literature regarding experimental low wavenumber shear stress data. The low wavenumber shear stress levels in both the cross-flow and streamwise directions are determined to be roughly 10 dB higher than those of normal pressure. As is the case for various models of TBL pressure, these measurements suggest that a nearly constant value for normalized shear stress at low wavenumber is valid over a broad range of frequencies.

Specific attention is given to issues of factorial invariance, the theorized causal direction between indicators and constructs, and whether the intended use of the test if for diagnostic screening or for individual differences research. When clinical checklists, which often have dichotomous (yes/no) or polytomous (never, sometimes, always) response formats are used in individual differences research, measurement issues need to be reviewed because decisions made during the development of a diagnostic instrument often differ from decisions made in the course of developing an instrument intended to quantify inter-individual and intra-individual differences. In addition, factorial invariance procedures for constructs with categorical (i.e., dichotomous or poytomous) indicators, and the associated confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) model are examined. These goals are advanced through the application of polytomous CFA modeling of two checklist instruments: The Developmental Behavior Checklist, and the short form of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire.  First, a general review is undertaken of the factorial invariance literature, causal directions in factor analytic models, and recent extensions that permit factor analytic models of polytomous test items. Next the factor structure of the Developmental Behavior Checklist is examined using polytomous CFA. Issues of causal direction, factorially complex items, and simple structure are discussed. Finally, polytomous CFA models are used to investigate the factorial invariance of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire across gender and late-adult age groups. In polytomous factor models a latent continuous response variable underlying each observed categorical indicator is connected to the observed indicators by calculating the cutpoint (or threshold) needed to produce the observed response frequencies. Since these thresholds are all that connects the actual data to the factor model, it is essential that investigations of invariance test the threshold parameters in addition to the usual test of loadings and item-specific variances. However, the additional measurement model parameters in polytomous CFA presents issues for the specification and identification of an appropriate baseline model for nested invariance tests. This problem is addressed by using two interdependent nested sequences. One sequence permits testing of measurement thresholds and loadings, while assuming invariance of item-specific variance, and the other sequence permits testing of the item-specific variances by assuming threshold invariance.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1355], "author_name_tesi": "Bontempo, Daniel Edward", "last_name_ssi": "Bontempo", "middle_name_ssi": "Edward", "first_name_ssi": "Daniel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Scott Hofer", "Andrea Piccinin", "Steven Howard Zarit", "Clancy Blair", "Jon F Nussbaum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Scott Hofer, Committee Chair", "Andrea Piccinin, Committee Member", "Steven Howard Zarit, Committee Member", "Clancy Blair, Committee Member", "Jon F Nussbaum, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["polutomous factor models", "factorial invariance", "measurement equivalence"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Basal Roughness at Upper Thwaites Glacier\n", "id": "11973", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6639", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-05-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The basal roughness of glaciers and ice sheets is an important parameter controlling ice flow.  \nIce will generally slide faster over a smoother bed than a rougher one, but the horizontal scale of roughness is as important as its amplitude. Studies of basal roughness to date have used airborne radar data, which capture kilometer-scale roughness well, but for which it is challenging to resolve the smaller-scale roughness that is likely more important to ice flow. Here we present the results of a ground-based radar survey to study basal roughness on the scale of 10s to 100s of \nmeters, and relate these observations to basal conditions. The data are from Thwaites Glacier, \nWest Antarctica, one of the largest and fastest-flowing outlet glaciers on the continent, as well as one that is thinning rapidly and contributing to sea-level rise. We assess the value of different methods for quantitatively characterizing roughness using radar data, including bed-echo intensities, along-track root-mean-square (RMS) deviation of the basal topography, and spectral and wavelet analysis of the basal topography. We find that roughness is greater across-flow than along-flow, and greater downstream than upstream in our study area. This spatial organization results from a combination of pre-existing topography and glacial erosion. The multi-method analysis allows us to robustly characterize basal roughness in our study area. We correlate our results with existing models of greater basal shear stress downstream, and infer the presence of subglacial water. Finally, we clarify the nature of the relationship between basal conditions and roughness and relate our findings to those of similar studies. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6637], "author_name_tesi": "Boon, Xiang Ying Rebecca ", "last_name_ssi": "Boon", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiang Ying Rebecca", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sridhar Anandakrishnan", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Thesis Advisor", "Sridhar Anandakrishnan, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thwaites Glacier", "wavelets", "spectral analysis", "roughness", "melt", "glaciers", "ice", "geophysics", "glaciology", "geoscience", "roughness"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EFFECT OF THE MYXOVIRUS RESISTANCE PROTEIN, MX1, ON SECRETION BY A UTERINE CELL LINE.\n", "id": "12146", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5759", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In cattle, substantial embryonic loss occurs during the peri-implantation period resulting in losses approaching half a billion dollars annually.  During the peri-implantation period the conceptus must signal to the maternal uterus to maintain pregnancy.  In ruminants, this signal is interferon tau (IFNT), which blocks the endometrial luteolytic mechanism, allowing the corpus luteum (CL) to continue producing progesterone and support pregnancy.  Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are upregulated by IFNT during this period and are thought to play crucial roles in supporting conceptus growth, differentiation, and embryo implantation.  Two of these ISGs encode the myxovirus resistance proteins MX1 and MX2.  Recently, MX1 was demonstrated to be a secreted protein that apparently regulated secretion of another protein, interferon stimulated gene-15 (ISG15).  Interestingly, both of these proteins are secreted via one of the relatively uncharacterized \u201cunconventional\u201d secretory pathways leading to the hypothesis that MX1 is a regulator of unconventional secretion.  This would be critical during early pregnancy because the conceptus is entirely dependent upon endometrial secretions for survival prior to attachment and placentation.  \nMethods for the quantification of the MX1 protein are only semi-quantitative, consisting of protein immunoblotting/ western blotting, which can be quite variable from blot to blot.  Therefore, the first objective of these studies was to develop a Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) assay for ovine MX1 (oMX1).  This assay was validated by detecting known amounts of recombinant (r) oMX1 in different diluents over the range of 2.4-10,000 ng/mL and in bovine plasma over the range of 2.4-40,000 ng/mL.  \nOnce this assay was developed and successfully measuring MX1 protein, we began the main objective of the present studies, which was to determine the effects of MX1 on secretion by uterine epithelial cells using a combination of inhibition and overexpression assays. For the inhibition assay, morpholino antisense oligonucleotides were used to induce transient \u201cknock-down\u201d of the MX1 protein in a uterine epithelial cell line, oGE.  The MSD assay was then used to quantify the inhibition of MX1 in oGE cell lysates.  The assay quantified the MX1 reduction in lysates to be approximately 52% \u00b1 52 ng of MX1/mL.   Potentially regulated proteins included ISG15 and galectin-1 (LGALS1), which were both reduced with the inhibition of MX1. Interestingly, glalectin-15 (LGALS15) increased in secretions with the inhibition of MX1.  These three proteins are all unconventionally secreted proteins.  The secretion of the conventionally secreted protein, cathepsin L (CSTL), showed increased secretion of the 5-kDa active form/subunit with the inhibition of MX1 as well. \nFor the overexpression assay, an MX1 cDNA was cloned into a pCMV-Myc mammalian expression vector, which was used to overexpress the MX1 protein in oGE cells.  Treatment with the overexpression plasmid resulted in robust overexpression of the MX1 protein in both lysates and secretions from these cells, but there was ultimately no difference in the unconventionally or conventionally secreted proteins examined. \nAs a second objective, we examined cellular proteins whose patterns of secretion change when MX1 is altered using 2D SDS PAGE and mass spectrometry.  Samples from the overexpression and inhibition assays previously described were utilized in this study.  In the MX1 inhibitions gels, 8 proteins were potentially identified that were inhibited when MX1 was inhibited (WD repeat-containing protein 38 (WDR38), serpin peptidase inhibitor (SERPIN), alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG), triosephosphate isomerase-1(TPI1), peroxiredoxin-6 (GPX6), malate dehydrogenase 1B (MDH1B), ankyrin repeat and IBR domain-containing 1(ANKIB1), lim domain 7 (LMO7)), and 2 proteins were potentially identified in spots that increased when MX1 was inhibited (cystatin E/M (CST6), toll-like receptor 1(TLR1)).  In the overexpression gels, 4 proteins were potentially identified in spots that were increased as well (SERPIN, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), MDH1B).  The quality score and the percent coverage (percent of matched peptides between the potential proteins and the peptides recovered from the chosen spot) varied for each of the potentially identified proteins.  \nThe experiments in this thesis further define the role of MX1 in secretion and provide evidence that does not support the hypothesis that MX1 is a broad regulator of unconventional secretion. However, because some unconventionally secreted proteins but no conventionally secreted proteins were reduced when MX1 was inhibited, our hypothesis is partially supported and MX1 may regulate a specific pathway in unconventional secretion.  Overall, the results presented here point to a more complex role of MX1 with some proteins of each class being affected.  The free-floating preattached embryo is completely dependent upon the endometrial secretory milieu for survival prior to attachment and placentation.  If MX1 has a role in regulating endometrial secretory processes during early pregnancy, it would therefore have a direct role in embryo survival.  From this work, it will be important to; 1) determine if MX1 regulates secretion in any other tissues; 2) determine what specific proteins are regulated by MX1 and; 3) gather more evidence about the complex role MX1 possesses in regulating secretion.  Understanding the factors associated with conceptus survival, including how the conceptus regulates endometrial secretion, could lead to techniques to reduce early embryonic mortality.  Importantly, MX1 may play a direct role in regulating these functions by regulating endometrial secretory processes, necessary for embryo survival until placentation.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5755], "author_name_tesi": "Boone, Shannon Rae", "last_name_ssi": "Boone", "middle_name_ssi": "Rae", "first_name_ssi": "Shannon", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Animal Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Troy Ott", "Troy Ott"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Troy Ott, Thesis Advisor", "Troy Ott, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Reproductive Physiology", "MX1", "MYXOVIRUS RESISTANCE PROTEIN", "ovine", "secretion"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "Mother-Adolescent Sexuality Communication in a Developmental Context", "id": "6182", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6210", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-10-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Due to current rates of adolescent sexual activity, unintended pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infection including HIV/AIDS, much attention has recently focused on strategies for reducing the incidence of these occurrences. This focus has resulted in examinations of mother-adolescent sexuality communication as a predictor of sexual attitudes and behaviors. Much of the research in this area, however, has relied on single reporter self-reports of sexuality communication, and has assumed a direct association between communication and adolescent sexual attitudes and behaviors. The current study was designed to examine mother-adolescent sexuality communication, and to place the association between such communication and the sexual attitudes and behaviors of adolescents in the context of adolescent individuation and identity development. Mothers and their 15 to 18 year old male and female adolescents participated in the study. Each mother-adolescent dyad engaged in a videotaped conversation about sexuality, and completed questionnaires. Mothers who demonstrated more receptivity had adolescents who perceived less vulnerability to AIDS and more barriers to condom use. In addition, adolescents who rated their mothers as more responsive during previous sexuality conversations reported less perceived vulnerability to AIDS and fewer positive expectations for the protective abilities of condoms. Adolescents of mothers who displayed more composure were more connected to their mothers, and those who rated their mothers as more receptive were both more connected to their mothers and felt more independent from their control. Adolescent connectedness to mother and independence from mother did not, however, relate to adolescent sexual attitudes, precluding the hypothesized mediation. Adolescents whose mothers were more responsive reported identity commitments in more domains. In turn, adolescents with more identity commitments perceived less vulnerability to AIDS and had fewer positive expectations for condom use, but adolescent identity commitment did not act as a mediator. Although the associations between mothers\u2019 communication and adolescent sexual attitudes were in the direction opposite of that predicted, the relations that were found indicate that mothers\u2019 communication does relate to adolescent sexual attitudes.

This has not been the case in multinational corporations.  The multinational corporation is one of the contexts in which conflict plays a crucial role, however.  Understanding conflict interactions, as well as the way in which people from different cultures perceive conflict behavior, can enhance the working environment, not to mention benefit organizations in various ways. \nThe purpose of this study was to explore Thais\u2019 and Americans\u2019 preferences for styles of conflict management and the way they perceive these styles in terms of competence.  The individualistic-collectivistic orientation of Thai and American participants in the study was determined to see how they fit into the general assumptions concerning the two types.  This study also explored how such variables as gender, culture of the conflict counterpart (in-group/out-group), and exposure to other cultures relates to these preferences and the perceptions.  Both quantitative and qualitative methods were employed to obtain a more precise and complete picture of conflict phenomena in multicultural organizations.  The quantitative part of the study involved 319 Thai and American participants from 73 American-owned/co-owned multinational corporations in Thailand, and the qualitative part involved 27 interviewees from 13 such companies. \nMore often than not, the statistical and interview data were consistent.  In regard to the preference for styles of conflict management, both statistical and interview analyses indicated that Thais preferred nonconfrontational indirect conflict styles (e.g., avoiding and obliging) more than Americans did.  However, Thais also reported enacting direct confrontational styles (e.g., integrating, and compromising) to an extent similar to that of American participants.  Dominating styles were reportedly displayed by Americans more than by Thais in the qualitative examination, but ANOVA results showed no significant differences in preferences.  In addition to the five styles, interview data showed that Americans resorted to third-party help and emotional expression more than did Thais.  Thais exclusively used neglect and a combination of styles.  \nThe survey and interview data showed slightly different results for perceived competence.  Both methods indicated that American and Thai participants evaluated integrating and compromising, or the direct, open, and honest expressions of ideas, more favorably than they did other styles, with Americans mentioning this topic more frequently than did Thais in qualitative examination.  However, whereas ANOVA showed that Thais did not rate avoiding and obliging as highly as expected in competence, the qualitative part of the study revealed that Thais, nevertheless, focused on harmonious relationships and mutual face concerns to a much greater extent than did Americans.  Dominating was viewed as relatively low in competence by both Thai and American participants in the quantitative analysis; on the other hand, in the interviews, Americans saw aggressiveness or emotional displays as more acceptable than Thais did.\nNational and organizational culture tended to have a considerable effect on the ways Americans and Thais dealt with conflict.  For the most part, the participants reported values that were consistent with their expected individualistic-collectivistic orientations. Some deviation occurred in the manner that Thais reported relying on many individualistic values, such as directness and task accomplishment, more than Americans reported adopting collectivistic values.  From the discussion regarding values and practices in their organizations, it appeared that most organizations in the study relied on the Cultural Dominance Model, which emphasized reliance on management\u2019s standards as basis for policy formation and behavioral guidance.    \nFor the effects of the culture of the counterpart on conflict behavior and perceptions of it, the qualitative results indicated that Americans and Thais tended to assess the behavior of the conflict targets on the basis of similar criteria, regardless of the culture backgrounds of the other person.  Different reactions toward Thai and American target cultures were prevalent.  However, when different behavior or judgment criteria were reported, they were expressed in a way that showed understanding, adaptability, and cultural sensitivity.  Neither Thais nor Americans appeared to be biased in favor of their in-groups.  The quantitative analysis showed similar results for Thai participants\u2019 perceptions. The small number of American participants did not allow for the test of American perceptions toward different conflict targets.\nGender stereotypes relating to preferences for and evaluations of conflict styles did not appear to be operative in this study, as no differences in the preference for conflict styles between males and females surfaced.  In respect to perceptions of competence, males and females tended to show small differences in their evaluation of styles.  When different evaluations occurred, in large part, they ran counter to gender stereotypes (e.g., males evaluated obliging as higher in effectiveness than other styles).  \nStatistical analysis revealed only a few significant results for the correlations of exposure to other cultures to preferences for given styles or perceptions of corresponding levels of competence.  In contrast, the qualitative examination showed that exposure to other cultures seemingly affected Americans and Thais\u2019 behavior and perceptions in conflict situations substantially.  The evidence produced from these two methods led to the conclusion that exposure to other cultures may influence Americans and Thais in conflict situations in many ways; however, the impact showed in a variety of aspects of conflict phenomena, not merely conflict styles nor perceptions regarding each style.   \nIn addition, and contrary to expectations, ANOVA results revealed that Thai participants scored higher on the individualism scale (INDCOL) than American participants did.  However, the data were not sufficient to reject the assumption that the Thai participants tended more toward collectivism than did the American participants.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6569], "author_name_tesi": "Boonsathorn, Wasita ", "last_name_ssi": "Boonsathorn", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wasita", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Speech Communication", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dennis Stephen Gouran", "Ronald L Jackson Ii", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Judith Ann Kolb"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dennis Stephen Gouran, Committee Chair", "Ronald L Jackson Ii, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Judith Ann Kolb, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["intercultural workplace", "multinational corporation", "intercultural communication", "organizational communication", "conflict management", "conflict management styles", "conflict", "intercultural competence", "communication competence", "Thai", "Thailand", "qualitative", "quantitative", "mixed methods"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "SYNTHETIC MIMICS OF MAMMALIAN CELL SURFACE RECEPTORS", "id": "6960", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5749", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-01-05T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Receptors on the surface of mammalian cells function as sensors and mediators of uptake of specific ligands in the extracellular environment. These biomolecules reside on the cellular plasma membrane, the protective lipid bilayer that envelops the cell to guard the fragile inner cellular machinery from potentially toxic or opportunistic extracellular materials. Only small hydrophobic compounds passively diffuse across this hydrophobic barrier to rapidly penetrate into cells. More hydrophilic macromolecules such as proteins and DNA generally require specific active transport mechanisms to access the cell interior. Cell surface receptors are components of this active transport machinery and deliver cargo such as nutrients and growth factors into cells via the uptake process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. \nMammalian cell surface receptors comprise at least three basic components: a ligand recognition motif projecting from the cell surface, a linker region, and a membrane-binding element that anchors the receptor to the plasma membrane. Receptors on the surface of mammalian cells promote the uptake of cell-impermeable ligands by receptor-mediated endocytosis. To mimic this process, we synthesized small molecules designed to project ligand-binding motifs from the surface of living mammalian cells. These synthetic receptors comprise N-alkyl derivatives of 3\u0192\u00d2-cholesterylamine as the plasma membrane anchor linked to binding motifs that target cell-impermeable macro and small molecules such as antidinitrophenyl IgG, proteins fused to oligohistidine, human IgG, and the antibiotic vancomycin.\nThe cellular uptake of ligands mediated by 3\u0192\u00d2\u0192{cholesterylamine derived synthetic receptors is proposed to mimic endocytic cellular penetration mechanisms employed by certain protein toxins and viruses. These mechanisms are highly complex at the molecular level and are thought to involve plasma membrane subdomains termed lipid rafts and/or endocytosis involving the protein clathrin. These nonnatural receptors mimic many natural receptors by avidly associating with cell surfaces (typical cellular t1/2 ~ 20 h), dynamically cycling between plasma membranes and intracellular endosomes (typical recycling t1/2 ~ 3 min), association with proposed lipid raft membrane microdomains, and delivery of cell-impermeable ligands to late endosomes/lysosomes.

Ammonia (NH\u00ac\u00ac3) is an air pollutant and irritant that has been recognized to cause various clinical signs in people and animals, including the development of respiratory disease.  Ammonia concentrations in the microenvironment of laboratory rodents can be altered based upon housing and husbandry practices.  These differences could potentially serve as a variable in certain research models, especially those involving respiratory investigations.   In this study, female C57BL/6J mice were separated into groups that were either housed in individually ventilated or filter-topped caging without forced ventilation (hereafter referred to as static caging), and cages changed at either 1 or 2 week intervals.  Within 5 days, static cages reached a significantly higher concentration of NH\u00ac\u00ac3 than the ventilated cages.  The effect of this ammonia exposure on pulmonary inflammation, pathogen clearance, and surfactant levels after intranasal challenge with Mycoplasma pulmonis infection was then assessed.  Baseline levels of inflammation, prior to infection, tended to be higher in mice housed in static cages and for mice that had their cages changed at 2 week intervals, however these differences were not statistically significant.  Exposure to higher concentrations of ammonia exacerbated the mycoplasmal infection in mice housed in static cages, causing them to have higher CFU counts in the earlier stages of infection when compared to mice in ventilated cages.  Mice in static cages also experienced a rapid decrease in pulmonary mycoplasma burden, while mice in ventilated cages had a much slower rate of clearance. The effect of mycoplasma on pulmonary surfactant proteins was characterized by a significant increase of surfactant protein A (SP-A) at 3 days post-infection. SP-A levels resolved back to baseline by 14 days post-infection.  The observed variation in mycoplasma infection and fluctuation of local humoral immunity may have confounding effects on mice used as models of respiratory disease.

computations encompass a wide range of applications including high performance computing (HPC) and more recently desktop applications.\nThough diverse, these applications share the trait of irregular data accesses leading to poor performance and increased energy consumption.\nIrregular data access has become an even greater concern for applications as computer systems have more computational cores that share complex levels of memory.\nAccesses within these levels are penalized based on the distance between core and memory, and may affect the performance of other threads.\nIn order to mitigate challenges with parallel sparse computations, this work considers two parts, namely, hybrid linear solvers and model-driven performance optimization.\n\nThe first part considers methods of improving hybrid sparse linear solvers.\nMany large parallel simulations rely on repeated solves of sparse linear systems.\nThese solves become a bottleneck if they are not completed in a timely manner using limited memory.\nFurthermore, sparse linear systems from large simulations may be ill-conditioned to some degree, and fast iterative methods may not be efficient.\nIn such cases, direct solvers that rely on factorization are preferred, but come with some additional cost in both execution time and memory.\nAn alternative to direct solvers is the use of hybrid solvers that use a combination of iterative and direct methods.\nWe present work that demonstrates how hybrid solvers can be used efficiently to solve for multiple right-hand side vectors and two novel hybrid solver formulations, called substituted factorization, that may outperform direct solvers in both execution time and memory required.\n\nThe second part considers model-driven optimization of parallel sparse computation applications.\nWith more cores sharing resources in a shared-memory system, tasks, such as tuning, optimizing, and profiling, become more difficult.\nIdeally, developers want to identify segments of code that are poor-performing and lack efficient energy use for both new and large legacy codes.\nSegments defined by a particular performance and power usage are commonly known as phases.\nThis part presents a model-driven method for identifying unique phases in an application that relies on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).\nModels from this method provide information on which segments have particular traits, length of time spent in a phase, and transition between phases.\nWe use this phase-aware method to correctly identify phases with a bad performance to power ratio that is resulting in high energy.\nBy identifying phases, we demonstrate how a static schedule for dynamic voltage and frequency scaling can be constructed that reduces the energy of these applications.\n  \n    \n",

This context is particularly significant given: (a) teens in the United States search for nutrition and exercise information more than any other types of health information online (Wartella et al., 2015), (b) there is an expansive amalgamation of both healthy and disordered fitness content on social media (Carrotte et al., 2015), and (c) a growing body of research suggests that young people make real health-related decisions based on the information they find online (Fox & Duggan, 2013). \nTwo theories inform this study's design. The first is Gasser et al.'s (2012) Youth-Oriented Information Quality Theoretical Framework, which emphasizes a process and context-oriented approach to understanding how youth make decisions about online content. Developed by scholars at the Youth and Media Center at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University, this framework explores how youth search for, evaluate, and create information online and use these processes to make decisions about information quality.\nBuilding on an IS foundation invested in how diverse users interact with information and technology, the second theoretical foundation is an Intersectionality approach. Rather than examining singular categories of identity characteristics (race, gender, socioeconomic status, etc.), the guiding research questions ask how intersections of young users' identities relate to their search, evaluation, and creation processes. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 teenagers (ages 13-18) in the United States to examine the ways in which the intersections of identity characteristics relate to the ways in which young people make decisions about the fitness information they interact with via social media. Data collection and analysis were informed by a hybrid interpretive-critical epistemology that values the subjective experiences and realities of the participants, while also exploring the structural and systemic inequalities that inform these experiences. \nThe results suggest that young people care about and have active strategies for determining the quality of visual and textual fitness information via social media and that differences emerge across participants' intersecting identities. This dissertation contributes to: (a) theory by applying and extending Gasser et al.'s (2012) preliminary framework and, (b) methodology by offering a reconciliation between the identity vs. structure debate as to how to conduct Intersectionality research through a blended interpretive-critical epistemological approach. In terms of practice, this youth-oriented approach provides insight into what teens are already doing to make decisions about high-stakes online content, as well as how to move forward to collaboratively build educational interventions that develop these skills. These interventions are particularly critical to build at a time of fake news, when society is asking large-scale questions about media, information, and truth. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16931], "author_name_tesi": "Booth, Kayla M", "last_name_ssi": "Booth", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Kayla", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eileen Trauth", "Eileen Trauth", "Lynette Yarger", "Michael McNeese", "Karen Treat Keifer-Boyd"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eileen Trauth, Dissertation Advisor", "Eileen Trauth, Committee Chair", "Lynette Yarger, Committee Member", "Michael McNeese, Committee Member", "Karen Treat Keifer-Boyd, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Information Quality", "Youth", "Intersectionality", "Social Media", "Information Behavior", "Teens"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "THE EFFECTS OF THE MICROBIOME IN ENDOCRINE VITAMIN D METABOLISM", "id": "14183sub224", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14183", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with bone diseases like osteoporosis and immune- mediated disease like inflammatory bowel disease. Endocrine vitamin D metabolism is thought to be controlled by calcium intake and other hormones that interact to regulate mineral homeostasis, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the parathyroid gland and fibroblast growth factor (FGF23) from bone. The gut microbiome consists of trillions of cells that have coevolved with their hosts to influence nutrition, metabolism, and immune function. There is evidence the microbiome regulates bone health, indicating a link between the gut microbiome and endocrine vitamin D metabolism. Using antibiotic treatments and colonization of germ free mice, I examined the effects of host-microbial interactions on regulation of endocrine vitamin D metabolism. My research showed disrupting the microbiome with antibiotics increased FGF23 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a stable vitamin D metabolite used as a marker of vitamin D status. These changes were dependent on signaling through toll-like receptors. Colonization of germ free mice decreased host FGF23, leading to increased levels of hormonal vitamin D and circulating calcium. In both antibiotics treated mice and colonized mice, changes in FGF23 and vitamin D metabolites were associated with changes in TNF-\u03b1.

However, there is very limited public domain research on the erosion resistance conveyed by multilayer hard coatings.  In addition, data from multilayer coating studies may present seemingly contradictory results due to the wide variation in coating systems and coating architectures investigated.  This thesis presents a systematic study of multilayer coatings based on TiN/Ti and TiN/X, where X = Zr, Hf, or Nb, in order to determine the effect of multilayer coating design and interlayer materials on the hard particle erosion resistance of these coating systems.\nMultilayer coatings were eroded using glass beads, quartz and alumina media, with particle velocities ranging from 75 to 180 m/s.  Erosion performance was found to depend strongly on the TiN/Ti coating multilayer design architecture and the erosion conditions.  Coatings with two layers, one of TiN, the other a thin titanium bond layer, gave optimal erosion performance against the alumina erodent, whereas coatings with 32 layers (16 each of TiN and Ti) with a high volume fraction of titanium, offered the best erosion performance against the glass bead erodent.\nTiN-based coatings with interlayers of Ti, Zr, Hf, and Nb were compared to determine the effect of interlayer material on erosion performance.  High values of Vickers microhardness were found to correlate with poor erosion performance.  The TiN/Zr multilayer coatings exhibited the worst durability for all erosion conditions, followed by TiN/Hf.  The TiN/Nb multilayer coatings provided the best durability for quartz and glass bead erodents.  Although TiN/Ti coatings showed better durability than TiN/Nb against alumina particles, this discrepancy was attributed to the thinner than anticipated total thickness of the TiN/Nb coatings.\t\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [840], "author_name_tesi": "Borawski, Brian ", "last_name_ssi": "Borawski", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith Todd", "Douglas Edward Wolfe", "Jogender Singh", "Albert Eliot Segall"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith Todd, Committee Chair", "Douglas Edward Wolfe, Committee Chair", "Jogender Singh, Committee Member", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["impact", "coating", "thin film", "fracture", "mechanics", "ceramics", "erosion", "physical vapor deposition", "titanium nitride"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Numerical Simulation of Transport and Uptake of Reactive Air Pollutants in Healthy and Diseased Human Lungs", "id": "13121swb5357", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13121", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Exposure to reactive air pollutants can initiate or exacerbate respiratory health problems, and absorption of inhaled toxicants can occur in all regions of the respiratory tract, from the nose to deep in the lung.

In order to determine whether individuals with disease-modified lung geometries are at higher risk of lung injury (compared to those with healthy lung geometries) as a result of exposure to harmful inhaled pollutants, numerical simulations of reactive gas transport and uptake were performed in anatomically-accurate human lung geometries reconstructed from high-resolution multidimensional computer tomography (MDCT) chest scans of two consenting adult males.

The approach used will be to analyze the spatial influence of the array transducer on the wavelength and wavenumber of the excited guided wave modes.  While this approach does not produce results that are fully optimized for a given structure, it yields a complete independence from the material or waveguide to be inspected and thus is valid for any structure to which the transducer is applied.  This makes it more versatile in that it can be easily applied to various structures and to structures for which the entire wavestructure solution or material properties are not fully known.  A comparison of the excitation spectra between comb and annular arrays will be performed to determine the similarities and differences between the two.  The properties of the excitation spectrum are analyzed to determine optimum annular array transducer design parameters including inner radius, element width, width-spacing ratio, and number of elements, as well as to determine how these various parameters ultimately affect the excitation properties of the transducer considering features like primary wavelength excitation, main peak separation, sidelobes, and effective range of wavelength control.  Methods will be developed to determine the applied time delays required to preferentially excite various regions of the dispersion curve using the excitation spectrum alone.  In addition to this, the wave mode excitability for various types of transducer loading will be considered, and the effect of this factor will be taken into account to predict optimum mode excitation with linearly phased annular array elements, considering both excitation spectrum and mode excitability.  It will be shown that very good agreement exists between predicted waveforms and FE results.  FE and experimental validation is provided.

In-flight icing can lead to dramatic decreases in lift and increases in drag that have caused more than a thousand deaths and hundreds of accidents over the past three decades alone. Current ice protection technologies have substantial drawbacks due to weight, power consumption, environmental concerns, or incompatibility with certain structures. In this research, an actuator phasing method for ultrasonic de-icing of aircraft structures was developed and tested using a series of finite element models, 3D scanning laser Doppler vibrometer measurements, and experimental de-icing tests on metallic and composite structures including plates and airfoils.\n\nAn independent actuator analysis method was developed to allow for practical evaluation of many actuator phasing scenarios using a limited number of finite element models by properly calculating the phased stress fields and electromechanical impedance curves using a complex coupled impedance model. A genetic algorithm was utilized in conjunction with a series of finite element models to demonstrate that phase inversion, in which only in-phase and anti-phase signal components are applied to actuators, can be utilized with a small number of phasing combinations to achieve substantial improvements in de-icing system coverage. Finite element models of a 48\u201d-long airfoil predicted that phase inversion with frequency sweeping can provide an improvement in the shear stress coverage levels of up to 90% compared to frequency sweeping alone. Experimental evaluation of the phasing approach on an icing grid showed a 189% improvement in de-icing coverage compared to frequency sweeping alone at comparable power levels. 3D scanning laser Doppler vibrometer measurements confirmed the increased variation in the surface vibration field induced by actuator phasing compared to unphased frequency sweeping.\n\nAdditional contributions were made to facilitate actuator phasing and to advance the state-of-the-art in ultrasonic de-icing technology. These contributions include the development of improved frequency optimization, reduction in the size of the system hardware, and improvements in actuator bonding techniques. It was demonstrated that a dynamic frequency selection method is critical to effectively implementing the actuator phasing method. A miniaturized relay system was also designed and implemented to facilitate actuator phasing in conjunction with a phase splitter circuit and a single amplifier. An improved frequency tuning method was adopted and implemented in the de-icing system to eliminate the need for an impedance analyzer and to provide more accurate frequency selection by directly measuring the forward and reflected power between the amplifier and the de-icing actuators.\n\nOverall, it was demonstrated that this novel method can greatly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the ultrasonic de-icing system by effectively redistributing the shear stress fields at the ice-structure interface, and that this method can be practically implemented in the de-icing system with an overall reduction in size and weight compared to previous versions of the technology.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10183], "author_name_tesi": "Borigo, Cody J", "last_name_ssi": "Borigo", "middle_name_ssi": "J", "first_name_ssi": "Cody", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Joseph Lawrence Rose", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Edward C Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Joseph Lawrence Rose, Dissertation Advisor", "Joseph Lawrence Rose, Committee Chair", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Edward C Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["de-icing", "aircraft", "ultrasound", "ultrasonic", "vibration", "ice protection", "anti-icing", "phasing", "piezoelectric"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "COPING WITH UNCERTAINTY IN WATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT THROUGH CHOICES OF POLICY INSTRUMENTS AND INFORMATION INVESTMENTS", "id": "6171", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6107", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Traditionally, information collection for water quality management has been focused on biological data to describe environmental conditions, and stressor-condition-response relationships.  While this kind of information is essential, other types of information \u2013 e.g., economic information about the benefits and costs of alternative policy actions \u2013 may be equally important for efficient management. \nIn this dissertation, I examine the performance of alternative strategies for managing ecological risks related to nutrient pollution in the Susquehanna River Basin (SRB) under alternative economic and ecological information structures. The SRB is the major source of nutrient pollution and related ecological damages in the Chesapeake Bay. The water quality management strategies are differentiated by nutrient reduction targets for subwatersheds of the SRB, and the environmental instruments used to pursue these goals. I define performance as the expected net benefits (pollution control benefits less costs) achieved by the strategies.  The analysis allows me to estimate how the reduction of economic and ecological uncertainty can influence the optimal design of the strategies, and also estimate the value of different types of information in improving the performance of the strategies.   \nThe study is based on a coupled numerical economic-biophysical model. Uncertainty is modeled by randomizing the values of model parameters using Monte Carlo simulation techniques.  The results show that the value of all types of information is strongly dependent on the policy instruments used in water quality management. I also find that information about the economic benefits of pollution reductions has the highest value regardless of the management strategies.  The value of information and policy performance results are sensitive to the assumptions about the functional forms and initial amount of information available to water quality managers.  However, the relative performance of alternative policy instruments and relative ranking of information collection strategies are independent from the assumptions. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6100], "author_name_tesi": "Borisova, Tatiana A.", "last_name_ssi": "Borisova", "middle_name_ssi": "A.", "first_name_ssi": "Tatiana", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Gerard Abler", "James Samuel Shortle", "Elizabeth P Marshall", "Denice Heller Wardrop"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "James Samuel Shortle, Committee Chair", "Elizabeth P Marshall, Committee Member", "Denice Heller Wardrop, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["policy-making under uncertainty", "watershed management", "value of informatin", "policy instruments", "information investments"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR BETA/DELTA MODULATES ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR-DEPENDENT SIGNALING AND SKIN CARCINOGENESIS", "id": "11381", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4127", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-10-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since its identification in the early 1990\u0081fs, the physiological roles of the nuclear hormone receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 (PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2) have become better understood. This ligand-activated transcription factor is known to be a key regulator of glucose and lipid homeostasis. PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 exhibits markedly higher expression in epithelial tissues such as the skin; therefore, this nuclear receptor been investigated in skin tumorigenesis. Most evidence has suggested that ligand activation of PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 inhibits skin tumorigenesis, and the results of mechanistic studies have established that these effects are due to receptor-dependent alterations in tumor promotion. The studies within this dissertation examined if PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 modulates another critical component of carcinogenesis, namely tumor initiation, and sought to delineate if PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 modulates the balance between carcinogen bioactivation and detoxification. Utilizing in vivo and in vitro mouse and human skin models, it was observed that Ppar\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-null mice exhibited reduced cytochrome P450 (Cyp) mRNA induction in response to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Cyp mRNA induction was also found to be attenuated in Ppar\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-null keratinocytes at multiple times and with eleven different PAHs. Furthermore, results generated from a PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 shRNA model in human keratinocytes revealed a similar attenuation of PAH-mediated Cyp mRNA induction. Additionally, experimental results with mouse keratinocytes indicated that PAH-mediated phase II enzyme mRNA induction is reduced in Ppar\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-null keratinocytes. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is the known transcriptional regulator of PAH-dependent phase I and II enzyme mRNA induction. Therefore, subsequent studies were designed to delineate how PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 modulates AHR-dependent signaling in mouse and human keratinocytes. Data generated from mechanistic studies indicated that the expression of AHR and several accessory proteins were not altered by PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 expression. The ability of AHR to bind a ligand and translocate to the nucleus were also not modulated in a PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-dependent manner. Additionally, PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 did not appear to physically interact with the AHR. Surprisingly, Ppar\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-null keratinocytes exhibited lower AHR occupancy and histone acetylation at the Cyp1a1 promoter in response to B[a]P, as assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). These findings suggested that the chromatin structure of xenobiotic metabolism promoters may be modulated by PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2. Since DNA methylation is a common method of altering chromatin structure, this mechanism of gene regulation was examined using DNA methylation inhibitors and bisulfite sequencing. Interestingly, methylation within the Cyp1a1 promoter was enhanced in Ppar\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-null keratinocytes. Additionally, inhibition of DNA methylation resulted in a PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-dependent modulation of basal Cyp mRNA expression. These results suggest that epigenetic regulation by PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 contributed to the modulation of AHR signaling. To determine if modulated AHR signaling in keratinocytes results in functional changes in skin tumorigenesis, a complete skin carcinogen bioassay was performed in wild-type and Ppar\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-null mice. The multiplicity of B[a]P- or DMBA-induced skin lesions was found to be lower in Ppar\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-null mice. These observations appear to be mediated by decreased DNA adduct formation in Ppar\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-null keratinocytes as compared to wild-type cells. However, PAH exposure in keratinocytes did not change mRNA expression of the DNA damage markers activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) or p53 in either genotype. Tumorigenesis by N-methyl-N\u0081\u0152-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), a carcinogen that does not require AHR signaling or P450 bioactivation, resulted in enhanced tumorigenesis in Ppar\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-null mice. The enhanced tumorigenesis in MNNG-treated Ppar\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-null mice supports previous evidence that PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 modulates tumor promotion. The absence of PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 also caused increased lesion size, more malignant tumor conversion, and increased inflammation upon MNNG or B[a]P treatment, which further indicates that PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 functionally reduces tumor promotion. Collectively, the experiments within this dissertation identified PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 as a critical modulator of PAH-mediated skin tumorigenesis by altering both tumor initiation and promotion. Mechanistically, the effects on tumor initiation were mediated by PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2-dependent modulation of AHR signaling in keratinocytes. This dissertation thus established a novel molecular mechanism by which PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 can alter skin tumorigenesis. Collectively, the results of these studies help to clarify the biological functions of PPAR\u0192\u00c0/\u0192\u00c2 in skin homeostasis and carcinogenesis.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4105], "author_name_tesi": "Borland, Michael Gregory", "last_name_ssi": "Borland", "middle_name_ssi": "Gregory", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters", "Gary H Perdew", "Andrea Marie Mastro", "Yanming Wang", "Craig Richard Baumrucker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Dissertation Advisor", "Jeffrey Maurice Peters, Committee Chair", "Gary H Perdew, Committee Member", "Andrea Marie Mastro, Committee Member", "Yanming Wang, Committee Member", "Craig Richard Baumrucker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["PPARBeta/Delta", "AHR", "PAH", "Bioactivation", "Skin carcinogenesis"]}]
