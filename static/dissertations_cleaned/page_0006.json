It constitutes 70% of the diet of Ethiopians and is preferably made from the grain of Eragrostis tef. Elasticity and eye (pore) formation are important quality attributes of injera. The pliability of injera allows it to be used as a utensil to pick up wot (stew eaten with injera). The honey-comb like eyes help in the grasping of wot which soaks into the pores on the surface of injera. This study focused on determining the effects of fermentation time and viscosity on the elasticity and eye formation of injera and also understanding the mechanism by which eyes form. Viscosity and fermentation time were found to have a significant effect on elasticity and eye formation of injera. It was observed that injera baked from tef batters with low or high apparent viscosities had fewer eyes on their surfaces and hence an optimum range of apparent viscosity for baking injera with many evenly distributed eyes was determined to be approximately 1.1 to 1.4 Pa.s. Carbon dioxide was also shown to significantly influence the formation of eyes on the surface of injera. The higher the amount of CO2 or gas bubbles in the fermented batter, the higher the number of eyes formed on the injera. Also, addition of sodium metabisulphite (a reducing agent) to tef batters significantly affected both elasticity and eye formation of injera. This suggested that disulfide bonds between proteins may contribute to elasticity and may have an influence on eye formation.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10331], "author_name_tesi": "Attuquayefio, Wendy Darling", "last_name_ssi": "Attuquayefio", "middle_name_ssi": "Darling", "first_name_ssi": "Wendy", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gregory Ray Ziegler", "John Neil Coupland", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gregory Ray Ziegler, Thesis Advisor", "John Neil Coupland, Thesis Advisor", "Ramaswamy C Anantheswaran, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Elasticity", "eye size", "tef", "injera", "viscosity", "sodium metabisulfite"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "A Study of the Elongation Rate and Air Shower Properties of Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays from the Southern Pierre Auger Observatory\n", "id": "7789", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "784", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The Southern Pierre Auger Observatory is the largest hybrid cosmic ray detector in operation, consisting of a 3000km2 array of surface detectors as well as air fluorescence detectors.

Here I demonstrate the use of statistical analysis in determining the optimal parameters for Auger event reconstruction, selection of air shower modeling tools, and identification of the mass composition of cosmic rays. I use Monte Carlo simulations of air shower events to investigate the dependence of the mean particle density at 1000m from the air shower core, S(1000), on several different variables associated with air shower parameters. Using the same simulations, I investigate how calculating this mean particle density at distances other than 1000m from the core affects the uncertainties in the reconstructed parameters. Furthermore, I explore the differences between hadronic interaction models used in air shower simulations, and I demonstrate crucial deviations between simulated showers and real Auger data. Finally, I present a preliminary analysis of the primary mass composition of ultra high energy cosmic rays.

Furthermore, as the literature focuses mostly on adult samples, it limits our understanding of the development and maintenance of underlying affective mechanisms that potentially contribute to clinical levels of anxiety.  Behavioral inhibition (BI) is an early-appearing temperament trait and a robust predictor of social anxiety disorder (SAD).  Both BI and anxiety may have distinct patterns of emotion processing marked by heightened neural responses to threat cues.  Therefore, examining early BI and associated neural underpinnings in a sample of children may help elucidate such mechanisms.  First, I examined BI-group differences in structural volumes of brain regions that have been implicated in social threat-processing.  I found that at high-BI with reduced anterior insula volumes presented with stronger BI-SAD relations. These findings support previous reports of strong BI-SAD relations with decreasing insular volume, and its potential role in fear and anxiety modulation.  Second, I examined BI-group neural responses to briefly presented facial stimuli using a face-probe task.  Non-BI children displayed greater activation in several regions in response to threat faces versus neutral faces, including striatum, prefrontal and temporal lobes. When comparing congruent and incongruent trials, which require attention disengagement, BI children showed greater activation than non-BI children in the cerebellum, which is implicated in rapidly coordinating information processing, aversive conditioning, and learning the precise timing of anticipatory responses.  Third, I examined whether the associations between parent-ratings of anxiety symptoms pre and post an attention training manipulation is moderated by a-priori selected brain volumes.  I found that while volumes of the insula, ACC, and OFC were associated with anxiety in the active control group, they were not associated in the active ABMT group.

Using a second visual variable in animations to represent the magnitude of change between time states has been suggested as an effective method for enabling users to more easily recognize patterns of change in a geographic time-series. This work seeks to answer the question: Does explicitly representing geographic change in animated maps enable users to answer questions about patterns of change easily? To address this research question, bivariate symbols (with both the value of the data and the magnitude of change between time frames represented) were created and tested. Selective attention theory (SAT) was used in selecting bivariate symbol types (separable and integral). Domain analysis with experts from the Avian Knowledge Network (AKN) was performed to determine appropriate map reading tasks for use in task-based experiments using AKN data. Combined with existing task typologies, material from the domain analysis helped form a new task typology of movement patterns found in aggregated spatiotemporal point data. Formal task-based experiments followed, where participants were placed into one of five experiment groups (each using a different symbol) and asked to perform the same series of statement agreement and certainty ratings while studying map animations. Results show that aside from questions explicitly about change, univariate non-change symbolization may be most appropriate. Future studies should focus on testing different data relationships (independent, interdependent, or unrelated) with symbol variations that may have different attention behaviors as predicted by SAT. The results presented here improve the understanding of whether explicit change symbolization helps elucidate geographic time-series patterns or hinders the overall effectiveness of map animation.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4351], "author_name_tesi": "Auer, M.

However, several questions remain regarding marriage-related declines in substance use. First, to what extent does the transition to marriage account for age-related declines in alcohol and marijuana use following the early twenties? Second, to what extent do marriage-related declines in alcohol and marijuana use differ by individual characteristics (i.e., age at marriage, gender, and race)? And third, do social influences (i.e., the average amount of time spent with friends, the number of friends who use alcohol and marijuana, and friends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 approval of these substances) and attitudes regarding substance use (i.e., approval of alcohol and marijuana use) help explain marriage-related declines in alcohol and marijuana use? To answer to these questions, the present study used multilevel modeling to examine marriage-related change in the frequency of alcohol use, drunkenness, and marijuana use between ages 17 and 27 among 1,644 participants from the longitudinal National Youth Survey (Elliott, Huizinga, & Menard, 1989). Results indicated that the transition to marriage explained 46% of age-related declines in alcohol use, 82% of age-related declines in drunkenness, and 5% of age-related declines in marijuana use between the early and late twenties. Women and whites experienced significantly greater declines in alcohol use frequency during the transition to marriage than men and nonwhites. However, marriage-related declines in each type of substance use frequency did not significantly differ by age at marriage, and marriage-related declines in drunkenness frequency and marijuana use frequency did not significantly differ by gender or race.

The current dissertation project focused on the role of child temperament, parenting, and interactive context on outcomes related to the development of approach-withdrawal tendencies and behavioral self-regulation and conscience. The overarching goal was to contribute to the developmental literature on how parenting interacts with child temperamental characteristics to predict outcomes relevant to child self-regulatory capabilities, specifically, by exploring various means through which contexts of measurement affect patterns of influence. These patterns were examined in a longitudinal sample of mothers and children who were observed when the child was 12 months, 18 months, and 4.5 years of age.\n\tThe goal of the first study was to examine whether mothers\u2019 behavior when introducing infants to low- and high-intensity novel objects (12 months) predicted children\u2019s approach-withdrawal responses in two contexts in toddlerhood (18 months) based on their infants\u2019 early approach to novelty. For high-approach infants, maternal positive affect with a high-intensity novel toy predicted more toddler approach during a low-intensity novel situation. For low-approach infants, maternal stimulation with a low-intensity novel toy predicted less toddler approach during a high-intensity novel situation. Maternal sensitivity did not relate to toddler approach-withdrawal for low- or high-approach infants. Thus, certain maternal behaviors may lead to stronger associations between earlier and later measures of approach-withdrawal, but the effects are tied to contexts of socialization and outcomes.\n\tThe goal of the second study was to observe mothers\u2019 and children\u2019s positive affect, responsiveness, and control behavior in two contexts in toddlerhood (18 months), one involving no regulatory structure (free play) and one involving a specific regulatory goal (clean-up). Temperament differences were examined based on inhibited, exuberant, and average approach temperament groups created from a latent profile analysis of toddler affective and behavioral responses to novelty. There were few mean differences in mother and child behavior based on child temperament. However, mothers displayed more control in the structured task compared to the unstructured task, and children displayed less positive affect, less responsiveness, and more attempts to control mother behavior. Additionally, there were several significant relations between child and mother behavior in each task across temperament group, but there were additional relations between child behavior and mother behavior only for the exuberant and/or average approach groups. These results suggest that mother and child behaviors do in fact differ across unstructured and structured contexts, and that mothers of exuberant and average-approach children may potentially adjust their parenting to child responses relatively more than mothers of inhibited children; both of these factors may affect temperament- and context-based contributions of parenting behavior on children\u2019s regulatory development.\n\tThe third study examined child temperament group and mother-child interactions during the unstructured and structured tasks in toddlerhood (18 months) as longitudinal predictors of child behavioral self-regulation and conscience at preschool age (4.5 years). Based on past research, it was hypothesized that exuberant children\u2019s regulatory outcomes would be most strongly predicted by parent-child mutual positivity/responsiveness observed in the unstructured context, and inhibited children\u2019s regulatory outcomes would be most strongly predicted by mothers\u2019 control/structuring behavior in the structured context. Contrary to expectations, mother control/structuring behavior in both contexts related to better behavioral self-regulation in the exuberant group. Further, mother control/structuring behavior in free play related to poorer behavioral self-regulation in the average approach group, and mother control/structuring behavior in clean-up related to poorer behavioral self-regulation in the inhibited group. Mother control may provide generally-beneficial self-regulatory guidance to exuberant children, but could serve a disruptive effect for children of other temperament types when displayed in certain contexts.\nIn conclusion, the results of this dissertation project demonstrated that parent and child behavior varies across interactive contexts, as do temperament-by-parenting interaction patterns predicting children\u2019s regulatory outcomes. Early self-regulatory development thus appears to involve a complex interplay of temperament and parenting across different interactive contexts. Specific patterns of influence such as those that emerged from these studies may offer meaningful insight to researchers and clinicians about how parent-child relationships promote various regulatory outcomes in children with different temperamental characteristics.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13065], "author_name_tesi": "Augustine, Mairin Eileen", "last_name_ssi": "Augustine", "middle_name_ssi": "Eileen", "first_name_ssi": "Mairin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Stifter", "Cynthia Stifter", "Douglas Michael Teti", "Lisa Michelle Kopp", "Kristin Buss"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Stifter, Dissertation Advisor", "Cynthia Stifter, Committee Chair", "Douglas Michael Teti, Committee Member", "Lisa Michelle Kopp, Committee Member", "Kristin Buss, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["temperament", "parenting", "self-regulation", "approach-withdrawal", "child development"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE HIGHER EDUCATION EQUAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM (Act 101): \nPERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCES OF PENNSYLVANIA COLLEGE AND \nUNIVERSITY STUDENTS, COUNSELORS, AND TUTORS \n\n", "id": "10917", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6503", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The labor market in America has undergone a fundamental transformation over the past 25 to 30 years. The large loss of jobs in the manufacturing sector has created a dual labor market largely made up of marginal jobs in the retail and service sector (with low wages, inadequate or no fringe benefits, and little or no chance for career advancement) and significantly better white-collar and professional careers (with good pay, adequate benefits and career trajectories) for those with proper academic credentials (Wilson, Mason, & Ewing, 1997). This labor trend had resulted in the shrinking of the traditional middle-class and the frustrating inability of many younger Americans who are struggling financially to maintain the lifestyle of their parents and in many cases are unsuccessful (Newman, 1993). These changes are especially crucial for the at-risk student as they lack both the informal employment contacts and the financial cushion that traditional middle-class students often enjoy. So the emphasis on earning a college credential has increasingly become the determining factor as to who is better qualified to acquire the better jobs. Attaining a college credential is especially crucial to improving the quality of life and economic condition of marginalized groups and historically oppressed individuals which is comprised of a high proportion of at-risk students. Colleges and universities have become increasingly important gatekeepers to acquiring what is, for many at-risk students, the passport to upward social mobility and the realization of the American Dream (Newman, 1993). \n\tThe purpose of the present study was to explore, describe, and interpret Act 101 students' perceptions of what personal and academic challenges they encountered when first enrolling in college, which support services were most important, and why some eligible students chose not to participate in Act 101 program services. The setting for this qualitative study was 32 community, four-year public and four-year private colleges and universities located throughout Pennsylvania that were participating in the Higher Education Equal Opportunity Program (Act 101). Focus groups were conducted to learn the perceptions and experiences of currently enrolled Act 101 students, program counselors/advisors, and program tutors.    \n\tThe research findings for research question one included personal, financial, accountability, grades, and lack of preparation themes. The research findings for research question two included counseling/advising, program director, tutors, and other service themes. The research findings for question three included personal, outside perceptions, and program service themes. The themes developed from the student responses were consistent with the themes developed from the counselor and tutor themes. These findings were consistent even though the type, availability, and delivery of program services differed at individual institutions as did the cultural backgrounds and residences of the students. Based on the study findings, the researcher concluded that all Act 101 programs that participated in this study shared similar challenges with at-risk students.  The researcher further concluded that all Act 101 programs could benefit if similar types, availability, and delivery approaches of program services were utilized in meeting the needs of Act 101 student\u2019s. The research findings also supported Tinto's Longitudinal Model of Institutional Departure which focused on academic and social integration directly impacting student departure decisions. The researcher found that the participants\u2019 quotes and developed themes consistently reflected how the availability and delivery of Act 101 program support services created an overall conductive environment to academic and social integration. This integration positively impacted retention and persistence results for at-risk students in every Act 101 program that participated in this study.  \n  \tFinally, we must continue to evolve with the changing times that demand new thinking and a willingness to adopt new approaches in the way we address at-risk student\u2019s needs. Designing, implementing, and maintaining effective support services for at-risk students is critical to increasing retention and persistence rates among the at-risk college population. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6503], "author_name_tesi": "Augustine, William Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Augustine", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William J Rothwell", "William J Rothwell", "Richard Allen Walter", "Edgar Paul Yoder", "Wesley Edward Donahue"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William J Rothwell, Dissertation Advisor", "William J Rothwell, Committee Chair", "Richard Allen Walter, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member", "Wesley Edward Donahue, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["The Higher Education Equal Opportunity Program", "Act 101", "At-risk Students", "Under-prepared Student"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "THE MEANING OF HEALTH-RELATED E-MAIL MESSAGING AT THE \nWORKSITE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE\n\n", "id": "9316", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "632", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-08T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This qualitative inquiry was undertaken to explore how employees at two worksites made meaning of health-related e-mail messages in relation to health behavior change.

This environment is incredibly complex, which can make studying enzyme reactions inside cells challenging. The aqueous phase model systems described here aim to provide insight as to the mechanisms used by cells to control enzyme activity, compartment formation, and compartmentalization of biomolecules. Chapter 1 provides a general background of intracellular organization in biological cells, followed by a discussion of fundamental principles governing biomolecule activity within a nonideal solution. The types of aqueous phase separation that appear in later chapters are discussed, as well as a review of related aqueous phase-separated model systems.\nChapter 2 describes complex coacervation of a long poly(uridylic acid) RNA (poly U, a polyanion) and short cationic peptide (RRASLRRASL) that undergo reversible phase separation in response to the phosphorylation state (and therefore charge state) of the peptide. Phosphorylation was controlled enzymatically by a kinase and phosphatase pair. This demonstrates that phosphorylation could be a viable means to control compartment formation and dissolution in vivo. Additionally, the poly U/RRASLRRASL coacervates were capable of concentrating solutes up to 1150\u00d7. In Chapter 3, sequential enzyme activity is studied in a polyethylene glycol (PEG)/sodium citrate biphasic system. The enzymes glucose oxidase (GOX) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and substrate Amplex Red partitioned to opposite phases and required mass transport across an interface for product formation. A mathematical model was developed to describe the complex kinetics in the system, and the model was validated when it accurately described other experimental conditions. Chapter 4 looks at the reaction of HRP with two different substrates that differed in their relative hydrophobicity. Catalysis by HRP was highly dependent on solution composition because attractive interactions between the more hydrophobic substrate and more hydrophobic crowders and cosolutes (different molecular weights of PEG) caused a larger decrease in enzyme activity. This was confirmed by diffusion nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. This is significant because it is the first systematic study of substrate-crowder interactions within the macromolecular crowding community. In Chapter 5, enzymes and substrates of the purine biosynthesis pathway were partitioned to the dextran-rich phase of a PEG/dextran biphasic system. The mathematical model developed in Chapter 3 was used in this phase system to describe the kinetics and mass transport under conditions that were difficult to study experimentally. The results suggest that significant advantages of enzyme colocalization may only be observed if essentially all of the enzyme is restricted to compartments, rather than only being weakly partitioned. Finally, Chapter 6 offers some general conclusions from this work, as well as some future outlook on using aqueous phase systems as model cells.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11011], "author_name_tesi": "Aumiller, William Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Aumiller", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "William", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Carsten Krebs", "Scott A Showalter", "Antonios Armaou"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christine Dolan Keating, Dissertation Advisor", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Chair", "Carsten Krebs, Committee Member", "Scott A Showalter, Committee Member", "Antonios Armaou, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aqueous phase separation", "macromolecular crowding", "phosphorylation", "coacervate", "sequential enzymes", "compartmentalization"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Vulnerability and Threat Based Measures of Building Protection from Airborne Chemical and Biological Agents", "id": "19731", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4965", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "To mitigate risk in the event of extraordinary incidents including chemical and biological attacks, risk assessment is a necessary process to identify threats and systems vulnerabilities.  Most available risk assessment methodologies are qualitative and lack building specific components to assess building system protection level.  It is important that quantitative or semi-quantitative methods are developed to evaluate building systems, control, and remediation measures.  These methods require reliable building performance measures to determine occupant health consequences of a building attack.  This research investigated available threat-based and vulnerability-based measures specific for building mechanical systems and determine their accuracy and usefulness in risk assessment.  \nThreat-based measures are event and agent specific measures indicating an absolute severity levels of building occupants in an attack event.  Vulnerability-based measures are relative and non-agent specific measures which evaluate the impact of an event relative to a base event.  Both approaches were carried out on a presumed contaminant release of 6 x 108 cfu of Bacillus anthracis inside or into an OA intake of  a three-story, 16,791 ft2 (1,560 m2) residential building to determine the impact of mechanical system and event characteristics including filter efficiency, ventilation rate, mechanical system types, zoning strategy, and stack effect.  The multizone modeling program CONTAM was used to simulate the spread of the contaminants after a release.  The contaminant transport simulation was coupled with the appropriate epidemiological methodology to determine total infections and casualties which were used as reference measures.  Vulnerability-based measures were also applied to the same scenarios and compared their interpretation to reference measures.  Uncertainty analysis was performed on three filter scenarios (MERV 6 filter, MERV 13 filter and no-filter) to determine the effects of variations in input parameters. \nTotal infections, total casualties, percent infections, and percent casualties provided absolute numbers of occupants that had health adverse consequences from contaminant exposure.  These measures were easy to compare between cases.  Fraction of building protection, another threat-based measure, were straightforward to compute and also easy to compare; however, it lacked ability to differentiate risk in some scenarios especially one with uniform air distribution.  \nA number of vulnerability-based measures (i.e., nondimensional building average concentration, transient concentration, and improvement score) were not complicated to obtain compared to the threat-based measures.  They were suitable in identifying risk in scenarios with uniform contaminant distribution but different mechanical system characteristics.  On the other hand, nondimensional occupancy dose curves and decile breakdown of nondimensional exposure dose indicated risk levels accurately for scenarios with uniform and non-uniform airborne contaminants.  The nondimensional occupancy dose curve included only results in occupied space; while the decile breakdown of nondimensional exposure dose covered the contaminant distribution for the entire building.\nBased on results from both measures, the impact of different mechanical system and release characteristics could be evaluated in a building attack event.  A higher efficiency filter provides better protection than the less efficient one.  For a release into an air handler, the DOAS system was worse than the CAV and VAV systems due to much lower air change rates in contaminated spaces.  However, for an interior release event, a DOAS system was much more protective than the CAV and VAV systems because of its ability to limit the spread of contaminant from recirculation.  Also, the zoning strategy could contain the contaminants within zones connected to the mechanical system that the release occurred.  Nonetheless, zoning created more possible release scenarios.  A winter stack effect could reverse air direction in elevator shaft and lower air change rates in stairwell; its effect on severity level of building occupant were found to be minimal for this building.  \nIn conclusion, the research evaluated each measure and discussed its application and usefulness.  Sensitivity analysis indicated that uncertainties for most input parameters affected results in varying degree depending on the mechanical system and type of results.  The confidence in the mitigation measure depends on the confidence in the risk assessment results.  Future work would embody the development of risk assessment methodology using building-specific performance measure as a part of design procedure. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4942], "author_name_tesi": "Aumpansub, Ponkamon ", "last_name_ssi": "Aumpansub", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ponkamon", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Architectural Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William P Bahnfleth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William P Bahnfleth, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vulnerability", "threat", "Risk", "Assessment", "Airborne Contaminants", "HVAC"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "STEREOSELECTIVE SYNTHESIS OF (Z)-2-ACYL-2-ENALS VIA\nRETROCYCLOADDITIONS OF 5-ACYL-4-ALKYL-4H-1,3-DIOXINS:\nAPPLICATIONS IN NATURAL PRODUCT SYNTHESIS\n\n", "id": "7823", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5087", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Reported herein are several approaches for the synthesis of substituted acrolein derivatives via the retrocycloaddition of substituted 4H-1,3-dioxins.  Upon thermal or Lewis acid mediated retro hetero Diels-Alder reactions of these substrates, an appropriately substituted acrolein derivative is generated (stereoselectively in most cases) which can be utilized as a substrate for a variety of cycloaddition reactions.  These cycloadditions, including Diels-Alder, hetero Diels-Alder, and [4 + 3], have provided access to several ring systems with excellent control over regio- and stereoselectivity.\nA strategy for the stereocontrolled synthesis of (Z)-2-acylenals has been developed through utilization of a retrocycloaddition reaction of 5-acyl-4-alkyl-4H-1,3-dioxins.  This approach has provided concise synthetic routes to several natural products containing the 5-acyl-2H-3,4-dihydropyran substructure. Application of this methodology has been showcased in the natural product syntheses of both the immunosuppressant loganetin and the cytotoxin euplotin A.  This methodology has also been investigated in a synthetic approach towards the synthesis of the xenicin core.\nSimilarly, retrocycloadditions of 4H-4-alkyl-5-(trialkylsilyloxy)-1,3-dioxins proceed smoothly in refluxing toluene to afford (Z)-2-(trialkylsilyloxy)-2-alkenals with complete stereoselectivity. These enals undergo Sasaki-type [4 + 3] cyclization with dienes in the presence of Lewis acids, in many instances with excellent regio- and/or stereoselectivity.\nAlso, throughout our investigations of forming 1,3-dioxins it was found that these retrocyloaddition precursors could be formed by a variety of reaction sequences.  An example of a deconjugation approach for the formation of dioxins is exemplified in the development of a thermally labile solid-phase linker. \nA similar approach was also utilized in the synthesis of the 1,3-dioxin precursors for the preparation of the labdane/clerodane ring system.  Subsequent thermolysis of this substrate provided clean conversion, via a one-pot retro- hetero Diels-Alder reaction and successive intramolecular Diels-Alder reaction, to provide the requisite trans-decalin ring system with an axial bridgehead aldehyde.\nFinally, in our studies toward the synthesis of 1,3-dioxins, a Diels-Alder approach to the sesquiterpene illudin C ring system was investigated.  Unfortunately, this approach proved unproductive; however, it did lead to an alternative approach to illudin C. A convergent total synthesis of illudin C is described. The tricyclic ring system of the natural product was quickly assembled from cyclopropane and cyclopentene precursors via a novel oxime dianion coupling reaction and a subsequent intramolecular nitrile oxide-olefin cycloaddition.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5062], "author_name_tesi": "Aungst, Jr., Ronald Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Aungst, Jr.", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Ronald", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["RAYMOND LEE FUNK", "Steven M Weinreb", "Scott Trent Feldman", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr."], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["RAYMOND LEE FUNK, Committee Chair", "Steven M Weinreb, Committee Member", "Scott Trent Feldman, Committee Member", "Joseph M Bollinger Jr., Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["heterocycloaddition", "Diels-Alder", "cycloaddition", "dioxin", "natural product", "4 + 3 cycloaddition", "synthesis", "retrocycloaddition"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "Teen Queens and Adrenaline Dreams: A History of The CW Television Network", "id": "14988aga128", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14988", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-02-19T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This project investigates the history of The CW Television Network, a U.S. English-language broadcast television network founded in 2006 as the merger of The WB Network and UPN.

In order to offer a more physiological model of estrogen deficiency with aging, we also utilized bilateral ovariectomy (OVX) in a subset of rats at 15 mo to be studied at 22-23 mo (MO OVX, n=16). Both adult and MO OVX rats underwent 31 min ischemia with reperfusion times 10 min, 6 hr, and 24 hr. 7 day reperfusion was studied in a subset of adult (n=2) and ovary-intact aged rats (n=2).

Western blot analysis was conducted on a subset of samples to assess changes in mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis1), mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), and optic atrophy 1 (OPA1). Aging with E2 deficiency resulted in smaller, more numerous mitochondria compared to adult. Increases in mitochondrial area and decreases in density were seen in adult and MO OVX within 6 hr of reperfusion, while reperfusion over 24 hr seemed to indicate recovery from ischemic injury, as mitochondrial areas returned to baseline in adult hearts. Mitochondrial Drp1 significantly increased with I/R, while no significant changes were seen in Fis1, Mfn1 or OPA1. For the first time, our mitochondrial morphological data suggests a temporal resolution for I/R injury in the female rat heart.

While a lot of work has been done in the case of continuous tests, little has been done concerning discrete data.  This thesis addresses the problems of high-dimensional, independent, discrete tests, namely estimating the number of true null hypotheses ('pi0') and the control of the false discovery rate (FDR).\n\nThe 'pi0' estimators in consideration include those developed by Nettleton, Pounds and Cheng, Storey, and Bancroft and Nettleton, as well as a more-recently developed Regression procedure.  We also utilize Tarone's idea of removing tests that have no power prior to estimating 'pi0'.  We compared eight methods in total.\n\nWe generated two types of data, each with two configurations, and simulated data for eleven different values of 'pi0' and two different values of m, the number of total simultaneous tests.  These data sets were then used to compare the eight methods for estimating 'pi0'.  We found that several estimators proved to be useful for our data, including those developed for continuous test statistics.  With discrete data it is possible for a test to have zero power.  Filtering out tests with zero power generally improves the estimate of 'pi0'.\n\nWe then used the same data to compare eleven procedures for controlling FDR.  The procedures provide an algorithm or rule for when to reject a hypothesis, while maintaining the FDR at some specified level, usually q=.05.

The \nblade is modeled as an elastic beam undergoing flap bending, lag bending and elastic torsion, \nand a radial degree of freedom is added for the absorber. The tuning of the embedded radial \nabsorber to a frequency close to 3/rev with no damping is shown to reduce significantly (up to \n86%) the 4/rev in-plane hub forces of a 4-bladed hingeless rotor similar to a MBB BO-105 in \nhigh speed flight.

The capability for ubiquitous and distributed sensing has lead to the possibility of data-rich and information-poor environments, where the ability to collect data has overtaken the ability to understand its relevance and importance to the overall system goals. If the benefits of the sensor technology developments are to reach end users, we need to address two key questions.  First, what data should be gathered given resource constraints like limited  sensor battery power?  Second, what information should be shared with humans, and between humans, given their cognitive constraints?  This thesis focuses on development of agent-based information management algorithms and architectures that can deal with the massive amounts of data generated, without overloading the human operators.  Intelligent agent technology with its emphasis on autonomy provides a valuable paradigm for this problem.\nThis thesis mainly focuses on designing and building a market-based resource allocation architecture for sensor management in distributed sensor networks.  A second domain, supply chain management, examines the question of what information should be shared, and involved development of a collaborative sense-making application.\nA market-based agent design is proposed for the distributed sensor management problem, where the different system units are regarded as various market entities. This approach has the ability to create a comprehensive sensor management paradigm that can optimally distribute non-commensurate sensor network resources (e.g., sensor attention, battery power, and transmission capacity) among the distributed consumers, operating in a co-operative or semi-cooperative environment. \nA team-based agent design is proposed for collaborative sense-making in a multi-echelon supply chain. The various supply-chain entities, including the data generating entities (like RF sensors) are treated as team members with specific roles in a multi-agent team, based on the multi-agent team framework, Collaborative Agents for Team work (CAST). This approach holds the promise of addressing the information needs of the individual agents without the causing the problems of information overload, using the CAST based pro-active information and knowledge delivery policies.\n \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6475], "author_name_tesi": "Avasarala, Viswanath ", "last_name_ssi": "Avasarala", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Viswanath", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Tracy Mullen", "David J Hall", "Steven Raymond Haynes", "Murali Haran"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Tracy Mullen, Committee Chair", "David J Hall, Committee Chair", "Steven Raymond Haynes, Committee Member", "Murali Haran, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Sensor Management", "Market-oriented Programming", "Sensor Management", "Level 4 Data Fusion", "Mult-agent Systems", "Supply Chain Management"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "ASSESSING THE LINKS BETWEEN\nEMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCHOOL ENGAGEMENT AND ACADEMIC OUTCOMES AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS\n", "id": "6054", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1969", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-02-25T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this research investigation I examined the relationship between emotional and behavioral school engagement and academic performance among high school students.

The combustion exit temperature is often raised to increase engine efficiency and reduce specific fuel consumption.  Current combustion exit temperatures exceed the melting point of nickel alloys used in the turbine stage of gas turbine engines, which follow the combustor.  Ceramic coatings and cooling air bled from the final stages of the compressor allow for the turbine components to maintain temperatures that prevent failure.\n\nBetween stationary and rotating components of a gas turbine engine, a gap is maintained to prevent a collision.  This gap creates an open cavity beneath the hub of the rotating and stationary components.  If not properly sealed, air in the hot gas path can enter the wheel space; this process is known as ingress. Conversely, air leaving the wheel space and entering the hot gas path is known as egress.  The components beneath the rotor and stator hubs typically do not have ceramic coatings and in the presence of ingress may be heated above acceptable limits.\n \nMethods for preventing ingress include geometrical designs, as well as the use of purge flow.  Like the air used to cool turbine blades and vanes, purge flow is bled from the final stages of the compressor.  The use of purge flow will reduce engine efficiency since that air is no longer used for combustion.\n  \nIt has been experimentally and computationally shown that under low purge flow conditions low frequency structures form in the wheel space, moving slower than the rotor speed and the number of structures is unrelated to the number of vanes or blades.  It has also been shown that these structures can cause ingress deep into the wheel space.\n\nThe Axial Flow Research Turbine Facility (AFTRF) was recently updated with blade, vane, and wheel space geometry representative of the next generation of aircraft turbomachinery. \nThe objective of this study was to indentify low frequency structures that were present in the wheel space of the rig under low purge flow conditions.  Experimental and computational studies were completed, in conjunction, to fully understand the flow structure and pressure distribution in the wheel space.\n  \t\nAn understanding of number of structures and their rotational speed will aid in the validation of future computational models of the AFTRF wheel space which could be used do design a more effective rim seal.  It will also be useful in understanding future experimental results from the AFTRF.\n\nThe experiential study showed 15 structures rotating at 77.5 % of the rotor speed and the computational analysis showed 14 to 15 structures rotating at 81.7 % rotor speed.  The agreement was deemed acceptable to validate the computational model.\n \nFrom the computational model, ingress mass flow from the hot gas path into the upper wheel space was shown to be 2.5 times greater than the supplied purge flow and ingress from the upper wheel space into the lower wheel space was 1.75 times greater than the purge flow.  Pressure in the wheel space was shown to have the strongest correlation with local ingress and egress patterns and pressure on the rotor hub, upstream of the blade, was also strongly correlated.  Pressure on the stator hub downstream of the vanes appeared to have little correlation with local ingress and egress patterns.  Further investigation showed locations of maximum ingress were caused when the stator vane wake, rotor blade leading edge, and low pressure in the wheel space coincide at similar circumferential locations.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9607], "author_name_tesi": "Averbach, Michael Alec", "last_name_ssi": "Averbach", "middle_name_ssi": "Alec", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cengiz Camci, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gas Turbines", "Axial Flow Turbine", "AFTRF", "Wheel Space", "Purge Flow", "Ingress"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development of a Novel Electro-optical Vibrational Spectroscopy Technique to Inform Organic Electronic Materials Design", "id": "19760", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9481", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-10-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Interest in flexible electronics is increasing as consumer electronics start to focus on more mobile, lightweight technologies.

The research contained herein investigated how these factors interact to influence exotic plant invasions. In the Northeastern United States, the highly abundant native white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.), and landscape fragmentation are known to facilitate plant invasion independently. At the same time, biologically diverse native plant communities are broadly expected to limit invasion. In this work, primary producer-consumer interactions, plot-level native diversity, and surrounding landscape configuration were investigated to assess their association with exotic plant invasion across the region. \nUsing floristic composition data from 24 deer exclusion research sites distributed across the Northeastern US, the effect of deer on exotic versus native plants was investigated at species and community levels. Results indicated that deer facilitate the abundance of some exotic plant species, but inhibit the presence and abundance of many natives. While deer did not alter absolute exotic plant richness or abundance, they increased the degree of plant invasion due to strong declines in native plant abundance. Deer altered species composition and lowered native plant richness and abundance, causing an overall reduction in Shannon diversity (H\u2019). \nTo understand why some exotic species increased and others decreased in response to deer across the region controlled multiple-choice deer preference trials were conducted. Using captive deer, relative preferences for eight invasive exotic plants and seven native plants that are currently widespread and occur frequently in the region were determined in spring, summer, and autumn. Even though deer consumed more native plant biomass overall, preferences varied strongly at the level of species. This suggests that deer facilitate the invasion of exotic plants that are relatively unpalatable due to preferential selection of palatable plants. \nLast, the relative importance of site-level white-tailed deer density, multiple landscape fragmentation metrics, and plot-level native plant diversity were tested for their roles in explaining plant invasion patterns in forest understory communities. The same pooled, floristic community data from 24 sites in the Northeastern US was analyzed using a series of nonparametric and parametric, multivariate and univariate statistics to illustrate the effects of multiple factors and their interactions on several measures of plant invasion. Deer, landscape structure and composition, and native species richness all affected patterns of exotic plant invasion. Results showed that deer density was highly correlated to landscape structure and that, as deer density increased, the percentage of exotic plant species also increased. Generally, landscape fragmentation was positively correlated with plant invasion. However, several interactions among deer presence, native plant diversity, and landscape attributes were identified. Exotic plant richness increased with native plant richness, but some evidence was found for native plant diversity limiting the degree of invasion in non-fragmented landscapes.

As scientists begin to understand how these organisms utilize specific and non-specific interactions with a variety of biopolymers such as chitin, peptides, proteins and nucleic acids with these precursors to create inorganic/organic composite materials, they have begun to wonder about the synthesis of other types of non-biologically templated synthetic techniques that might be possible. Bioengineered organisms and biopolymers have begun to be used for these types of studies. A variety of selection techniques exist for discovering biopolymers with an affinity for a target material, however, one of the most notable is a technique called peptide phage display. This is a technique that utilizes a commercially available randomized peptide library attached at the tip of the filamentous bacteriophage M13. In this dissertation capabilities of bacteriophage M13 are explored in regard to the creation of bi-functional nano materials by exploiting both specific peptide interactions as well as non-specific peptide interactions on the surface of the organism.\nChapter 2 focuses on utilizing the specific peptide interactions of the randomized library at pIII in order to discover peptides with high binding affinity for a variety of nanomaterials. Selection studies called biopanning are performed on a variety of nanomaterials such as CaMoO4, allotropes of Ni, Fe2O3 and Fe3O4, and Rh and Pt with the fcc type crystal structure. Similarities and differences between peptides discovered for these materials are discussed.\nChapter 3 focuses on utilizing the non-specific peptide interactions on the long axis of M13 called pVIII. The pVIII region consists of 2700 copies of the same 50 amino acid protein which as a negatively charged domain which is exposed to solution. The pVIII region therefore provides the surface of the phage with a negative charge on which nanomaterials can be supported. Metal salt precursors reduced in the presence of WT M13 are studied in this chapter. Metal salt precursors of Fe, Co, Ru, Rh and Pd seem to be the most effective at coating the surface of the phage based on the positively charged metal-aquo complexes formed in water, which are attracted to the negative pVIII region. Other types of reactions are explored with WT phage as a scaffold such as conversion chemistry in a polyol solvent to access several intermetallic phases as well as co-precipitation reactions to access ternary oxides.\nChapter 4 focuses on combining research from chapter 2 and chapter 3 to create a bi-functional material that utilizes both specific and non-specific peptide interactions with inorganic materials on the surface of M13 to attach two different types of nanomaterials. The example provided here is a magnetically recoverable hydrogenation catalyst made up of a pVIII region coated with rhodium nanoparticles held in place by non-specific peptide interactions and a pIII region attached to iron oxide nanoparticles via specific peptide interactions. This is the first example in the literature of a commercially available pIII bioengineered M13 bacteriophage forming a bi-functional material.\nThis research provides a methodology to design and build single and multi-component materials on the surface of bacteriophage M13 without the necessity for additional bioengineering and library characterization. The simplicity of use will make the technique available to a wider variety of researchers in the materials science community. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3508], "author_name_tesi": "Avery, Kendra Nicole", "last_name_ssi": "Avery", "middle_name_ssi": "Nicole", "first_name_ssi": "Kendra", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak", "Raymond Edward Schaak", "Christine Dolan Keating", "Michael Thomas Green", "John H Golbeck"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Raymond Edward Schaak, Dissertation Advisor", "Raymond Edward Schaak, Committee Chair", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member", "Michael Thomas Green, Committee Member", "John H Golbeck, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phage display", "biomineralization", "multi-functional materials", "biotemplated materials", "magnetically recoverable catalyst"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Homeschool Geographies: A Case Study of Educational Infrastructure in Virginia\n", "id": "9855", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "365", "abstract_tesi": "Homeschooling in the United States has grown over the last four decades from a small grassroots movement to an infrastructure supporting over 1.5 million students in 2007.

Specifically, the ways in which  prospective and beginning teachers\u2019 develop pedagogical content knowledge for teaching science in light of current recommendations for reform emphasizing teaching and learning science as inquiry are explored. \nWithin this theme, the focus is on three core areas: a) the use of technology tools (i.e., web-based portfolios) in support of learning to teach science at the elementary level; b) beginning teachers\u2019 specialized knowledge for giving priority to evidence in science teaching; and c) the applications of perspectives associated with elementary teachers\u2019 learning to teach science in Cyprus, where I was born and raised. \nThe first manuscript describes a study aimed at exploring the influence of web-based portfolios and a specific task in support of learning to teach science within the context of a Professional Development School program. The task required prospective teachers to articulate their personal philosophies about teaching and learning science in the form of claims, evidence and justifications in a web-based forum. The findings of this qualitative case study revealed the participants\u2019 developing understandings about learning and teaching science, which included emphasizing a student-centered approach, connecting physical engagement of children with conceptual aspects of learning, becoming attentive to what teachers can do to support children\u2019s learning, and focusing on teaching science as inquiry. The way the task was organized and the fact that the web-based forum provided the ability to keep multiple versions of their philosophies gave prospective teachers the advantage of examining how their philosophies were changing over time, which supported a continuous engagement in metacognition, self-reflection and self-evaluation. \nThe purpose of the study reported in the second manuscript was to examine the nature of a first-year elementary teacher\u2019s specialized knowledge and practices for giving priority to evidence in science teaching. The findings of this study indicated that Jean not only articulated, but also enacted, a student-centered approach to teaching science, which emphasized giving priority to evidence in the construction of scientific explanations. It also became evident through data analysis that Jean\u2019s practices were for the most part consistent with her knowledge and beliefs. This contradicts the findings of previous studies that indicate a mismatch between beginning teachers\u2019 knowledge and practices. Furthermore, the findings of this study illustrated that critical experiences during teacher preparation and specific university coursework acted as sources through which this aspect of pedagogical content knowledge was generated.\nThe third manuscript proposes new directions for teaching science in elementary schools in Cyprus and makes recommendations to improve the current teacher preparation program in light of the need for a reform. This manuscript is built upon contemporary perspectives of learning and cognition, and is informed by current trends in science education in the United States and United Kingdom. Issues of teaching and learning science as inquiry, engaging in scientific argumentation, and the use of software scaffolds in support of learning and learning to teach science are discussed with special attention to the unique educational setting of Cyprus. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3808], "author_name_tesi": "Avraamidou, Lucy ", "last_name_ssi": "Avraamidou", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Lucy", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Carla Zembal Saul", "Thomas Dana", "Barbara Allen Crawford", "Priya Sharma"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Carla Zembal Saul, Committee Chair", "Thomas Dana, Committee Member", "Barbara Allen Crawford, Committee Member", "Priya Sharma, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["web-based portfolios", "evidence", "learning", "teaching", "science"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "SIMULATIONS OF AEROSOL, MICROPHYSICAL AND COASTAL INFLUENCES ON ARCTIC MIXED-PHASE CLOUDS\n", "id": "9228", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "82", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mixed-phase stratus clouds are the prevalent cloud type in the Arctic during the winter and transition seasons. Despite their important role in various climate feedback mechanisms they are still not well understood and are difficult to represent accurately in large-scale models. In this study the role of ice nucleation mechanisms, the influence of the coastally-generated circulations and parameterized ice crystal habit on the longevity and structure of Arctic mixed-phase clouds were examined using detailed mesoscale, cloud- and eddy-resolving model simulations.\nThe structure and the lifetime of simulated Arctic mixed-phase clouds were found to be highly sensitive to the concentration of ice-nuclei (IN) acting in deposition/condensation-freezing nucleation mode. Contact nucleation could not produce significant ice amounts unless the contact IN concentrations were increased to unrealistically high values. Local, coastally induced circulations were found to be responsible for maintaining the continuous ice precipitation along the coastline through transport of deposition/condensation-freezing IN from above the cloud layer. It was demonstrated that incorrect partitioning of the liquid and ice phase can produce errors  in  the  surface  radiative  budget  of  up  to  90 Wm-2. \nSimulated IN sensitivity and liquid/ice phase partitioning were found to depend critically on the assumed ice crystal habit. It was demonstrated that a large range of liquid or ice water path can be produced by reasonable changes in ice crystal habit mass-dimensional and terminal fall-speed relations based on data reported in the literature. The changes in ice crystal habit were shown to be related to liquid layer formation, splitting of liquid layers, and cloud dissipation mechanisms in multi-layered Arctic mixed-phase clouds. These results suggest that predicting changes in crystal habit is of significant importance for correct model representation of mixed-phase clouds.\nThree additional ice nucleation mechanisms (\u201cevaporation IN\u201d, \u201cevaporation freezing\u201d, and immersion freezing) were examined regarding the ability of our model to more accurately simulate liquid and ice water content, ice concentrations, and observed cloud structure. All of these mechanisms were found to be capable of producing ice crystal concentrations similar to the observed values, while maintaining the liquid content of the cloud. The observed cloud structure was also correctly reproduced for extended periods of time.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [83], "author_name_tesi": "Avramov, Alexander Elkov", "last_name_ssi": "Avramov", "middle_name_ssi": "Elkov", "first_name_ssi": "Alexander", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jerry Y Harrington", "Jerry Y H Arrington", "Johannes Verlinde", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux", "David Pollard"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jerry Y Harrington, Dissertation Advisor", "Jerry Y H Arrington, Committee Chair", "Johannes Verlinde, Committee Member", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Committee Member", "David Pollard, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aerosols", "mixed-phase clouds", "arctic clouds", "ice crystal habit"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF AN INNOVATIVE SPACER GRID MODEL UTILIZING COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS WITHIN A SUBCHANNEL ANALYSIS TOOL", "id": "8004", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4297", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-09-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In the past few decades the need for improved nuclear reactor safety analyses has led to a rapid development of advanced methods for multidimensional thermal-hydraulic analyses. These methods have become progressively more complex in order to account for the many physical phenomena anticipated during steady state and transient Light Water Reactor (LWR) conditions. The advanced thermal-hydraulic subchannel code COBRA-TF (Thurgood, M. J. et al., 1983) is used worldwide for best-estimate evaluations of the nuclear reactor safety margins.  In the framework of a joint research project between the Pennsylvania State University (PSU) and AREVA NP GmbH, the theoretical models and numerics of COBRA-TF have been improved. Under the name F-COBRA-TF, the code has been subjected to an extensive verification and validation program and has been applied to variety of LWR steady state and transient simulations.\nTo enable F-COBRA-TF for industrial applications, including safety margins evaluations and design analyses, the code spacer grid models were revised and substantially improved. The state-of-the-art in the modeling of the spacer grid effects on the flow thermal-hydraulic performance in rod bundles employs numerical experiments performed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations. Because of the involved computational cost, the CFD codes cannot be yet used for full bundle predictions, but their capabilities can be utilized for development of more advanced and sophisticated models for subchannel-level analyses. A subchannel code, equipped with improved physical models, can be then a powerful tool for LWR safety and design evaluations. \nThe unique contributions of this PhD research are seen as development, implementation, and qualification of an innovative spacer grid model by utilizing CFD results within a framework of a subchannel analysis code.  Usually, the spacer grid models are mostly related to modeling of the entrainment and deposition phenomena and the heat transfer augmentation downstream of the spacers. Nowadays, the influence that spacers have on the lateral transfer of momentum, mass, and energy within fuel rod bundles are not modeled. The goal of this study is to address the missing phenomena in the current F-COBRA-TF spacer grid model and namely the turbulent mixing enhancement due to spacers and the lateral flow patterns created by specific configurations of the spacers\u2019 structural elements. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4270], "author_name_tesi": "Avramova, Maria Nikolova", "last_name_ssi": "Avramova", "middle_name_ssi": "Nikolova", "first_name_ssi": "Maria", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nuclear Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov", "Lauewnce E Hochreiter", "John Harlan Mahaffy", "Markus Glueck", "Cengiz Camci"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kostadin Nikolov Ivanov, Committee Chair", "Lauewnce E Hochreiter, Committee Chair", "John Harlan Mahaffy, Committee Member", "Markus Glueck, Committee Member", "Cengiz Camci, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thermal-hydraulics", "sub-channel analysis", "CFD", "F-COBRA-TF", "spacer grids"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "FINITE-ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION AND VERIFICATION OF COMPLEX FLUID MODELS BASED ON EVOLVING NATURAL CONFIGURATIONS, MOTIVATED BY STUDIES OF BLOOD", "id": "14506aoa122", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14506", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ability to model the flow of blood along with its concurrent capacity for clotting and lysis can greatly accelerate the development and deployment of many clinical applications.

Subsequently, the model is expanded to include reaction and diffusion concurrent with advection, which is necessary to model the chemistry of blood clotting and lysis that can take place during blood flow. The proposed FEM scheme is then extended to be applicable to the fully-coupled model. COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae has been used as the programming environment for the FEM implementation. The accuracy of the proposed implementations has been assessed using the method of manufactured solutions (MMS).

TRP ion channels are one family of sensory proteins that are implicated in almost every sensory modality i.e., touch, taste, smell, vision, hearing etc. (Islam, 2011). As a result, their dysfunction is implicated in many disease processes making them attractive drug targets (Moran et al., 2011; Nilius and Owsianik, 2010). TRP channels display remarkable diversity during evolution, yet they share many structural and functional similarities among evolutionally diverse species. Model organisms like Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster provide a tractable system for investigating the complexities of these molecular sensors in a simpler setting. Metabolic regulation of TRP channels is an emerging field (Kahn-kirby et al., 1991; Kumar et al., 2014; Riera et al., 2014). My work reveals role of a form of vitamin B3, Nicotinamide (NAM) in modulating sensory signaling, behaviors and in some cases eliciting cell death via a TRPV channel in C. elegans and D. melanogaster. My lab has established an excellent C. elegans metabolic mutant model pnc-1 (pyrazinamidase/nicotinamidase-1) to study how metabolism affects biological processes like development, aging and cell death. I began my research by investigating a cell death phenotype in the pnc-1 mutant. Loss of C. elegans nicotinamidase pnc-1 that is required for NAD salvage synthesis causes metabolic perturbation and increase in its substrate NAM levels (Vrablik et al., 2009). Four cells in the uterus (uterine-vulval 1 cells) of the animal die due to excess NAM in pnc-1 mutant. Here I report that NAM inflicts death on another set of cells found in the head (OLQ neurons) of the animal. I show that the death phenotype is limited to these two cell types because they both express a heteromeric TRPV ion channel made up of OCR-4 and OSM-9 subunits, co- expression of these is necessary for NAM induced cell death. Using electrophysiology in Xenopus oocytes, I determine that NAM is a direct agonist for OCR-4/OSM-9 TRPV ion channel. This is the first successful report of in vitro functional expression any C. elegans TRPV channel. C. elegans TRPV channels are not well characterized and I propose that NAM agonist provides a tool for the same. I further show that NAM agonist activity on TRPV channels is conserved in D. melanogaster. In Drosophila, Nanchung (Nan) and Inactive (Iav) are the OCR- 4 and OSM-9 orthologos respectively. Nan/Iav hetromer is also activated by NAM in electrophysiology in Xenopus oocytes. Calcium imaging in Drosophila larvae shows that NAM application induces a calcium spike and over stimulates the chordotonal neurons (the only cells that co-express Nan/Iav hetromer) and renders them inactive. I also show that behaviors mediated by the orthologous Drosophila channel are responsive to NAM. These results provide an intriguing link between metabolic regulation and TRPV channel activity thus opening avenues for future research.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14733], "author_name_tesi": "Awani, Awani ", "last_name_ssi": "Awani", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Awani", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Molecular, Cellular and Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wendy Hanna Rose, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["TRPV", "ION CHANNEL", "C ELEGANS", "NICOTINAMIDE", "CELL DEATH"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "essays on economic theory", "id": "26174", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11473", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis consists of four chapters. The first two chapters examine a role of\ncommunication to sustain cooperation/collusion. The first chapter, written jointly\nwith Vijay Krishna, studies a role of communication in cartels. Our analysis is\ncarried out in Stigler\u2019s (1964) model of oligopoly with secret price cuts. This is a\nrepeated game with private monitoring since in the model, firms observe neither the\nprices nor the sales of their rivals. For a fixed discount factor, we identify conditions\nunder which there are equilibria with \"cheap talk\" communication that result in\nnear-perfect collusion\u2014profits are close to those of a monopolist\u2019s\u2014whereas all\nequilibria without such communication are bounded away from this outcome. Thus,\nin our model, communication leads to higher prices and profits.\nThe second chapter is a precursor of the first chapter. In this chapter, I examine a\na model of a repeated prisoner\u2019s dilemma, and show that cheap-talk communication\nis necessary in order to achieve cooperative outcomes in a long-term relationship.\nUnlike the first chapter, I study a continuous time model \u00e0 la Abreu, Milgrom and\nPearce (1991). Actions have to be held fixed for a certain period, but signals arrive\ncontinuously over time. Monitoring is private and players communicate regarding\ntheir private signals. Through communication players can aggregate private signals,\nand this helps them detect defections. It is shown that under certain conditions,\nthere exists an equilibrium with communication that strictly Pareto- dominates all\nequilibria without communication.\nThe third chapter constructs and analyzes a model of reputation in which\nreputation of a player affects not only terms but also chances of trade, and hence\nreputation plays an allocational role. It is shown that reputational concern can be\nharmful to the society once the allocational role of reputation is taken into account.\nMore precisely, over-provision of quality may occur, even when the net value of\nproducing a high-quality good is larger than that of low-quality a goods\nThe last chapter, written jointly with Hiroki Fukai, is a contribution to monetary\neconomics.

Current methods of identification of networks include computationally-based and experimentally-based methods, though only the latter have the ability to probe amino acid networks under a variety of ligand-bound conditions.  A recently developed NMR-based technique is known as the CHEmical Shift Covariance Analysis (CHESCA) method was used to identify and characterize the amino acid networks in isolated \u03b1-subunits of tryptophan synthase (\u03b1TS).  \nTryptophan synthase (TS) has long been studied for the intersubunit communication observed between the \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits (\u03b2TS) as well as the intramolecular channel connecting the two active sites.  The conformational states of the two subunits are highly synchronized and it is possible that this extensive intersubunit communication is the result of the amino acid networks connecting \u03b1TS and \u03b2TS.  The use of \u03b1TS as the system allowed for the study of the enzyme under working conditions (i.e. while undergoing active catalytic turnover) and under resting conditions (i.e. while in the apo state), as well as two other, single ligand-bound states, revealing the ligand-dependency of the \u03b1TS amino acid networks.  Most importantly, two clusters of residues were identified in each state and the catalytic residue, Glu49, switches clusters only in the working state.  Additionally, the T183V substitution severs crucial hydrogen bonds between the dynamic \u03b22\u03b12 and \u03b26\u03b16 loops.  This disruption appears to prevent the cluster switch of Glu49 and results in a 14-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency.

A consequence of the equivalence is that a simple procedure for the design of the Near IO linearizing position controller is revealed. Furthermore, the cascade form allows one to view the robustness issues for position control from a Lyapunov backstepping perspective.

Finally, for a typical rough road profile, it is shown that the decentralized Near IO linearizing controllers \ngive a more than 60% performance improvement in the tracking error metric across all four actuators and a more than 50% improvement in response matching of the sprung mass acceleration power spectral density over the decentralized linear controllers.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [836], "author_name_tesi": "Ayalew, Beshahwired ", "last_name_ssi": "Ayalew", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Beshahwired", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mechanical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara E Kulakowski", "Moustafa El Gindy", "Heath Hofmann", "Kathryn Weed Jablokow", "Christopher Rahn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara E Kulakowski, Committee Chair", "Moustafa El Gindy, Committee Member", "Heath Hofmann, Committee Member", "Kathryn Weed Jablokow, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["actuator interaction", "sliding mode control", "input-output linearization", "feedback linearization", "electrohydraulic acutator", "road simulators"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Gut microbial nutrient provisioning of the xylophagous beetle Anoplophora glabripennis", "id": "20098", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9572", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-01-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tXylophagous insects are proposed to thrive on nutritionally suboptimal diets through symbiotic associations with microbes that supplement their nutritional requirements, particularly nitrogen (proteins).

Despite years of innovation, IVC filter-related complications remain common, including caval perforation, filter embedment, filter fracture, filter migration, persistence or worsening of deep-vein thrombosis due to IVC thrombosis, and recurrence of PE. In this thesis, a computational workflow is developed and demonstrated for simulating IVC filter placement, hemodynamics, and embolus transport and capture in patient-specific models reconstructed from medical image data.\n\nPatient-specific IVC geometries are first segmented and reconstructed from clinical computed tomography data. Virtual IVC filter placement is then performed using nonlinear finite element analysis with vein-filter contact modeling and nonlinear constitutive models for the vein tissue and nitinol IVC filter. The blood flow and the transport and capture of emboli are simulated using a coupled computational fluid dynamics / six degree-of-freedom (CFD/6DoF) model that uses an immersed boundary method to resolve the blood flow around the emboli. The embolus-trapping performance of the filter is predicted by systematically varying embolus starting positions, embolus diameters, embolus densities, and IVC orientations in thousands of embolus transport simulations.\n\nSimulations reveal that patient-specific variations in the IVC cross-sectional shape cause a non-uniform distribution of vein\u2013filter contact forces among the filter struts (range of 8-26 mN per strut). Patient-specific anatomical features also generate regions of locally high or low wall shear stress (WSS) and affect secondary flow features such as Dean vortices and flow recirculation regions. Non-Newtonian blood effects are found to be significant in the IVC (e.g., up to a 50% difference in WSS between results obtained using a non-Newtonian model compared with using the Newtonian approximation) due to the predominance of low shear rates. Embolus transport simulations predict that embolus trajectories and capture rates for a given filter are sensitive to the IVC morphology, the embolus-to-blood density ratio, and the direction of the gravitational force (i.e., patient orientation).\n\nWith further development and validation, the computational workflow presented herein may be used to guide IVC filter design, to predict the in vivo performance of IVC filters, and to guide the selection and placement of IVC filters on a patient-specific basis. Simulations could also be used to improve preclinical testing standards such that benchtop experiments better mimic the in vivo environment and performance of IVC filters.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13231], "author_name_tesi": "Aycock, Kenneth Iven", "last_name_ssi": "Aycock", "middle_name_ssi": "Iven", "first_name_ssi": "Kenneth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Keefe B.

The abundance and the orientation of slickensides in black shale relative to gray shale show that bedding-parallel slip during flexural-slip folding favored reduced effective normal stress. This reduction in effective stress is inferred to occur during the buildup of maturation-related pore pressure. Morphology of slickensides is dependent on the minerals decorating the slip surface. Chlorite rich films show mirror-like morphology polish but posses ridge-in-groove striations on microscopic scale. Quartz and calcite fibers are covered with ridge-in-groove type of striation on mesoscopic scale as well. Slip surfaces are characteristic of three internal detachment zones in the Appalachian foreland, all cutting black. The interpretation is that the Hubbert-Rubey model for low effective stress favors that development of these detachment zones rather than the inherent weakness of the shale.

To generate a representative sample of femurs, the data from NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) III and NHANES 07-14 were used. A total of 36,019 femurs were generated using NHANES population demographics. A sample population containing 216,509 individuals was generated using weighted data in NHANES 07-14. Measurements of the proximal femur (head diameter, neck diameter, shaft diameter and neck-shaft angle) were made on the synthesized femurs using shape fitting algorithms. Gender different were investigated with controlling input variables. The males measurements were found significantly bigger than females except for neck-shaft angle. The measurements collected from synthesized NHANES III are compared with data from the real NHANES III proximal femur measurements gathered from 2D x-ray images. The synthesized NHANES III measurements were compared with synthesized NHANES 1314 and, the recent population measurements were found slightly bigger except neck-shaft angle. Correlation tests between input demographics and output measurements were performed. The neck-shaft angle was found strongly correlated and decreasing with age. The changes of measurement were investigated between years and races pairs. The significant changes were found in most of the year pairs except head diameter. Most of the race pairs were also found significantly different. Additionally, the relationship between bone geometry and hip fracture was investigated using NHANES 07-10 & 13-14 questionnaire data.

The uncertainty of a thermal hydraulic code prediction is calculated with uncertainty analyses. The objective of all the uncertainty analysis is to determine how well a code predicts with corresponding uncertainties. If a code has a big output uncertainty, this code needs further development and/or model improvements. If a code has a small uncertainty, this code needs maintenance program in order to keep this small output uncertainty. Uncertainty analysis also indicates the more validation data is needed. \n\nUncertainty analyses for the BWR nominal steady state and transient scenarios are necessary in order to develop and improve the two phase flow models in the thermal hydraulic codes. Because void distribution is the key factor in order to determine the flow regime and heat transfer regime of the flow and critical power is an important factor for the safety margin, both steady state void distribution and critical power predictions are important features of a code. An uncertainty analysis for these two phenomena/cases provides valuable results. These results can be used for the development of the thermal hydraulic codes that are used for designing a BWR bundle or for licensing procedures. \n\nThis dissertation includes the development of a particular uncertainty methodology for the steady state void distribution and critical power predictions. In this methodology, the PIRT element of CSAU was used to eliminate the low ranked uncertainty parameters. The SPDF element of GRS was utilized to make the uncertainty methodology flexible for the assignment of PDFs to the uncertainty parameters. The developed methodology includes the uncertainty comparison methods to assess the code precision with the sample-averaged bias, to assess the code spreading with the sample-averaged standard deviation and to assess the code reliability with the proportion of specimens among the sample with a bias lower than the experimental uncertainty. Besides, the rankings of dominant phenomena are observed with the second comparison method (sensitivity analysis). Simple Random Sampling, Order Statistics, Richardson Extrapolation are some of the methods that are in the developed methodology. This uncertainty methodology was implemented for the COBRA-TF predictions.

Engineering students are expected to grasp more concepts in a faster manner than ever before in order to adapt to this rapidly changing world. For future engineers to stay relevant in society, they must be taught important concepts in such a way that they can gain all necessary information in their relatively short college years. The field of sustainability is a key engineering topic gaining attention in recent years due to our changing world conditions. Current teaching methods intended to introduce Architectural Engineering students to in-depth sustainable building design concepts do not typically begin until the later part of students\u2019 academic careers. \n\nThis research sought to improve sustainability education of engineering students through the development and implementation of an augmented reality-based simulation game called ecoCampus. ecoCampus allowed first-year engineering students to create different \u201cwhat if\u201d design concepts, visualize those designs in the context of an existing space, and receive performance feedback about those concepts related to sustainability and other key building metrics. The findings from the implementation of ecoCampus were compared to two other, paper-based experimental treatment activities to understand the benefits of this type of tool. \n\necoCampus was shown to help students resist the tendency toward design fixation within the context of a self-directed, time-constrained learning environment better than with the use of paper-based design methods. Additionally, through the design brainstorming process, students demonstrated a tendency to critically assess their design concepts to improve their developed designs more than students who completed the paper-based methods were able to do. In addition to the educational contributions, this research documented the process for creating this type of new educational tool, which included the specific steps followed to create ecoCampus as well as the pitfalls that were observed during development. The findings from this research have helped to create an understanding about how these types of technologies can be used in future educational research efforts and also an understanding of a process that can be followed for developing future applications like ecoCampus.

Environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture, are more easily manipulated in high tunnels, thus increased tomato fruit quality and yield, and predictable early and late season harvests are commonly observed. Consequently, interest in high tunnels has rapidly grown. Tomatoes are the most commonly produced food crop in high tunnels across the US, though high tunnel specific nitrogen (N) fertilizer recommendations are yet to be developed. Growers currently rely on N recommendations for open-field tomato production, but yield potential and plant vigor are generally increased under high tunnels, and the environment may alter crop N needs.\nTomato \u2018Scarlet Red\u2019 was grown under high tunnels in central Pennsylvania (PA) to develop N recommendations. A RCB split-plot design with three replicates was used in 2015 and 2016. Urea was applied pre-plant (0, 37.5, and 75 lbs N per acre, main plot factor) and through weekly fertigation (0, 80, 120, and 200 lbs N per acre, split-plot factor) and the effects on fruit yield, plant biomass, total leaf N and soil nitrate (NO3-N) studied. A secondary objective was to compare the pre-sidedress nitrate test (PSNT) and leaf N sampling standards to determine if PSNT could be used to determine the need for additional N in a system where soil nutrient leaching is limited and N is supplied both pre-plant and through weekly fertigation.\nIn PA, N recommendations for open-field fresh-market tomato production are for a total of 125 lbs N per acre, with 50 lbs N per acre applied pre-plant and 75 lbs N per acre through irrigation (i.e. N fertigation) for cultivation in fine texture soils with high or optimum potassium (K) levels or organic matter (OM) content that exceeds 2%. In this study, the greatest number of fruits were harvested from plants that received 75 lbs N per acre pre-plant and a total of 80-120 lbs N per acre through fertigation. Years differed significantly in fruit marketability, and the total N recommendations for open-field production or 45 lbs N per acre less N was sufficient for marketable yield in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Unmarketable yield was greater in 2016, mostly due to blossom end rot, and was positively correlated with pre-plant N rate during the first 3 harvest weeks. Leaf N content was generally greatest in treatments that received 120 or 200 lbs N per acre through fertigation, and was significant in 2016 during the last 4 of the 6 samples taken 47, 76, 86 and 91 days after planting (DAP), and in only 2 samples (79 and 95 DAP) in 2015. Soil NO3-N results from PNST were varied, and did not strongly correlate with either pre-plant or fertigated N, however elevated soil NO3-N was sampled in 2016 compared to 2015. This study suggested that determinate tomatoes grown in high tunnels can be grown with open-field recommendations or less N, and N requirements are highly dependent on the site conditions and high tunnel management.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15246], "author_name_tesi": "Ayers, Kathleen Marie", "last_name_ssi": "Ayers", "middle_name_ssi": "Marie", "first_name_ssi": "Kathleen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Berghage Jr.", "Richard P Marini", "Jason Philip Kaye"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Berghage Jr., Thesis Advisor", "Richard P Marini, Committee Member", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["High tunnels", "Nitrogen", "Plant Nutrition", "Nutrient Recommendations", "Tomato", "Vegetable Production", "Fertigation"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "The Included Middle: Logos in Aristotle's Philosophy\n", "id": "7312", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4818", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-10T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation is a research of the various meanings of logos in Aristotle\u2019s philosophy and the conceptual relation between them. Our method is dialectic, bringing a survey of Aristotle\u2019s philosophy together the argumentation of our thesis. We started from the very beginning of the Aristotelian corpus, we devoted our first two chapters to Aristotle\u2019s logic, chapters III and IV to his philosophy of nature, and our last chapters V and VI to his ethical political philosophy. Thus, we have worked on four fundamental meanings of logos respectively: \u201cstandard\u201d, \u201cproportion\u201d, \u201creason\u201d and \u201cdiscourse\u201d.\nOur thesis is the following. In its four fundamental meanings in Aristotle\u2019s philosophy, logos each time refers back to a focal meaning: a relation between terms that preserves them together in their difference instead of collapsing one term to the other or holding them in indifference. Thus \u201cstandard\u201d, \u201cproportion\u201d, \u201creason\u201d and \u201cdiscourse\u201d as well as their synonyms and derivatives all refer back to a relation between formerly contrary or mutually exclusive terms. Thus the term logos in Aristotle provides the inclusive counterpart to what could appear as a simply exclusive principle of non-contradiction or of the excluded middle.\nMost significantly, the sense of logos which defines human beings refers to their ability to understand and express both experiences made first hand and experiences they have not had and may or will never have first hand. It is this sense of logos that sheds light on the specifically human character of education, science, historiography, politics, psychology, sophistry and philosophy.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4795], "author_name_tesi": "Ayg\u00fcn, \u00d6mer ", "last_name_ssi": "Ayg\u00fcn", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "\u00d6mer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Russon", "Daniel Joseph Conway", "Veronique Marion Foti", "Christopher P Long", "Mark Munn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Russon, Committee Chair", "Daniel Joseph Conway, Committee Chair", "Veronique Marion Foti, Committee Member", "Christopher P Long, Committee Member", "Mark Munn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["reason", "language", "aristotle", "logos"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Manganese Oxide/reduced Graphene Oxide Hybrids \nas Anode Materials For High-performance Lithium-ion Batteries", "id": "23720", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10846", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis project, Mn3O4/rGO hybrid nanomaterials using as anode for lithium-ion batteries have been studied.

Research outlined in this work evaluated sequence analysis of the Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and \u03b2-tubulin gene of isolates of S. homoeocarpa and closely related taxa from a wide geographic region in North America. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of 50 isolates of S. homoeocarpa obtained from both cool and warm-season turfgrass species identified two genetically distinct isolate type groups, which we have termed Type I and Type II isolates. Type I isolates were predominately obtained from C3 (or cool-season) turfgrass hosts, and Type II isolates, which were obtained solely from C4 (or warm-season) turfgrass hosts. The results indicate that isolates in the two isolate types are likely cryptic species, and that isolates in the Type II group are more widely dispersed than previously reported and are common in the transition zone of the United States, where both host species are grown in close proximity. These two isolate types are collected from their expected host types in field conditions throughout the transition zone. To date, there is no research evaluating the effect of temperature on the growth of both isolate types, and therefore, in vitro growth measurements of three isolates representing both isolate types were compiled over a wide range of temperatures (10-35\u00b0C). Our results suggest optimal growth for Type I and Type II isolates occurs from 25-30\u00b0C. These temperatures were used in cross inoculations studies to evaluate the ability to cause disease and the level of virulence of both isolate types when inoculated on both the preferred and alterative host types. Results indicate that Type I and Type II isolates are able to cause disease on both C3 and C4 hosts and that Type I isolates are overall more virulent than Type II isolates on both host types. Results suggest that Type I and Type II isolates are host-adapted. These findings will likely have disease management implications for warm-season turfgrass species being used more frequently, especially in Mid-Atlantic States. Bermudagrass is gaining popularity for athletic field turf and golf course turf for its durability, as well as its ability to thrive with reduced chemical, fertility and water inputs. A molecular detection method capable of detecting both isolate types using conventional PCR was developed for rapid identification of S. homoeocarpa based on the ITS region. Additionally, primer/probe sets for the quantification of fungal biomass in planta using quantitative PCR was developed and validated using ITS region and elongation factor 1-\u03b1 sequence data. The elongation factor 1-\u03b1 primers and probe amplified an 84-bp region. S. homoeocarpa fungal biomass collected in planta from perennial ryegrass leaf blades symptomatic with dollar spot had detectable levels of fungal biomass resulting in Ct values from 22.275 to 25.742. Detectable levels of S. homoeocarpa biomass were also present in asymptomatic tissue at significantly higher levels than in symptomatic tissue, with Ct values from 29.990 to 36.783. This research developed a quantitative assay that may be used as a potential tool in future work investigating the amount of pathogen fungal biomass required to incite disease. Such findings may be useful in the development of field applicable detection methods to reduce fungicide applications.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [13103], "author_name_tesi": "Aynardi, Brian Alexander", "last_name_ssi": "Aynardi", "middle_name_ssi": "Alexander", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wakar Uddin", "Wakar Uddin", "Gary Moorman", "Donald Durwood Davis", "John Edward Kaminski III", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wakar Uddin, Dissertation Advisor", "Wakar Uddin, Committee Chair", "Gary Moorman, Committee Member", "Donald Durwood Davis, Committee Member", "John Edward Kaminski III, Outside Member", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Dollar spot", "turfgrass", "q-PCR", "Genetic diversity", "Sclerotinia homoeocarpa"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Managing the invisible obvious: The entanglement of innovation, strategy, and organizing", "id": "15274", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7729", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The production environments of today are not the same as the production environments of yesterday. The intensification of globalization and increase in market turbulence over the past forty years has exposed the limits of order (e.g., efficiency, predictability, and control) with those of un-order (e.g., emergence, non-linearity, and experimentation). The implication is a need to rethink the nature of the firm and that of innovation.\nSuch a focus is particularly acute in the context of the established firm, which must remain nimble and adaptive to be able to create new competencies, while simultaneously exploiting but entangled in existing competencies, i.e., innovation\u2019s paradox. Effectively innovating in this context requires more than just the ability to generate new ideas, put strong leaders in place, and provide extensive resources; it also requires a deep competency in managing what may be termed the invisible obvious \u2013 the social and material assumptions, meanings, and affordances that are embedded in and guide organizational activity.\nWhat is the invisible obvious in the established organization? This dissertation explores a possible explanation and its implications for innovation and strategic management. Specifically, I conducted a year-long immersive study at the Intel Corporation that examined how people interpret innovation and how those interpretations are entangled with and make up the core competencies of the firm. From this, I found three markedly different conceptions of innovation that drove these entanglements: technologic, economic, and humanistic. I term these conceptions innovation frames and explicate the nature and dynamics of the concept using my ethnographic interviews and a case study based on a newly formed disruptive technology that emerged from within Intel. I tie this newfound concept of innovation frames to the fields of strategy and innovation and argue for a shift in their theoretical and practical conversations that center on the relationship between interpretation and organizing \u2013 a link made visible through the examination of individual and the firm-level innovation frames.\nIn conclusion, I develop a strategic model for innovation, the L\u2019oer Model, that identifies multiple innovation pathways around which firms can create new competencies in the face of innovation\u2019s paradox. A redefining of the firm as a sociomaterial entanglement, the model reshapes our thinking on the question of innovation and suggests that the long-term survival of a firm depends on managing the invisible obvious.

Animals and humans both gain several advantages from their deceptive abilities, hence researchers have started to develop different ways to introduce deception in robots. Although deception is really important, not a lot of work has been done on its applications in robotics. In this paper, previous work on deceptive robot motion in a binary target system for a manipulator is analyzed and applied on a mobile robot simulator with some further improvements. Moreover, a new adaptive algorithm is proposed to randomly choose deceptive trajectories, based on the previous choice of them, to deceive humans in the long run. A mathematical formulation of the deceptive algorithm using Markov decision processes (MDP) is also presented and an updated Markov process (called Adaptive Markov Process) is developed. The mathematical model presented is an extension to a simple higher order Markov process using a number of new factors and variables, in particular the inclusion of reset and distribution of probabilities in a more intelligent manner. Different studies were performed with human participants to test deceptive strategies\u2019 performance on a mobile robot simulator. Furthermore, studies also showed that the adaptive deceptive algorithm is more effective in deceiving humans in the long run than just a normal random algorithm. A different set of user studies were performed with human participants to test our adaptive deceptive algorithm and analyze the effectiveness of each deceptive strategy in the long run on a mobile robot. Our studies showed that the adaptive algorithm did deceive humans in the long run and each strategy was either more or equally deceptive when used in the adaptive algorithm than when used independently.

There has been an increasing need and thus search for optimal modulation classifiers due to ever increasing variety of digital modulations. \n\nThe modulation classification technique discussed here is being designed for a real-time Software-Defined Radio (SDR) system to be implemented on SDR development boards and it is robust and efficient with a processing time overhead low enough to allow the software radio to maintain its real-time operating objectives. We are investigating classification of digital single-carrier modulations as well as multi-carrier modulations. The method is to use the waveform's In-phase--Quadrature (I--Q) diagrams and, by employing clustering algorithms on them, determine the type of modulation being transmitted.  \n\nFor classifying single-/multi-carrier modulations, we further study existing methods to find the appropriate Gaussianity test to classify single-carrier signals from multi-carrier ones. This technique may require a lot of processing power; however, with today's technology, it is feasible. Thus, we try to find the test with the best error rate and least amount of processing time.\n\nWe also include this algorithm with methods to extract the features of an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signal in the case of multi-carrier modulations. We also utilize the clustering algorithms to propose a new method in correcting frequency imbalances and I--Q offsets in OFDM signals as a mean of signal synchronization.\n\nThis new Modulation Classification method will be capable of determining the type of modulation scheme among different PAM, PSK, QAM, and OFDM modulations and can be further expanded to include any new modulation scheme.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4800], "author_name_tesi": "Azarmanesh, Okhtay ", "last_name_ssi": "Azarmanesh", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Okhtay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sven G Bilen", "Sven G Bilen", "Julio Urbina", "James Kenneth Breakall", "John F Doherty", "John D Mitchel", "Kyusun Choi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sven G Bilen, Dissertation Advisor", "Sven G Bilen, Committee Chair", "Julio Urbina, Committee Member", "James Kenneth Breakall, Committee Member", "John F Doherty, Committee Member", "John D Mitchel, Committee Member", "Kyusun Choi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["modulation classification", "cognitive radios", "Software-defined radios", "OFDM"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Patriarchy, Militarization, and the Gender Gap in Education: The Case of Pakistan", "id": "9422", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6313", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study investigated the effects of patriarchy and militarization on women\u2019s educational attainment in Pakistan, where the literacy rate is among the lowest in the world, roughly two-thirds of all women cannot read or write, and even modest goals of girls\u2019 primary school enrollments seem elusive.

Meprin isoforms are enriched in human as well as rodent intestine. They have also been reported in kidney, leukocytes, lung and skin. Considerable research has been conducted regarding the in vitro functions of these proteases, however the physiological roles of these proteases are unknown. Generation of meprin beta, alpha and alpha-beta knock-out mice were steps towards filling this void.\n\nThis work reports the general characterization of the meprin alpha knock-out mouse and investigates the role of meprin proteases in the mouse intestine using a model of colitis. Several polymorphisms have been identified in the human meprin alpha gene that significantly correlate with ulcerative colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, which make this mouse model relevant to the human pathology. Human and rodent intestines have high but non-uniform meprin expression and hence allow one to study the contributions of different meprin isoforms. To understand the role of meprin A, colitis was induced in wild-type and meprin alpha knock-out mice by dextran sulfate sodium administration. Meprin alpha knock-out mice showed greater susceptibility to injury and had a phenotype of heightened inflammation as evidenced by different markers of inflammation at macroscopic as well as molecular level. Further investigations showed a role for mucosal meprin A in the process of tissue repair. To understand the phenotype of increased inflammation, meprin interaction with immune-mediators was studied at greater detail. This led to the first known documentation of an in vivo interaction of meprins with an immune-mediator, interleukin\u201318. Subsequent experiments using meprin alpha-beta knock-out mice elucidated the contribution of meprin B in the phenotype in this model of inflammatory bowel disease. These experiments collectively demonstrated a novel function of meprins in immuno-modulation. \n\nThis thesis furthers our knowledge about the roles of meprin metalloproteases in the rodent intestine and also elucidates the importance of proper distribution of meprin isoforms. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5913], "author_name_tesi": "BANERJEE, SANJITA ", "last_name_ssi": "BANERJEE", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "SANJITA", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Judith S Bond", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "Sergei A Grigoryev", "Harriet C Isom", "Cara Lynne Schengrund"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Judith S Bond, Committee Chair", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member", "Sergei A Grigoryev, Committee Member", "Harriet C Isom, Committee Member", "Cara Lynne Schengrund, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["MEPRIN", "INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "RACIALIZATION OF CRIME: A TEST OF CITIZENSHIP STATUS ON CRIMINAL PERCEPTIONS", "id": "13700dvb5473", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13700", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Criminal behavior can happen independent of country of origin, culture, religion, race, ethnicity, age, or gender.

These arrays consist of MEMS microbolometer pixels as small as 17 &#956;m \u00d7 17 &#956;m that are fabricated on CMOS read-out circuitry (ROIC). Vanadium oxide thin films are often used as the imaging layer in the microbolometers because they have a high temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR), low noise characteristics and low resistivity. These films have been commercially made for over two decades using ion beam sputtering.\nThis work focuses on fabrication of VOx layers via pulsed dc reactive magnetron sputtering of a vanadium metal target. In particular, this work discusses the effect of rf substrate bias on the structure and electrical properties of vanadium oxide (VOx) thin films processed via pulsed dc sputter deposition. The VOx films were deposited using pulsed DC (20 kHz, 90% duty cycle) magnetron reactive sputtering with various Ar:O ratios at pressures between 1 and 5 mTorr. The substrate rf bias was varied between 0-40 Watts (corresponding to dc self-bias of -50 volts to -340 volts) during deposition of the VOx thin films. Earlier work on pulse dc magnetron sputtering indicated that VOx films processed without substrate bias have resistivity 1 &#937;.cm and consist of fcc rocksalt type VOx nanocrystallites in an amorphous matrix. On the other hand, cross-section transmission electron microscopic studies of films fabricated with an rf substrate bias indicated formation of a nanocrystalline columnar microstructure with micro-twins embedded in them. Electrical properties such as resistivity, temperature coefficient of resistivity, and 1/f noise of VOx films are compared as functions of substrate bias conditions. Films processed with rf substrate bias exhibit lower resistivity and higher TCR values than unbiased samples deposited under identical conditions (Ex: 0.05 &#937;.cm resistivity sample exhibited TCR values &#8776; -2.2%/&#9702;K with rf substrate bias as opposed to 0.1 &#937;.cm with TCR of &#8776; -1.7%/&#9702;K). The rf bias during the film growth dramatically changes the structure and thereby changes the electrical properties.\nIn conclusion it is demonstrated that it is possible to deposit VOx thin films for &#956;-bolometer applications using pulsed dc reactive sputtering with rf substrate bias that have electrical prop-erties that are equal to or surpass films currently fabricated via ion beam sputter deposition.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2149], "author_name_tesi": "BASANTANI, Hitesh Arjun", "last_name_ssi": "BASANTANI", "middle_name_ssi": "Arjun", "first_name_ssi": "Hitesh", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark William Horn", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark William Horn, Thesis Advisor", "Mark William Horn, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Low Noise", "Sputtering", "Substrate Bias", "Microtwins", "Infrared Imaging", "High TCR", "Bolometer", "Vanadium Oxide"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Thin Film Materials and Devices for Resistive Temperature Sensing Applications", "id": "23039", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10533", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Thin films of vanadium oxide (VOx) and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) are the two dominant material systems used in resistive infrared radiation detectors (microbolometers) for sensing long wave infrared (LWIR) wavelengths in the 8-14 \u03bcm range.  Typical thin films of VOx (x < 2) currently used in the bolometer industry have a magnitude of temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) between 2%/K - 3%/K.  In contrast, thin films of hydrogenated germanium (SiGe:H) have |TCR| between 3%/K to 4%/K. Devices made from either of these materials have resulted in similar device performance with NETD \u2248 25 mK. The performance of the microbolometers is limited by the electronic noise, especially 1/\u0192 noise. Therefore, regardless of the choice of bolometer sensing material and read out circuitry, manufacturers are constantly striving to reduce 1/f noise while simultaneously increasing TCR to give better signal to noise ratios in their bolometers and ultimately, better image quality with more thermal information to the end user.\n\tIn this work, thin films of VOx and hydrogenated germanium (Ge:H), having TCR values > 4 %/K are investigated as potential candidates for higher sensitivity next generation of microbolometers. Thin films of VOx were deposited by Biased Target Ion Beam Deposition (BTIBD) (~85 nm thick). Electrical characterization of lateral resistor structures showed resistivity ranging from 104 \u03a9-cm to 2.1 x 10^4 \u03a9^cm, TCR varying from -4%/K to -5%/K, normalized Hooge parameter (\u03b1H/n) of 5 x 10-21 to 5 x 10-18 cm^3. Thin films of Ge:H  were deposited by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) by incorporating an increasing amount of crystal fraction in the growing thin films. Thin films of Ge:H having a mixed phase, amorphous + nanocrystalline, having a |TCR| > 6 %/K were deposited with resistivity < 2,300 \u03a9-cm and a normalized Hooge\u2019s parameter \u2018\u03b1H/n\u2019 < 2 x 10-20 cm3. \nHigher TCR materials are desired, however, such materials have higher resistivity and therefore unacceptable large electrical resistance in a lateral resistor configuration. This work looks at an alternate bolometer device design which incorporates higher TCR materials in a vertically integrated configuration. Thin films of high TCR hydrogenated germanium (Ge:H, |TCR|  > 6%/K) and vanadium oxide (VOx , TCR > 5%/K) were integrated in lateral and through film configuration. The electrical performance of the vertically integrated devices is compared with lateral resistance structures. It was confirmed experimentally that the device impedance was significantly lowered while maintaining the signal to noise ratio of the lateral resistor configuration. The vertically integrated devices allow higher device currents without any increase in self heating. These structures may help reduce integration time and may result in higher frame rate. \nFinally, one dimensional arrays were fabricated using both lateral and vertically integrated configurations and their performance was evaluated. It was found that the performance of the lateral devices was limited by noise floor of the measurement setup used. However, due to the lower impedance of the vertically integrated resistors, a higher signal and therefore higher signal to noise ratio could be obtained. These vertically integrated devices exhibited low RMS noise values of 12 mK.

Its impact on Earth system functions is likely to increase in the future when the proportion of the world\u2019s population living in urban areas is expected to grow dramatically. Thus, many policymakers are starting to look for ways to control sprawl through smart growth policies before it becomes unmanageable. However, the mechanisms by which sprawl takes place and the likely impact of smart growth on sprawl and on various stakeholders are not yet fully understood. Therefore, there is a need to develop a comprehensive methodology for sprawl analysis and its containment.\nConsequently, the goal of this dissertation was to provide a research framework and methodologies that contribute to the understanding of sprawl dynamics and its containment. It arrives at this goal through three analyses. The first analysis addresses sprawl and landscape fragmentation in Centre County, Pennsylvania through cross-tabulation, identifying the dominant and systematic land use transitions in the area and subsequently, the explanatory drivers of urban land use location through logistic regression. The second analysis projects future urban land use location in Centre County through simulation modeling using the CLUE-S modeling framework and includes validation and uncertainty analyses of the simulated products. By assessing the price elasticity of residential land demand and housing supply, the third analysis evaluates the feasibility of remedying sprawl by implementing smart growth policy through land price increases without compromising affordability of housing in Centre County.\nThe results of these analyses demonstrate that land use transitions are predominantly from agriculture to urban land. The primary explanatory drivers of urban land use location in Centre County are soil and topographic factors. The validation of the simulation of near future urban land use location is encouraging, although sprawl projections show significant temporal decay. The output of the sprawl simulation is sensitive to decision rules on the ease of conversion to urban of other land use categories and to weights of input parameters. Price elasticity of residential land demand is relatively high, thus implying that smart growth policies that increase land price are likely to contain sprawl without increasing housing price. In sum, the analyses suggest that effective sprawl containment not only calls for a comprehensive analysis of local land use dynamics to confirm that sprawl is a problem, but also requires that policy makers are aware of the uncertainty inherent in sprawl model projections for informed and realistic application of model output in their planning policies. To avoid failure of sprawl amelioration measures, stakeholders who are liable to feel the effects of these measures and are likely to resist their implementation should be identified and incorporated in the policy process from its inception.\n\nKey words: urban sprawl, smart growth, affordable housing, explanatory drivers, simulation uncertainty, land demand\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4624], "author_name_tesi": "BATISANI, NNYALADZI JAY", "last_name_ssi": "BATISANI", "middle_name_ssi": "JAY", "first_name_ssi": "NNYALADZI", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Brenton Yarnal", "William Ewart Easterling Iii", "Donna Jean Peuquet", "Rick Lane Day"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Brenton Yarnal, Committee Chair", "William Ewart Easterling Iii, Committee Member", "Donna Jean Peuquet, Committee Member", "Rick Lane Day, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["urban sprawl", "smart growth", "affordable housing", "explanatory drivers", "simulation uncertainty", "land demand"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "A Study on the Effect of Delivery Vehicles on the Efficacy of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 in Humans", "id": "27551", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12211", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-12-04T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (BB-12) is a probiotic strain that has been used as a food ingredient and food supplement worldwide since 1985 with well-documented health benefits. It has been commonly delivered in fermented dairy products for perceived health benefits including facilitating bowel transit, increasing gut short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production, and modifying gut microbiota (increase the ratio of potentially beneficial to harmful microbes). In addition to traditional fermented dairy-based probiotic-containing products, many new types of probiotic-containing products such as juice-based, chocolate-based, and capsules have been developed. While these provide more options for people to access probiotics, little research has been done on the effect of delivery matrix (dairy vs. non-dairy) on the efficacy of BB-12 in humans. In addition, it was not clear how yogurt fermentation might impact the survival of BB-12 in the product or on its performance in vivo. In order to address these questions, a randomized clinical trial was conducted using BB-12 delivered by capsule (CAP) or yogurt smoothies.\n\nThe first step in the project was to identify a selective medium for the enumeration of BB-12 in yogurt product where high concentration of live cultures Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LB) and Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) are present. After evaluation of different selective media, the MRS-NNLP agar was found to effectively inhibit growth of ST and LB, and was subsequently chosen for BB-12 enumeration. Then three yogurt smoothies: 1) a control yogurt smoothie without BB-12 (YS), 2) a yogurt smoothie with BB-12 added pre-fermentation (PRE), or 3) post-fermentation (POST), were developed. Compositions (fat and total solids) of the yogurt smoothies were measured following each production. The concentration of BB-12, ST, LB, and pH of the products were measured weekly during shelf life. Data from 27 batches indicated the BB-12 population in the yogurt smoothies was stable during shelf life and comparable within and across batches. The population of BB-12 declined in both PRE and POST throughout shelf life and was found to decrease faster in the POST drink as compared to the PRE drink. The BB-12 remained at the specified dose level (log10 10 \u00b1 0.5 CFU per/serving) throughout shelf life of the products.\nThe second objective was to evaluate the effect of BB-12 interventions on the gut transit time and fecal SCFA production in healthy adults. A total of 36 healthy adults aged 18-40 years with a BMI of 20-35 kg/m2 were recruited in this controlled, 4-period crossover, free-living study. Participants received each of the 4 treatments in a random order. When consuming yogurt smoothies, participants consumed 240 g of yogurt smoothie per day or on the capsule treatment, they consumed a probiotic capsule per day, receiving a dose of log 10 \u00b1 0.5 CFU of BB-12/day. Dietary intake of total calories and various nutrients were assessed via self-reported 3-day dietary recall. Gut transit times were measured at baseline using the blue dye and a telemetry device known as a SmartPill\u00ae, and after each treatment using SmartPill\u00ae only. Stool and blood samples were collected at baseline and after each treatment. Fecal SCFAs were extracted using ethyl acetate and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). A significant positive correlation (Spearman rho = 0.67, P < 0.0001) was observed between blue dye and SmartPill\u00ae transit times, suggesting that the blue dye method remained a reliable cost-efficient approach for baseline screening for whole gut transit time (WGTT). No significant treatment effect was observed on either GTT or fecal SCFAs. However, this study is the first to demonstrate the possible relationships among regional gut transit times and fecal SCFAs in healthy adults, and the results from this study confirmed a number of correlations that have been reported previously. Notably, the predominant SCFAs negatively correlated with WGTT, colonic transit time (CTT), and gastric emptying time (GET), but had little to do with small bowel transit time (SBTT).\nThe third objective was to survey the gut microbiota of participants before and after different BB-12 interventions. Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated from fecal samples using the MOBIO PowerSoil DNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol with modifications. The DNA samples were amplified for the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Amplicons were then sequenced at the DNA Technologies Core Facility of the University of California, Davis on an Illumina\u00ae Genome Analyzer II sequencing platform. After removing samples with low quality and poor compliances, about 2.4 million sequences from 147 stool samples were analyzed using QIIME. Overall, 10 phyla and 109 genera were identified in the participants. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria accounted for > 98% of the sequences at the phylum level. No significant treatment effect on the gut microbiota was detected due to the large interpersonal and intrapersonal variations observed except that yogurt interventions resulted in a higher relative abundance of Streptococcus than the capsule treatment. A significant gender effect was observed when comparing the gut microbiota of the present study cohort.\nIn an effort to understand the relationships between gut microbiota and host immune and metabolic responses, the beta-diversity results were grouped by parameters including sex, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TGs), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), and etc., a number of statistically significant differences were found. However, further studies are needed to validate these relationships, because either only a small percentage of difference could be explained by the grouping, or only a few data points were in one of the two arms.\nTo further explore the effect of the interventions on the relative abundance of members of Bifidobacterium genus, DNA samples were analyzed using bifidobacteria specific terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (Bif-TRFLP). Interestingly, the two BB-12-containing yogurt smoothies (PRE and POST) resulted in significantly higher percentage of B. animalis when compared to baseline, to the BB-12-free yogurt smoothie (YS), to the BB-12 containing capsule (CAP), and after final washout.\nIn conclusion, the BB-12 survived well in yogurt smoothies throughout shelf life (< 1 log decrease) and survived better in the pre-added treatment than in the post-added product perhaps due to BB-12\u2019s adaptation to the acidic environment during fermentation. Little treatment effect was observed on either GTT or fecal SCFAs. The predominant SCFAs negatively correlated with regional transit times except for SBTT. Small treatment effect on the gut microbiota was detected while gender effect was found to be significant in the present study cohort. BB-12 containing yogurt smoothies resulted in higher relative abundance of B. animalis than BB-12 containing capsule.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11602], "author_name_tesi": "Ba, Zhaoyong ", "last_name_ssi": "Ba", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhaoyong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert F Roberts", "Robert F Roberts", "Ryan John Elias", "Rodolphe Barrangou", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert F Roberts, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert F Roberts, Committee Chair", "Ryan John Elias, Committee Member", "Rodolphe Barrangou, Committee Member", "Penny Margaret Kris Etherton, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["BB-12", "gut microbiota", "delivery vehicles", "yogurt smoothies", "probiotics", "Bifidobacterium"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Synthesis of advanced control structures for complex chemical processes using sensor networks", "id": "26458", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11513", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In recent years the interest in control of distributed parameter systems (DPSs) has significantly increased in the chemical and advanced material process industries. This is due to the need to synthesize control structures for complex transport-reaction processes which are characterized by the coupling of chemical reactions with significant convection, diffusion, and dispersion phenomena. Such processes as exemplified by packed and fluidized bed reactors in chemical plants, reactive distillation in petrochemical industries processes, most lithographic and deposition processes in microelectronics and advanced materials manufacturing, and finally crystal and glass production, exhibit spatial variations that need to be explicitly accounted for by the controller.\n\nAn important observation is that the long term behavior of the above chemical processes can be captured by a finite number of degrees of freedom; thus the partial differential equation (PDE) descriptions can be effectively approximated by reduced order models (ROMs) in the form of finite dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs). For processes with nonlinear spatial operators and/or complex process domains, the ODEs can only be obtained via data-driven order reduction methods. Their major shortcoming is that they require a representative ensemble of solutions pre-exists for the process to be properly described, while there isn't a systematic method to ensure this important prerequisite. Currently, there is a lack of systematic and computationally-efficient data-driven methodologies for optimization and control of nonlinear PDE systems with complex spatial domains.\n\nThe proposed research will extend the applicability of control-oriented data-driven nonlinear order reduction methods for dissipative nonlinear PDE systems. The intellectual objective is to relax the requirement of a representative ensemble of solutions and develop a systematic data-driven order reduction methodology specifically tailored for control of PDE systems. It will thus resolve a fundamental limitation of data-driven techniques for control synthesis of spatially distributed processes. The main contributions of the proposed research can be classified as (a) deriving a computationally efficient adaptive model order reduction framework to circumvent the limitations of the current model order reduction techniques for control of nonlinear DPSs, and (b) synthesizing advanced output feedback control structures that can guarantee closed-loop stability and performance while (c) identifying criteria to minimize the required information for the controller structure revisions.

Farmers must continually adapt their practices as farm context changes. This thesis explores how farmers understand the social and biophysical contexts of their farms in relation to their: 1) views on and experiences with diverse sources of knowledge including information communication technology (ICT), local knowledge, and agricultural advisors, and 2) perceptions of good farming. Both topics were explored through empirical research based on semi-structured qualitative interviews conducted with 17 grain farmers and four agricultural advisors in southeastern Pennsylvania, and three focus groups conducted with grain farmers in northwest Italy. Located in close proximity to one another, the Pennsylvania farmers varied in terms of age, views about chemical use and soil management, and farm size. The Italian farmers were all members of farming cooperatives that made decisions about production and marketing collectively. Findings from data collection are organized as three distinct manuscripts in this thesis.  \n\nThe first manuscript (Paper 1) considers how grain farmers and agricultural advisors in southeastern Pennsylvania describe different sources of knowledge in farming in light of growing use of ICT and concerns over the sustainability of agriculture. Traditionally, farmers\u2019 reactions to technology in agriculture have been studied through an approach with a pro-innovation bias that prioritizes scientific knowledge. Paper 1 departs from this approach to consider the interplay of local knowledge, knowledge exchange between farmers and their advisors, and ICT as a knowledge source for farmers. The study found that participants used knowledge about their own farms and knowledge from their neighbors to make farming decisions. Additionally, while some farmers co-produced knowledge with an agricultural advisor, others expressed a greater dependence on their advisors to make decisions. In relation to ICT, farmers had mixed views about its convenience, and a few expressed concern that greater use of ICT for farming could replace farmers\u2019 human knowledge and skills. Some viewed ICT as less relevant to older farmers; however on the contrary, a few older farmers discussed their desires and efforts to use ICT. The findings suggest that to promote sustainable agriculture, developers of information technologies must identify creative approaches to designing ICT, as well as take into account the different sources of knowledge farmers consider when making decisions. \n\nThe second manuscript (Paper 2) takes a lifeworld approach to consider how Pennsylvania farmers\u2019 past experiences, stocks of knowledge, and interpretations of how others farm shape their understandings of good farming. Farmers\u2019 own ideas about good farming are important because of their potential to complicate typically compartmentalized and competing labels such as \u201calternative\u201d versus \u201cconventional\u201d farming. Findings centered on three primary themes: becoming a good farmer, displaying good farming, and typical perceptions about good farming. One implication of this research is that agricultural paradigms such as alternative and conventional prove difficult to apply at the individual farm level, as farmers meanings of good farming are embedded in their lifeworld, making them complex, dynamic, and sometimes uncertain.\n\nThe final manuscript (Paper 3) offers an international comparative perspective on the broad topics explored in Paper 1 and Paper 2. It is based on data from three focus groups conducted with a total of 19 members of farming cooperatives in northwest Italy. Relevant to the topic of diverse sources of knowledge and ICT, main themes included the importance of farming cooperatively and the general absence of smartphone usage by these Italian farmers. The Italian farmers viewed use of ICT as less relevant to farming than some Pennsylvania farmers who viewed it as inevitable. Farmers in both countries shared local knowledge with their farming neighbors; however, the Italian farmers described themselves as highly dependent on one another, especially in being members of cooperatives. In terms of good farming, salient themes expressed by the Italian farmers included the importance of passion and displaying good farming through farm appearance for others to see. In large part, the Italian farmers\u2019 views of good farming were similar to those of the Pennsylvania farmers. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10236], "author_name_tesi": "Babbie, Kristin Barbara", "last_name_ssi": "Babbie", "middle_name_ssi": "Barbara", "first_name_ssi": "Kristin", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Clare Hinrichs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Clare Hinrichs, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["sustainable agriculture", "good farming", "information communication technology", "Pennsylvania", "Italy", "farming", "sociology", "rural"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Effects of 2-hydroxyestradiol on binge eating in rats", "id": "14682", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7500", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "One conundrum of binge eating is that women are more likely to suffer from binge-related eating disorders, even though estradiol decreases food intake.  2-hydroxyestradiol (2OHE2), an estrogen metabolite, may account for the contradiction, due to possible interference with dopamine (DA) signaling.  Therefore, a series of studies was conducted in order to investigate the effects of 2OHE2 on binge eating in an established rat model.\nResearch presented in Chapter 2 investigated the acute effects of 2OHE2 on bingeing.  Two cohorts (1 male, 1 female) of 34 non-food-deprived rats were each separated into two groups: 1) daily control (D) (received an optional source of dietary fat for 20 min every day) or 2) bingeing (INT) (received fat intermittently, i.e. 20 min on Mon, Weds, Fri).  During the 5-week binge induction period, shortening intakes escalated over the 5-week binge induction period significantly faster in females than in males, such that males consumed significantly less fat relative to body mass than did females after 5 weeks. This result is consistent with the idea that biological differences contribute to sex differences in bingeing. Rats of both sexes were then injected with 2OHE2 (1.0, 3.0, and 10.0 \u03bcg/kg intraperitoneally), vehicle, or 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2) immediately prior to fat access. Fat intake was significantly stimulated by 2OHE2 only in the INT rats (p<0.03). Furthermore, this effect seemed to be more subtle in females than in males.  The results indicate that 2OHE2 can acutely exacerbate intake in a bingeing rat.  Additionally, results suggest that females may escalate intakes faster due to endogenous hormones.  \nResearch presented in Chapter 3 investigated the effects of chronic administration of 2OHE2 on bingeing, and the effect of 2OHE2 on DA efflux in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of bingeing rats.  In study 1, three groups of female rats (n=16 per group) were used.  Group one was ovariectomized (OVX) and implanted with an osmotic mini-pump containing 2OHE2 (E); group two underwent OVX surgery and received a vehicle implant (O); group three underwent sham surgery and received a vehicle implant (I).  All rats were exposed to the INT protocol described above.  After four weeks, shortening intake escalated more quickly in the E rats than in either the O or I rats.  Additionally, during week 4, E rats ate significantly more shortening than did I rats, and significantly less chow than either O or I rats.  The results indicate that 2OHE2 can exacerbate binge escalation and shift intake from more homeostatically-driven eating to more hedonic eating.  \nIn study 2, male rats (n=6) were exposed to a minimum of 5 weeks of the INT protocol before they were implanted with a microdialysis guide cannula targeting the PFC.  DA efflux was recorded before, during, and after presentation of shortening and intraperitoneal injection of either 2OHE2 (3.0 \u03bcg/kg) or vehicle.  2OHE2 abolished the shortening-evoked DA efflux that was present after injection with vehicle, and significantly enhanced shortening intake. These results demonstrate that 2OHE2 can alter DA signaling in the PFC of bingeing rats.\nThe results of the present studies indicate that 2OHE2 can exacerbate intake both acutely and chronically in a rat model of bingeing.  These effects may due, in part, to the effects of 2OHE2 on DA signaling in the PFC.  Together this suggests a novel mechanism explaining the increased risk for binge-related eating disorders in females.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7439], "author_name_tesi": "Babbs, Richard K", "last_name_ssi": "Babbs", "middle_name_ssi": "K", "first_name_ssi": "Richard", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rebecca L Corwin", "Rebecca L Corwin", "Erica Unger", "John E Hayes", "Barbara Jean Rolls"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rebecca L Corwin, Dissertation Advisor", "Rebecca L Corwin, Committee Chair", "Erica Unger, Committee Member", "John E Hayes, Committee Member", "Barbara Jean Rolls, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["binge", "2-hydroxyestradiol", "sex differences", "rat", "eating disorders"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "First Year Experiences of African American Students at a Predominately White Institution: Considering Influence of Ethnicity and Socioeconomic Status through Cultural Capital Theory", "id": "7844", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3734", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-05-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Many scholars continue to call attention to the growing socioeconomic divide within the African American population (Wilson, 1987; Gates & West, 1996; hooks, 2000; Dyson, 2005).

The shifting socioeconomic background characteristics of first-year African American college students at four-year institutions reflect the growing class distinction within the African American population. Despite this increasing heterogeneity, current research on African American college students typically addresses socioeconomic status separately from ethnic identity. This study contributes to postsecondary research by investigating the compounding effects of ethnicity and socioeconomic identity for African American student experiences during the first-year of university study. \n\nThe influence of socioeconomic background differences on educational experiences for African Americans has been considered extensively at the secondary level through the use of Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s cultural capital theory. Cultural capital refers to background - knowledge base, skills, and attitudes - families of the dominant socioeconomic class transmit to their children (Lareau & Weininger, 2003). In an effort for the dominant class to maintain their status position, some forms of culture are devalued, while other forms are legitimized and honored within social institutions. \n\nQualitative research methods, specifically a multiple case study method, were employed for this study.

All participants were entering their first-year at a selective, doctoral research extensive institution located in the Mid-Atlantic United States. Face-to face, semi-structured interviews were conducted three times during the academic year. In between interviews, participants highlighted significant academic and social experiences in journal entries. During the data analysis phases, four themes emerged reflecting the experiences of African American students during their first-year at a predominately White institution: 1) Constructing an African American identity; 2) Converting various forms of cultural capital; 3) Experiencing stereotypes and racism; and 4) Developing bicultural perspectives. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3715], "author_name_tesi": "Baber, Lorenzo DuBois", "last_name_ssi": "Baber", "middle_name_ssi": "DuBois", "first_name_ssi": "Lorenzo", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Higher Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Beverly Lindsy", "Patrick T Terenzini", "Regina Deil Amen", "M Christopher Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Beverly Lindsy, Committee Chair", "Patrick T Terenzini, Committee Member", "Regina Deil Amen, Committee Member", "M Christopher Brown, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["african american students; first year experiences;"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Mothers' Work in Schooling Children: Perspectives from Immigrant Asian-Indian \nMothers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "6993", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5599", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-13T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "<p>The task of educating children to meet the demands of the twenty-first century has become a huge challenge for parents and teachers in the United States.  For many immigrant parents who for better economic opportunities come \u201cvoluntarily\u201d (Ogbu, 1991a) to the United States, their children\u2019s schooling becomes of primary importance to them.  In the case of immigrant parents from non-western countries, e.g. from Asia, many of whom are viewed as \u201cminorities\u201d in the United States, cultural differences between themselves and mostly white American school personnel often create stress and anxiety for parents as they become concerned about their children\u2019s schooling. </p>\n\n \n<p>For many immigrant mothers, unfamiliarity with the American educational system may raise concerns about the effectiveness of their role as mothers, causing them to worry about their \u201cmothering for schooling\u201d (Griffith, 1995; Griffith & Smith, 2005) work and about how to help their children adjust between culturally divergent home and school environments.  As an immigrant, minority Asian-Indian mother, and early childhood educator, I can personally relate to such a transitional and cultural dilemma.  </p>\n\n\nIn the United States, public schools and other educational institutions have not been adequately prepared to provide culturally responsive environments to accommodate parents and children of divergent backgrounds.  Unsettling tensions about \u201cpublic\u201d schooling continue to persist between mostly white American educators and parents of non-mainstream cultural groups.   In a country of innumerable minority and immigrant cultures, strategic considerations regarding \u201cculturally responsive teaching\u201d (Gay, 2000) practices within public schools have been rather slow.  In addition, many schools have not been able to adequately involve immigrant minority parents to negotiate cultural differences between their home and their children\u2019s school. Even definitions and meanings of childhood as understood in majority schools create barriers and limitations for alternative expressions, thus enforcing a code of silence among immigrant, minority children and parents.  <br><br>\n\n\nFollowing the implementation of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, several professionals from India began to migrate to the United States.  However, despite their good English language skills, many Asian-Indian immigrants found their social interaction patterns different from the mainstream white American cultural norms.  <br><br>\n\n\n\nRegarding children\u2019s schooling, Asian-Indian immigrant parents, including the mothers of this study often find themselves unprepared, not so much with the academic aspects of schooling, but more with the social aspects of white American schools.  Many mothers may find themselves spending more time and energy teaching their children about ethnic pride, cultural heritage, language, food, family structure etc.  <br><br>\n\n\n\nThere are not enough studies focusing on immigrant minority women, and even less on those pertaining to immigrant Asian-Indian women, who are the focus of this study.  Despite the fact that they are considered to be part of a `model minority\u2019 immigrant group, adequate attention has not been bestowed upon their mothering for schooling work.  <br><br>\n\n\n\nBased on my own experiences as a voluntary immigrant, minority Asian-Indian mother, the frustration of keeping up with one\u2019s own cultural and family goals, while simultaneously staying connected to unfamiliar white American schools, can be very taxing on the mothers. More so, in cases when the mothers find that their children\u2019s schooling experience and educational success largely rests upon their work as primary care givers.   <br><br>\n\n\n\nUsing a feminist lens, supported by focus group and follow up interviews, this study examines and analyzes Asian-Indian mothers\u2019 everyday challenges of schooling children as they navigate themselves between culturally divergent contexts; their home, children\u2019s white American school and communities at large.   In addition, this study also highlights Asian-Indian mothers\u2019 creative responses to their everyday social, emotional and cultural tensions in schooling children, which are greatly shaped by their gender, culture, social-class and immigrant minority status.  More importantly, my collaborations as an insider within this group, and some previous pilot research study that I have done, forms an important background context for this dissertation.    <br><br>\n\n\n\nThis qualitatively designed study is geared to be subjective in nature, facilitating interpretation of the multiple realities of immigrant Asian Indian women\u2019s mothering for schooling experiences, while allowing me, the researcher to be part of the emerging study.  Feminist interview research as a method of investigation has provided strategies to theorize the lived reality and highlight the emerging thoughts, ideas and behaviors, which shaped Asian-Indian women\u2019s mothering for schooling process.   <br><br>\n\n\n\nExploring Asian-Indian women\u2019s mothering for schooling experiences from a feminist perspective helps developing understanding of their everyday mothering for schooling work lives, alongside addresses issues of gender, culture  social class and immigrant status.  In addition, feminist theoretical explorations while highlighting women\u2019s oppression, seeks to analyze and create awareness about the conditions that shape women\u2019s lives.   <br><br>\n\n\n\nThis study is not meant for comparing immigrant minority Asian-Indian mothers with other women belonging to minority or majority groups. Instead, it is designed to facilitate mothers to share their stories and in the process bring to the forefront mothers\u2019 often taken for granted voices, vulnerabilities, strengths, weakness as well as experiential and situated knowledge.  Last but not least, the ultimate purpose of this study is to create understanding about Asian-Indian mothers and their work in schooling children.  <br><br>\n\n\n\nFocus group interviews and follow-up interviews served as data generating method for use within this qualitative design.  It involved two groups, one consisting of six mothers and the other consisting of four mothers. Mothers in both the groups were familiar with each other as well as the subject matter.  The group participation which defines focus-group interviews is a highly efficient data collection procedure, and helped in gathering more information in a short period of time.   Focus group interviews were followed by additional one on one in-depth interview, in which two mothers from each group were selected to participate. The four mothers were selected for follow-up interviews because of the choices they made in response to their mothering for schooling work and for the kind of changes they made for themselves.  \n <br><br>\n\n\nI was drawn to this method of inquiry, because of its interpretive qualities, that emphasized the process, rather than the product.  Although attention was directed to the strengths and weaknesses of a life experiences, unlike the nature of developmental theories, issues of incorporating validity and reliability were less emphasized.  Since issues of subjectivity and reflexivity are on going, fragmented and interrupted, this study does not focus on the \u201cfixed\u201d truths.  \n <br><br>\n\n\nAll of the mothers who participated in the focus group interviews were married and resided in a small rural campus town in Mid-Atlantic section of the United States of America.  Mothers who participated in this study came from two-parent, Hindu, middle and upper middle class families in India, except for one mother who hails from Sri Lanka but in every sense like a South Indian woman.  They come from diverse families, from different parts of India.  Besides English they speak multiple languages, representing many states in India.  They are part of a growing Asian-Indian community consisting of nearly hundred families, spanning a wide age range, from senior citizens to small babies.  The community has been spread out, families live in several areas of town and majority of their children attended their local community public schools. Majority of the adults in the community, mostly spouses, are associated with the local university as professionals, in academic, administrative and research capacities.\n <br><br>\n  \nEach focus group interview was divided into four phases. Phase one was centered on Asian-Indian mothers\u2019 childhood and early schooling experiences in India.  Phase two was centered on their mothering for schooling experiences.  In Phase three, mothers focused on the future.  Finally, in Phase four, mothers made their concluding remarks and reiterated their mothering for schooling beliefs and opinions.  However, the boundaries between the four phases were fluid, in the sense they did impose any restrictions or limitations in mothers\u2019 participation.  In other words, the boundaries between the four phases were loose, and in many ways proved to be quite purposeful in extrapolating the mothering for schooling phenomena.  Fluid boundaries were beneficial to everyone in sharing their stories, for the participants as well as for me, the researcher, and helped us stay focused, without getting sidetracked from the research topic.  Many of these stories are presented in this thesis.\n <br><br>\n\nBy narrating their stories, mothers of this study, were able to interpret their mothering for schooling experiences and transmit their ideas based on those experiences.  Being voluntary immigrants meant rethinking their mothering for schooling agenda as well as redefining their ethnic understandings of mothering, schooling and mothering for schooling work.  As first generation immigrants and educated women, who had their early and elementary education in their country of origin; unfamiliarity with the American educational system raised concerns about schooling rituals, teaching/learning philosophies, and organizational priorities prevalent among American public schools in their local community.  \n <br><br>\n\nUnlike mainstream white American mothers, whose culture in general parallels with that of the public schools, first generation immigrants many who came as adults, found themselves faced with misunderstanding and confusion about their children\u2019s schooling. While trying to get adjusted to new social and cultural environments, many mothers also worried about the impositions of the school culture on their mothering work as well as on their children\u2019s personality development.   Hence the frustration of keeping up with one\u2019s own cultural and family goals, while simultaneously staying connected to unfamiliar white American schools, made their work very taxing.  In addition, differences in terms of their color, ethnicity, language, food, religion, values beliefs and family structure etc. forced them to overcome cultural barriers and also negotiate cultural differences.\n <br><br>\n\nMothers found that their perceptions about schools and schooling as experienced in the past were very different, quite unlike their perceptions about American public schools and schooling rituals. In order to adequately respond to their present mothering for schooling experiences, they found themselves reflecting on their past schooling experiences to make sense of their present experiences.  They used their past experiences as a resource to sustain themselves with their everyday challenges of mothering work. Through retrospection mothers negotiated the past with the present and even reinvented the wheel.  The study revealed mothers became learners again, to find that their mothering for schooling work is subject to time, space and circumstance.  Hence, they used their past experiences as a resource, to integrate their past with their present and future lives in America.   \n <br><br>\n\nMothers\u2019 stories revealed that contextual and cultural differences between home and school compelled them to formulate their mothering for schooling work as a mediated process.  Mothers found themselves doing supplementary mothering for schooling work, to make up for the deficits created within culturally defined environments, like their children\u2019s American schools, as well as their Indian homes.  In addition, it also meant, mothers investing more time and physical energy, extending themselves beyond their homes, into schools, local communities, mainstream community as well as their own ethnic community.  \n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5590], "author_name_tesi": "Babu, Sudha G.", "last_name_ssi": "Babu", "middle_name_ssi": "G.", "first_name_ssi": "Sudha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson", "Marnina K Gonick", "Debra M Freedman", "Madhu Suri Prakash"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Ewald Johnson, Committee Chair", "Marnina K Gonick, Committee Member", "Debra M Freedman, Committee Member", "Madhu Suri Prakash, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["immigrant mothers", "Asian-Indian", "mothering", "schooling", "cultural differences", "family/school (dis)connections"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "SUPPORTING THE USER EXPERIENCE IN FREE/LIBRE/OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\n\n", "id": "9880", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4927", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the increasing number and awareness of free/libre/open source software (FLOSS) projects, Internet users can download a FLOSS tool that meets just about any need.

FLOSS projects center on software developer activities with little attention to user-centered design activities that could increase the user experience on the project. The purpose of this dissertation is to understand open source software ecology in order to bring support for user experience design activities on FLOSS projects. CodePlex, an open source project hosting website, serves as the open source software ecology. \nThe research consists of two phases, a descriptive science phase and a design science phase. In the descriptive phase fieldwork in the form of ethnomethodologically informed ethnography describes the everyday activities of three groups: the team that produces CodePlex, the participants who use CodePlex to produce open source projects, and user experience practitioners who bring their expertise to design software with a positive user experience. The descriptive phase also includes an analysis of activity awareness of the three groups. The design science phase consists of a claims analysis that provides design rationale for a design that proposes to support UX activities on CodePlex. The results show that activity awareness contributes to the socio-technical solution where UX activities can be supported as a new community of practice, with features that support building social capital. The UX support features include a UX workspace where UX contributors recognize their value and other features that support the presence of UX throughout the project site and the CodePlex community. \nThis dissertation contributes empirical materials from the descriptions of everyday activities of the three groups and analytic materials generated from the activity awareness and claims analyses that are translated into design representations. Specifically the contributions include 1) mechanisms of articulation work of the three groups and how the mechanisms contribute to the design representation; 2) the demonstration of a translation science in computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and human-computer interaction (HCI); and 3) an understanding of how UX activities and software engineering activities integrate. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4904], "author_name_tesi": "Bach, Paula M", "last_name_ssi": "Bach", "middle_name_ssi": "M", "first_name_ssi": "Paula", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Millar Carroll", "John Millar Carroll", "Mary Beth Rosson", "Andrea H Tapia", "Steven Raymond Haynes", "Alison Alene Carr Chellman"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Millar Carroll, Dissertation Advisor", "John Millar Carroll, Committee Chair", "Mary Beth Rosson, Committee Member", "Andrea H Tapia, Committee Member", "Steven Raymond Haynes, Committee Member", "Alison Alene Carr Chellman, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Free/Libre/Open Source Software", "user experience", "activity awareness", "open source usability", "usability", "open source", "FLOSS", "Human Computer Interaction", "Computer Supported Cooperative Work"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Anticipatory Child Fostering and Household\nsocioeconomic Security in Malawi", "id": "15098", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7615", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Child fostering is practiced throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa and is often used by families to o\u000bset economic risk and insecurities.

While the study of child fostering has historically resided in the domain of anthropologists, the practice has also garnered the attention of demographers, who recognize that, in the context of sub-Saharan Africa, where families and households are notoriously complex, childrearing is as important as childbearing. As the AIDS epidemic calls into question how systems of child fostering may be changing, a divide has emerged between scholars. Some believe that systems of fostering are failing in the face of the morbidity and mortality burden of AIDS, while others maintain that the institution of child fostering remains robust.  This dissertation positions itself in the midst of this debate, using repeated cross sectional data from 20 countries and rich longitudinal data from a study in Malawi to provide both a pan-African and in-depth account of changing and existing fostering norms.  I focus explicitly on households and individuals who host foster children to (1) empirically chart the health of fostering systems---as determined by foster child residence patterns---over the course of the AIDS epidemic, (2) illuminate how child fostering is experienced by families who host foster children, and (3) examine the consequences of hosting a foster child for young adult\u00d5s fertility preferences.  The findings from the first two studies in this dissertation help answer questions about how the practices of child fostering have and have not changed.  Findings from the first study demonstrate that, in most countries, foster children reside in wealthier households throughout the epidemic and that poorer households take on the majority of fostering responsibilities only in particularly high HIV prevalent regions.  Using in-depth qualitative interviews with people who fostered children, the second study highlights that although child fostering may have increased in quantity, the overall quality of the fostering experience has largely remained the same. The final study leverages longitudinal data and finds that fostering a child is positively associated with the odds of a person decreasing their ideal family size, thus empirically demonstrating what demographers have heretofore assumed: that childrearing responsibilities influence individuals' childbearing intentions.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10519], "author_name_tesi": "Bachan, Lauren Kate", "last_name_ssi": "Bachan", "middle_name_ssi": "Kate", "first_name_ssi": "Lauren", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jenny Trinitapoli", "Jenny Trinitapoli", "David R Johnson", "Kevin J Thomas", "Nancy Kay Luke", "Brian King"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jenny Trinitapoli, Dissertation Advisor", "Jenny Trinitapoli, Committee Chair", "David R Johnson, Committee Member", "Kevin J Thomas, Committee Member", "Nancy Kay Luke, Committee Member", "Brian King, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Families", "Child Fostering", "Africa", "Malawi"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Using population structure and phenology to advance insect management in diversified vegetable agroecosystems", "id": "16087", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8012", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-09-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Population structure and phenology can both be used to advance insect management in diverse vegetable agroecosystems.

One of these aphids, Aphis glycines, is largely present in the state as a result of migration and dispersal from areas with high densities of its overwintering host, Rhamnus cathartica. Using genetic tools and air-flow trajectory models to investigate the natal sources of A. glycines in Pennsylvania, I found A. glycines populations sampled in Pennsylvania had high levels of genotypic diversity.

A series of two- and three-dimensional finite-element groundwater models are presented here to simulate groundwater nitrate transport and remediation in the Florida Keys, where wastewater injection is suspected of contributing to the deterioration of the offshore coral reef.  These models include quantification of the hydrogeology of reversing groundwater flow due to tidal pumping and nitrate removal rates based on a new application of a molecular technique for measuring microbial respiration rates.  \n\tPhysical constraints on tidal pumping, including comparisons of net to total submarine groundwater discharge rates and the variable-density mixing of recirculated seawater, were derived from observed tidal properties and published aquifer characteristics, with model calibration to previously conducted tracer experiments.  The model demonstrates that even moderate tidal fluctuations are capable of driving reversing groundwater flow patterns, with net groundwater velocities and tracer distributions that closely match field measurements.  Tidally pumped contaminant plumes were shown to be more dispersed than plumes in comparable static flow fields.\n\tMicrobial denitrification rates were correlated with the relative abundance of the expressed nitrite-reductase gene nirS as measured by Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Reaction (Q-RT-PCR), to determine if gene expression is proportional to the rate of the metabolic process facilitated by the gene product.  Measured denitrification rates by cultures of Paracoccus denitrificans varied from 1.67 to 50.5 mg/l/hour, and relative gene transcript abundances varied from 16 to 303 copies/ml.

This apprehension is significant in the Philippines since it has long officially subscribed to gender mainstreaming and is ranked high in gender equity indices. \n\nThe study focused on analyzing the extent to which Philippine institutional climate change efforts integrate gender concerns.

When the helicopter is operated near its flight boundary, the required power and vibratory loads rapidly increases which impose a limit on the helicopter operation. Various methods were proposed and studied in order to achieve performance improvement under such operating condition. The effect of active control scheme was examined for its impact on the performance improvement and vibration reduction in the present study.  \n\nNumerical simulations are based on the UH-60A Blackhawk helicopter with an active Gurney flap spanning from 70$\\%R$ to 80$\\%R$ of the main rotor. For obtaining the aeroelastic response of the rotor blade, finite element method was used to represent elastic blade. The aerodynamic loads acting on the blade are provided by CFD based 2D lookup table. Prescribed wake model was used to resolve the induced inflow over the rotor disk. The unsteady aerodynamic behavior due to the higher harmonic actuation of active Gurney flap was resolved by the time-domain unsteady aerodynamic model. \n\nThe first part of preliminary study covers parametric study using Gurney flap. Starting with simple rigid blade representation of the rotor blade, the effect of 1/rev Gurney flap actuation was examined on three different gross weights. The effect of active Gurney flap width, the chordwise location of active Gurney flap, the effect of unsteady aerodynamic model, and the effect of 2/rev actuation frequency were examined. The second part of preliminary study was conducted with the elastic blade model to include the effect of torsion dynamics. \n\nPerformance improvement using active Gurney flap was examined for maximizing thrust capability at two flight speeds. 1/rev Gurney flap actuation increased the gross weight capability up to 1,000 lbs. Also, 1/rev actuation of Gurney flap increased maximum altitude limit of baseline rotor by 1,400 ft. Furthermore, it was predicted that the maximum level flight speed can be increased by 30 knots with respect to that of the baseline rotor. \n\nThe effect of active Gurney flap on the vibration reduction was first examined at the stall condition. Using 1/rev actuation, in-plane vibratory force and moment can be reduced by 68$\\%$ and 44$\\%$, respectively. The effects of higher harmonic frequencies were investigated at the high-speed cruise speed, and single frequency phase sweep was conducted to find the best phase angle that minimizes each vibratory components. 3/rev actuation yielded 36$\\%$ reduction in in-plane vibratory moment. 74$\\%$ reduction in vertical vibratory force was predicted with 4/rev actuation. With 5/rev actuation, 81$\\%$ reduction in vertical vibratory load was observed. With the input-output information obtained from single frequency phase sweep, the plant model which correlates active control inputs to helicopter vibratory loads was constructed. Multicyclic controller was applied to the plant model, and 25$\\%$ reduction in the cost function was reported. Vertical vibratory load was reduced by 51$\\%$, and inplane force and moment were reduced by 18$\\%$, 22$\\%$, respectively.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7595], "author_name_tesi": "Bae, Eui Sung", "last_name_ssi": "Bae", "middle_name_ssi": "Sung", "first_name_ssi": "Eui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi", "Edward A Smith", "Mark David Maughmer", "Christopher Rahn", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Farhan Gandhi, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward A Smith, Committee Member", "Mark David Maughmer, Committee Member", "Christopher Rahn, Committee Member", "George A Lesieutre, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rotorcraft", "Performnce Improvement", "vibration Reduction", "Gurney flap", "MiTEs", "microflap", "vibration", "power"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "The Welfare Consequences of Carbon Tax Reform in Open Economies: The Application of Computable General Equilibrium Model for Pennsylvania", "id": "6873", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3148", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-08-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "ABSTRACTS\nTaxes on environmental externalities have long been recognized in the economics literature as a cost-effective mechanism for reducing the costs of environmental degradation.  However, in recent years there has been substantial interest in other possible benefits from environmental taxes, most notably, the economic gains that could result from substituting revenues from environmental taxes for conventional, distortionary taxes on labor income or other goods and services.  Emerging from this literature is the \u00a1\u00b0double dividend hypothesis\u00a1\u00b1 that the economic gains from environmental taxes will be greater if the revenues are used to reduce distortionary taxes rather than be returned to consumers through lump sum transfers.  \nMost theoretical and empirical research on the double dividend has been conducted under the assumption of a closed economy. This assumption removes the possibly important effects of interregional factor mobility and interregional trade.  Moreover it is an unrealistic assumption for most economies, and especially for those of small countries or sub-national political jurisdictions, such as states.  \nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the double dividend hypothesis in the context of an open economy.  The study specifically considers the hypothesis in the context of a carbon tax in the state of Pennsylvania.  To test the double dividend, the carbon tax revenues are used to reduce labor income taxes in the state.  A static CGE model is constructed for Pennsylvania.  The model captures key features of a regional open economy, most notably endogenous factor mobility, and interregional trade.  An innovative feature of the model is labor migration in response to environmental quality and the after-tax wage rate. \nResults show that the double dividend holds for the Pennsylvania model for a carbon tax imposed either unilaterally by the state government, but also for a national carbon tax. The magnitude of the double dividend is larger for the state tax than for the federal tax. Labor migration affects negatively the double dividend, but the impact is small.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3135], "author_name_tesi": "Bae, Jeong Hwan ", "last_name_ssi": "Bae", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Jeong Hwan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle", "Adam Zachary Rose", "David Gerard Abler", "Martin Shields", "Stephen Michael Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Samuel Shortle, Committee Chair", "Adam Zachary Rose, Committee Member", "David Gerard Abler, Committee Member", "Martin Shields, Committee Member", "Stephen Michael Smith, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Carbon taxes", "Double dividend", "Open economy", "Migration", "Trade", "Alternative energy", "fossil fuels", "CGE model"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Processes and Effects of Mobile Phone-mediated Social Interactions: Motives, Use Patterns, and Social Capital Outcomes", "id": "15402", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7604", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     Although some previous studies found positive associations between interpersonal communication media and social capital outcomes, such as life satisfaction, social trust, civic engagement, social leisure activities, and political engagement, little empirical research has been done on the examination of the mobile phone and its implications for social capital at the individual level.

However, little is known about the effects of ISO 9000 participation on the educational outcomes of schools.  The purpose of this study was to investigate empirical evidence regarding how the implementation of ISO 9000 is related to school performance, which was measured by student achievement on the state-mandated standardized tests and the student attendance rates of schools \u2013 or the graduation rates, in the case of high schools.  The study also examined whether the ISO 9000 standardized education system helps foster more educational equality by mitigating the effect of school socio-economic status on the overall student achievement of a school.\nThe study was conducted using schools in the U.S. that participated in ISO 9000. The unit of analysis was a school, and the sample was selected from 30 school districts including 8 school districts implementing ISO 9000.  The sample consisted of 330 schools at the primary school level, 157 schools at the middle school level, and 112 schools at the high school level; among them, 101 primary schools, 62 middle schools, and 36 high schools were implementing ISO 9000 as of 2004.\nThe dependent variables were a) average passing rates of students of schools on the state-mandated tests, b) average passing rates of economically disadvantaged students of schools on the state-mandated tests, and c) the student attendance rates of schools or, in the case of high schools, graduation rates.  Independent variables were a) the percentage of students in a school who receive free/reduced lunches, b) school-wide student-teacher ratio, c) annual per-pupil expenditure of school district, and d) ISO 9000 participation.  The data were taken from various sources including official 2003-2004 school year state and district report cards and the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES).  Taking into account the hierarchical nature of the data, this study employed a Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) statistical technique.     \nThe study found that a) there is no relationship between ISO 9000 participation and student achievement of schools \u2013 across students in general and economically disadvantaged students in particular; b) there is a significant relationship between ISO 9000 participation and the student attendance rates in elementary and middle schools; and c) the effect of school SES, measured by the percentage of students receiving free/reduced priced lunches, on student achievement of a school does not differ between ISO 9000 schools and non-ISO 9000 schools. \nThe study results provide two important policy implications.  First, the ISO 9000 quality management system in education, focusing on procedural standardization of classroom activities, may not work well as a quick-fix solution to improve school performance \u2013 especially, student learning.  Due to the long-established institutional features of education such as value-orientation, diversity, complexity, and unpredictability, procedural standardization of teaching and learning by ISO 9000 may be more difficult and less appropriate than ambitious business-oriented school reformers had expected.  Second, given the relationship between student attendance and achievement, however, this study does not completely rule out the possibility that ISO 9000 could positively influence school performance in the long run.  By helping schools become more organized and thus function well in the areas of essential school operations such as student and teacher attendance, ISO 9000 could contribute to building a school climate which helps enhance school performance without intimidating other important values such as teachers\u2019 professional autonomy and creativity in classrooms.    \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5798], "author_name_tesi": "Bae, Sang Hoon ", "last_name_ssi": "Bae", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sang Hoon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Workforce Education and Development", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth Gray", "David Lynn Passmore", "Judith Ann Kolb", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth Gray, Committee Chair", "David Lynn Passmore, Committee Member", "Judith Ann Kolb, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ISO 9000 Quality Management System", "School Peformance", "Quality and Equality of Education"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "TAXI TOUR GUIDES AS CULTURE BROKERS ON JEJU ISLAND, KOREA\n", "id": "11705", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6052", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-01T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tour guides are an example of culture brokers who play a significant role in mediating two different cultural groups (Brown, 1992; Cole, 2008; Jennings & Weiler, 2006). Local tour guides who originally come from the tourism destination are especially important as culture brokers because they mediate the relationship between tourists and local residents and interpret socio-cultural situations. There are several reasons why a study of local tour guides as culture brokers should be conducted. Despite their importance as mediators in tourists\u2019 experiences (Chambers, 1997), tour guides as culture brokers have not been empirically studied. In addition, tour guides have been considered a \u201clargely homogeneous group\u201d in most studies, while, in fact, there are various types of tour guides whose roles may differ (Cole, 2008, p. 119).\n \nThe purpose of this study is to probe the importance of the roles of local tour guides as culture brokers, particularly taxi tour guides (TTGs) on Jeju Island, Korea. A qualitative approach via phenomenological analysis was utilized to answer research questions about the perception of the TTGs\u2019 roles, cultural experiences or culture-brokering, and TTGs\u2019 local background along with the observed roles of TTGs as culture brokers. By approaching the research questions from the perspectives of tourists and TTGs, this study deals with a taxi tour phenomenon with vivid and in-depth description.\n\nOpen-ended, in-depth, semi-structured interviews and participant observation were conducted through two separate trips to Jeju Island, Korea in June 2010. Fifteen taxi tour guides, fifteen tourists, and one local individual (i.e., the manager of one of the biggest Jeju Island online travel communities) were recruited via purposeful sampling. Extensive field notes and transcriptions were analyzed using the qualitative data analysis software NVivo\u00a9 version 8.0. To clearly understand the detailed meanings and nuances of the data, they were transcribed and initially analyzed in Korean first. Later they were translated in English.\n\nThe results indicated that tourists\u2019 travel experiences were heavily influenced by taxi tour guides and, at the same time, taxi tour guides were aware of the significance of their roles with varying degrees of pride. In terms of culture-brokering or culture experiences, the most satisfying factor out of tourists\u2019 experience was explanation or interpretation by TTGs. TTGs also considered their explanation of Jeju culture as the key difference from other types of trips such as rental cars or package trips. In particular, tourists felt that TTGs from Jeju Island provide the best explanation of Jeju culture, which makes TTGs\u2019 background very important. However, not all the TTGs agreed that their background was a competitive edge. \n\nWhile looking at tourists and TTGs\u2019 perceptions of several factors, some constraints (e.g., irrational fare system) were found that hinder TTGs from working as culture brokers properly and TTGs\u2019 attitudes against these (i.e., pathfinders vs. free riders) were described as well.

In more detail, this study (a) provides a rich and in-depth description of the Railo culture, (b) demonstrates a coherent profile of the Railo culture and documents the degree to which Railers agree on it, and (c) examines the relationships between Railers\u2019 motivation, satisfaction, loyalty, and attachment to the country.\n\nThis dissertation is composed of five chapters including an introductory chapter (Chapter 1), the three interrelated studies on Railo (Chapters 2-4), and a final, concluding chapter (Chapter 5). I collected the data during two phases, phase I (June-August 2012; Railo summer 2012) and phase II (December 2012-March 2013; Railo winter 2013) using multiple data collection methods: ethnographic tools (e.g., interviews, observations, free listing surveys) and questionnaires (e.g., cultural consensus survey, structural equation modeling survey). The population for the first data collection was Railers who were traveling during the summer of 2012 or who had experienced Railo since its introduction in 2007. The population for the second phase of data collection was limited to Railers who made Railo trips between December 2012 and March 2013. \n\nThis study provides various insights into Railo and its influences on the domestic travel behavior of Korean youths. It also presents implications for Korail (Korean Railroad Corporation), local governments, and tourism organizations who are responsible for creating sustainable strategies for operating Railo and encouraging domestic tourism. Avenues for future research also were discussed in an effort to expand knowledge about travel, transportation, and culture.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9102], "author_name_tesi": "Bae, So Young  ", "last_name_ssi": "Bae", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "So Young ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Garry Chick", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Alan R Graefe", "Robert William Schrauf"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Garry Chick, Committee Chair", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Member", "Alan R Graefe, Committee Member", "Robert William Schrauf, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rail-Ro(Railo)", "Travel Culture", "Domestic Tourism", "Youth Tourism", "Rail Travel", "Korea"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CLOSING THE GAP BETWEEN FPGAs AND ASICs: THE APPLICATIONS OF CLOCK SKEW SCHEDULING ON FPGAs", "id": "11125", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6051", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Since the first field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) production in 1985, were used only as glue logic, FPGAs have dramatically improved to compete with application specific integrated circuits (ASICs).

In addition, today\u00a1\u00afs trends in shorter life cycles of products, and exponentially increasing costs of the mask and NRE with shrinking process technology make FPGAs the preferred design solutions over ASICs due to the advantages of faster time to market, field reprogrammability, and low non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost. However, the advantages of FPGAs,which have been brought by reconfigurable nature of FPGAs, come with the cost of slower speed, more power, and larger device size. Because FPGAs must use\nmore transistors and interconnects than ASICs for the same functionality.\nTo reduce the performance and power consumption gaps between FPGAs and ASICs, which are limiting factors of further widespread use of FPGAs, FPGA\nvendors have aggressively adopted the latest process technology with innovative FPGA architectures. Besides the hardware wise optimizations, FPGA CAD (Computer Aided Design) tools also have been improved to have state-of-art ability to optimize logic designs through various stages of the CAD flow.

Twelve psychotherapists were nominated by peers and were interviewed for approximately one hour each about a case of their choosing in which therapeutic gains were made. The interviews were analyzed primarily through grounded theory procedures, incorporating some elements of Consensual Qualitative Research. \n\tUltimately the theory consisted of a core category, \u201ctherapist reactivity management,\u201d that incorporated cognitive work, experiential change, responsiveness, and use of self. Therapist reactivity management was related to five other categories: causes of reactivity, reactivity, effects of reactivity, management facilitators, and management results.\n\tThe essence of the core category was the process of bringing therapist and client psychological needs into conscious relationship with each other. This definition captured the diversity of therapist experiences without reducing them down to a single pathway. Variations depended on therapist attitudes toward reactivity, degree of resolution of underlying issues, and the type and intensity of the challenge presented by the client. Two main approaches emerged: that of the wounded healer, and that of the relational expert. Results were integrated with existing literature and recommendations made for psychotherapist training and practice.\n\tThis study is the first qualitative investigation focused on countertransference management, and as such offers new possibilities for clinical application and understanding of a process recognized for nearly 100 years and crucial to helping troubled individuals through therapeutic relationship.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [321], "author_name_tesi": "Baehr, Alan ", "last_name_ssi": "Baehr", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Alan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Counseling Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jamie Myers", "Joyce Karen Illfelder Kaye", "James Edward Martin", "Jeffrey Hayes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jamie Myers, Committee Member", "Joyce Karen Illfelder Kaye, Committee Member", "James Edward Martin, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Hayes, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["countertransference", "wounded healer", "grounded theory"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "Mathematical and computational models for nanostructured coating using electron beam-physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD)\n", "id": "7573", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5921", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-11-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nanostructured coatings offer substantial improvement over conventional coatings in physical and mechanical properties such as hardness, strength, toughness and thermal conductivity.  There are numerous applications where nanostructured coatings have been found to beneficial including bio-mechanical implants, semiconductor thin films, propulsion, and power generation. In aircraft and power generation turbines, nanostructured thermal barrier coating (TBC) can significantly reduce fuel costs. There has been an acute need for a science base, such as dynamic models of nanostructured coating processes. Modeling the processes presents significant challenges because the physical variables are highly coupled and interact in a nonlinear manner. Real-time control of this process poses additional challenges because of the high vacuum, high temperature, and generally hostile environment for making in-situ measurements, which further motivates the need for good process models.\n\nThis research proposes unified models for controlling nanostructured coating process using electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD). Specifically, the following three dynamical models have been developed:\n1.\tMachine Dynamics Model \u2013 combines models of various component dynamics in the EB-PVD machine such as cathode heating, ingot melting, and evaporation.\n2.\tDeposition Process Model \u2013 mathematically characterizes the physical relationship between process parameters and the micro/nanostructure of the coating. \n3.\tSubstrate Kinematics Model \u2013 geometric models that are computationally efficient for modeling the kinematics of substrate and manipulator motion.\n\nOne of the main contributions of this work is the use of partial differential equations for the deposition process model to characterize the evolution of the coated surface. This has been used to characterize surface evolution at the macro-level (1 micrometer), at the meso-level (50 nanometers), and with limited fidelity at the nano-level (1 nanometer). The underlying partial differential equations have been solved using numerical techniques on a cluster of computers, and solutions have been found to agree well with experimental results published by independent researchers.\n\nA multi-criteria technique has also been developed to determine EB-PVD parameters by solving a optimization problem including four criteria: production cost, process efficiency, coating uniformity, and coating life-time. The technique combines a fuzzy-logic approach with a continuous variable control approach to enable interactive optimization. A simplified model of the EB-PVD process has been developed to relate current input to the EB gun to the coating thickness. This model has been used to design and simulate a real-time PID controller. Simulation results indicate that the controller performs well in terms of disturbance-rejection in input power. The controller requires real-time feedback from quartz-crystal microbalance sensors, which makes it practically feasible and serve as a basis for spatial composition control. \n\nAnticipated benefits of this research are the development of a science base for controlling nanostructured coating processes using the EB-PVD through reduced-order mathematical models and efficient computational models. This can be expected to lead to systematically engineered processes with high repeatability and low variance instead of the current \u201ctrial and error/recipe-based methods\u201d used in industry. This can be expected to have a significant short-term and long-term impact in several vertical industry sectors including energy, transportation, medical, and semi-conductor.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5915], "author_name_tesi": "Baek, Seungyup ", "last_name_ssi": "Baek", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Seungyup", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu", "Richard Allen Wysk", "Robert Carl Voigt", "Jogender Singh"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Vittaldas V Prabhu, Committee Chair", "Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Member", "Robert Carl Voigt, Committee Member", "Jogender Singh, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multiobjective optimization problem", "Simulation", "Level set method", "Nanostructured coating", "EB-PVD", "Feedback control"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Confirmation of Sphaerobolus stellatus as a Causal Organism of Thatch Collapse of Turfgrasses", "id": "17529", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8548", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-03-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In 2011, previously unreported disease symptoms were observed on golf course putting greens in the United States and New Zealand. Symptoms of this disease, referred to as thatch collapse, include dark green depressed patches approximately 8 to 46 cm in diameter. The patches of degraded organic matter result in a disruption of playability of golf course tees, fairways and greens. A single fungal species was commonly isolated from turfgrass grown in California, Michigan, Montana, South Dakota, and New Zealand. Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) revealed 695 to 724-bp sequences that were a 98% to 99% match to Sphaerobolus stellatus in the NCBI database. S. stellatus is a basidiomycete commonly found within wood mulch. Little is known about S. stellatus within turfgrass systems. When mature turf was inoculated with S. stellatus and incubated for 6 weeks, thatch layer depth and total organic matter was reduced 28% and 21%, respectively. Studies were conducted to assess the morphology, growth rates and gleba production of S. stellatus isolated from turf. The general morphology of gleba were closer to S. iowensis, but basidiospores were similar to S. stellatus. Optimal temperatures for growth of S. stellatus ranged from 21 to 30\u00b0C. Higher quantities of gleba were produce at 10, 15 and 20\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C with the highest quantities occurring within 11 weeks of incubation at 10\u00b0C. To understand the mechanism by which organic matter was degraded by S. stellatus, the structure of lignin and lignin modifying enzymes were assessed. Utilizing tetramethylammonium hydroxide thermochemolysis, a significant depolymerization of lignin was found when S. stellatus colonized organic matter for 6 weeks. The presence of laccase in an isolate of S. stellatus from turf, manganese independent peroxidase in S. stellatus isolates and xylanse in all fungal extracts illustrates the mechanism of organic matter reduction in turf. Overall, S. stellatus isolated from turf effectively degrades lignin within organic matter through laccase and peroxidase production, and therefore is confirmed to serve a causal agent of thatch collapse.

First, we focus on the Southern Hemisphere and compare eddy life cycles that have been separated by the rate at which they generate eddy available potential energy through Ekman pumping. We find that when this generation is anomalously large, the eddies are amplified with higher values of eddy kinetic energy. We attribute the amplification of these eddies to anomalously low values of barotropic conversion during their decay phase.\n\tNext, we turn our attention to the Northern Hemisphere during its winter. We separate the eddies into two horizontal scales \u2013 planetary and synoptic. We find that the planetary-scale wave life cycle leads to more Arctic warming than the synoptic-scale wave life cycle. This greater warming occurs despite the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and hemispherically integrated values of zonal available potential energy being close to their climatological values preceding the life cycle. We conclude that the growth of the planetary-scale waves is not reliant on baroclinic instability and the flux-gradient relationship. Rather, we find that enhanced localized tropical convection over the Pacific warm pool excites the planetary-scale waves. These planetary-scale waves grow in the mid-latitudes as they tap the Earth\u2019s vast reservoir of zonal available potential energy. They transport large quantities of sensible and latent heat into the Arctic which subsequently enhances downward infrared radiation and causes surface warming. An examination of the synoptic-scale cyclones during the planetary-scale wave life cycle reveals that over the North Pacific, individual cyclones and their attendant \u201catmospheric rivers\u201d are diverted northward into the Arctic from their climatological storm track by an amplified planetary-scale ridge that resides over western North America. The cyclones contribute to the broader-scale surface warming by the planetary-scale waves themselves.  Finally, we find that the Arctic surface warming observed during the full composite of synoptic-scale wave events is largely caused by a particular subset of events with enhanced planetary-scale wave activity. We discuss these results in the context of the Tropically Excited Arctic warMing (TEAM) mechanism and Arctic amplification.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11955], "author_name_tesi": "Baggett, Cory Francis", "last_name_ssi": "Baggett", "middle_name_ssi": "Francis", "first_name_ssi": "Cory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Sukyoung, Lee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Sukyoung, Lee, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Planetary-scale wave life cyclesand synoptic-scale wave life cycles", "Subseasonal to seasonal prediction", "storm track dynamics", "teleconnections", "tropical convection", "Siberian snow cover", "Arctic amplification", "climate dynamics", "general circulation models (GFDL spectral dynamical core)", "numerical weather prediction (WRF)", "Planetary-scale wave life cycles", "Synoptic-scale wave life cycles", "Arctic warming", "Ekman pumping", "Tropical convection", "Teleconnections"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "HOME ON THE PRAIRIE: A STUDY OF AMERICAN MARTEN (Martes americana) DISTRIBUTION AND HABITAT FRAGMENTATION IN THE TURTLE MOUNTAINS OF NORTH DAKOTA\n\n", "id": "8767", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "148", "abstract_tesi": "The North Dakotan Turtle Mountains are an island of primarily forested habitat home to the American marten, Martes americana, a meso-carnivore in the mustelid, or weasel, family.

This isolated landscape in North Dakota allowed me to ultimately verify American marten range expansion.  Concerning habitat fragmentation, the way the forest patches are distributed appears to be more important to marten habitat than interior forest area, although the latter is important as well.

The model reveals that IEA ratification (uniquely) ties the hands of constitutionally unconstrained authoritarian leaders with high levels of brown industry dependence, guaranteeing that such autocrats make good on their commitments to provide cost-offsetting\ncompensation to brown industry owners ex-post to an IEA's ratification. This credible commitment, in turn, compels brown industry owners to decrease their levels of government-directed opposition (in equilibrium), thereby enabling constitutionally unconstrained autocrats with high industry dependence to effectively prolong their tenure in o\u000effice via IEA membership. On the other hand, the model also suggests that constitutionally constrained autocracies lack the incentives to use IEAs as signaling mechanisms, and thus higher levels of brown industry dependence will thereby raise the IEA rati\fcation costs for these regimes. Hence, autocracies with low constitutional constraints will ratify IEAs more quickly as their reliance on brown industry increases, and will survive longer in o\u000ece as a result, whereas the opposite holds true for constitutionally constrained autocrats.

Further investigation of brain-heart dynamics during epileptogenesis indicated a causal relationship between interictal discharges (IID) and long RR intervals which progressed into IID-induced loss of cardiac rhythmicity 2-days prior to the first seizure.\nOur findings suggest that repeated epileptic discharges cause or exacerbate serious cardiac pathologies and point to an autonomic nervous system disorder that later reinforces the epileptic state. As the conditions worsen and overt seizures occur, postictal episodes of spreading depolarization modulate the network\u2019s threshold to further hyperexcitability via effects on the autonomic regulatory nuclei.\nWe have developed models of post-malarial epilepsy (PoME). In long-term chronic recordings, we observe complex interactions between epileptic-like activity and cardiac regulation during epileptogenesis and further seizures, heart arrhythmias, spreading depolarization, and death. This model, which is induced from\ninfection not genetic mutation, therefore provides a unique platform for the study of the mechanisms of epileptogenesis and investigation of complex interactions between seizures, spreading depolarization,  cardiac and respiratory dysfunction, and sudden death (SUDEP).", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14268], "author_name_tesi": "Bahari, Fatemeh ", "last_name_ssi": "Bahari", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Fatemeh", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce J.

The main underlying idea is that most of natural signals are inherently sparse in certain bases or dictionaries. In this dissertation, the problem of information fusion using sparsity models are investigated. For this purpose, different sparsity models, including the joint sparsity and the tree-structured sparsity priors are studied and a flexible framework for extraction of cross-correlated information from different sources is proposed, which allows for fusion of the modalities at multiple granularities. In addition, the proposed method quantifies the quality of the different sources that offers added robustness to several sparsity-based multimodal classification algorithms. \n\nWhile several fixed dictionaries have been suggested for sparse representation in different applications, a better approach would be to train the dictionary for the application in hand, which is referred to as dictionary learning. However, most of the existing dictionary learning algorithms are only applicable with a single source of information. In this dissertation, reconstructive-based and discriminative-based multimodal dictionary learning algorithms are developed, which have several implications. In particular, the algorithms result in more compact dictionaries that are critical for efficient implementation of the sparse models. Moreover, the fusion is performed both at the feature level and the decision level for robust fusion. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is evaluated on several applications including face recognition, biometrics recognition, and target classification. \n\nKernelized dictionary learning algorithms are also developed for sparse representation in the featured space. In the proposed formulation, the dictionary and classifier are obtained jointly for optimal classification performance which provides the learned features. The proposed algorithms are then used for hyperspectral image classification, where they enhance collaboration among the neighboring pixels and results in the state-of-the-art performance.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10495], "author_name_tesi": "Bahrampour, Soheil ", "last_name_ssi": "Bahrampour", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Soheil", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Asok Ray", "William Kenneth Jenkins", "Shashi Phoha", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer", "Joseph Francis Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Asok Ray, Dissertation Advisor", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Chair", "Shashi Phoha, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Scott Mayer, Committee Member", "Joseph Francis Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Multimodal Dictionary Learning", "Sparse Representation", "Information Fusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Teachers\u2019 Understandings and Actions towards China\u2019s New Curriculum Reforms in the Context of Chinese Examination-Oriented Education", "id": "14399jwb5749", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14399", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "China\u2019s long tradition of exam-based education has tended to be a steadfast barrier to educational reform efforts. Over the past decade, however, new official school reform efforts have emerged under the descriptive banner of \u201cquality education\u201d or, in Mandarin, suzhi jiaoyu. In spite of serious efforts to change curriculum and pedagogy to support suzhi jiaoyu, studies indicate the tremendous power of social and organizational structures to restrict classroom change. These include not only the power of high stakes entrance exams (such as gao kao), but also the willingness and capacities of teachers. The conflict between suzhi jiaoyu reform and traditional structure fits well within the framework offered by Bolman and Deal, which includes structural, human resource, and symbolic lenses for understanding. Coupling this framework with a variety of qualitative research methods, this case study examines the beliefs and attitudes of a sample of 29 secondary school teachers in the Grace school in Sichuan as a means for understanding the challenges and meaning of suzhi jiaoyu school reform implementation. \nThe empirical examination of the present study reveals that teachers\u2019 reform implementation was reconfigured by their evolving perceptions and actions toward the reforms. As teachers developed stronger perceptions regarding reform practices\u2019 merits, consistency, and technical properties and gained increasing self-efficacy in reform implementation, teachers\u2019 reform behaviors increased. However, as the inconsistency between structural goals and reform practice appeared and the gap between teachers\u2019 personal need and capacity and reform demand increased, teachers\u2019 reform practice was negatively affected in classroom.

However, since vulnerabilities cannot be completely\nremoved from a system, successful attacks often occur and cause damage\nto the system. Despite numerous technological advances in both security\nsoftware and hardware, there are many challenging problems\nthat still limit effectiveness and practicality of existing security measures.\n\nAs Web applications gain popularity in today's world, surviving\nDatabase Management System (DBMS) from an attack is becoming even\nmore crucial than before because of the increasingly critical role\nthat DBMS is playing in business/life/mission-critical applications.\nAlthough significant progress has been achieved to protect the DBMS,\nsuch as the existing database security techniques (e.g., access\ncontrol, integrity constraint and failure recovery, etc.,), the\nbuniness/life/mission-critical applications still can be hit due to\nsome new threats towards the back-end DBMS. For example, in addition\nto the vulnerabilities exploited by attacks (e.g., the SQL\ninjections attack), databases can be damaged in several ways such as\nthe fraudulent transactions (e.g., identity theft) launched by\nmalicious outsiders, erroneous transactions issued by the insiders\nby mistakes. When the database is under such a circumstance\n(attack), rolling back and re-executing the damaged transactions are\nthe most used mechanisms during the system recovery. This kind of\nmechanism either stops (or greatly restricts) the database service\nduring repair, which causes unacceptable data availability loss or\ndenial-of-service for mission critical applications, or may cause\nserious damage spreading during on-the-fly recovery where many clean\ndata items are accidentally corrupted by legitimate new\ntransactions. In this study, we address database damage management\n(DBDM), a very important problem faced today by a large number of\nmission/life/business-critical applications and information systems\nthat must manage risk, business continuity, and assurance in the\npresence of severe cyber attacks.\n\nAlthough a number of research projects have been done to tackle the\nemerging data corruption threats, existing mechanisms are still\nlimited in meeting four highly desired requirements:\nnear-zero-run-time overhead, zero-system-down time,\nzero-blocking-time for read-only transactions,\nminimal-delay-time for read-write transactions. Firstly, to\nachieve the four highly desired requirements, we propose\nTRACE, a zero-system-down-time database damage tracking,\nquarantine, and recovery solution with negligible run time overhead.\nTRACE consists of a family of new database damage tracking,\nquarantine, and cleansing techniques.  We built TRACE into the\nkernel of PostgreSQL. Secondly, motivated by the limitation of TRACE\nmechanism, we propose a novel proactive damage management approach\ndenoted database firewalling. This approach deals with\ntransaction level attacks. Pattern mining and Bayesian network\ntechniques are adopted in the firewalling framework to mine frequent\ndamage spreading patterns and to predict the data integrity\nin the face of attack when certain type of attack occurs repeatedly.\nThis pattern mining and Bayesian inference approach provides a\nprobability based strategy to estimate the data integrity on the\nfly. With this probabilistic feature, the database firewalling\napproach is able to enforce a policy of transaction filtering to\ndynamically filter out the potential damage spreading\ntransactions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3602], "author_name_tesi": "Bai, Kun ", "last_name_ssi": "Bai", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu", "Peng Liu", "Chao Hsien Chu", "Thomas La Porta", "Sencun Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Peng Liu, Committee Chair", "Chao Hsien Chu, Committee Member", "Thomas La Porta, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Security", "Data Damage", "Database", "Integrity"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Parallel-pattern Versus Linear-pattern Discussion Online Collaborations", "id": "17658", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8351", "abstract_tesi": "While online learning can enable synchronous and asynchronous collaboration among distance learners, a lack of clarity exists regarding the nature of online collaboration for interaction effective patterns, and for methods for engaging in collaboration.
