This dissertation investigates the appropriateness of the language-action framework as a theoretical source for web services, the technological component of a science of services. \n\nWeb service supports interoperability among applications independent of their platform, through a set of standards. Current web service efforts are hindered by complexities created by the proliferation of standards which are sometimes competing and/or overlapping. These complexities undermine the usability of web services and therefore hinder widespread adoption. These complexities can be managed by developing boundaries for each web service aspect and new design methodologies and principles that are tailored towards web services. The Language-Action Perspective (LAP) is a candidate theoretical perspective for addressing these concerns because it follows the basic premise of web services\u2014supporting communication among disparate applications to achieve business goals. \n\nThe central hypothesis of this dissertation is that the Language-Action Perspective (LAP) would be an appropriate theoretical framework for web services. This hypothesis is tested through three inter-dependent essays. The first essay investigates whether LAP constructs can describe and explain the web services architecture. Findings from this essay reveal a need for conversation mechanisms to guide interactions among web services. The second essay responds to this finding. The domain selected for this investigation is enterprise integration. This essay develops a mechanism for accessing design knowledge with LAP constructs. The outcome is translated into web service conversation specifications. As proof of concept, a research prototype that uses a LAP based mechanism to generate web service conversation specifications as integration solutions is also developed. The third essay assesses the contribution of LAP constructs for designing effective integration solutions. The contribution of LAP constructs were assessed by designing and carrying out a controlled experiment. The assessment shows that LAP based mechanism produces higher quality integration solutions and reduces designer effort required for developing solutions. \n\nSignificant contributions from this dissertation include a LAP-inspired reference framework for web services (essay 1), a methodology and software artifact for designing enterprise integration solutions as conversations among web services (essay 2), and an evaluation of the relative effectiveness of LAP constructs for designing web service solutions (essay 3). Together they test the central hypothesis\u2014the appropriateness of LAP as a theoretical framework for web services.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3642], "author_name_tesi": "Umapathy, Karthikeyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Umapathy", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Karthikeyan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sandeep Purao", "John Watson Bagby", "John Yen", "Russell Richard Barton"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sandeep Purao, Committee Chair", "John Watson Bagby, Committee Member", "John Yen, Committee Member", "Russell Richard Barton, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Integration Designer Assistant", "Speech Acts", "Web Service Architecture", "Theoretical Framework", "LAP", "Language-Action Perspective", "Web Services", "Design Science"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "A Modified Duobinary Communication System For Rapid Prototyping Using Fpgas And Asics \n\n", "id": "21841", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9028", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "High speed communication channels, including backplanes, always have distorting effects on signals being transmitted through them. This is mainly a result of the frequency dependent nature of such channels.  In order to address this issue two common techniques exist: either carefully selecting the materials used in the backplane design or modifying the signal to suit characteristics of the communication channel/backplane by employing different line coding schemes and equalization. The most common line coding method is NRZ; however, as speed further increases, duobinary and PAM-4 are also promising techniques being investigated.\nMost of the past research in duobinary and PAM-4 was concentrated on simulations of the performance of coding and equalization techniques to compensate for the channel distortion. This proposed work focuses on rapid prototyping, using FPGAs and/or ASIC, of NRZ and duobinary coding and channel equalization. NRZ and duobinary coding are chosen because they are generally less complex than PAM-4, which makes them a good choice for higher data rates.\nA typical duobinary transceiver system comprises of an encoder at the transmitter and the corresponding decoder at the receiver. The complete encoderconsists of a duobinary pre-coder, which in turn includes a unit delay and an XOR gate to prevent error propagation, and a delay and add filter that converts the two level NRZ signal into a three level duobinary signal. The duobinary signal is then transmitted to the communication channel. At the receiver side, the duobinary decoder is implemented using a signal splitter, two comparators, and an XNOR gate. The duobinary signal generated is a three level signal which current commercial FPGAs are not capable of handling. In order to solve this problem, a simple new architecture of a duobinary system to be used with the commercial, off-the-shelf FPGAs is proposed.\nThe standard duobinary system architecture is modified by placing the duobinary encoder after the transmit equalization, before the channel, while the duobinary decoder is placed immediately after the channel, before receiver equalization is performed. This scheme offers the advantage of allowing us to use the FPGA equalizers in the NRZ coding without having to modify them to support the three-level duobinary signal. Hence, this modified architecture takes advantage of the well-developed digital signal processing blocks in commercial FPGAs while allowing faster development times. The duobinary encoder and decoder can be built in an ASIC and interfaced with the FPGA. Simulation of this architecture is performed in Simulink, and results obtained show that hardware implementation of such architecture is feasible as the transmitted data is reliably recovered at the receiver. \nTo accomplish this research, two software tools were used, MATLAB Simulink and Altera\u2019s Quartus. The FPGA board used was a Stratix IV GT SI Development board with the EP4SG210040I1 chip. Simulink was used for the NRZ simulation and Quartus for hardware implementation. Two real-world channels were used: a 29 in Megtron-6 Caltrace board and a 32 inch backplane both provided by FCI electronics. Eye diagram scopes in Simulink are used to view the simulation results. The transceivers of the Stratix IV GT SI board were run at 5.65 Gbps and 11.3 Gbps using both channels to verify proper operation and also to demonstrate the equalization features within the transceivers. NRZ measurements were taken with the DSA 8200 Tektronix Time Domain Reflectometer.  A correlation between the simulated and measured NRZ data is made and the results show a high degree of correlation. The BER for NRZ and duobinary were also computed for both channels the results were comparable; however, the duobinary uses half of the bandwidth. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8861], "author_name_tesi": "Umar, Ashraf Ibrahim", "last_name_ssi": "Umar", "middle_name_ssi": "Ibrahim", "first_name_ssi": "Ashraf", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aldo W Morales", "Sedig Salem Agili", "Jeremy Joseph Blum"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aldo W Morales, Thesis Advisor", "Sedig Salem Agili, Thesis Advisor", "Jeremy Joseph Blum, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Duobinary", "NRZ", "FPGA", "ASIC", "Bandwidth", "High-Speed", "Rapid Prototyping", "Transceiver", "Stratix IV GT", "Eye diagram"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Swelling and Mechanical Behavior of Ionizable Hydrogels Containing Highly Branched Polyamine Macromonomers\n\n", "id": "9111", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "821", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-10-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Linear \u0192\u00d1\u0192z\u0192\u00e7 diepoxide-terminated poly(ethylene glycol)s (PEG di-epoxide) of molar mass 4,000 and 20,000 g mol-1 were end-linked with amine-terminated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers of Generations 0, 2, and 4 in a good solvent (water) to prepare architecturally well-defined copolymer hydrogels.  PEG di-epoxide was also randomly crosslinked with branched poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) in water to prepare hydrogels with high concentrations of amine functional groups, much like the dendrimer gels, but with an ill defined architecture.  The gelation and equilibrium swelling of these gels in water were characterized while systematically varying the polymer concentration at preparation, dendrimer generation, mole ratio of crosslinker endgroups to PEG endgroups, and PEG precursor molar mass.  The Ahmad-Rolfes-Stepto (ARS) theory of non-linear polymerization was applied to predict conditions favoring gelation, and the model predictions captured many features of the experimental results.  Some hydrogels exhibited \u00a1\u00a7superabsorbent\u00a1\u00a8 behavior upon extraction and equilibrium swelling in pure water.  The end-linking reaction stoichiometry was identified as the most important factor governing the swelling behavior, whereas the polymer volume fraction at crosslinking, precursor chain molar mass, and dendrimer generation played less significant roles.  The superabsorbency arised in part from ionic effects related to protonation of the amine groups at external pH=7.  Upon air-drying and re-swelling of the extracted networks, a substantial decrease in equilibrium swelling was noted, which may be attributed to a secondary crosslinking reaction that occured during drying.  For dried and re-swollen networks, the scaling of storage modulus with equilibrium swelling was not much different from scaling predictions for neutral polymer networks in good solvents.  \nThe pH-dependent swelling behavior of these two hydrogel systems containing high concentrations of amine-functional macromonomers was also examined.  After extraction in neutral water, the hydrogels were swollen in aqueous solutions of HCl or NH4OH to vary the external pH.  Equilibrium volume swelling ratios (Qs) passed through a maximum value (Qmax) at an external pH (denoted pH*) which was approximately 4 to 5 for the gels studied.  The swelling behavior was modeled using Donnan equilibrium theory to describe the ion swelling pressure, with the Flory-Rehner phantom network expression representing the elastic and mixing contributions to the free energy.  The model accurately predicted the maximum in swelling near pH=4 to 5, but overestimated Qmax for several of the gels due to neglecting the finite extensibility of the short linear PEG chains. \nTwo possible applications of polyamine hydrogels were examined.  First, the PAMAM/PEG hydrogel system was used as an immobilization matrix for nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Rhizobium leguminosarum, with a focus on identifying structural factors that maximize cell density.  Second, the effect of crosslink density on DC ionic conductivity of a gel electrolyte was examined, in order to determine whether PEI-based gels might be useful as electrolytes for Lithium ion batteries.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [814], "author_name_tesi": "Unal, Burcu ", "last_name_ssi": "Unal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Burcu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Erin Clare Hedden", "Ronald C Hedden", "James Patrick Runt", "Erwin A Vogler", "Bruce Ernest Logan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Erin Clare Hedden, Dissertation Advisor", "Ronald C Hedden, Committee Chair", "James Patrick Runt, Committee Member", "Erwin A Vogler, Committee Member", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["end-linking", "hydrogel", "swelling", "gel electrolyte", "pH-dependence", "dendrimer", "rhizobia"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Restoration decision-making of disrupted infrastructure networks: A design by shopping and data visualization approach", "id": "27375", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11982", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-10-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Infrastructure networks serve communities by providing essential goods and services, for example, transportation, power and water. Natural hazard events, such as earthquakes, can damage network elements that disrupt operations on the network, leading to potentially significant economic and social losses. Simultaneous and instantaneous restoration of all damaged network elements is an ideal restoration action following the occurrence of a hazard event; however, the scale of the disruption and limitations on available physical and financial resources preclude this restoration solution. Instead, restoration actions must be prioritized preferably in a way that accounts for broader considerations, such as indirect economic losses and social impacts. Although optimal restoration design of disrupted infrastructure networks has been studied in the past, these studies focused solely on recovering the physical infrastructure as rapidly as possible within the financial constraints. In this research, the restoration problem is formulated in such a way that broader considerations such as indirect economic losses and social impacts can be factored into the decision-making. \nThe restoration problem is solved through a framework that is adopted from \u201cDesign by shopping\u201d paradigm where simulation, many-objective, that is, four or more objectives, optimization and data visualization are combined. In order to expedite decision-making, a data visualization technique that reduce the cognitive efforts required to explore the solution set of a many-objective optimization problem is developed.  The novel data visualization technique enables efficient exploration of the solution set by quickly revealing those objectives that have significant tradeoffs for further exploration, thus reducing the number of 2D representations that must be generated and interpreted while allowing preferences to be applied when selecting a solution. The utility of the framework for restoration design is demonstrated through two case study transportation network applications. The results of the case studies demonstrated that a clear tradeoff exists between the restoration costs and the indirect economic and social losses and that a marginal increase in restoration costs with a different allocation of resources could yield significant gains in indirect economic and social losses.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11420], "author_name_tesi": "Unal, Mehmet ", "last_name_ssi": "Unal", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Mehmet", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gordon Patrick Warn", "Gordon Patrick Warn", "Vikash Varun Gayah", "Konstantinos Papakonstantinou", "Timothy William Simpson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gordon Patrick Warn, Dissertation Advisor", "Gordon Patrick Warn, Committee Chair", "Vikash Varun Gayah, Committee Member", "Konstantinos Papakonstantinou, Committee Member", "Timothy William Simpson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Disaster resilience", "Infrastructure networks", "Restoration", "Design by shopping", "Many-objective optimization", "Data visualization"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Comprehensive Spatial Query Containment Framework for Minimizing Redundancy\n", "id": "9612", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "748", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Spatial data management has received significant attention from the database research community in recent years because of its huge application to our daily lives. Several impacted areas include business intelligence operations, geographic information systems, and location-based services. While these services are valuable to users, they frequently must operate on systems with limited processing capability and bandwidth capacity. To minimize unnecessary resource consumption, an effective strategy is to avoid the execution of redundant queries based on results previously obtained by the client. This work introduces the concept of spatial query containment as a means to identify when a new query can be answered solely using results from an existing query. For the approach proposed in this thesis, query containment has been engineered to support a variety of popular spatial query types, including range, window, k-nearest neighbor, and reverse k-nearest neighbor. Each query Q has an associated containment scope area such that any future query Q\u2019 both semantically contained by Q and issued at a point inside of the containment scope of Q can be answered using only the results from Q. Theoretical and experimental analysis indicate that the containment scope processing framework outperforms existing techniques under a wide variety of datasets, query loads, and computing environments. The substantial reduction in redundant query evaluations provided by the spatial query containment framework supports the deployment of novel, data rich applications in challenging environments while maintaining sufficient scalability, reliability, and performance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [741], "author_name_tesi": "Unger, Brandon Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Unger", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Brandon", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wang Chien Lee", "Wang Chien Lee", "John Joseph Hannan", "Daniel Kifer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wang Chien Lee, Thesis Advisor", "Wang Chien Lee, Thesis Advisor", "John Joseph Hannan, Thesis Advisor", "Daniel Kifer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["region query", "database", "data management", "containment framework", "auxiliary scope", "containment scope", "spatial query", "nearest neighbor query", "reverse nearest neighbor query"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "EFFECT OF THIOL-QUINONE REACTIONS ON \nPOLYPHENOL AND LIPID INSTABILITY IN FOODS\n", "id": "12002", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4719", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-11-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Polyphenols are attractive ingredients due to their purported health benefits, but their addition to foods is limited by their chemical instability, as they are rapidly oxidized under many conditions. This oxidation not only compromises the potential biological activity of the phenolic compound, but can also affect the chemical stability of the surrounding food matrix. Polyphenols bearing catechol or gallate groups, when oxidized to their benzoquinone forms, are strong electrophiles capable of reacting with nucleophilic thiols via 1,4-Michael addition reactions. These reactions are known to proceed in foods during processing and storage, yet little is known about the consequences of said reactions on polyphenol stability and lipid oxidation reactions.\n\nWe hypothesize that thiols in foods accelerate catechol oxidation by capturing quinones via their sulfhydryl groups, thereby increasing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production rates and, consequently, lipid oxidation rates.  However, we also hypothesize that, browning reactions due to nonenzymatic polyphenol oxidation will be inhibited in the presence of thiols, as these compounds are expected to disrupt phenolic polymerization reactions.  The stability of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in the presence of several thiol-containing species [cysteine (Cys), glutathione (GSH), 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3SH), &#946;-lactoglobulin (&#946;-lg)] was followed in both aqueous and dispersed lipid systems. \n\nThe test thiols were observed to inhibit browning, presumably by interfering with EGCG polymerization, although both cysteine and glutathione increased the rate of EGCG oxidation and H2O2 production. EGCG oxidation and H2O2 formation rates were lower in the presence of &#946;-lg compared to protein-free controls; however, EGCG was significantly more stable after &#946;-lg\u2019s Cys  residues were blocked with N-ethylmaleimide. \n\nDespite the observed increase in H2O2 production rate in the presence of the thiols, a net antioxidant effect in was observed in emulsions. We attributed this antioxidant effect to the quenching of hydroxyl and lipid-derived radicals by EGCG and, possibly, the thiols\u2019 sulfhydryl groups. These results suggest that thiols in foods accelerate polyphenol oxidation reactions and, in turn H2O2 generation rates; however, this does not appear to compromise the oxidative stability of food lipids.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4684], "author_name_tesi": "Unnadkat, Nausheel Ramniklal", "last_name_ssi": "Unnadkat", "middle_name_ssi": "Ramniklal", "first_name_ssi": "Nausheel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias", "Ryan John Elias"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias, Thesis Advisor", "Ryan John Elias, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["covalent adduct", "polyphenol oxidation", "thiol quinone reaction", "protein", "michael addition"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "CONDITIONS AND CONSTRAINTS RELATED TO COLLABORATIVE MANAGEMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN PENNSYLVANIA ", "id": "13108ceu107", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13108", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-10-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Previous research demonstrates that the traditional, managerial approach to natural resource management has been ineffective in many cases.

A number of fMRI studies have been conducted in anesthetized animals, but their interpretations are controversial because anesthetic agents can significantly disrupt brain hemodynamics, leading to changes in BOLD signals that might not represent the neurovascular coupling relationship during the awake state. Neuroimaging studies conducted in awake animals are important because they can more accurately detect changes in brain hemodynamics. Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) is a technique that can be used for assessing functional connectivity of brain networks when subjects are not performing a task or receiving sensory stimulation. rsfMRI can potentially be used to investigate the influence of genetic manipulations, environmental interactions, pharmacological treatments, and neuropathology on brain function in humans and animals. While there are numerous rsfMRI studies in humans during the awake state, much fewer awake rsfMRI studies have been conducted in animals. Thus, establishing an awake rsfMRI procedure for rodents will help broaden understanding of brain function. An established awake rsfMRI procedure in mice is especially important, given the availability of a variety of transgenic mice that can be used to investigate the relationship between genetic and the function of normal and diseased brains. If successful, this could stimulate more awake mice rsfMRI studies and those results can inform human studies.\n\nIn this thesis, we established an awake mouse rsfMRI protocol.

Because this motion can be recapitulated in synthetic environments using purified components, the kinesin-microtubule system is an excellent model for biologically derived nanoscale motion. The first objective of this thesis was to develop microscale transport systems that use kinesin-driven microtubules as carriers to transport and sort cargo in lab-on-a-chip devices. The second objective was to develop in vitro models that mimic the microtubule organization found in cells, to study the role of kinesin motors in cellular processes such as cell division.\n\t By optimizing materials, surfaces and geometries, functional kinesins motors and microtubules were successfully integrated into enclosed microchannels.   A three-tier hierarchical system of microfluidic channels that links the microscale transport channels to macroscopic fluid connections was used.  Shallow microchannels (5 micron wide and 1 micron deep) were etched in a glass substrate and bonded to a cover glass using PMMA as an adhesive. Intermediate channels (~100 micron wide) serve as reservoirs and connect to 250 micron deep microchannels that hold fine gauge tubing for fluid injection. High surface-to-volume ratio in microchannels results in gradients of motor adsorption. To solve the problems of high surface-to-volume ratio in these systems, we developed an approach, using a headless kinesin construct, to eliminate gradients in motor adsorption and microtubule binding in the enclosed channels. This enables precise control of kinesin density in the microchannels and maximizes microtubule movement. The confinement geometry (channel cross-section 5 micron x 1 micron) enables long-distance movement (~5 mm) and directional control, which are prerequisites for developing hybrid lab-on-chip devices using biomotor-driven transport.  We further showed that constructing a circular ring using these microchannels generates a high density ensemble of isopolar microtubules driven by kinesin motors. These aligned microtubules can be used for microscale transport applications or as a model in vitro system for studying kinesin-driven microtubule organization in cells.\n\tThe stability and limited shelf life of these motor proteins and their associated protein filaments is a barrier to implementing of kinesin-driven transport in devices.  We demonstrated that freeze-drying or critical point drying kinesins adsorbed to glass surfaces extends their lifetime from days to more than four months. Further, photoresist deposition and removal can be carried out on these motor-adsorbed surfaces without loss of motor function. The methods developed here are an important step towards realizing the integration of biological motors into practical devices, and these approaches can be extended to patterning and preserving other proteins immobilized on surfaces.\nA number of tools have been developed to manipulate microtubules in solution, including optical tweezers, fluid flow, magnetic fields, and DC electrophoresis, however each approach has its limitations.  AC electrokinetics provides a novel tool for manipulating and organizing microtubules in solution, enabling new experimental geometries for investigating and controlling the interactions of microtubules and microtubule motors in vitro.  By fabricating microelectrodes on glass substrates and generating AC electric fields across solutions of microtubules in low ionic strength buffers, we were able to collect and align bundles of microtubules and to measure the electrical properties of microtubules in solution.  We found that AC electric fields result in electroosmotic flow, electrothermal flow and dielectrophoresis of microtubules, which can be controlled by varying the solution conductivity, AC frequency, and electrode geometry.  These experiments demonstrate that AC electrokinetics provides a powerful new tool for kinesin-driven transport applications.\n  Furthermore, by maximizing dielectrophoretic forces and minimizing electroosmotic and electrothermal flows, microtubules could be assembled into opposed asters, reminiscent of the mitotic spindle in dividing cells. However the microtubules in these asters were not sorted for polarity. We developed kinesin motor patterning and neutravidin patterning techniques and used them to organize microtubules in the asters an isopolar manner, similar to microtubule organization in a mitotic spindle. These assembled structures serve as an in vitro model for investigating the role of microtubule motors in development and maintenance of the mitotic spindle.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4425], "author_name_tesi": "Uppalapati, Maruti Chandra Mouli Varma", "last_name_ssi": "Uppalapati", "middle_name_ssi": "Varma", "first_name_ssi": "Maruti Chandra Mouli", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William O Hancock", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Richard Cyr", "Ahmed A Heikal", "Ryan S Clement"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William O Hancock, Committee Chair", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Chair", "Richard Cyr, Committee Member", "Ahmed A Heikal, Committee Member", "Ryan S Clement, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["protein patterning", "microfabrication", "AC electrokinetics", "microtubule", "kinesin", "mitosis"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Reverse Nearest Social Group Query", "id": "26439", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11197", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Spatial data management issues, widely studied in the past few decades, have posed great challenges to researchers.

We strongly believe that novel socio-spatial storage and querying systems are required to meet this need in the near future. In this work, we particularly focus on the challenge of quantifying influence in the socio-spatial domain. The idea is to find groups that satisfy spatial (proximity) and social (group cohesion) constraints and thus can be considered in the influence set for a given query point. To solve this problem, we propose the idea of Reverse Nearest Social Group (RNSG) Query. This socio-spatial query is strongly related to Reverse Nearest Neighbor (RNN) query that has been of much interest to spatial data researchers in the past. Unlike the Reverse Nearest Neighbor query that finds individuals having query point as the Nearest Neighbor, RNSG query finds all social groups that satisfy k-core constraint and have their farthest member (individual with maximum euclidean distance to the query point) as a Reverse Nearest Neighbor of the query point. Compared to conventional RNN queries, RNSGQ is much more challenging because of the added social constraint. To tackle this challenging research problem, we propose an algorithm R-SAGE(Rnn-based Social-Aware Group discovEry Algorithm) to find all RNSG(s) efficiently. Experiments conducted on real world datasets show that the proposed R-SAGE algorithm outperforms the other baselines sig- nificantly. The proposed solution thus has huge implications on solving various problems in a variety of existing and upcoming domains such as Location Based Systems, Decision Support Systems, Social Marketing, Continuous Referral Systems to name a few. The efficient RNSGQ framework facilitates solving these novel socio-spatial problems and thus coping up with the recent challenges.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10743], "author_name_tesi": "Upreti, Nitish ", "last_name_ssi": "Upreti", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Nitish", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Wang Chien Lee", "Kamesh Madduri"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Wang Chien Lee, Thesis Advisor", "Kamesh Madduri, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["socio-spatial", "database", "query", "social", "spatial", "influence", "query design"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "High Power Piezoelectric Characterization for Piezoelectric Transformer Development", "id": "11490", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5732", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-11-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The major goal of this thesis was to develop characterization techniques to identify and define guidelines to manufacture high power density actuators. We particularly aim at improving the strengths of piezoelectric transformers, namely the high efficiency, ease of manufacturing, low electromagnetic noise, and high power to weight ratio resulting in an adaptor application by identifying material limitations, geometrical limitations and offer guidelines to counter drawbacks limiting the power density. This goal was achieved by means of a number of steps.\nThere are 3 losses present in piezoelectrics. Namely dielectric, elastic and piezoelectric losses. These losses can be calculated using mechanical quality factors of the resonating piezoelectric actuator. But in order to calculate all three losses, the mechanical quality factor for resonance and anti resonance need to be measured. Although the mechanical quality factor for resonance is conventionally measured, measurements in antiresonance have been ignored. Since there was no unique measurement technique to address antiresonance and resonance Q in one single sweep, in this study constant vibration velocity method was developed. During the constant vibration velocity measurement, the input electrical energy is monitored and significant differences between resonance and antiresonance drives are observed. For the same output work (identical vibration velocity) significant differences in the losses were observed. Thermographic images have shown increasing temperature differences for resonance and antiresonance nodal point temperatures, with higher vibration velocities. The theoretical evaluation identified the difference observed in the mechanical quality factors at resonance and antiresonance to stem from the piezoelectric loss. In order to investigate losses in the absence of thermal effects a transient characterization technique was adopted. The burst technique, originally developed for characterization of the mechanical quality factor at resonance, has been modified with a switch circuit to leave the resonator in an open circuit condition. The newly introduced open circuits burst have resulted in antiresonance quality factor measurements along with resonance quality factors in a \u201cnon-heating\u201d sample. In this technique too, resonance and antiresonance losses showed significant difference. Resonance burst mode characterizations at elevated ambient temperatures have shown that the lower vibration velocity mechanical quality factors appear to be more sensitive to the ambient temperature.\nDesign criteria\u2019s to produce the most power dense structure were investigated. Common device shapes were investigated to see which one does enhance the power density of the piezoelectric device. Disk shaped piezoelectric actuators have proven to have lower matching impedances and higher, farther persisting mechanical quality factors with respect to vibration velocities. In order to achieve identical power level, plate shaped samples will have been to strain ~3.5 times more than disk shaped samples. Thus the most power dense structure has been concluded to be a disk shape ~1W/cm3 input electrical power.\nOnce the actuators shape was fixed, further design on structure were conducted with \u00a9ATILA finite element method. For the transformer application, the design considered following key factors; 1-Controlling the output impedance by optimizing number of layers and layer thicknesses of the multilayer and 2- Evaluation of various electrodes and their affect on high power performance was evaluated. As the thickness of active layers decreased, the number of electrode layers increases. This increase in the metal to piezoelectric ratio and the relative increase in the electrode resistance under high current loads, both will have to be accounted for. Thus; with the piezoelectric composition and the device structure optimized, the research focused on candidate electrode materials and their effects on a multilayer piezoelectric transformer has been investigated.  Transformers with silver/palladium, silver/platinum, pure silver and copper postfire electrodes were fabricated and significant differences in high power characteristics of the transformers as a function of the electrode resistivities have been observed. Silver/platinum, silver and copper electrode single disk postfire transformers showed 10W, 11.2W and 13.9W performances respectively. Multilayered piezoelectric transformers with three layer silver and silver platinum electrodes were fabricated and tested for performance. Silver electroded multilayered transformers showed 29 W against a 250 ohm load, whereas silver/platinum electroded transformers were limited to 26W.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5726], "author_name_tesi": "Ural, Seyit  Onurhan", "last_name_ssi": "Ural", "middle_name_ssi": "Onurhan", "first_name_ssi": "Seyit ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino", "Kenji Uchino", "Clive A Randall", "Richard Joseph Meyer Jr.", "Leslie Eric Cross", "Matthew M Mench"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenji Uchino, Dissertation Advisor", "Kenji Uchino, Committee Chair", "Clive A Randall, Committee Member", "Richard Joseph Meyer Jr., Committee Member", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member", "Matthew M Mench, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["High Power", "Piezoelectric", "Transformer", "Quality Factor", "Jump Phenomena", "Constant vibration velocity", "Antiresonance", "Piezoelectric Loss"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Thermodynamics and structure of fluids physisorbed on nanotubes\n", "id": "7074", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4693", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The thermodynamics and structure of atoms and molecules physically adsorbed (physisorbed) onto cylindrical surfaces at low temperatures is studied theoretically for two systems: classical argon adsorbed onto the external surface of a bundle of carbon nanotubes, and quantum molecular hydrogen adsorbed within a magnesium oxide nanopore.\n\nThe transition from quasi-one dimensional physics to two and three dimensional physics in these systems is characterized through analysis of density distributions, pair correlation functions, effective potentials, and heat capacities.

Milk fat depression (MFD) is a condition caused by altered rumen fermentation when highly fermentable diets are fed and, although it is normally not desired, has been extensively investigated to understand the mechanisms regulating fat synthesis in the mammary gland.  Milk fat depression can be experimentally induced using trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), the most potent trans-FA inhibitor of milk fat synthesis identified. On farm use of CLA-induced MFD has been proposed to benefit high producing and transition cows that undergo a profound negative energy balance due to massive mobilization of body fat stores to support milk synthesis. The mechanism involves decreased use of dietary nutrients for milk fat synthesis which improves energy balance and reduces the use of body fat stores for milk synthesis. However, significant confusion about the effect of spared nutrients and CLA on adipose and mammary lipogenesis exists. \n The objective of experiments presented in this dissertation was to investigate the role of nutrients spared from milk fat synthesis during CLA-induced MFD on adipose and mammary lipogenesis. Acetate was used as a spared nutrient, because it is the main nutrient spared during MFD. The first experiment aimed to investigate the direct effect and interaction of CLA and spared nutrients on adipose lipogenesis in non-lactating cows. In this experiment we found that adipose tissue is sensitive to the anti-lipogenic effects of trans-10, cis-12 CLA at the transcription level, as expression of the lipogenic transcription factors SREBP1 and PPAR\u03b32, and of the lipogenic enzymes FASN, ACC, SCD and LPL were reduced by CLA (all P < 0.05). However adipose lipogenic capacity was not affected by CLA. Acetate tended to reduce expression of lipogenic factors Spot 14 and PPAR\u03b31 (P = 0.07) and reduced expression of FAN, ACC, and SCD (P < 0.05), but did not affect adipose lipogenesis capacity. \nIn a second experiment, the direct effect of CLA and spared acetate on adipose lipogenesis in lactating cows was tested.  Here, CLA reduced lipogenic capacity by 70%, with no changes in expression of lipogenic factors or enzymes. Additionally, acetate did not affect adipose lipogenesis; however, milk fat yield increased by 20% when spared acetate was provided (424 g of acetate/d), suggesting that acetate might me limiting milk fat synthesis under normal dietary conditions. The last experiment investigated the dose relationship between acetate supply and milk fat synthesis in cows with normal milk fat levels. Importantly, acetate linearly increased milk fat concentration from 3.71% in control to 4.12% at the highest dose of acetate (P < 0.01) and quadratically increased milk fat yield up to 217 g/d with an acetate dose of 10 moles/d (P < 0.001). In conclusion, adipose tissue is sensitive to the anti-lipogenic effects of trans-10, cis-12 CLA , while acetate spared during CLA-induced MFD does not play a role in stimulating adipose lipogenesis. However, under normal dietary conditions, acetate stimulates mammary lipogenesis.\nTogether, these experiments provide key insights to the effect of CLA on adipose tissue lipogenesis and the role of spared acetate on adipose and mammary lipogenesis.

For developing countries, well-being is a concern because of widespread poverty and whether people\u2019s basic needs are being met.  One prominent idea for poverty alleviation and economic improvement is tourism development.  Women especially are impacted by and receive benefits from tourism differently than men.  The question is whether tourism can contribute to improving the quality of lives, for men and women, in developing countries.  Surf tourism is a growing sector which has not received much academic attention but has the potential to have tremendous economic and social impacts on remote communities worldwide.  Nicaragua is one such country that is seeing this sector grow due to its tropical climate and high quality surf generating coastline.  \nThe community of Las Salinas, Nicaragua is one of the prime surf spots on the west coast of Nicaragua.  Surf lodges have begun to pop up in there over the past 15 years.  I stayed with a local Nicaraguan family in this community for three weeks and conducted interviews with 27 participants to learn about how residents perceived well-being in their community.  The results revealed that the seasons, caring for the environment, foreigners, a bad economic situation, government forces, religion, social problems and family solidarity were the main factors which influenced well-being in the community.  Tourism did emerge as a major factor in the economic well-being of the community.  The implications of this study are that while tourism may improve the economic situation for the community, many other factors about community life need to be taken into account when considering tourism development.  Future research might include studying more objective indicators of well-being for this community and including more residents.  Another direction may be how much ownership and the level of influence in tourism development increases or decreases the amount of benefits the community may receive that could contribute to their well-being.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3733], "author_name_tesi": "Usher, Lindsay Erin", "last_name_ssi": "Usher", "middle_name_ssi": "Erin", "first_name_ssi": "Lindsay", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Garry Chick", "Garry Chick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Garry Chick, Thesis Advisor", "Garry Chick, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["surf tourism", "Nicaragua", "well-being"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "\u201cwe share our territory\": Re-defining surf localism and human territoriality on the Pacific Coast of Nicaragua", "id": "18671", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8933", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Localism is a well-known issue in surf culture.  It is territorial behavior whereby resident surfers exclude outsiders from a surf break through threat, intimidation or whatever other means necessary.  This form of territoriality not only has negative consequences for visiting surfers, who may be excluded from surfing or injured, but for the host community as well.  If a surf destination becomes known as a bad spot for localism, surfers will go elsewhere and the flow of income for tourism-dependent communities can get cut off.  This is especially the case in developing countries such as Nicaragua, where remote communities are becoming less reliant on agrarian lifestyles and more reliant on tourism.  The purpose of this study was to examine the phenomenon of localism, a form of human territoriality, at Popoyo Reef on the Pacific Coast of Nicaragua.\nThis ethnographic study was conducted from May to July of 2012.  The methods used included participant observation (in the surf and the community) and interviews with 74 local surfers, resident foreigners, tourists, local government officials, and Nicaraguan and foreign business owners and managers.  Pictures and video of the surf and the community were also taken.  I took field notes to document my participant observation and maintained a research journal of daily life.  \nThe results indicated that while localism is not a problem at Popoyo Reef, many local surfers feel a strong sense of ownership over the surf break; feelings that could be characterized as mild localism.  Local surfers are willing to share their space with resident foreigners and tourists, but they want respect from the people with whom they are sharing.  Several surfers had witnessed physical fights in the surf, but some had not.  Surfers generally did not tell others what to do, but they would give them advice, educate them about the rules, and help other local surfers when they were learning to surf.  Surfers knew the basic rules of surfing and expected others to follow them.  Resident foreigners and tourists did not seem to think localism was a problem.  Besides citing a few incidents, overall, people were very positive about the locals surfing Popoyo Reef and the encounters they had with them.  There was no agreement on who local surfers considered to be \u201clocal,\u201d but for many it was only people who had been born in the community.  However, some local surfers categorized resident foreigners who had helped them and their community as \u201clocal surfers.\u201d\nTourism developers need to respond to the feelings of local surfers if they want to avoid \u201clocalism.\u201d  In this study some local surfers were frustrated by surf tour operators who disrespected them, mistreated their workers, or did not give back to the community.  While they are amiable now, this could change in the future.  In addition, the number of people in the water could increase locals\u2019 need to protect their space.  Many tourists know about the surf break now; hence tourist numbers will likely increase in the years to come.  The destination should be monitored to see what changes take place.  In an effort to extend the research on localism, future studies should be conducted in destinations located in the developed and developing world.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8772], "author_name_tesi": "Usher, Lindsay Erin", "last_name_ssi": "Usher", "middle_name_ssi": "Erin", "first_name_ssi": "Lindsay", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Recreation, Park and Tourism Management", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter", "Brian King", "Garry Chick", "Christine Buzinde", "Jess Ponting"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Dissertation Advisor", "Deborah Lee Kerstetter, Committee Chair", "Brian King, Committee Member", "Garry Chick, Committee Member", "Christine Buzinde, Committee Member", "Jess Ponting, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["surf tourism", "territoriality", "Nicaragua", "localism"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "Modeling and Quantifying Industry Dynamics under Aggregate Uncertainty", "id": "7209", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2370", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-06-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, I empirically investigate the selection process and the evolution of an industry in response to aggregate shocks.\n\nIn the first essay (Chapter 2), I develop a new way to quantify the effects of import competition on intra-industry patterns of job creation and destruction and productivity.

Recent pipeline leaks and explosions in various regions have challenged the industry to re-evaluate on-going efforts aimed at aggressive pursuit of preventive strategies. Considering that safety and environmental risk has become a major issue in the United States and around the world, particularly in cases where oil, gases and other hazardous wastes are involved, an important point in the gas pipeline industry that represents both social and competitive issue is the pipeline accidental risk. In this paper, I compared the failure data from various pipelines to observe the trend regarding failure rates, causes of failure, aging characteristics and failure rate dependence on pipeline parameters.\nStatistical tools were used to develop an effective risk reduction strategy based on the need to reduce pipeline incident and failure rates. Five main safety risk factors: pipeline age, maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP), time dependent factors (corrosion and material degradation) and time independent factors (third party damage, incorrect operation, material defect) were highlighted and statistically analyzed to demonstrate their effects on pipeline failure rate. An inverse transformation analysis of variance results for the failure rate model showed four risk factors A: Age (0.0001), B: MAOP (0.0003), D: Time Independent (0.0191) and E: Time Dependent (0.0022) to be significant since their obtained p-values was less than 0.05. From this I inferred that Factors A: Age, B: MAOP, D: Time Independent and E: Time Dependent are major contributing factors in the pipeline failure rate, with R2 value \u2013 0.83, prediction error sum of squares (PRESS) \u2013 32.95 and coefficient of variance (CV) \u2013 21.82. Relative scoring index approach and an aggregated weighting technique was applied to sort the grouped factors. The statistically developed safety plots showed that the effect on failure frequency of factors such as pipeline age, MAOP, corrosion (internal &external), and how the failure rates for pipelines above four decades of installation were affected by corrosion damage.\nThis research identified the need for the urgent assessment of aging pipelines due to the high risk of corrosion and cracking. The model was validated using various case studies from history to demonstrate that the resulting interactions were similar to the hypothetical failure rate curve. The results of the interactions of the risk factors could provide risk and hazard prevention personnel with a better understanding of gas pipeline maintenance activities.\n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [930], "author_name_tesi": "Uzoh, Chukwuma Andrew", "last_name_ssi": "Uzoh", "middle_name_ssi": "Andrew", "first_name_ssi": "Chukwuma", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Li Li / Dr Oyewole", "Dr Samuel A Oyewole", "Dr Li Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Li Li / Dr Oyewole, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Samuel A Oyewole, Thesis Advisor", "Dr Li Li, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["failure control", "pipeline corrosion", "gas pipelines", "risk-based management", "Quantitative risk analysis", "third party damage", "operational damage", "analysis of variance."]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE GENETIC REGULATION AND PHYSIOLOGY OF MANGANESE TOXICITY AND TOLERANCE IN ARABIDOPSIS\n\n\n", "id": "9190", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5052", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-12-18T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Acid soils and associated mineral toxicities and infertility are major constraints to agricultural production worldwide.

Rice is the most important cereal crop of the developing world and a staple food source of more than half of the world\u2019s population, providing 20-70% of total daily caloric intake.  Rainfed lowland rice is the dominant rice production system in areas of greatest poverty: South Asia, parts of Southeast Asia, and essentially all of Africa, where its production is limited by multiple abiotic stresses, uncertain moisture supply and decreasing soil fertility.  Phosphorus deficiency is considered to be one of the major constraints limiting rice production in those areas.  Most farmers still plant traditional rice varieties that produce poor plant growth and low yields.  Adding to the problem is that resource-poor farmers are largely unable to afford the cost of fertilizers, thus, they remain trapped in poverty.  An alternative strategy is to develop phosphorus efficient varieties with enhanced genetic adaptation to phosphorus-stressed soils, defined as improved yield ability in low-input agricultural systems coupled with better phosphorus acquisition and use efficiency.\nPlant roots display a wide array of adaptations to low phosphorus stress, including changes in root anatomy, morphology and architecture as well as increased production and secretion of root exudates.  Plastic root responses to low phosphorus availability show promising benefits to improve phosphorus acquisition efficiency.  The first experiment was undertaken to investigate the effect of low phosphorus availability on root morphological, anatomical and architectural characteristics among diverse rice genotypes.  This work serves as the basis of further understanding of various root traits controlled by low phosphorus availability in rice.  Our results show that rice genotypes varied considerably in root traits.  Low phosphorus availability has significant effects on the majority of root traits evaluated.  Several root traits such as root hairs and root cortical aerenchyma are considered important in phosphorus acquisition.\nIn addition, genetic mechanisms determining natural phenotypic variation of root hairs, lateral root branching, root anatomical features, and nodal root growth angle were studied.  Traits were evaluated on ~335 accessions from the O. sativa diversity panel.  To identify loci underlying such traits, genome-wide association (GWA) analyses were performed using 36,901 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).  We identified significant associations for all root traits.  Significant loci associated with these root traits would be useful for plant breeders by incorporating them into new rice cultivars.  This study represents an essential step toward genetic improvement strategies with the final goal of producing improved cultivars that enhance acquisition efficiency of soil resources, especially phosphorus, in the low-input agricultural system. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9742], "author_name_tesi": "VEJCHASARN, PHANCHITA ", "last_name_ssi": "VEJCHASARN", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "PHANCHITA", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathleen Marie Brown", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Dawn S Luthe", "Yinong Yang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathleen Marie Brown, Dissertation Advisor", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Chair", "Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Member", "Dawn S Luthe, Committee Member", "Yinong Yang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["rice", "genome-wide association mapping", "root traits"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Essays on research and development, innovation and productivity", "id": "12461", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6440", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-09-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation investigates firms' incentives to engage in research and development (R&D). In particular, I investigate empirically the link between R&D, innovation and productivity. This allows me to evaluate costs and benefits of R&D from a firm's perspective.\n\nFirms invest in R&D in order to raise the probability of developing new innovations. These innovations can be new processes that improve product quality or reduce the production costs\nfor the firm. Alternatively, innovations can encompass the introduction of new products or an extension of the range of final goods that the firm supplies. Firm innovations generate improvements in a firm's performance, specifically they increases firm's productivity and profits.\n\nThere is significant heterogeneity in R&D spending across firms and industries. Positive R&D expenditures are not necessarily observed for every firm at any point in time. So, the question is: Why do some firms invest\nin R&D and others do not? Also, what are the factors that affect firms' R&D investment decision? As with any other kind of investment the rate of return of R&D investment and the cost of R&D investment determine the firms' incentives to engage in R&D. In this thesis I develop an empirical model to estimate these returns and costs in order to understand the incentives firms face when they make their R&D choices. This in turn helps us understand the heterogeneity in firms' R&D efforts and productivity performances.\n\nMost studies on the effects of R&D assume a direct link between R&D and productivity, for example Lichtenberg and Siegel (1991), Hall and Mairesse (1995), and Doraszelski and Jaumandreu (2011). These studies treat the process between R&D and productivity as a black box, since the outcome of the R&D process, the innovation it produces, is not directly observable. This thesis extends these studies by modeling the link between R&D and productivity explicitly. In particular, I let R&D affect the realization of product and process innovation. Once realized, these two types of innovation are then treated as determinants of productivity.\n\nBy breaking the direct link between R&D and productivity into two links, i.e. the link between R&D and innovation and the link between innovation and productivity, I am able to account for the different types of uncertainties associated with each link separately. The first link from R&D to innovation largely captures the uncertainty regarding whether R&D investment actually leads to an innovation. This uncertainty is sometimes referred to as R&D risk. The second link from innovation to productivity captures a very different type of uncertainty. Product innovations are typically associated with the risk that the market might reject these products. Process innovations on the other hand, are typically associated with the risk that the higher efficiency might not lead to lower costs or difficulties in their implementation. In contrast to previous models which assume a one-step direct link between R&D and productivity, my model distinguishes both links. Knowing more about the uncertainty inherent in each of the linkages will allow for a better understanding of the determinants of firms' R&D decisions. This is important when evaluating public policies, such as subsidies to R&D which can be undertaken to promote productivity growth.\n\nMy model is based on the structure of Aw, Roberts, and Xu (2011) (ARX). They endogenize firm productivity by allowing the firm's investments in R&D to shift the future path of productivity. In contrast to ARX, I model the link between R&D and productivity in more detail by assuming that R&D can lead to process and product innovation which in turn can lead to productivity gains. My model features a single agent which makes a dynamic choice of whether or not to invest in R&D: The current R&D choice leads to a change in future productivity which in turn affects the future R&D choice. In that sense productivity is endogenous and the R&D choice is dynamic in my model.\n\nThe second distinctive feature of this thesis is that I exploit a unique new data set,the Mannheim Innovation Panel (MIP), a rich data set that provides information on the innovation success of German firms. The MIP contributes to the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) which is available for many countries. Therefore, empirical studies using the CIS data for various European countries can be compared to studies using the German MIP data. The uniqueness of the data set lies, among other things, in the presence of variables identifying whether or not the firm introduces an innovation during a certain time period. Furthermore, it distinguishes between product and process innovation which makes it possible to separate the effects of different kinds of innovation on firms' productivity. The MIP has the additional advantage that it contains information on innovation expenditures. This means that in contrast to previous studies, I do not only account for R&D expenditures but also for costs pertaining to the link between innovation and productivity such as the marketing costs of new products.\n\nTo my knowledge, this thesis presents the first model structurally formulating the links from R&D to innovation and from innovation to productivity that is applied to the CIS data. The key structural parameters estimated are those that describe the process of endogenous productivity evolution, including the effect of an innovation of the firms future productivity, and the costs of conducting R&D for both experienced firms and firms beginning their R&D investments. The empirical model includes an equation describing the firms dynamic demand for R&D investment and it allows me to measure both the benefits and costs of R&D.\n\nMy empirical model produces the following results. First, product innovation as well as process innovation increase productivity. This result corresponds to economic intuition. Second, participation in R&D leads to a higher probability of a product or process innovation, implying that engaging in R&D leads to higher productivity. This result is in line with the empirical findings of the literature. Third, the firm's current R&D decision depends on productivity and on past R&D decisions. The idea here is that R&D investments and the productivity process are mutually dependent over time. Fourth, fixed costs of R&D are significantly smaller than sunk costs of R&D. This means that the firm R&D history is an important determinant of current R&D behavior: a firm that has chosen to invest in R&D previously has a lower cost of continuing than a firm that did not chose to invest in R&D previously. The latter firm has higher costs of entering the R&D process. The fifth finding concerns firm size: larger firms have higher R&D costs than smaller firms. This corresponds to the empirical pattern in my data that larger firms have a higher probability of investing in R&D than smaller firms.\n\nI use the empirical estimates to investigate two policy applications. The first policy simulation investigates the questions whether an R&D subsidy leads to an increase in productivity. This question is at the heart of many discussions regarding the costs and benefits of public subsidies. I find that a subsidy which leads directly to lower R&D costs leads to more innovation and higher productivity. The second policy experiment concerns the effect of competition on R&D investment. There are two schools of thought: The first states that only monopolies have an incentive to innovate in order to deter potential entrants whereas the second school of thought states that competition fosters R&D because market participants want \"to escape competition.\" My results shows that when firms face less elastic demand for their output, as would occur when there are fewer substitute products available, the gain in average productivity and the demand for R&D both decline.\n\nThis thesis contains the following chapters. Chapter 1 presents an overview of the literature on R&D, innovation and productivity. This chapter contains also a discussion of the results in the empirical literature that uses the CIS data. Chapter 2 contains the model while chapter 3 provides a detailed description of the data. Chapter 4 presents the estimation strategy. Chapter 5 discusses the empirical results and chapter 6 contains the results of the policy experiments. Chapter 7 concludes the thesis with a summary.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6439], "author_name_tesi": "VUONG, VAN ANH ", "last_name_ssi": "VUONG", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "VAN ANH", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts", "Mark John Roberts", "James R.

Locations of moraine sets in some northern-hemisphere locations including Greenland and North America are consistent with the hypothesis that temperature anomalies associated with millennial cold events occurred primarily in wintertime.  Extensive forward simulations show that glacier stagnation is more likely for larger and faster warming, suggesting that glacial deposits can be used to learn the amplitude of abrupt-warming events. Additional data will be required on supraglacial-debris effects before such temperature-change reconstructions are quantitatively accurate for heavily debris-laden glaciers, but existing understanding is sufficient to show that well-defined moraine ridges lacking extensive, homogeneous, hummocky deposits just upglacier represent climatically significant events and not landslide-triggered advances.  \n\n\tThe first chapter of this work involves the coupling of a dynamic glacier model with a dynamic subglacial sediment package, allowing sediment to be deposited sub- and pro-glacially.  The result is a numerical glacier model that deposits moraines based on its terminus position.  Experiments were run, varying the climate forcing on the glacier, to observe the resulting moraines and compare them to moraine sets observed in nature.  Successful simulation of moraine sets in Greenland driven by ice-core climate records required notable damping of the millennial signal, as required by the hypothesis that millennial temperature fluctuations occurred primarily in wintertime.  \n\n\tThe second chapter involves testing of the hypothesis that, if the influence of valley hypsometry is controlled for, stagnation of terminal regions of a glacier require warming larger and faster than some threshold, although with some tradeoff between rate and size of warming.  Quantitative modeling experiments were run using simplified valley shapes, in order to isolate a cause and effect relationship between hypsometry, climate change, and glacial stagnation.  Stagnation was found to be more likely for rougher beds with lower mean slopes, as well as for larger and faster warmings.  The results indicate that it may be possible to quantify ancient climate changes based on observations of glacial stagnation deposits.\n\n\tThe third chapter expands on the study of glacier stagnation, to include transport of supraglacial debris and its thermal shielding effects on glacial melting.  Modern observations and process understanding show that extensive supraglacial debris favors stagnation.  The ice-flow model from the first two chapters was expanded to include \u201cpoint\u201d sources (landslides) and distributed sources of supraglacial debris, transport of the debris, and the thermal effects of the debris.  The results show that landslide deposits sufficient to cause notable glacier advance cause stagnation events while remaining widely distributed on the glacier surface, thus producing hummocky topography upglacier of any moraine, such that a single moraine ridge formed without such hummocky deposits represents a climatic event rather than a landslide.  Model runs show that if sufficient supraglacial debris is supplied from distributed sources, the glacier will be longer and more-likely to experience stagnation following warming than an equivalent clean glacier.  A rich range of behavior is simulated, with sensitivity to some parameters that are not yet well-constrained by field glaciology.  Quantitative estimation of the size and rate of warming responsible for the observed pattern of stagnation deposits, or lack thereof, in glaciated valleys in a region remains a realistic possibility, but will require improved understanding of debris dynamics.

The first essay (Chapter 2) considers whether it is necessary for a firm to be first to enter a new market to attain market leadership and under what conditions it can attain market leadership if it fails to be the first mover. The second essay (Chapter 3) considers how buyers should structure their compensation schemes for reverse auction market makers, such that the buyer lowers its overall cost of procurement. The following abstracts provide additional detail about the two essays.\n\n\nAbstract of Essay I: Determinants of Market Leadership in Competition Between Standards: The Roles of Network Externalities, Switching Costs, and Customer Preferences\n\n\nCasual observation of the market outcomes of competition between standards in high-technology markets suggests that the first standard to enter the marketplace does not always win. Sometimes it loses and exits the marketplace; sometimes it survives as a follower in the marketplace. A natural question to ask therefore is: What factors determine which standard wins in the marketplace? How do these factors interact with one another? The present research answers these questions by modeling the competition between two standards, one of which enters the marketplace first. We model what we believe to be the key drivers of high-technology markets, namely, network externalities, customers\u2019 preferences for competing standards, and the level of switching costs that customers face. \n\n\nWe model customer behavior as a stochastic process in a market with two competing standards. The pioneering standard, standard 1, enters the market at a certain point in time, and the second standard, standard 2, enters later. Customers arrive continuously into the market and choose a product made with either standard 1 or standard 2. The market shares of the two standards evolve stochastically as customers arrive and as they switch between the two standards. We construct the market share stochastic process by aggregating the customer-level stochastic process and then characterize the long-run behavior of the market share process.\n\n\nOur analytical results suggest that the pioneering standard does not always win in high-technology markets. Instead, we find that a range of possible market outcomes arises, depending on the level of switching costs, degree of network externalities, and customer preferences. Our findings suggest that empirical studies that examine the outcome of competition between standards must account for the nature of the market structure. \n\n\nCounter-intuitively, we find that standard 2 can sometimes overtake the pioneering standard, even if it is inferior. A customer\u2019s purchase decision is dependent on not only the benefits the standard offers but also the situational factors that surround the purchase decision. Therefore, a customer may purchase an inferior standard that offers lower utility because of situational constraints. Consequently, the inferior standard may become the market leader if enough customers encounter situational factors that make them purchase the inferior standard. Our findings suggest that some typical marketing strategy prescriptions for firms operating in high-technology markets, such as building an early lead and exploiting positive feedback, must be contingent on the extent of the switching costs, the strength of the network effects in the market, and customer preferences. \n\n\nAbstract of Essay II: Incentive-Compatible Compensation Schemes for Reverse Auction Market Makers\n\n\nWe investigate the nature of the incentive-compatible compensation scheme that a buyer must offer to a market maker when the buyer plans to hold an online reverse auction. When the buyer requires that the market maker qualify suppliers on its behalf and when the market maker\u2019s effort is unobservable, the buyer faces a moral hazard problem. This problem arises because the market maker may shirk its responsibility by failing to exert any effort to qualify suppliers rigorously. Structuring appropriate compensation schemes represents one way to solve the moral hazard problem. We therefore use principal\u2013agent and auction theory to build a model to investigate how to structure compensation schemes to solve the moral hazard problem. \n\n\nCounter-intuitively, our findings suggest that, in some procurement situations, the buyer should structure the market maker\u2019s compensation as a percentage of the contract value. Such compensation schemes offer an incentive to the market maker to increase the winning bid, which seems, at first glance, undesirable for the buyer. However, such a counter-intuitive compensation scheme is necessary when quality costs rise very quickly with poor quality and when there is significant variation in quality among suppliers. In this procurement situation, the buyer faces a high risk of incurring substantial costs associated with awarding business to a poor quality supplier. Therefore, the buyer wants to identify and screen out low quality suppliers so they do not bid in the auction. Proper supplier qualification is consequently necessary so that the buyer identifies low quality suppliers correctly. But, the market maker will not qualify suppliers rigorously if it receives compensation based on the amount of savings the buyer obtains. The resulting lack of rigor in supplier qualification can lead to a low quality supplier being invited to participate in the auction, in which case the winning bid is likely to be low, which increases the market maker\u2019s compensation. \n\nIn contrast, offering the market maker compensation that is based on a percentage of the contract value encourages the market maker to qualify suppliers rigorously. Rigorous qualification ensures that the buyer eliminates the low quality suppliers from the auction, and hence, the winning bid is likely to be high, which will increase the market maker\u2019s compensation. More generally, our analysis suggests that the nature of an incentive-compatible compensation scheme depends on the extent of quality variation among suppliers and how fast quality costs increase with poor quality.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6024], "author_name_tesi": "Vadali, Srikant ", "last_name_ssi": "Vadali", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Srikant", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Business Administration", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gary L Lilien", "Arvind Rangaswamy", "G Jogesh Babu", "Gary Bolton", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gary L Lilien, Committee Chair", "Arvind Rangaswamy, Committee Member", "G Jogesh Babu, Committee Member", "Gary Bolton, Committee Member", "Anthony Mark Kwasnica, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["standards competition", "network externalities", "incentive compatible compensation scheme", "reverse auctions", "first mover advantage"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development of a High Surface Area Cathode for an Environmentally Friendly Magnesium Reserve Battery", "id": "19959", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9556", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-11-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this thesis, various materials and fabrication techniques were examined in an attempt to develop a cathode material for a \u201cgreen\u201d magnesium reserve battery.

Two different electrolytes \u2013 saturated sodium chloride and artificial seawater \u2013 were tested as well.\nUsing the Gamry Reference 3000 potentiostat, the electrochemical cells were tested together in a full cell configuration. The two main tests that were run were the read voltage experiment which measures the cell voltage over time and the constant current discharge experiment which measures the voltage response of the cell as a constant current is forced through the cell.\nRead voltage experiments indicated that the conducting polymer cathodes, polypyrrole and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)  (PEDOT), provided a stable cell voltage of over 1.8 V when coupled with AZ91 in either electrolyte solution. However, the conducting polymer cathodes failed in the constant current discharge tests likely due to the relatively low conductivity of the samples. While the materials are \u201cconducting\u201d polymers, their conductivity is still orders of magnitude lower than graphite and metallic materials.\nThe graphite cathodes displayed lower cell voltages of between 1.6 to 1.8 V, but were much better in the constant current discharge experiments. Two materials that stood out among the graphite materials were the Zorflex double weave graphite fabric and the pressed powder graphite made using powder metallurgy techniques. The high surface area and electrical conductivity of these materials allowed for large currents to run through the cell while the cell voltage still remained high.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9328], "author_name_tesi": "Vadella, Robert Joseph", "last_name_ssi": "Vadella", "middle_name_ssi": "Joseph", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Shaw", "Elzbieta Sikora"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Shaw, Thesis Advisor", "Elzbieta Sikora, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Magnesium", "Graphite", "PEDOT", "Conducting Polymers", "Thin Films", "Reserve Battery", "Corrosion", "Electrochemistry", "Discharge"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "CALCULATION OF TEMPERATURES IN GAS TURBINE ROTOR-STATOR\nCAVITIES USING CONJUGATE HEAT TRANSFER", "id": "10740", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "379", "abstract_tesi": "The present study deals with the numerical modeling of the turbulent flow in a rotor-stator cavity with or without imposed through flow with heat transfer. The commercial finite volume based solver, ANSYS/FLUENT is used to numerically simulate the problem. A conjugate heat transfer approach is used. The study specifically deals with the calculation of the heat transfer coefficients and the temperatures at the disk surfaces. Results are compared with data where available. Conventional approaches which use boundary conditions such as constant wall temperature or constant heat flux in order to calculate the heat transfer coefficients which later are used to calculate disk temperatures can introduce significant errors in the results.  The conjugate heat transfer approach can resolve this to a good extent. It includes the effect of variable surface temperature on heat transfer coefficients. Further it is easier to specify more realistic boundary conditions in a conjugate approach since solid and the flow heat transfer problems are solved simultaneously. However this approach incurs a higher computational cost. In this study, the configuration chosen is a simple rotor and stator system with a stationary and heated stator and a rotor. The aspect ratio is kept small (around 0.1). The flow and heat transfer characteristics are obtained for a rotational Reynolds number of around 106. The simulation is performed using the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM). The computational model is first validated against experimental data available in the literature. Studies have been carried out to calculate the disk temperatures using conventional non-conjugate and full conjugate approaches.\n\nIt has been found that the difference between the disk temperatures for conjugate and non-conjugate computations is 5 K for the low temperature boundary conditions and 30 K for the high temperature boundary conditions.  These represent differences of 1% and 2% of the respective stator surface temperatures.  Even at low temperatures, the Nusselt numbers at the disk surface show a difference of 5% between the conjugate and non-conjugate computations, and far higher at higher temperatures.  It has also been found that the Reynolds Stress Model (RSM) is the most appropriate one for such kind of swirling flows with heat transfer.

In today\u2019s media saturated environment, the pervasiveness of the Internet, coupled with the increasing role of social media, is changing how people find, evaluate, and process information. Previous studies have examined the effects of narratives in health campaigns in light of their ability to implicitly affect the message recipient\u2019s cognitive and affective reactions by conveying the real life experiences of an actual person. In addition, an extensive body of research has investigated the role of framing in health communication and has suggested that different health frames (gain vs. loss) have distinct effects for different types of health behaviors (prevention, detection, and cessation). Yet, health frames have been primarily examined in the context of traditional media such as print-based or videos. Finding effective ways to deliver health information is a challenge for health communicators since people are less motivated to exert cognitive effort during information processing due to the sheer amount of available information. Thus, employing powerful visuals has become essential in order to captivate people\u2019s attention and make them more attentive to the advocated message. An important stream of research has investigated independently the role of visuals, framing, and narratives. Yet, there is paucity of research examining their combined effects in health messages.  \nThis dissertation seeks to address this gap by examining jointly the effects of narratives, frames, and visuals in promoting health messages. An online 2 (message type: narrative vs. informational) x 2 (health frames: gained-framed vs. loss-framed) x 2 (presentation format: visual vs. non visual) between-participants factorial experiment was conducted. Message type was operationalized by presenting health information in a narrative or factual fashion. Narratives conveyed health-related information through the eyes of the story\u2019s protagonist, whereas informational messages included generic and statistical information relevant to the featured health issue, notably, sun protection and skin cancer. Message frames were operationalized in terms of gain- or loss-framed messages. A gain-framed message emphasized the advantages of performing the advocated health behavior, whereas the loss-framed message focused on the disadvantages stemming from failing to adopt the promoted health behavior. Presentation format was operationalized by presenting textual information independently or along with images that were in concert with the information included in the message. Participants were recruited from Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk and were randomly assigned to one of the eight experimental conditions. After reading the health message, they were asked to answer questions about their attitudes toward the message and issue and to indicate their behavioral intentions both offline and online. In short, the findings showed that health narratives are overall more persuasive than informational messages. Participants who received information in a narrative format developed more positive attitudes about sun-protection behaviors and showed heightened behavioral intentions. \nThe study also revealed several intriguing patterns in regards to the role of frames when applied in the context of narrative health messages. Compared to gain-framed narratives, it was found that loss-framed narratives led to more favorable attitudes toward sun protection as well as increased behavioral and sun protection compliance intentions. Conversely, participants reading gain-framed informational messages produced more positive attitudes toward the message than those who were exposed to gain-framed narratives. The mediation analyses showed that empathic identification with the character in a health story was a significant predictor on the outcome variables. Surprisingly, the findings revealed that visuals did not affect how participants evaluated the advocated health behavior.  By empirically examining the combined effects of those three variables, the findings of this study provide useful insights for health communicators and practitioners in the fields of advertising and public relations by proposing effective ways of delivering health information. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14757], "author_name_tesi": "Vafeiadis, Michail ", "last_name_ssi": "Vafeiadis", "first_name_ssi": "Michail", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Mass Communications", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fuyuan Shen", "Fuyuan Shen", "Frank Dardis", "Marcia W Distaso", "Mary Beth Oliver"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fuyuan Shen, Dissertation Advisor", "Fuyuan Shen, Committee Chair", "Frank Dardis, Committee Member", "Marcia W Distaso, Committee Member", "Mary Beth Oliver, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Narratives", "Health", "Frames", "Visual"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Walksafe: College Campus Safety App Incorporating Pebble Smartwatch\n", "id": "26607", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11742", "abstract_tesi": "I present a campus security app incorporating wearable technology like Pebble smartwatch.

Clinical management of ACL injury is dependent upon various factors with ACL reconstructive surgery representing a typical mode of treatment.  The objective of surgical ACL reconstruction is to restore mechanical joint stability as a means to reestablish correct knee function, improve patient self-reported accounts of knee HRQL and prevent associated musculoskeletal sequelae.  Use of the ipsilateral hamstring tendons (HT) autograft has recently gained rising popularity among orthopaedic surgeons as a primary selection of harvest tissue for ACL reconstruction.  Consequently, practitioners may be apprehensive to this trend with concern for sacrificing the agonistic function of the hamstrings to the native ACL, or disrupting compensatory knee flexor musculo-articular stiffness (MAS) proposed to augment joint stability in the absence of this focal passive restraint.  Although numerous experiments have profiled various resultant hamstring performance indices subsequent to related tendon harvest for ACL reconstruction, no evidence exist profiling knee flexor MAS responses in an associated cohort of patients.  This void in the literature warrants attention due to the fact that knee flexor MAS positively correlates with joint stability in young, physically active ACL deficient patients.  Thus, the primary aim of this research study was to investigate knee flexor MAS responses to HT autograft harvest in young, physically active patients 12-to-36 months post-ACL reconstruction.  Comparisons were made among the involved, contralateral uninvolved, serving as an internal control, and healthy matched control legs.  Based on a prior similar experiment specific to the patellar tendon technique, it was hypothesized that knee flexor MAS would not differ among legs.  Secondary aims of this research study were to descriptively profile affiliated joint range of motion (ROM) and dynamic postural control as well as hamstrings strength and endurance outcomes in this cohort of patients.  Furthermore, associations between knee flexor MAS and subjective as well as objective measures of functional joint capacity were explored.  The results of this research study demonstrated that knee flexor MAS was statistically significantly greater in the involved leg compared with the uninvolved and matched legs.  However, no statistically significant correlations existed among knee flexor MAS and subjective or objective outcome measures.  Conversely, patients exhibited statistically significant deficits in the involved leg compared with the uninvolved and matched legs for knee ROM and dynamic postural control as well as hamstrings strength and endurance.  Based on these observations, it can be proposed that HT autograft harvest for ACL reconstruction does not lessen compensatory knee flexor MAS.  Yet, clinical insufficiencies persist 12-36 months following surgery in young, physically active patients.  These outcomes suggest continued research is warranted to determine the efficacy of associated interventions to reestablish functional joint capacity in related patients.  Additionally, orthopaedic medicine and allied health care practitioners may reference the outcomes from this unique experiment to potentially identify clinical management strategies in treating this specific patient population.

To study these interactions in a selective and controlled manner, it is important to develop materials capable of targeting interactions at the molecular level. In this thesis, the principles of bioengineering, biochemistry, neuroscience, and materials chemistry were integrated with nanotechnology-based strategies for the design, synthesis, and characterization of small-molecule-functionalized materials. The nanoengineered, neurotransmitter-functionalized platforms developed here are capable of selectively recognizing and capturing large- biomolecule binding partners while having relatively low nonspecific binding.\nOne of the key challenges in the fabrication of neurotransmitter-functionalized surfaces is to position isolated small-probe molecules on protein-resistant matrices to provide optimal access to large binding partners. Nanotechnology-based insertion techniques were utilized to create neurotransmitter-functionalized surfaces using self-assembly of molecules with biological relevance. In particular, insertion-directed self-assembly was employed to isolate tether molecules terminating in a chemically targetable functional group for probe conjugation within a matrix of an oligo(ethylene glycol) self-assembled monolayer (SAM) to resist protein binding.\n Methods were developed to modify substrates with serotonin (5 HT), a small-molecule neurotransmitter important in brain function and psychiatric disorders. To mimic free serotonin in solution, an alternate coupling chemistry was devised to preserve the core chemical epitope of 5-HT by attaching its amino acid precursor, 5 hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), via its ancillary carboxyl group to inserted tether molecules.  Quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM) was used to demonstrate that 5-HT- and 5-HTP-functionalized surfaces selectively capture their cognate antibodies while having low nonspecific recognition of other antibodies. However, only 5-HTP-functionalized surfaces selectively bind recombinant receptors that natively recognize free serotonin. By contrast, serotonin-functionalized surfaces fail to bind membrane-associated serotonin receptors. It is inferred that recognition of small molecules by large biomolecules, which has evolved to distinguish between small-molecule ligands with highly similar structures in solution, requires preservation of all functional groups of free molecules. \nA fluorescence spectroscopy-based technique was also developed to study binding of proteins in a competitive environment on neurotransmitter-functionalized surfaces. Additionally, to broaden the scope of microcontact insertion printing for patterning hydrophilic tether molecules, the surface energy of polymeric stamps was tuned by oxygen plasma treatment to enable printing of polar tether molecules to fabricate bioactive small-molecule microarrays (SMMs). The binding of biomolecules on these patterned surfaces was detected by fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Substrates patterned with small-molecule probes selectively captured their large-molecule binding partners in a competitive environment. These advances provide new avenues for chemically patterning small molecules and fabricating SMMs with highly specific molecular recognition capabilities. \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [448], "author_name_tesi": "Vaish, Amit ", "last_name_ssi": "Vaish", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Amit", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss", "Peter J Butler", "Paul S Weiss", "Anne Andrews", "William O Hancock", "Joan Marie Redwing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul S Weiss, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter J Butler, Committee Chair", "Paul S Weiss, Committee Chair", "Anne Andrews, Committee Chair", "William O Hancock, Committee Member", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Chemical Patterning", "Capture Surfaces", "Biosenosors", "Self-Assembled Monolayers", "Receptor Proteins", "Small Molecules"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Gravitational waves from Intermediate Mass Binary Black Holes: First steps toward using Numerical Relativity waveforms for LIGO data analysis ", "id": "8821", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "661", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The need for providing accurate and reliable templates for detecting gravitational waves from the LIGO and LISA gravity wave detectors has fueled the numerical relativity effort toward solving the binary black hole problem.

The most interesting result was associated\nwith the effect of volume fraction on the coarsening rate constant.\nCoarsening rate constant as a function of volume fraction extracted\nfrom the cubic growth law of average half-edge length was\nfound to exhibit three distinct regimes: {em anomalous behavior} or\ndecreasing rate constant with volume fraction at small volume\nfractions ($lesssim$20\\%), {em volume fraction independent} or constant\nbehavior for intermediate volume fractions ($sim$20-50\\%), and the\n{em normal behavior} or increasing rate constant with volume fraction for\nlarge volume fractions ($gtrsim$50\\%). The simulation results are\nin agreement with the experimental results of Ardell and coworkers\nin Ni-Al, Ni-Ti and Ni-Si alloys. Based on non-linear growth law\nfit to the coarsening data, the growth exponent in the presence of\ncoherency stress was found to be $sim$3 for the average precipitate\nsize, while the exponents were $sim$4 for\nthe average spacing between the aligned\nprecipitate arrays. The effect of simulation dimension (2D and 3D)\non the coarsening kinetics was compared for stress-free\n$delta'$ precipitates in Al-Li alloys and stressed $gamma'$\nprecipitates in Ni-base alloys, at 20\\% volume fraction. The main\ndifference in the kinetics from 2D and 3D simulations was\nthe increase in coarsening rate constant with the simulation\ndimension.\n\nThe second alloy system considered was Al-Cu with the focus on\nunderstanding precipitation of metastable tetragonal\n$\theta'$-Al$_2$Cu in a cubic Al solid solution matrix.\nIn collaboration with Chris Wolverton at Ford Motor Company,\na {em multiscale model}, which involves {em a novel combination\nof first-principles atomistic calculations with a mesoscale\nphase-field microstructure model}, was developed.\nReliable energetics in the form of bulk free energy, interfacial\nenergy and parameters for calculating the elastic energy were\nobtained using accurate first-principles calculations.\nWith the help of anisotropies incorporated in the multiscale\nmodel based on first-principles calculations, the equilibrium\nprecipitate morphology of $\theta'$ was found to be governed by\nthe combination of interfacial and elastic energy anisotropy.\nQuantitative results from the model in the form of length,\nthickness and aspect ratio of precipitates were comparable with\nthe experimental results. With sufficient large-scale simulations,\nwhich will become possible in the coming years, this multiscale\nmodel can be used to provide quantitative precipitation kinetics\nand coarsening information, which are very useful in designing\nthe processing parameters of these alloys.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6469], "author_name_tesi": "Vaithyanathan, Venugopalan ", "last_name_ssi": "Vaithyanathan", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Venugopalan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu", "John Richard Hellmann Jr.", "Long Qing Chen", "Darrell G Schlom", "Qiang Du"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu, Committee Member", "John Richard Hellmann Jr., Committee Member", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Chair", "Darrell G Schlom, Committee Member", "Qiang Du, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["phase-field model", "3D simulation", "first-principles phase-field coupling", "coarsening of gamma-prime precipitates", "multiscale model", "anomalous coarsening"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Examining and Controlling the Morphology of the Photoactive Layer of Organic Photovoltaic Devices", "id": "23784", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10898", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-12-11T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Electronic devices such as solar cells, transistors and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) fabricated using organic semiconductors offer a potential feasible alternative to their inorganic counterparts due to several advantages such as ease of processing (ink-jet printing, roll-to-roll processing), flexibility and excellent control over the electronic properties through chemical modifications. Compared to the inorganic semiconductors, however, the performance of organic semiconductor-based electronic devices are much lower. For example, in the case of photovoltaic devices (solar cells), the power-conversion efficiencies are still lower (7%-10%) compared to that of inorganic solar cells (> 25%). The efficiency of a solar cell is determined, among other factors, to a significant extent by the morphology of the active layer, the thin film where photons are absorbed and charges generated. Even though significant improvement in the efficiencies have been achieved, mainly through band-gap engineering and processing optimization, a fundamental understanding of the structural and morphological effects of the active layer on the performance of organic photovoltaic devices remains obscured. \n\nIn this work, the focus is on examining the structure-function relationships in solution-processed bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaic devices and development of processing techniques for device optimization. A bulk-heterojunction device is formed by mixing of donor-acceptor semiconductors, and the subsequent structure formed in the active layer is dictated by the miscibility and crystallization of the components, which are functions of processing conditions. Excitons (electron-hole pairs bound by coulombic forces) formed in the donor semiconductor upon absorption of light have a diffusion length of around 5-10 nm before recombination occurs. Thus the structural length scales formed in the active layer determine the number of excitons that can dissociate into charges. We have examined the microstructure of poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) donor and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) acceptor mixture using grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) and energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) to characterize the in-plane structural length scales for various processing conditions such as annealing temperatures and spin-casting solvents. Our results show that the structural length scales are driven by self-limiting P3HT crystallization upon thermal annealing, which correlate to the internal quantum efficiencies of the devices. In contrast, it has been reported in the case of poly[2,5-bis(3-hexadecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene] (PBTTT)/ fullerene mixtures that thermal annealing results in crystallization of PBTTT with unconstrained lateral dimensions causing coarsening of the in-plane characteristic length scales. Thus the morphological evolution in polymer/fullerene solar cells, and consequently device performance, depends on the crystallization motif of the polymer. \n\nThe microstructure resulting from mixing of donor-acceptor semiconductors can yield distinctive donor-acceptor interfaces that affect charge separation and recombination. Our studies utilizing a low band-gap poly[(4,4'-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2',3'-d]germole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl] (PGeBTBT) donor and PC71BM acceptor examine the effects of mixing on the charge generation in a device. Composition of mixed phases ascertained qualitatively and quantitatively using EFTEM and resonance soft X-ray scattering (RSOXS) show that the concentration of polymer in the mixed phase decreases as fullerene concentration in the mixture is increased. This resulted in a concomitant increase in the device performance. Similarly, photo-induced absorption studies carried out using ultrafast spectroscopy show increase in polaron concentration with increase in purity of the mixed phase. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) data show a change in fullerene aggregation with increase in fullerene concentration in the mixture. This indicates that adding polymer to the mixed phase results in dispersal of fullerene, and consequently, changing the local environment of the polymer affects formation of charge-transfer states and subsequent dissociation into individual charges. Thus, high interfacial area that is formed upon intimate mixing of polymer/fullerene, considered ideal for efficient exciton dissociation, counteracts through high charge recombination. Our results show that the composition of mixed phases affects charge separation at the interface consequently affecting device performance of organic photovoltaics.   \n\nAnother important aspect that has been shown to affect device performance of organic photovoltaics is the orientation of polymer crystals with respect to the substrate. For example, P3HT predominantly orients in an edge-on configuration, i.e., with the \u03c0-\u03c0 bond stacking direction parallel to the substrate. It is hypothesized that out of plane \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, called face-on orientation, is important for effective charge transport. One way to achieve enhancement of face-on orientation is by directional crystallization which has been shown to be very effective for P3HT \u2013 in this case, directional crystallization from solution. In this context, \u2018zone-annealing\u2019 is relevant as it has been employed to directionally crystallize polymers. In this work, we designed and developed the zone-annealing equipment, which can yield thermal gradients greater than 60\u00b0C/mm. Preliminary results from GIWAXS experiments on P3HT/PC61BM thin films show anisotropy in the structure and a moderate enhancement of face-on orientated P3HT crystallites. This technique was extended to  organic field-effect transistors (OFET) to enhance charge mobilities through directional crystallization of organic semiconductors. In case of P3HT, the increment in charge mobilities was by a factor of 2 upon zone-annealing. However, in the case of organic small molecule semiconductor, 2,7-dioctyl[1]benzo- thieno[3,2-b][1] benzothiophene (C8-BTBT) , highly aligned crystalline domains were obtained \u2013 a very promising result for fabricating high mobility OFETs. Thus, the zone-annealing technique provides a handle for controlling the morphology of organic thin film electronic devices. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10488], "author_name_tesi": "Vajjala Kesava, Sameer ", "last_name_ssi": "Vajjala Kesava", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sameer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Enrique Daniel Gomez", "Scott Thomas Milner", "Ralph H Colby", "Michael John Janik"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Enrique Daniel Gomez, Dissertation Advisor", "Scott Thomas Milner, Committee Member", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Organic semiconductors", "Solar cells", "Structure-function relationships", "X-ray scattering", "Transmission electron microscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Charge Transport through Inhomogeneous Polymeric Materials", "id": "18812", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8826", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The generation of unique properties through mixing of organic semiconductors has enabled improved performance and novel functionalities in organic electronic devices.  In organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), isolated phases of a second material within the photoactive layer can act as recombination centers, enhancing the overall device performance.  Mixing of flexible polymer semiconductors with high-mobility small organic molecules can yield high-performance flexible thin film transistors.  Solution-processed, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ), thin-film organic solar cells rely on the self-assembly of polymer/fullerene donor/acceptor mixtures to create the necessary morphology with a high interfacial area for efficient photocurrent generation.  Efficient conversion of absorbed photons into photocurrent requires sufficiently intimate mixing of the donor and acceptor phases such that photogenerated excitons can easily find an interface, as well as a sufficiently large thermodynamic driving force for charge separation at the interface.  At the same time, efficient transport of separated charges towards the electrodes requires a certain degree of phase segregation between the two materials, to enable ordered molecular packing within each phase and also minimize interfacial recombination.  Despite the importance of creating inhomogeneous mixtures of organic semiconductors and the tremendous recent advances in the performance of the aforementioned devices, it remains a challenge to fully describe the optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductor mixtures and understand the effects of structural and morphological parameters on charge transport.  \nRecently, it has been shown that highly regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (RR-P3HT) and poly[2,5-bis(3-hexadecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno(3,2-b)thiophene] (PBTTT) are promising materials for organic electronic applications due to the relatively high charge carrier mobility, high solubility in different organic solvents and acceptable film-forming properties.  Charge carrier mobility in polymer semiconductors depends critically on crystallinity of the ordered regions, orientation of the conjugated lamellae, \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking, and also connectivity between ordered regions.  By varying the thermal annealing parameters and casting solvents, we have systematically studied charge transport within poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly[2,5-bis(3-hexadecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno(3,2-b)thiophene] (PBTTT) thin films as a function of the crystallinity and found that there is not a universal relationship between crystallinity and mobility.  Using an aggregate model for absorption spectra of P3HT thin films suggests that the conjugation length for P3HT thin films modulates charge mobility.  Higher boiling point solvents result in higher conjugation length and consequently higher mobility.  Our polarized soft X-ray scattering (P-SoXS) studies revealed anisotropic scattering profiles for P3HT thin films with higher charge mobility suggesting that longer intracrystalline order leads to higher mobilities in P3HT thin films.  This is remarkable since anisotropic scattering has not been reported for thin films spun cast from a single component.  In the case of PBTTT thin films, our P-SoXS studies confirm that higher orientational correlation lengths leads to higher charge carrier mobilities, but more importantly, through measuring thin-film modulus by buckling phenomena we could correlate mechanical properties and orientational correlation length (OCL) with PBTTT charge mobilities.  Our results reveal that interconnectivity among crystallites modulates the charge mobility for PBTTT thin films and higher number of tie chains leads to higher OCL and consequently higher mobility. \nWe also found that the charge mobility depends on the crystallization kinetics; rapid crystallization can affect the microstructure of polythiophenes by increasing the density of tie molecules.  As a consequence, there are more pathways connecting ordered regions which results in higher charge carrier mobilities.  Our results suggest that controlling the crystallization kinetics might be an important factor for maximizing the charge mobility in semicrystalline polythiophene thin films. \nIn addition to single component semicrystalline thin films, blends of solution-processable organic molecules and conjugated polymers are of interest due to their potential use in low-cost, light-weight, scalable and flexible photovoltaic devices.  One challenge lies in that, once mixed, self-assembly often does not lead to the formation of pure phases.  We showed that RR P3HT/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) mixtures separate into two phases due to the crystallization of the polymer.  The P3HT rich phase, composed of P3HT crystals, is essentially pure.  The PCBM-rich phase, however, is a mixture of amorphous P3HT with PCBM.  The role of mixing within nanophases, however, on charge transport of organic semiconductor mixtures is not fully understood.  We have examined the electron mobility in amorphous blends of P3HT and PCBM.  Our studies revealed that the electron mobility is correlated with the miscibility of amorphous polythiophene/fullerene blends, which is determined by measuring the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter.  Immiscibility promotes efficient electron transport by promoting percolating pathways within organic semiconductor mixtures.  In fact, our results suggest that donor/acceptor mixtures which are completely miscible would exhibit sharp drop offs in charge transport efficacy with dilution.  Strongly immiscible systems, on the other hand, would readily phase separate into large domains and prevent efficient charge separation.  Consequently, partial miscibility of donor/acceptor mixtures is critical for efficient device performance.  Our findings regarding charge transport in the fullerene-rich phase of polythiophene-fullerene solar cells can also be extended to any semicrystalline polymer-fullerene mixture. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8673], "author_name_tesi": "Vakhshouri, Kiarash ", "last_name_ssi": "Vakhshouri", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Kiarash", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Enrique Daniel Gomez", "Michael John Janik", "Scott Thomas Milner", "John B Asbury"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Enrique Daniel Gomez, Dissertation Advisor", "Michael John Janik, Committee Member", "Scott Thomas Milner, Committee Member", "John B Asbury, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Charge mobility", "X-ray diffraction", "Intracrystalline", "Intercrystalline", "Crystallinity", "Morphology", "Structure", "Miscibility"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Characterization of Multi-fin Quantum Well Structures using Photo-conductance Decay Technique", "id": "15317", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7682", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The era of traditional \u2018Moore\u2019s Law\u2019 scaling of transistors encountered a roadblock with problems like short channel effects and sub-threshold leakage current increasingly plaguing the MOS devices.

This study evaluated the role of enrichment time (8 and 24 h) and initial bacterial level (~1 to 10^3 CFU/mL) in modified E. coli medium + novobiocin (mEC+n) grown at 37C for the detection of the STEC serogroups. The sensitivity and the specificity of the assay was determined.   The mPCR protocol successfully detected all seven STEC at a level of ~1 CFU/mL following a 24 h enrichment step. The mPCR was highly specific and detected all strains belonging to the different O groups tested and did not demonstrate any cross reactivity with E. coli belonging to other O groups and other bacterial species. \nFor the second objective, the mPCR assay was evaluated for detection of the 7 STEC serogroups in artificially contaminated beef carcass swabs, beef trim, and ground beef following overnight enrichment in tryptic soy broth, modified tryptic soy broth + novobiocin, and mEC+n , respectively.  Individual STEC serogroups were experimentally inoculated at low (1-10 CFU/mL) and high (11-100 CFU/mL) levels, and a cocktail of 2-strain, 4-strain, and 6-strain combinations also were evaluated. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in detecting STEC at both inoculation levels in carcass swabs, beef trim, and ground beef. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in the detection of STEC between irradiated ground beef and non-irradiated ground beef. Fat concentration (80:20 lean:fat or 90:10 lean:fat) also did not impact STEC detection in ground beef. There was a significant difference (P &#8804; 0.05) in the detection of four-strain and six-strain serogroups of STEC from ground beef and beef carcass swabs, but not in trim. This observation could be attributed to the dilution of the designated serogroups following initial inoculation. To address this issue, E. coli belonging to serogroups O103, O113, O111, and O157 were inoculated experimentally and simultaneously at three different estimated concentrations (10, 10^2, and 10^3 CFU/mL) in all three beef products to determine the sensitivity of the multiplex PCR. Results demonstrated no significant difference (P > 0.05) in detecting all four STEC serogroups at three inoculation levels in trim and carcass swabs; but there was a significant difference (P &#8804; 0.05) in detecting STEC at the lowest levels (10 CFU/mL and 10^2 CFU/mL) in 80:20 lean:fat, non-irradiated ground beef. There also was a significant difference (P &#8804; 0.05) in the detection of STEC between irradiated and non-irradiated ground beef. \nFuture studies are needed to improve the assay to prevent interference of the background microflora while testing in ground beef. Since this assay primarily concentrated on screening of these serogroups, it would be advisable to determine efficient methods to isolate these strains after or in conjunction with the mPCR assay. Research should investigate the holding times following enrichment to running the assay to determine if this step affects the sensitivity of the assay. Future research also may include the addition of more serogroups to the current seven STEC or include the addition of primers targeted against STEC virulence markers. This approach will aid in the identification and characterization of STEC in food, clinical, and environmental samples.\n Detection of several STEC simultaneously has the potential to save time during epidemiological investigations of foodborne illnesses. Based on these studies, we have demonstrated the feasibility and practicality of using this mPCR assay for the detection of STEC serogroups in enrichment broths and beef products.

In addition, results showed supported the hypothesis that transfer occurs best to visual feedback conditions that are previously practiced, and not necessarily to familiar presentations of feedback. \n\tOverall, the results support the idea that the kind and extent of transfer of learning is task-dependent and not simply a manifestation of either inherent qualities of the learner or the environment alone. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9770], "author_name_tesi": "Valantine, Andrew David", "last_name_ssi": "Valantine", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell", "Mark Latash", "Robert L Sainburg"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karl Maxim Newell, Thesis Advisor", "Mark Latash, Thesis Advisor", "Robert L Sainburg, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Transfer of Learning", "Handedness"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "EVALUATING EFFECTIVE WRITING STRATEGIES FOR ADOLESCENT STUDENTS\nIN AN EMOTIONAL AND/OR BEHAVIORAL SUPPORT SETTING\n", "id": "9659", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3802", "abstract_tesi": "A successful transition from school to adulthood is difficult for individuals with emotional and/or behavioral difficulties (EBD) who do not have the literacy skills required for higher education and employment.

Even though the literature presents extensive mathematical models for the individual analysis of the different processes of a supply chain, research covering a system-wide approach is limited and recent. This is the case of the inventory planning decisions, which traditionally have been independently analyzed from supplier selection and transportation decisions. In addition, previous research has made assumptions that may not always hold under real world operational settings. This is the case of stationary demand, which is not always true at tactical and operational levels. Similarly, in distribution, the problem is usually simplified by assuming a unique transportation mode, considering neither delivery lead times, nor economies of scale. Therefore, there is an urgent need for integrated models that optimize the entire supply chain, where operations can be accurately represented through the mathematical models. \nIn this research, we first develop a multi-period single-product inventory lot-sizing model for a serial supply chain problem, where raw materials are purchased from multiple suppliers at the first stage and external demand occurs at the last stage. The demand is known and may change from period to period. The purpose of this model is to determine optimal inventory policy that coordinates the transfer of materials between consecutive stages of the supply chain from period to period while properly placing purchasing orders to selected suppliers and satisfying customer demand on time. Transportation costs are modeled using an all-units discount structure, where less-than-truck load (LTL) transportation mode is selected. A general version of the model is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program, where transportation costs are either represented by piecewise linear functions or approximated by power or quadratic functions.\nIn the second part of this research, a mixed integer linear program version of the original single-product model is extended to the multi-product case, where more than one type of raw material may be required for each product. In this scenario, economies of scale may be obtained by the coordination of replenishment, manufacturing, and transportation orders. Full-truck-load (TL) and LTL transportation modes are both considered in the mathematical formulation. This model provides the appropriate flexibility for practical implementation in real production/distribution systems.\nIn this research, we show the convenience of the integrated analysis approach over the sequential method. Our experimental results show savings of up to 6% when the problem is solved with the proposed integrated approach, compared to the sequential method, where the production/distribution and supplier selection problems are independently solved in two stages.  Our experimental results also show that the optimal raw material procurement strategy is affected by production and inventory cost parameters, which may appear to be unrelated to raw material supplier decisions. This finding also ratifies the convenience of using the integrated approach, where the entire supply chain problem is simultaneously analyzed. \n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6388], "author_name_tesi": "Valdebenito Candia, Victor Alejandro", "last_name_ssi": "Valdebenito Candia", "middle_name_ssi": "Alejandro", "first_name_ssi": "Victor", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Marc Mc Dill", "Jose Antonio Ventura", "Arunachalam Ravindran", "Richard Allen Wysk", "Marc Eric Mcdill"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Marc Mc Dill, Dissertation Advisor", "Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Chair", "Arunachalam Ravindran, Committee Chair", "Richard Allen Wysk, Committee Member", "Marc Eric Mcdill, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Transportation Cost", "Dynamic Inventory Policy", "Supplier Selection", "Serial Inventory System", "Supply Chain Logistics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Integrating Road Building Decisions into Harvest Scheduling Models", "id": "11634", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13289", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-01-22T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Forest planning models have traditionally used a sequential approach to define optimal harvesting and road building schedules.

However, food processing environments appear to be of particular importance. While L. monocytogenes is considered ubiquitous in nature, it is important to recognize that not all L. monocytogenes phylogenetic lineages appear to be equally distributed. Epidemiological evidence suggests the distribution of certain lineages appears to be related to certain habitats. An association between environmental conditions affecting biofilm formation by phylogenetic lineages of the pathogen under such conditions warrants investigation and further discussion. \nAt first, a critical view of biofilm concepts, focused on practical implications and limitations of current definitions is presented. The idea that biofilm formation may be an alternative measure of microbial fitness also is proposed. \nThe ability of four different epidemic clones (EC) of L. monocytogenes to form biofilms, as a function of pH, temperature, water activity (aw), initial inoculum, and nutrient level, using the microtiter plate method was investigated. The effect of the growth conditions were evaluated after 48 hours of static incubation. Data were analyzed by performing an analysis of variance in a full factorial design. Cohen\u2019s f2 was used to measure the effect of each individual factor. All factors and interactions affected biofilm formation significantly (p \u2264 0.05).   A significant difference in biofilm formation was found only between ECII and ECIII. The statistical analysis revealed that temperature, followed by aw and inoculum, were the main factors that explain most of the variability in the biofilm formation. These results demonstrate that some EC need specific combination of environmental conditions to develop their biofilm phenotype and may be different from each other. In addition, these results demonstrate that factor levels also have a significant impact in revealing or masking differences in biofilm formation. This report is the first to compare the combined effect of various environmental conditions on biofilm formation of epidemic clones of L. monocytogenes.\nAs such, biofilm formation should be considered a multi-dimensional phenomenon that cannot be adequately assessed by using a side-by-side comparison, but rather, evaluated under a variety of environmental conditions.  \nAnd finally, L. monocytogenes, representing lineages I, II and III were evaluated using multivariate analysis to uncover potential associations between lineage and biofilm formation. Forty-one strains of L. monocytogenes strains were evaluated using a randomized factorial design (34) of four extrinsic factors at three different levels: nutrient availability Tryptic Soy Broth with yeast extract (TSBYE % v/v); Temperature; pH; and aw. The individual effects of these factors, as well as their combinations, were evaluated for biofilm development. Interestingly, the set of conditions favorably affecting biofilm formation does not always correlate with the set of conditions affecting multiplication of planktonic cells. From a practical perspective, the results support the idea that microbial contamination pathways and differential prevalence should be studied in the context of biofilm. From an ecological perspective, these results demonstrated that L. monocytogenes lineages I and II partially share biofilm formation patterns as a function of environmental conditions, suggesting that they have overlapping but different fundamental niches. Additional analyses demonstrated that L. monocytogenes lineages I and III share similar biofilm formation patterns with respect to environmental conditions, suggesting that they share a similar fundamental niche. These results also demonstrate that L. monocytogenes lineage I exhibited a higher degree of variability in biofilm formation under different environmental conditions than lineage II. Based on these findings, it can be hypothesized that a lineage with a higher variability in biofilm formation, compared with a lineage with lower variability (under multiple environmental conditions) has a higher likelihood for evading routine antimicrobial interventions. The results support the hypothesis that L. monocytogenes lineage II has a narrower fundamental niche, as compared with lineages I or III. Furthermore, when epidemic clones (EC) were investigated, two EC from lineage I did not necessarily shared the same biofilm formation pattern, thereby increasing the likelihood of having two separate contamination pathways. In contrast, an EC belonging to lineage II demonstrated a high degree of similarity in biofilm formation despite the fact that it belonged to different outbreak events separated geographically and in time. The environmental factors responsible for the identified difference between lineages I and III and lineage II were investigated via Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The factors with the highest correlation with lineage II are the interaction of temperature, aw and pH. The factors with the highest correlation with lineages I and III are the interactions between aw and pH. Therefore, temperature might be the key factor affecting the differential fitness between lineages. These results may provide a knowledge platform and a deeper understanding of L. monocytogenes ecology for future research and ultimately, could provide practical suggestions for the improvement of L. monocytogenes environmental sampling plans and antimicrobial interventions in food processing establishments.

Although the specific factors that influence codeswitching are varied, bilingual members of a community of codeswitchers are more likely to engage in intra-sentential codeswitching (e.g. El ni\u00f1o caught his friend a punto de romper el blender, \"The boy caught his friend about to break the blender\") in contrast to bilinguals who maintain a functional separation between the two languages. Codeswitching has been studied extensively in production, particularly from structural and social perspectives. In contrast, few studies have examined the comprehension of codeswitched speech from an experimental perspective. This dissertation attempts to address this gap by employing an innovative eye-tracking methodology known as the visual world paradigm (Cooper1974; Tanenhaus et al., 1995) to examine the role of grammatical gender in the processing of Spanish-English codeswitched speech. \n\nWe focus on grammatical gender because researchers have observed a production asymmetry in its use in Spanish-English codeswitching. Specifically, article -- noun constructions (Mixed NPs) frequently appear as Spanish masculine articles followed by English nouns regardless of the gender of the Spanish translation equivalent, e.g. el juice, Sp. el [masc] jugo [masc] and el cookie, Sp. la [fem] galleta [fem]. Alternatively, Mixed NPs with Spanish feminine articles are infrequent and restrictively appear with English nouns that have feminine Spanish translation equivalents, e.g. la cookie, Sp. la [fem] galleta [fem] but *la juice, Sp. el [masc] jugo [masc]. This observation leads us to propose that codeswitching is an ideal test case to investigate the direct link between production and comprehension. Working within the Production-Distribution-Comprehension (PDC) framework (Gennari & MacDonald, 2009), we hypothesize that the gender production asymmetry reported in the production of codeswitched speech should be reflected in comprehension. \n\nTo investigate this hypothesis, we first quantified the distribution of Mixed NPs using a bilingual spoken language corpus (Deuchar et al., 2012) as a means to confirm the production asymmetry described by other researchers (e.g. Jake et al, 2002; Otheguy & Lapidus, 2003; Clegg, 2006). Validating previous observations, we found that masculine marked Mixed NPs constitute the overwhelming majority of Mixed NPs (92%). In contrast, feminine marked Mixed NPs were rare in our corpus (3%). To examine the impact of this production asymmetry in comprehension, we recruited 2 groups of Spanish-English bilinguals from City College of New York (CCNY) categorized by their place of birth (U.S. born, N = 21, v. Latin born, N = 25). Both groups of bilinguals participated in three separate eyetracking experiments within one experimental session: a Spanish unilingual block, a lexical-level codeswitching block, and a sentence-level codeswitching block. In all three blocks, participants were shown a simple 2-picture display of concrete objects. While listening to recorded stimuli in Spanish (Spanish unilingual block) or in codeswitching, a target picture was named, and participants were instructed to click on the target picture. Concurrently, participants' eye movements were recorded with a desk-mounted eyetracker at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. \n\nWe capitalized on two previous findings in the eye-tracking literature. First, Spanish gender has been shown to be used as a facilitatory morpho-syntactic cue in informative contexts (Lew-Williams & Fernald, 2007). In contrast, phonological competition (i.e. overlapping phonology in potential target candidates) is shown to delay spoken language recognition (e.g. Allopenna et al., 1998). Therefore, our experimental items in the codeswitching blocks introduced a phonological manipulations such that all paired items overlapped in initial phonology but had Spanish translation equivalents that differed in gender, e.g. candy, Sp. caramelo [masc] and candle, Sp. vela [fem]. Furthermore, in both the Spanish unilingual and lexical-level codeswitching block, target items were embedded phrase-finally in a simple carrier phrase. In the sentence-level block, target items were embedded in sentence-medial position in variable sentential contexts. In order to encourage listening for comprehension, we introduced a plausibility judgment at the end of each trial. Moreover, half of the sentences began in English and the other half in Spanish. Each member of an experimental pair was a target and was combined with both Spanish articles resulting in four experimental conditions: feminine match trials, feminine mismatch trials, masculine match trials, and masculine mismatch trials.  If the predictions of the PDC framework are correct, then bilinguals should not show any facilitatory processing for masculine conditions given its documented preference as the default article in Spanish-English codeswitching. In contrast, the feminine mismatch trial should result in increased delayed processing in comparison to feminine match trials. \n\nIn our analysis, we compared the proportion of fixations to target items and distractor items for each condition in each experimental block. We conducted paired-t tests on the difference between the mean proportion of target and distractor fixations in 100 msec time regions from article onset. The Spanish unilingual block served as a baseline to examine gender processing in Spanish. To further support the validity of our materials and to interpret the bilingual data, we included a control group of Spanish monolinguals (N = 24). Replicating a previous study, the Spanish monolinguals revealed the online use of grammatical gender in informative contexts as evidenced by significantly higher mean proportion of fixations to target items in different gender trials at earlier time regions than for same gender trials. In contrast, the U.S. born bilingual group showed no facilitation due to gender in spoken language processing, exhibited by a similar timecourse for both different and same gender trials. The Latin born group showed facilitatory effects only for feminine conditions. \n\nThe lexical level codeswitching block revealed that U.S. born bilinguals can use grammatical gender to strongly facilitate target identification in masculine conditions. Differences were also found for feminine conditions but were mainly attributable to increased difficulty in integration of feminine mismatch targets. In contrast, the Latin born group continued to exhibit strong facilitatory effects for feminine conditions. For masculine conditions, differences were found but were mainly attributable to increased difficulty in integration of masculine mismatch targets.  For the sentence-level codeswitching block, the U.S. born bilinguals showed little modulation attributable to grammatical gender except for a strong facilitatory effect for feminine mismatch targets in Spanish-first codeswitching trials. In contrast, the Latin born group did reveal differences based on language manipulation and gender. Specifically, in English-first codeswitching trials, the Latin born bilinguals exhibited a weak facilitatory effect for feminine conditions that was neutralized in Spanish-first codeswitching trials. For masculine conditions, the masculine match trials revealed a similar timecourse of processing in both English-first and Spanish-first codeswitching trials, but masculine mismatch trials were more difficult to integrate in Spanish-first codeswitching trials. We discuss the findings in terms of gender processing in bilingualism and implications for the PDC model.

In subduction margins, fault behavior is influenced by the interplay of accretionary wedge and active d\u00e9collement strength and stress state. Similarly, in other tectonic settings, such as major crustal fault zones, the onset of seismogenesis may be due to the evolving frictional or mechanical behavior along the plate interface and immediately adjacent wall rock material. Despite their importance, there are few studies that determine the stress regime from changes in consolidation state of prism sediments and characterize the frictional strength and stability of natural fault gouges at elevated temperatures. \n        Laboratory experimentation is essential in characterizing these properties because it allows for a detailed investigation of deformation along numerous loading paths and frictional behavior at in situ geothermal conditions. In order to examine the variations in consolidation and stress state within the Nankai Trough offshore southwest Japan and to characterize the frictional behavior along the Alpine Fault zone in New Zealand, I evaluated uniaxial consolidation and triaxial deformation experiments on natural prism and fault zone materials. These experiments are designed to 1) provide the first comprehensive assessment of consolidation state across an accretionary complex, 2) explore how the consolidation state can be used as a proxy for past loading history and in situ stress state in the vicinity of a major fault system in the Nankai Trough, and 3) evaluate the importance of temperature on the slip stability of the Alpine Fault zone.\n        Results of uniaxial consolidation experiments on Nankai prism materials, which were collected during numerous Integrated Ocean Drilling Program expeditions, indicate that there is an across-trench variation in consolidation state within the Nankai accretionary complex. The outer accretionary prism sediments near the deformation front (Sites C0006 and C0007) and megasplay fault zone (Sites C0001 and C0004) exhibit the most severe apparent over-consolidation, as documented by large over-consolidation ratios (OCR) ranging from 2.98-4.17 and 0.82-4.45, respectively. Farther landward, the forearc Kumano Basin (Site C0002) and underlying accretionary prism (Sites C0002 and C0009) have lower OCR values that range from 2.26-3.04 and 1.23-1.93, respectively. These results, in combination with shipboard data, suggests the presence of erosive events near the megasplay fault zone, minor cementation in the forearc basin, and an increase in horizontal stress associated with a complex tectonic loading history within the outer and inner accretionary prism. All of these processes will lead to an apparent over-consolidation (i.e. OCR >1) in the one-dimensional consolidation experiments. \n        To further investigate the effects of complex loading on the consolidation state and deformation behavior of Nankai prism materials, I conducted additional uniaxial consolidation and triaxial deformation experiments targeting slope basin sediments near the megasplay fault zone. These samples were collected from a laterally continuous slope apron section that is progressively incorporated into the shear zone of a major out-of-sequence thrust. These results indicate that the slope basin sediments become increasingly over-consolidated with proximity to the megasplay fault zone, with OCR values of 0.39-1.84 at Site C0008 to 2.31-3.79 and 0.94-3.99 at Sites C0022 and C0004, respectively. The high OCR values at Sites C0022 and C0004 could be explained by the onset horizontal tectonic loading and compression as the megasplay fault zone accommodates tectonic stress in response to plate convergence. To explore this hypothesis, I conducted triaxial experiments on Site C0022 samples to probe the yield envelope along different loading paths. The yield stresses are consistent with a model in which the maximum horizontal stress increases while the effective vertical stress remains constant as the megasplay fault is approached. The change in stress state can explain the gradual increase in the OCR values from normally consolidated sediment at Site C0008 to highly over-consolidated sediment at Sites C0022 and C0004. This is consistent with independent observations of stress state near the megasplay fault zone, which show a strike-slip to thrust faulting stress regime, and suggests that this is a novel approach for interpreting the complex in situ stress state within tectonically loaded sediments.\n        In Chapter 3, I characterize the frictional properties of the Alpine Fault zone, which is a major transpressional fault on the South Island of New Zealand, and explore their implications for the onset of earthquake nucleation and unstable slip at depth. I conducted high-temperature and -pressure shearing experiments of Alpine Fault principal slip zone (PSZ-1) and wall rock material from depths of 111.5-142.9 m obtained by the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP). At temperatures \u2264 180\u00b0C, principal slip zone (PSZ-1) is frictionally weaker than the surrounding wall rock material, with friction coefficient (\u03bc) values decreasing from \u03bc = 0.46 at 23\u00b0C to 0.35-0.40 at 180\u00b0C. Following this, the slip zone drastically strengthens to values comparable to that of the wall rock material, with \u03bc = 0.87-0.90 and \u03bc = 0.87 at 500\u00b0C for the PSZ-1 and wall rock material, respectively. This contrast in frictional strength between the fault-core and wall rock material suggests shear localization within the upper ~3-4 km of the Alpine Fault zone. The overall increase in friction strength is accompanied by a transition from stable to unstable behavior at temperatures \u2265180\u00b0C, as documented by a decrease in the friction rate parameter (a-b) for all material. The frictional results, in combination with constraints on the rheologic critical stiffness (kc), suggests that the highest potential for earthquake nucleation correspond to depths \u2265 4 km along the Alpine Fault zone.\n        Collectively, the results of the experiments in this dissertation provide insight into the consolidation and stress state of actively accreting subduction margins and new constraints on the updip limit of seismicity within crustal fault zones.  I demonstrate that there is an across-trench variation in consolidation state within the Nankai accretionary prism. This variation can be used as a proxy for the stress state and history of sediments within the accretionary prism, with implications for sediment cementation, erosive events, or enhanced lateral tectonic loading. This work also provides a new technique for interpreting the in situ stress state of tectonically loaded sediment through meticulous analysis of sediment yield behavior and consolidation state. This novel technique can be implemented for future investigations of stress state in other tectonic regions and subduction margins. Additionally, I show that an increase in temperature will result in a concurrent increase in frictional strength and transition to potentially unstable behavior within the Alpine Fault zone. By analyzing the frictional results in the context of a simple stiffness stability criterion, I am able to define the updip limit of seismicity along the Alpine Fault zone. This type of stiffness analysis can be incorporated into future frictional stability studies to provide additional constraints of seismogenesis along other plate boundary fault zones.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16514], "author_name_tesi": "Valdez, Robert Dennis", "last_name_ssi": "Valdez", "middle_name_ssi": "Dennis", "first_name_ssi": "Robert", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Demian Saffer", "Demian Saffer", "Chris J Marone", "Donald Myron Fisher", "Jonathan P Mathews"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Demian Saffer, Dissertation Advisor", "Demian Saffer, Committee Chair", "Chris J Marone, Committee Member", "Donald Myron Fisher, Committee Member", "Jonathan P Mathews, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Consolidation state", "Nankai Trough", "In situ stress state", "Friction", "Slip stability", "Scientific drilling", "Alpine Fault", "Accretionary prism", "Rate and state friction"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "Role of Maize Expansins in Reproductive Development", "id": "6820", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1850", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-09-23T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Groups-I and II/III grass pollen allergens are some of the major elicitors of grass allergies, with approximately 90% of grass pollen-allergic patients sensitive to them. Group-I pollen allergens are recognized as a subfamily of \u00e2-expansins, a group of cell wall proteins that loosen plant cell walls in characteristic ways. The proposed role of the pollen \u00e2-expansins is to loosen the cell walls of the silks to aid in the penetration and growth of the pollen tube through the silk. Group-II/III pollen allergens (G2A) are not classified as expansins because they lack one of the two domains that characterize the expansin superfamily. Recent results suggest that maize G2As have wall loosening activity on their own.  In this work I have looked at the role of expansins and G2As during maize reproductive development.\n\n\nMaize group-I pollen allergens (pollen \u00e2-expansins) can be divided into two classes, A and B. I have identified a minimum of 14 class A genes and 6 class B genes in cultivar B73. Class A contains two distinct subclasses that are located in different chromosomes. On the other hand, class B genes are found in a single genomic location. I have also found in maize cultivar B73 at least 11 G2A genes that can be separated into two groups, one coding for high pI proteins and another for low pI proteins.\n\n\nTo understand the role of the pollen \u00e2-expasnins, I have studied a maize line with a transposon insertion in one of the pollen \u00e2-expansin genes, EXPB1. I found that the insertional mutation has no effect on pollen viability, in vitro pollen tube growth or the proportion of progeny sired when small pollen loads are deposited onto stigmas. When fertilization is effected using large pollen loads deposited onto the stigmas, however, the transposon mutation is greatly underrepresented in the progeny. These results suggest that this protein has a large effect on pollen tube growth rates in vivo and plays a major role in male-male competition for access to the ovules. Furthermore, pollen from the insertional lines tends to form large aggregates.\n\n\nIn order to corroborate this phenotype, maize calli were transformed with an RNAi construct, driven by a pollen specific promoter, to silence class B pollen beta-expansin genes. Many lines in the first generation were infertile. I have identified several lines that show phenotypes possibly linked to reductions in expression of class B pollen \u00e2-expansins. Some lines produced seed when crossed as females, but did not shed any pollen before the anthers started to senesce. In other lines, segregation analysis from crosses of transgenic plants to wild type plants suggests problems in the transmission of the transgene through the pollen. The formation of large pollen aggregates was also observed in some cases. Since a similar phenotype was seen in the transposon lines defective in EXPB1, it is very likely that the silencing of the class B genes is responsible for the observed phenotypes. \n\n\nAn RNAi construct for the G2A proteins resulted in the identification of seven lines that show problems with transmission of the transgene when the transgenic parent is male. This transmission problem could be linked to reduced levels of G2A expression. In some lines the transmission problems were seen in multiple generations. These lines do not show any problems with viability or in-vitro growth and they do not produce pollen aggregates. However, upon examination of pollen tube growth of pollen from hemizygous plants in-vivo, I saw fewer pollen tubes growing through the silk.\n\n\nOn the basis of these results I propose that both class B pollen \u00e2-expansins and G2A proteins loosen the cell walls of the silks to aid in the penetration and growth of the pollen tube. The pollen \u00e2-expansins also appear to play a role in pollen separation.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1834], "author_name_tesi": "Valdivia, Elene Ruth", "last_name_ssi": "Valdivia", "middle_name_ssi": "Ruth", "first_name_ssi": "Elene", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Physiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel J Cosgrove", "Andrew George Stephenson", "Teh Hui Kao", "Hong Ma", "Surinder Chopra"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel J Cosgrove, Committee Chair", "Andrew George Stephenson, Committee Chair", "Teh Hui Kao, Committee Member", "Hong Ma, Committee Member", "Surinder Chopra, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Expansins", "Maize", "pollen", "pollen allergens"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "The Effect of Topology on the Dynamical Behavior of Oscillator Networks", "id": "6914", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1538", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-02-14T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Recent years have seen an upsurge of interest in the topological properties of real networks.  The underlying motivation for much of this research is that an understanding of network structure will elucidate the dynamical behaviors of the system.  A common hypothesis is that the topological characteristics of these networks have evolved to facilitate some dynamical process.  Working with that hypothesis, this dissertation explores the role of network topology on the dynamical behavior of a collection of nonlinear oscillators.  Specifically, we address the question of whether there are ideal topologies for certain functions performed by the network; that is, given a required dynamical response of the system, can the set of connections be chosen to elicit this behavior? If so, are there any common topological properties of the networks that accomplish this task? \n\n\nOf particular interest to oscillator networks is the minimization of vibration at target locations in the structure. In this dissertation, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize the topology of the network so that the vibration of target oscillators is minimized.  It is demonstrated that reduction of target energy is nearly always possible by a change of connection topology. The components of the GA are then discussed in detail.  Using this method, target minimization is observed to be a largely local phenomenon; the ideal topologies found by the GA contain the target as a hub and otherwise have a large number of homogenously distributed edges.  Hub creation is observed as the primary mechanism for minimization; the addition of edges to the graph is secondary, as is illustrated by imposing an edge penalty on the system.  The reduction in amplitude of the target oscillator is attributed to a balance between a minimization of the local mean field of the target and a maximization of the target degree.

(northern highbush blueberry) is a member of the Ericaceae family and of wide ecological and economic importance.  However few studies have examined in detail whole-plant physiological responses to drought or reproductive effort. Belowground, one of the most studied aspects of members of the Ericaceae is their association with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. Although not well studied, the root system of ericoid species is notable for being highly branched with its finest roots reaching only 20 \u00b5m in diameter. In this study, roots were classified and examined based on a root order classification, and anatomical, morphological and functional aspects were described. The root vascular anatomy and morphological data were then used to explore in more detail the response of this root system to severe drought conditions and differences in reproductive growth. Using minirhizotrons, we examined root lifespan and seasonal patterns of root production. Even with such small diameters, the first three root orders (considered the ephemeral portion) exhibited median lifespans between 115-155 d. By exposing the root system to heterogeneous soil water conditions and soil water deficits, patterns of nocturnal root tissue rehydration for each root order were studied by measuring their water potentials using thermocouples psychrometers over the nighttime period of 12 h. We hypothesized that root tissue rehydration would be delayed, especially in the distal root orders because of their greater hydraulic constrains. We found that even though the water potentials of roots in dry soil equilibrated with those of roots in wet soil, the equilibrium point reached before sunrise was still about -1.2 MPa, indicating tissues were not fully rehydrated. The finest distal roots (1st \u2013order roots) exhibited the lowest water potentials in dry soil. The lowest root hydraulic resistances (estimated) corresponded to the lowest orders of the permanent root system (4th-order roots), thus, indicating a possible place of hydraulic safety control. Reproductive effort can strongly influence processes belowground. Mycorrhizal colonization increased as reproductive effort increased. However, fine root dynamics (production and lifespan) and physiological traits such as root respiration, total nonstructural carbohydrate concentration, and root membrane leakage were not affected by high reproductive effort, suggesting a root system with a very low cost of construction and maintenance. The first three root orders account for < 16% of the total plant non-structural biomass. In contrast, high reproductive effort caused a 53% difference in total aboveground plant non-structural biomass at the time of maximum fruit growth compared with non-fruited plants. A slight increase in photosynthetic rates and a very low carbon requirement belowground may be associated with the high carbon efficiency of Vaccinium corymbosum coping with the high C and N demands associated with high reproductive effort.

Classified within several pathologies including dissociation, insensibility, and fascination, sensory disorders constituted the delusional failure to register experience recognized by others as real. Because these pathologies were understood as both epistemic and moral failures, treatment methods and representational strategies held particular significance for mid-nineteenth century approaches to embodiment and empiricism. Pathologies of the senses presented a critical challenge to the social work of sensibility, undercutting its egalitarian aims and calling attention to forms of subjugation according to race, gender, class, and disability. \nOriginating in eighteenth-century Scottish Common Sense philosophy, sensibility signified both a physiological principle and moral philosophy that channeled individual sensitivities to the external environment toward non-hierarchical social attachments. As it was leveraged in medical discourse of mental health and social reform during the mid-nineteenth century, however, sensibility was both proscriptive and prescriptive, inscribing boundaries for social participation not only through sympathetic attachment but according to perceptive capacity. Whose subjective experience counted as real depended upon the social and cultural politics of the time, particularly as they were indexed by normative hierarchies of embodiment. The inscription of insensibility thus represented a more fundamental disavowal of the experience of subjugated populations, not only denying their participation within communal fellow-feeling, but disclaiming the factuality of their experience.\nWhile sensibility regulated social participation according to the perceived sensory capacities of different individuals, my argument is that sensory disorders did not function solely as negations of individual experience, but were treated by authors and medical practitioners including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Martin R. Delany, and Oliver Wendell Holmes as productive sources of what I term \u201cuncommon sense.\u201d As I define it, \u201cuncommon sense\u201d signifies both a variety of sensory capacities that exceed or disrupt the normative function of sensibility as well as endeavors by authors and physicians to treat sensory disorders as alternative foundations for resituating approaches to the socially constructed environment. In focusing on mid-nineteenth century treatments of sensory disorders, States of Insensibility builds upon recent work recovering the complexity of antebellum materialist approaches to embodied cognition, a distributive model of agency circulated throughout the material connections among individuals and their historically situated environments. Insensibility offered a framework for negotiating how and why the experience of those excluded from the bonds of sensibility mattered. Hawthorne\u2019s critical engagement with the proprietary gender politics of associationism, Delany\u2019s telegraphic mode of racial sensibility, and Holmes\u2019s relational approach to adaptation and disability each sought to resituate the material conditions understood as disqualifying populations from political participation as sources for gathering together alternative representational practices and communal configurations.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16028], "author_name_tesi": "Vallee, Eric James", "last_name_ssi": "Vallee", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Eric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "English", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Dean Castiglia", "Christopher Dean Castiglia", "Carla Mulford Conklin", "Hester Maureen Blum", "Jonathan Paul Eburne"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Dean Castiglia, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Dean Castiglia, Committee Chair", "Carla Mulford Conklin, Committee Member", "Hester Maureen Blum, Committee Member", "Jonathan Paul Eburne, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["American Literature", "African American Literature", "Disability Studies", "Literature and Science", "History of Medicine", "Insensibility", "Nathaniel Hawthorne", "Martin Delany", "Oliver Wendell Holmes"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Fabrication and Characterization of Semiconducting Nanowires for Tunnel Field Effect Transistors\n\n", "id": "11690", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "246", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-01-07T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The scaling of traditional metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) is hitting a limit, not due to difficulties in fabricating short gate lengths, but rather to an ongoing power crisis. As channel lengths have been reduced power densities of integrated circuits have risen dramatically. While supply voltage scaling would alleviate many power concerns, the MOSFET structure fundamentally limits the amount that voltages can be reduced. Because MOSFET operation is governed by thermal emission of carriers over a potential barrier, the subthreshold swing from the off to on current is limited to a minimum of 60 mV/decade of current. Therefore, reductions in the supply voltage will degrade the on/off current ratio.\nThe tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) has emerged as a potential solution to these problems. Current is controlled by band-to-band tunneling through a barrier that is modulated by the gate, and subthreshold swings below 60 mV/dec. can be achieved. While TFET simulations are quite promising, subthreshold swings below 60 mV/dec. at technically relevant on-currents have yet to be demonstrated experimentally. Nanowire geometries and III-V semiconductor channel materials are predicted to improve TFET performance by increasing gate control and tunneling current.\nIn this dissertation the fabrication of TFETs from semiconducting nanowires will be investigated. First, axially doped silicon (Si) nanowire in situ p-n junctions will be studied. By controlling the nanowire growth, separate p and n-type segments can be formed to create a rectifying junction. While as-grown nanowire junctions do not have the abruptness necessary to facilitate band-to-band tunneling, thermally oxidized nanowires are shown to have a p-n-n+ profile with an abrupt n-n+ junction. By gating the nanowires an abrupt electrostatically-doped p+-n+ junction can be formed that permits reverse-biased tunneling. These p-n-n+ nanowires will be integrated into a top-gated lateral TFET test structure. Current-voltage (I-V) measurements will show that the gate-controlled tunneling current is composed of both direct band-to-band tunneling and trap-assisted tunneling components. Finally, p+-n+ and p+-i-n+ InGaAs nanowires with abrupt, heavily doped junctions will be etched from a planar wafer grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). The nanowires will be integrated into a lateral test structure, and characterized by I-V measurements. These results will show that surface conduction is a strong component of device operation, but that it can be reduced by thermal annealing. TFETs will be fabricated from the p+-i-n+ nanowires, and gate-controlled Esaki diode characteristics will be observed. While elevated surface leakage current will limit the device performance, the Esaki characteristics will indicate that band-to-band tunneling can be induced in a nanowire TFET. The platforms and analysis developed in this dissertation will permit advanced studies of semiconducting nanowire TFETs.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [244], "author_name_tesi": "Vallett, Aaron Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Vallett", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Aaron", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Suman Datta", "Jun Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Dissertation Advisor", "Theresa Stellwag Mayer, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Suman Datta, Committee Member", "Jun Zhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["TFET", "tunnel FET", "VLS Si nanowire", "axial doping profile", "scanning capacitance microscopy", "SCM", "InGaAs nanowire", "variable temperature I-V"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "NAVIGATION AND MAPPING THROUGH AUTOMATED IMAGE UNDERSTANDING AND RETRIEVAL\n\n", "id": "9625", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "598", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A novel method for image retrieval of navigational data through automated image understanding is presented, for mapping purposes.

This approach is particularly attractive in regions where there is a considerable potential supply of biomass and where a high share of electricity generation capacity comes from coal plants. An RPS that allows for biomass co-firing could provide an incentive for some plants that otherwise would not co-fire. In order to properly assess the likely response of coal units in a region requires taking into consideration competition among coal plants and other generation sources.  Further, such an analysis would require estimating biomass local availability, which is heterogeneous across different areas, and could drive up its price, making co-firing not economic feasible for some plants. In this thesis, I present a holistic framework allowing for endogenous adoption decisions of whether a plant chooses to co-fire or not. This framework is composed of a detailed power system that determines hourly output at each power plant while accounting for real world operational constraints (Unit Commitment Model) and a game-theoretic model that solves for a stable equilibrium among power plants competing for biomass. As a case study, I apply this framework to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), where many states have an existing RPS and where there is a high potential to obtain corn residue as a biomass. I simulate a co-firing rate under a broad range of carbon prices, which act as a RPS that includes biomass, and numerically solve for the Nash Equilibrium; i.e., none of the competing coal plants would unilaterally change their decisions whether to co-fire with biomass.

Characterized by an adverse reaction to gluten protein, celiac disease manifests in the small bowel and results in inflammation and increased permeability of the gut barrier. This is followed by an immune response mounted against not only gluten, but also tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a gluten-reactive enzyme secreted by intestinal epithelial cells. Despite the growing number of individuals affected by this disease, the only reliable intervention strategy available is lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet. Novel strategies for treating or preventing celiac disease include synthetic pharmaceuticals to modify the gut barrier, parabiotic infection to reduce inflammatory cytokine release and administration of a synthetic polymer that binds gluten proteins and prevents their digestion and absorption. Interestingly, polyphenols possess similar abilities as this polymer to interact with protein.\nPolyphenols are a structurally diverse class of compounds that are ubiquitous to plants. The bioactivity of many of these compounds has been explored extensively both in vivo and in vitro, demonstrating antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. Polyphenols have also been studied for their anti-nutritional effects, with high polyphenol diets resulting in decreased absorption of macro- and micronutrients. The ability of polyphenols to interact with protein has been studied extensively with respect to interactions with proline rich salivary proteins due to the role those interactions play in the tactile oral sensation of astringency.\nInterestingly, gluten proteins possess some structural similarities to salivary proteins including high frequencies of proline and secondary structure motifs that lend themselves to interacting with polyphenols through noncovalent interactions with the protein main chain. Based on these similarities, I hypothesized that gluten proteins would interact with polyphenols through noncovalent interactions and result in the formation of protein-polyphenol complexes in vitro. Furthermore, I expected that these interactions would limit the damaging effects of gluten proteins on intestinal epithelial cells in a celiac disease model by modifying or sequestering the protein, preventing its digestion and the resultant production of immunostimulatory fragments or impeding its recognition by cellular binding sites. My findings suggest that dietary polyphenols are able to interact with gluten proteins, forming protein-polyphenol complexes that exert some benefit towards reducing the intestinal permeability and inflammation associated with celiac disease.\nMy initial investigation focused on the mechanisms of interaction between 2-gliadin (57-89), a hydrolytically stable and immunologically relevant fragment of gluten that is produced during digestion, and three polyphenols: gallic acid (GA), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and theaflavin (TF). Though each of these compounds are found in tea and are therefore readily accessible in the human diet, they are also structurally distinct from one another. Saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance revealed that each of these compounds interacted with 2-gliadin (57-89) and while an overarching trend of phenolic groups playing an important role in interaction emerged, only EGCG demonstrated specific spatial orientation upon interaction with 2-gliadin (57-89). Additionally, EGCG and TF possessed similar affinities for interaction with 2-gliadin (57-89) despite TF having a greater molecular weight and increased frequency of potential binding sites. These findings suggested that the structural conformation of phenolic ligands influence the propensity of those compounds to bind to 2-gliadin (57-89) rather than the interaction being dependent on frequency of potential hydrogen bond donors and acceptors alone.\nGiven the importance of the structure of 2-gliadin (57-89) in recognition by immune receptors, I next examined the physical impact of interaction with EGCG on the peptide. The reaction formed protein-polyphenol aggregates, which were first observed using cryo-transmission electron microscopy. Using a variety of analytical techniques, I outlined the biphasic reaction mechanism that occurs upon exposure of 2-gliadin (57-89) to an excess of EGCG and elucidate the structural changes that interaction with EGCG exerts on the peptide. Further, I used computational modeling software to illustrate these interactions in silico. Using 2D NMR and circular dichroism, I determined that the complexes formed modified the structure of 2-gliadin (57-89) as observed by chemical shift changes in main chain hydrogens and an increase in the overall relative helicity of the peptide. These interactions may help mitigate the immune response associated with celiac disease by obscuring recognition of 2-gliadin (57-89) by human leukocyte antigen-DQ2 (DQA1*05:01, DQB1*02:01).\nThe objective of my next study was to determine the extent to which polyphenol complexation may disrupt celiac disease pathogenesis in vitro using a more translatable system. Purified polyphenols were replaced with decaffeinated green tea extract while gliadin, both native and enzymatically digested, was used in place of 2-gliadin (57-89). A critical step in the primary phase of celiac disease pathogenesis is the enzymatic hydrolysis of gliadin during digestion. The immunogenic fragments produced are able to stimulate intestinal permeability and are recognized by TG2 and immune cells. While the aforementioned studies suggest that polyphenols may disrupt the recognition of these fragments via sequestration and structural changes, I sought to also elucidate the impact of polyphenol supplementation on the formation of these digestive products. Upon addition of green tea extract to in vitro digestion of gliadin, immediate precipitation of protein was observed and quantified via SDS-PAGE and subsequent densitometric analysis of the proteins in the supernatant. Furthermore, green tea extract addition resulted in dose-dependent retention of proteins in the 30-45 kDa molecular weight range in comparison to the untreated control. Based on these findings, I hypothesized that (1) precipitation of gliadin by polyphenols is effective in sequestering gliadin proteins from digestive enzymes and (2) green tea polyphenols exert inhibitory effects directly on digestive enzymes, reducing their activity.\nCo-precipitation of native and pepsin-trypsin digested (PT) gliadin with green tea polyphenols was measured as increases in turbidity. Analyses of the supernatant revealed that at a 1:1 ratio of PT-gliadin to green tea extract, 93.4% of protein and 34.8% of green tea polyphenols were precipitated upon combination. Precipitation was also observed upon interaction between green tea extract and native, undigested gliadin. These precipitation profiles suggest that green tea polyphenols effectively bind to gliadin in vitro while a portion of the polyphenols remain unbound. It was also determined that green tea polyphenols dose-dependently inhibit both pepsin and trypsin. Collectively, these findings demonstrate multiple mechanisms for protective effects of green tea polyphenols against the production and availability of gliadin fragments.\nThe effect of green tea polyphenol supplementation on gliadin-mediated permeability was tested next, as intestinal permeability stimulated by exposure to gliadin is a hallmark symptom of celiac disease. This was done using an in vitro model for the intestinal brush border wherein human colonic cells (Caco-2) were grown to form a polarized monolayer on a permeable transwell. Permeability was measured as changes in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). In both the presence and absence of gliadin, green tea extract increased TEER, demonstrating an improvement in barrier integrity. This suggests that in addition to preventing the damaging effects of gliadin on intestinal permeability, green tea polyphenols exert protective effects on the gut barrier. This protective effect was further demonstrated as GTE suppressed the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, which play important roles in gut barrier maintenance and lymphocyte recruitment, respectively.\nThe overall findings of these studies suggest that the anti-nutritional characteristics of tea polyphenols can be used to physically sequester gliadin proteins, disrupting key steps in disease pathogenesis, and contribute to amelioration of celiac-related intestinal permeability. This is the first study to test a plant-derived dietary compound as a potential therapeutic agent for celiac disease. This potential treatment strategy features a variety of advantages including ease of incorporation into the diet, developed understanding of toxicity risks and a large body of work supporting supplementation of these compounds to treat other ailments. The interaction mechanisms outlined here in a simple in vitro system provide a foundation for future exploration into the potential for polyphenol supplementation to be used as a nutraceutical approach to treating celiac disease.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15269], "author_name_tesi": "Van Buiten, Charlene B", "last_name_ssi": "Van Buiten", "middle_name_ssi": "B", "first_name_ssi": "Charlene", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Food Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias", "Ryan John Elias", "Joshua D Lambert", "John Neil Coupland", "Connie Jo Rogers", "Gregory Ray Ziegler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ryan John Elias, Dissertation Advisor", "Ryan John Elias, Committee Chair", "Joshua D Lambert, Committee Member", "John Neil Coupland, Committee Member", "Connie Jo Rogers, Outside Member", "Gregory Ray Ziegler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["celiac disease", "gliadin", "gluten", "tea polyphenols", "egcg"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Developing sociopragmatic capacity in a second language through concept-based instruction", "id": "13752", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7317", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-02-20T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis reports on a study that sought to support intermediate-level US university learners of French (N = 8) in developing advanced second language (L2) sociopragmatic capacity through concept-based instruction.

Drawing on the work initiated by Galperin and Davydov, and extended to the L2 field by Negueruela and others, the study focused on promoting the internalization of sociopragmatic concepts (e.g., indexicality, social distance, power hierarchies) that were linked to specific communicative practices (e.g., second-person address forms).

The results show gains in sociopragmatic knowledge and spoken performance abilities. It is also argued that the learners\u2019 sociopragmatic knowledge provided a systematic orienting basis for choosing the pragmatic forms that fit their communicative needs.

The strong field analysis is motivated by fundamental, conceptual issues while the weak field analysis is\nof interest to gravitational wave phenomenology.\n\nIn the strong field regime, thanks to the notions of isolated and dynamical horizons, powerful new tools have become available for studying black holes. These frameworks are developed further. Specifically, to every isolated horizon we associate a set of mass and angular momentum multipoles, and show that these characterize the\nhorizon in a diffeomorphism-invariant fashion. They can be thought of as the source multipoles of a black hole in equilibrium and play a key role in the black hole entropy calculation in loop quantum gravity. Their definition easily carries over to dynamical horizons, where we expect them to play a significant role in both numerical and analytical studies in classical general relativity. We then\nconsider isolated horizons in higher dimensions and set up a Hamiltonian framework for spacetimes which admit an isolated horizon inner boundary and\napproach the anti-de Sitter geometry at infinity. This allows us to derive the first law of black hole mechanics in a Hamiltonian setting. Furthermore, this analysis greatly clarifies some issues concerning the definition of conserved quantities in such spacetimes. Returning to four spacetime dimensions, we study some aspects of the behavior of dynamical horizons in gravitational collapse, indicating that some of the prevailing\nintuition needs to be amended.\n\nIn the weak field regime, where linearized general relativity applies, we study the expected gravitational radiation from freely precessing triaxial neutron stars, which are potential sources for the Advanced LIGO detector. In older work, the gravitational wave spectrum of such objects was evaluated to first order in precession angle, leading to two spectral lines. Here we calculate the contributions to second order in the wobble angle, where a single extra line emerges. We show that the second-order spectrum may well be observable in the near future for precessing neutron stars as far away as the galactic center. Observation of the full spectrum at second order allows for a direct measurement of the star's wobble angle, oblateness, and deviation from axisymmetry, with the potential to significantly increase our understanding of neutron star structure.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [975], "author_name_tesi": "Van Den Broeck, Chris ", "last_name_ssi": "Van Den Broeck", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Chris", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Abhay Vasant Ashtekar", "Peter Istvan Meszaros", "Benjamin Owen", "Richard Wallace Robinett", "Jayanth R Banavar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Abhay Vasant Ashtekar, Committee Chair", "Peter Istvan Meszaros, Committee Member", "Benjamin Owen, Committee Member", "Richard Wallace Robinett, Committee Member", "Jayanth R Banavar, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["neutron stars", "black holes"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Variation in mass-dimensional relationships for mixed phase Arctic clouds\n", "id": "21821", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9946", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-04-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Discerning if a simple relationship exists between the mass-dimensional (m-D) coefficients found by fitting in situ ice crystal measurements and those needed in ice growth models is explored. Models use m-D relationships as a method of relating changes in mass to changes in size. The m-D relationships in models often come from observational studies. The relationship is a power law that relates the mass to the maximum dimension of the crystal with two coefficients, am and bm, often treated as constants. The relationships from in situ measurements include the entire growth history of the crystals and have large standard deviations in the fit coefficients. The leading coefficient, am, depends on the density of the crystal and therefore has a higher standard deviation and range than the power coefficient, bm. The bm coefficient depends on the temperature of the crystal and the crystal\u2019s habit.\n\tIce crystals were collected in Barrow, Alaska during two separate campaigns in the fall and spring of 2012. An image-processing algorithm was developed in order to automate the crystal analysis and classification from digital photographs. Over 30,000 crystals were classified by habit and analyzed in order to create m-D relationships. Meteorological influences, specifically average cloud temperature and thickness, were investigated for possible influences on the m-D relationships and the standard deviations of the coefficients, but none were found. Separating crystals by habit provided the highest correlation in the power law fits to the data. The spring and fall provided two starkly different cases in which the former had mostly pristine crystals while the latter had significant riming. This difference between the cases allowed for the significance of riming on m-D relationship coefficients to be examined. \n\tTo explore the physical connections between m-D coefficients determined from fitting and the coefficients for individual ice particles required by growth theories, a model that predicts mass, aspect ratio, density, and size was used. This ice growth model was embedded in a Lagrangian parcel model and then utilized to examine the evolution of the m-D coefficients. The parcel model was forced with input derived from 2000 trajectories derived from Large Eddy Simulation output. This provided relatively realistic parcel trajectories. Consequently, the m-D coefficients can be predicted in time with the model. The m-D coefficients were calculated in time and compared to the coefficients derived from fitting the model similarly to what is done with observations. The model yielded predicted coefficients that were higher than those seen in several observational studies and those derived from fitting the model output, especially for the leading coefficient, am. When the results of the mass and crystal maximum dimension produced by the model were plotted and then fitted to determine the m-D relationship, results of the coefficients were similar to the observational cases. No simple relation was found between the model predicted and fitted coefficient. Further studies will need to determine whether predicted and fitted m-D coefficients can be related to each other. Because the leading coefficient depends on density, finding an analytical method to relate the density to particle size may provide the necessary link.\t \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9671], "author_name_tesi": "Van Der Horn, Jennifer Lauren", "last_name_ssi": "Van Der Horn", "middle_name_ssi": "Lauren", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jerry Y Harrington"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jerry Y Harrington, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["mass dimensional relationships", "mixed phase clouds", "parcel model"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Validity of the KABC-II Culture-Language Interpretive Matrix: A Comparison of Native English Speakers and Spanish-Speaking English Language Learners", "id": "19137", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9241", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the validity of the Culture-Language Interpretive Matrix (C-LIM; Flanagan, Ortiz, & Alfonso, 2013) when applied to scores from the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd Edition (KABC-II; Kaufman & Kaufman, 2004).

Serpentine contains approximately 25% magnesium by weight and is prolific near most major population centers.  These two properties make serpentine an ideal mineral carbonation feedstock.  However, serpentine is a highly ordered ultramafic magnesium silicate structure consisting of alternating sheets of brucite-like material and silica-like material.  This highly ordered structure causes the formation of a silica barrier around the mineral particles that can slow or even stop the kinetics as the particles dissolve.  The physical behavior of this layer causes a shift in kinetic behavior from surface limited kinetics to diffusion limited kinetics.  However, it has been shown that both behaviors are important at the same time and vary by particle size.  Further, it has been shown that the kinetics can be greatly accelerated by incorporating concurrent, low energy, attrition-type grinding during the chemical reaction.  A computational model based on surface kinetics, surface species distribution, surface charge, the electrical double layer, gel layer diffusion, solution thermodynamics, and particle size and shape was developed to describe the kinetics.  It was demonstrated that the computational model can describe the experimental fractional magnesium extraction of magnesium from serpentine within ~3% in every case and within ~1% in most cases with reasonable understanding and characterization of the materials going into the system.

However, the tools to quickly and adequately characterize particle shape were not available during this study and represent a great opportunity for future research.

One area vital to our nation\u2019s well being is wastewater treatment.  The production of hydrogen gas from wastewater using anaerobic treatment processes makes wastewater treatment more economical.  Although hydrogen gas can be produced from any organic wastestream, the production of hydrogen from high strength food processing wastewater makes the most economic sense. The objectives of this thesis were to convert food processing wastewaters to hydrogen and to maximize hydrogen yields from glucose at concentrations typically found in the food processing industry.\nBatch and continuous reactor experiments were conducted to determine conditions for maximum biological H2 production yields and rates.  A method used to increase H2 production yields involved decreasing the H2 concentration in the reactor vessel to reduce H2 partial pressure inhibition.   This method was accomplished in two different ways using both batch and continuous reactor tests.  In batch tests, H2 gas produced was released either continuously using a respirometer or intermittently using a glass syringe.  H2 yields increased 43% when the continuous release system was used reaching a maximum of 0.92 mol-H2/mol-glucose.  In continuous reactor tests, low glucose concentrations were used to reduce the H2 production rate and reduce H2 partial pressure inhibition.  Continuous reactors were operated at glucose concentrations of 2.5 to 10 g COD/L at hydraulic retention times of 1 to 10 hours (2L reactor volume).  H2 yields increased with decreasing glucose loading rate reaching a high of 2.6\u00b12 mol H2 / mol glucose at the lowest glucose loading rates (0.5 \u2013 1.9 g glucose/hr).  High yields of hydrogen were consistent with a high molar acetate:butyrate ratio of 1.08:1 as more hydrogen is produced with acetate as a product (4 mol-H2/mol-acetate) than with butyrate (2 mol-H2/mol-butyrate).  Flocculation was also an important factor in the performance of the reactors.  The flocculant nature of the biomass allowed reactor operation at low HRTs with steady H2 production and > 90% glucose removal.  \nIn addition to inhibition due to hydrogen gas, undissociated acids also cause inhibition.  In continuous reactor tests, the effect of the undissociated form of acetic and butyric acids on H2 production yields was tested by varying the pH, by operating reactors at high glucose concentrations, and by adding these acids directly to the influent of the reactors.  Overall, total undissociated acid (p-value = 0.02) and undissociated butyric acid concentrations (p-value = 0.06) in the reactor (pH 5.5) were observed to decrease H2 yields while acetic acid had a lesser effect on H2 yields (p-value = 0.89).  At influent glucose concentrations of 10 to 30 g/L, H2 yields were fairly constant at 50\u00b12%.  At a glucose concentration of 40 g/L, H2 yields were the lowest of all conditions tested at 1.6\u00b10.1 mol-H2 / mol-glucose where a switch to solventogenesis occurred.  It was concluded that a self-produced total undissociated acid concentration of >19 mM is the threshold concentration that significantly decreased H2 yields and initiated solventogenesis under the conditions tested.  \nIn more applied tests, domestic and five different food processing wastewaters (apple, two potato wastewaters, and two confectioner wastewaters) were used as the substrate in batch tests.  Gas produced from the domestic wastewater sample (concentrated 25\u00d7) contained only 23\u00b18% hydrogen, resulting in an estimated maximum production of only 0.01 L/L for the original, non-diluted wastewater.  COD removals from the food processing wastewaters as a result of hydrogen gas production were generally in the range of 5-11%.  Overall hydrogen gas conversions were 0.7-0.9 L-H2/L-wastewater for the apple wastewater, 0.1 to 2.0 L/L for the confectioner wastewaters, and 2.1-2.8 L/L for the potato wastewater.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5903], "author_name_tesi": "Van Ginkel, Steven W", "last_name_ssi": "Van Ginkel", "middle_name_ssi": "W", "first_name_ssi": "Steven", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Civil Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "John Michael Regan", "Brian Dempsey", "Maryann Victoria Bruns"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Committee Chair", "John Michael Regan, Committee Member", "Brian Dempsey, Committee Member", "Maryann Victoria Bruns, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["food processing", "clostridia", "biohydrogen", "optimization"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Re-forging the Past: Interpreting Phoenician Iron Production at Tel Akko, Israel", "id": "14403mtv5062", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14403", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Tel Akko, located in northern Israel, has recently seen the discovery of large quantities of iron slag and metal working remains during excavations conducted from 2010 \u2013 2016 by Drs.

The focus is on the civilian occupation structures, known as Zivilverwaltungen, with an emphasis on the Zivilverwaltungen attached to the Generalgouvernement Belgien and the Generalgouvernement Warschau. Specifically, I argue that the unique position in which the civilian occupation bureaucrats who were members of the Zivilverwaltungen found themselves, left the men and women charged with overseeing them in an awkward and difficult position. This position placed them between the military and the civilian government in an uncertain status that was never completely satisfactorily resolved, and it was exacerbated by the fact that these occupations were hastily constructed, poorly planned and frequently haphazardly implemented.\n\nThe uncertainty that came from this awkward and difficult position led them to construct for themselves an alternate sphere, firstly on an external level, where they attempted to recreate the familiar and often very petty trappings of a standard German bureaucracy, which frequently led to infighting and complex parallel structures. However, and perhaps more importantly, they also constructed such an alternate sphere on an internal level, where these bureaucrats rushed to fill the ideological void left by not having any clear and cohesive objectives for the occupied territories with their own hopes, dreams and ambitions. For the men and women who oversaw these occupations, this ideological void and these alternate spheres they crafted for themselves allowed the occupations to become intensely personal affairs. They were not just working to occupy territory for the greater good of the German war effort or even for Germany\u2019s future after the war. They were occupying these territories to fulfill their own personal dreams and ambitions, which allowed them to overlook problems more readily, to fight with the colleagues with whom they disagreed more passionately, and ultimately to be more completely devastated by the loss of these territories at the war\u2019s end.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14491], "author_name_tesi": "Van Lidth De Jeude, Peter ", "last_name_ssi": "Van Lidth De Jeude", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "History", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sophie C De Schaepdrijver", "Sophie C De Schaepdrijver", "Carol A Reardon", "Jens-Uwe Guettel", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sophie C De Schaepdrijver, Dissertation Advisor", "Sophie C De Schaepdrijver, Committee Chair", "Carol A Reardon, Committee Member", "Jens-Uwe Guettel, Committee Member", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["World War I", "Occupation", "Belgium", "Poland", "Generalgouvernement", "Wilhelmine Germany", "Bureaucracy", "Zivilverwaltung", "WWI", "Generalgouvernement Belgien", "Generalgouvernement Warschau"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "STRUCTURAL ELUCIDATION, MOLECULAR REPRESENTATION AND SOLVENT INTERACTIONS OF VITRINITE-RICH AND INERTINITE-RICH SOUTH AFRICAN COALS", "id": "8779", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1672", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Two Permian-aged South African coals, vitrinite-rich Waterberg and inertinite-rich Highveld coals (similar rank, carbon content and Permian age), were studied to determine the structural differences and similarities of these two coals and how it impacts solvent swelling and extraction. The main differences were that the inertinite-rich Highveld coal was more ordered, more aromatic, and had less hydrogen than the vitrinite-rich Waterberg coal. Analytical data were used to construct advanced molecular representations for vitrinite-rich Waterberg and inertinite-rich Highveld coals. The three-dimensional models were structurally diverse consisting of a molecular weight distribution. The vitrinite-rich coal model consisted of 18,572 atoms and 191 individual molecules and the inertinite-rich coal model consisted of 14,242 atoms and 158 individual molecules. \nSolvent swelling of coal were conducted using the traditional pack-bed swelling method and a new novel single-particle stop-motion videography swelling method with NMP and CS2/NMP solvents. The single-particle swelling data was used to calculate the kinetic parameters and it was found that the swelling was governed by relaxation of the coal structure (super-Case II swelling). X-ray computed tomography was conducted confirming anisotropic swelling. \nThe petrographic transitions (maceral-group composition and reflectance) with solvent swelling and extraction were also quantified. Random reflectance analysis showed that, for both vitrinite and inertinite, there is a decrease in reflectance values with solvent treatment. Vitrinite reflectograms showed a shift from the dominant reflecting V-types to lower V-types. The inertinite reflectograms exhibited an increase in number of I-types. \nMolecular simulation and visualization were conducted to study solvent swelling and extraction on proposed molecular models. A theoretical extraction yield was determined using solubility parameters and showed agreement with experimental extraction yield trends. Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (SAFT) modeling was explored to test whether this method could predict swelling extent. The predicted swelling trends of SAFT were comparable to that of the experimental swelling results. Partially solvent swollen structures were constructed by the addition of solvent molecules to the original coal molecules using a amorphous building approach. This method showed that coal-coal non-bonding interaction changes with the introduction of solvent.

To determine the effect of this request on the occurrence of anomalous radium, I sampled streambed sediments at five CWTs that ceased to accept unconventional O&G wastewater, although they continued to process conventional O&G wastewater from 2011 to 2017. Then I compared these results to published data. Sediments collected at the point of discharge of these CWTs and along a 31 km transect downstream of two CWTs had elevated radium activities. Although the observed radium activities at the CWTs were hundreds of times higher than background, I calculated that eliminating the disposal of unconventional O&G wastewater from these CWTs since 2011 had already decreased radium loading to the stream by approximately 95%. Mineralogical characterizations and leaching experiments verified that the majority of radium in the sediments is associated with insoluble compounds: 86% in upstream sediments and 62-85% in downstream sediments. Radium was available for dissolution and/or desorption in minor amounts: 14% in upstream sediments and 15-38% in downstream sediments.

With the advent of ultra super critical technology for traditional coal-fired power plants along with advanced scrubber technology and carbon sequestration possibilities, large coal power plants may offer one of the cleaner and cheaper methods to use as a transition until new technologies provide a viable manner in which to move away from fossil fuels.  Additionally, with the legislative climate in the United States since the Three Mile Island incident, any nuclear technology will only be allowed in large centralized locations.\n\tWith the majority of the United States\u2019 power being provided by large power plants, they make an obvious target for research seeking to optimize performance.  Currently, many new data intensive technologies, from intelligent techniques to data mining, are being developed that open new doors previously closed when trying to optimize system performance.  These technologies are often not well suited to the typical hardware used for the real-time control of system processes.  Multi-agent technology provides an ideal platform from which to implement many of the new techniques being developed.\n\tWhile multi-agent technology in theory provides an ideal way to implement computationally heavy algorithms, multi-agent systems are distributed asynchronous systems.  Such systems are far more challenging to work with than the more traditional synchronous machine that most engineers and software developers work with.  While many control engineers have experience with such systems, they are typically not the people developing the new techniques that will allow enhanced operation.  This leads to discrepancies when implementing ideas from the lab into reality.\n\tTo address this issue, a development platform is required that can be used from the beginning of development that will allow initial work without needing the entire distributed system to work together, but allow a convenient method for testing system performance in a distributed asynchronous environment without having to re-implement the ideas on a completely different platform.\n\tFor this purpose, a Distributed Real-time Agent Framework with Time-warp (DRAFT) multi-agent system is proposed to address these issues using discrete event simulation techniques in conjunction with continuous ordinary differential equation solvers to provide a way for simulating a multi-agent system alongside a power plant.  The discrete event simulation techniques allow agents to operate as fast as possible simulation or run a pseudo real-time simulation.  In the former, all events are forced to synchronize; eliminating some of the complications of a distributed asynchronous system, but in the later, the system operates completely in a distributed asynchronous environment.\n\tAdditionally, the manner in which multi-objective optimization is implemented will be completely overhauled to make it far more intuitive and useful.  This is appropriate as the main objective in using multi-agent technology on a power plant is to assist in the optimization problem and gain as much extra efficiency as is possible.\n\tThis work is a continuation of initial development of a basic multi-agent system with intelligent control techniques, and focuses primarily on developing a new agent architecture and the multi-objective optimization techniques while addressing certain real-time issues that had yet to be resolved.\n\tThis thesis contributes generally to area of multi-agent systems, pushing further the use of agent technology with real-time systems.  More specifically, it contributes to simulation techniques useful for combining complex discrete systems with similarly complex continuous systems.  It also develops a new approach for how to deal with the multi-objective optimization problem.  These issues are of direct importance to the use of multi-agent technology on power plants and the author was well suited to tackle these problems as they mirror issues faced by the Department of Defense in pursuing distributed coordination techniques.\n\tIt is hoped that this work will further solidify and increase the quality of multi-agent research with real-time systems and encourage research to move from theoretical or overly simplified situations to more pertinent real world applications.  It also hoped that this research will contribute to laying out well defined procedures to approach a multi-objective optimization problem.  Results of this work will hopefully be used to enhance efficiency and allow a mechanism for many new data intensive solutions to current challenges.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2708], "author_name_tesi": "Van Sickel, Joel Herbert", "last_name_ssi": "Van Sickel", "middle_name_ssi": "Herbert", "first_name_ssi": "Joel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kwang Yun Lee", "Kwang Yun Lee", "Heath F Hofmann", "Jeffery S Mayer", "Robert M Edwards"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kwang Yun Lee, Dissertation Advisor", "Kwang Yun Lee, Committee Chair", "Heath F Hofmann, Committee Member", "Jeffery S Mayer, Committee Member", "Robert M Edwards, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["multi-objective optimization", "multi-agent", "power plant control"]}, {"year_isi": 2004, "title_ssi": "Electrophoretic Deposition: Fundamentals, Mechanisms and Examples with an In Depth Examination of the Ion Depletion Effect", "id": "6283", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3227", "defended_at_dtsi": "2004-02-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A definition of what is and what is not EPD is presented.  This definition then serves as a guide to the presentation of the basic science necessary to understand this process, including electrochemistry, colloid and surface chemistry, and electrohydrodynamics.  Analysis of this basic science leads to a list of possible mechanisms by which EPD can occur.  Some of these mechanisms have already been documented in the literature, while some are still hypothetical.  \nOne of the most interesting of these mechanisms, ion depletion enhanced - automatic leveling deposition, is chosen for in-depth analysis.  The first step is a complete analysis of the suspension of alumina powder in ethanol with added HCl which is used for deposition.  It is shown that alumina develops a significant positive surface charge in ethanol by the dissociative adsorption of ethanol molecules to the surface and the preferential desorption of ethoxide ions from the surface.  The addition of HCl leads to a large rise in surface charge due initially to reduction in ethoxide activity.  After this initial rise the surface charge is set by a competitive adsorption equilibrium of chloride and ethoxide ions to positive surface sites on the powder.\nAnalysis of the development of ionic and charge gradients in the electrolyte at the deposition electrode show the inevitability of a transition to convective transport without particles.  A dramatic change in conduction behavior in the presence of particles is shown to be due to the stabilization of an ion depleted, unbalanced charge conduction layer.  Extremely high voltage gradients in this layer exert a strong consolidating force on positively charged alumina particles, generating a densely packed deposition layer.  The high voltage gradient also leads to a strong equilibrating force to maintain a uniform thickness of the compact deposited layer.\nDemonstrations are also made of the potential of EPD to address problems in the manufacture of electroceramic devices.  The deposition of silver/palladium powder is used to demonstrate the ability to create both very thin layers and narrow conductor lines.  The EPD of PZT is used to demonstrate the formation of an intermediate thickness film with well controlled stoichiometry. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3214], "author_name_tesi": "Van Tassel, Jonathan J.", "last_name_ssi": "Van Tassel", "middle_name_ssi": "J.", "first_name_ssi": "Jonathan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Clive A Randall", "James Hansell Adair", "Leslie Eric Cross", "Digby D Macdonald", "Gary Lynn Messing"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Clive A Randall, Committee Chair", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member", "Leslie Eric Cross, Committee Member", "Digby D Macdonald, Committee Member", "Gary Lynn Messing, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electrophoretic Deposition", "Alumina Surface Charge", "Electroconvection", "PZT Films", "Ion Depleted Conduction"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Circumferential Guided Waves in Elastic and Viscoelastic Multilayered Annuli\n", "id": "9498", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2760", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "People all over the world rely on vast pipeline infrastructures whether it be directly, such as for fuel to cook and heat their homes, or indirectly, such as for delivery to the farmer who must harvest and process the food that will eventually end up on their table. In many cases these pipelines, or at least portions of them, have been in operation for more than half a century. This long-term use, coupled with a lack of integrity assurance programs in the early part of the 20th century, has resulted in the overall degradation and, in many cases, failure of the pipeline. Such failure can be detrimental to the people in the immediate vicinity of the pipeline and the surrounding habitat, and result in significant clean-up, reparation, and litigation costs to the operator. For this reason, most operators have now implemented pipeline integrity and assessment programs, which generally rely quite heavily on non-destructive testing methods.\nOne of the most common inspection technologies for gas transmission pipeline is the Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) In-Line Inspection (ILI) tool. These tools travel through the inside of the pipeline, saturating the pipe wall with a magnetic field, which subsequently \u201cleaks\u201d from the wall in areas of corrosion. While this technology has been found to be a reliable detection tool for most corrosion geometries, it has relatively limited sizing capabilities. For this reason, there is currently significant interest in the use of guided ultrasonic waves for improved inspection capabilities. In a similar fashion to the MFL tools, these ultrasonic tools travel through the inside of the pipe, usually transmitting and receiving ultrasound in the circumferential direction of the pipe.\nAs wave mechanics can be a very complex subject, many tool developers, and even researchers, equate the propagation of the circumferential wave to that which travels in a plate. While this may be a valid assumption in some cases, it is not in all cases; particularly as radius decreases and wall thickness increases. Furthermore, nowhere in the present body of literature regarding circumferential waves, has anybody made provisions in their model for the presence of coating layers, even if assuming elastic.\nThis primary goal of the work presented here is the development of more accurate modeling tools for circumferential guided waves. The generalized characteristic equations for circumferentially propagating shear-horizontal and Lamb [type] waves are derived and the Global Matrix Method is used to extend the solutions to multiple layers. Dispersion curves are presented for several cases of single-layer and multilayered annuli and some physical insights into their meaning are provided. Wave structures are also examined for satisfaction of the appropriate boundary condtions.\nThe elastic-viscoelastic correspondence principle is employed to allow the use of the elastic solutions for viscoelastic materials, via incorporation of complex material moduli. The Semi-Analytical Finite Element approach is enlisted to calculate the dispersion solutions for elastic/viscoelastic multilayered annuli and to obtain solution in the dispersion spaces for which the fully analytical calculation was found to fail. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical and semi-analytical approaches. The differences between the dispersion curves for elastic multilayered annuli and elastic/viscoelastic annuli are examined.\nTwo experimental demonstrations are provided to validate the accuracy of the newly development theoretical models and to provide examples of how the theoretical models may be employed to develop new non-destructive testing methodologies. In particular, it is shown how a circumferential shear-horizontal wave is influenced by coating thickness and how these effects may be used to detect disbonds in protective coating layers. Multiple disbond detection features are identified that have resulted directly from consideration of the theoretical models. \nAnother practical example is included in an appendix and employs a circumferential Lamb [type] wave for the estimation of the remaining wall thickness of a gradually thinned annulus. This study is completed using finite-element analysis as appropriate test specimens were not available and proper fabrication would be impractical.\nIt should be noted that there are many other potential applications for the models developed in this work.

Addressing this question requires identifying which factors are taken into account in action planning. Possibly, the adopted solutions depend on the nature of the task, including factors such as task difficulty and experience. In general, the solution may depend on cognitive as well as biomechanical factors.\n\nFrom a cognitive perspective, solving the degrees of freedom problem requires identifying which reference frame is used for action control. Actors may control physical actions relative to their bodies or relative to the external world. The origin of the adopted reference frames may be task-dependent.\n\nTo explore these possibilities, I conducted a series of experiments on how people manipulate two objects, one with each hand. I studied the influence of task difficulty and experience on performance through manipulations of start and target locations, timing of object grasps and object transports, number of repetitions that were performed, and object weight. These manipulations allowed me to determine which reference frame people used to plan their grasps.\n\nParticipants planned object grasps in cognitively efficient ways by adopting similar solutions for the two hands. Grasp selection was consistent with the use of an allocentric reference frame tied to the objects. The adoption of object symmetric grasps did not consistently depend on experience or grasp timing, but did depend on the similarity of the mass distribution of the two objects. In other words, symmetry in the mass distributions for the two objects appeared to drive the preference for symmetry in grasp selection. The results suggested that participants selected similar grasp locations because doing so allowed similar dynamics for the two hands during object transport. Breaking symmetry in allocentric dynamics resulted in changes in grasp selection.\n\nThe results are consistent with the notion that solving the degrees of freedom problem involves an interplay of representational and biomechanical efficiency.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5418], "author_name_tesi": "Van der Wel, Robrecht Parsival Reinhard Diederik", "last_name_ssi": "Van der Wel", "middle_name_ssi": "Parsival Reinhard Diederik", "first_name_ssi": "Robrecht", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Psychology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David A.

Second, most other types of homicide show a steady decline through both decades. Empirical work on the crime drop has tended to conflate these two trends, leading to confusion over the causes of these patterns. I survey existing causal explanations with these distinctions in mind. Crack cocaine markets have been identified as the major factor in the rise of youth homicides in the late 1980s, and the subsequent fall in the 1990s rate was concentrated within the same kinds of homicide. Explanations for the reversal of the youth homicide wave are thereby most plausible when they directly or indirectly deal with drug markets: economic improvement, routine policing, or crack market stabilization. The broad decline in other kinds of homicide, widely overlooked until now, demands further inquiry and analysis.

While some qualitative work has emphasized the potentially transformative nature of the transition to parenthood, quantitative estimates of parenthood\u2019s effects on criminal involvement have varied considerably. I use data from multiple waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to assess parenthood effects with multivariate, multi-level models.\n\nThis dissertation analyzes the influence of parenthood on crime over time (as youngest child\u2019s age) and across context (as neighborhood disadvantage). First, I address a set of hypotheses derived from major criminological theories. I analyze the full sample to arrive at estimates of the effect of being a parent at the time of the transition to parenthood, as well as estimates of how that effect might change over time. The empirical pattern of crime as a child is born and raised has the potential to support or disconfirm theoretical mechanisms that might explain parenthood. Second, I address an empirical hypothesis recently raised by Kreager and colleagues (2010) as a reconciliation of disparate findings in the life-course literature. In keeping with some urban ethnography, they hypothesize that the crime-inhibiting parenthood effect may only exist for women in poor urban areas. They did not, however, test this inference directly. Using Add Health, I am able to start with a full sample and test for differences in parenthood effects among subpopulations.\n\nWith regard to the theoretical hypotheses, my findings show that parenthood has a short-term negative influence on crime in the full sample. This pattern is consistent with a routine activities explanation, as argued by Yule and Griffiths (2009) in research on family roles and victimization. Changes in identity and self-concept, as discussed in the theory of cognitive transformation (Giordano, Cernkovich, and Rudolph 2002) and the age-graded theory of informal social control (Laub and Sampson 2003), may also be plausible explanations. The finding of a fading effect of parenthood is difficult to reconcile with the hypothesized mechanism of internal control. Accordingly, the social bonding theory developed by Hirschi (1969) is especially threatened by these results.\n\nThe empirical hypothesis states that the parenthood effect may in fact be a motherhood effect limited to poor urban areas. I test for differences between contexts: the full sample, an urban sample, a disadvantaged urban sample, and gender within the disadvantaged urban areas. My results partially replicate and confirm the findings of Kreager and colleagues (2010). I do find significant reductions in crime among mothers in high-risk urban areas. Their hypothesis that a parenthood effect is found exclusively among this population, however, is not supported by my findings. I do not find significant variation between motherhood and fatherhood in their associations with crime in any analyses. The fading effect of parenthood from the main results, upon further inspection, appears to be concentrated in non-urban areas.

Despite significant advances in the field of diabetes research, diabetic retinopathy affects more than 90% of individuals with diabetes and remains a leading cause of new cases of adult blindness.  A number of clinical reports provide evidence for altered retinal neurophysiology and functional impairment soon after the diagnosis of diabetes, and often prior to the detection of vascular lesions characteristic of retinopathy.  The neurodegenerative components of the disease remain poorly understood, however, and although diabetes-induced vision loss likely involves a loss of effective synaptic communication between retinal neurons, the impact of diabetes on retinal synaptic connectivity remains largely unexplored.  At the most basic level, the healthy function of retinal neurons and effective neurotransmission through retinal synapses are critical to healthy vision, and numerous publications indicate that these processes become dysfunctional in the early stages of diabetes.  The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that a short period of experimental diabetes reduces synaptic protein expression in rat retina, using the streptozotocin-diabetic rat model.\n\tThis research focused on several synaptic proteins essential to synaptic function and regulated neurotransmission in ribbon (tonically active) and conventional (phasically active) retinal synapses that comprise the retinal plexiform layers, including synapsin I, synaptophysin, VAMP2, SNAP-25 and PSD-95.  Immunohistochemistry localized these proteins to the synaptic layers of the retina, and identified a uniform weakening of synaptic protein immunoreactivity in retinas from one- and three-month diabetic rats.  Consistent with this finding, the whole-retina content of these proteins was significantly less than control levels in diabetic rats at these time points.  Further, mRNA transcripts of these proteins were significantly reduced after three months, while axonal and dendritic proteins and their mRNAs were concomitantly decreased after one month of diabetes.  These data suggest that one month of diabetes results in a significant depletion of proteins critical to synaptic maintenance and function in rat retina.\n\tA synaptosome isolation protocol was developed to investigate the impact of diabetes on synaptic protein expression specifically at retinal synapses.  Comparison of retinal synaptosomes isolated from control and one-month diabetic rats demonstrated a reduction of both synaptic proteins and mRNAs, as well as components of translation regulation machinery.  In vitro stimulation of synaptosomes revealed an impairment of depolarization-induced synapsin I phosphorylation in diabetic rats, indicating functional impairment of one mechanism of neurotransmission regulation.  The magnitudes of protein and transcript loss, together with the impairment of stimulus-dependent synapsin I phosphorylation, reported here indicate that diabetes has a profound impact on retinal synapses, and provide a potential mechanism of retinal dysfunction in diabetes.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2166], "author_name_tesi": "VanGuilder, Heather Dawn", "last_name_ssi": "VanGuilder", "middle_name_ssi": "Dawn", "first_name_ssi": "Heather", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Neuroscience", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alistair J Barber", "Thomas Wright Gardner", "Sarah Bronson", "Ian Alexander Simpson", "Robert J Milner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alistair J Barber, Committee Chair", "Thomas Wright Gardner, Committee Member", "Sarah Bronson, Committee Member", "Ian Alexander Simpson, Committee Member", "Robert J Milner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["synaptosome", "diabetes", "retina", "synapse"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Fabrication and Characterization of Hydrogel-filled Nanoliposomes for Applications in Nanomedicine", "id": "27445", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12101", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nano-scale carriers that enable selective delivery of bioactive payloads to specific cells are sought after in gene therapy, regenerative medicine, and cancer treatment.

Concerns with liposomal formulations are in vivo stability and rapid drug efflux from the liposome lumen. This thesis presents a simple modification to liposome drug formulations and evaluates changes to stability and release properties by inclusion of a hydrogel core within the intraliposomal space. \nThe resultant nanocarriers are evaluated for their size, surface charge, colloidal stability, and release properties. The presence of the hydrogel core is confirmed by membrane permeabilization by TX-100 detergent and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. Two distinct drug molecules, rhodamine123 and doxorubicin, were encapsulated in the liposome and the liposome nanogels were monitored for drug release by dialysis against a large volume of PBS. The results showed that the addition of a hydrogel core allows for the use of lipid blends that were previously ineffective for drug retention in liposomal doxorubicin formulations. Taken together, this work suggests that the simple inclusion of a hydrogel polymer interior to nanoliposomes opens the door for a robust control over colloidal stability and release properties without significantly altering existing liposome fabrication protocols.

As such, green roofs are taxing environments for the plants which inhabit them.  There exist, however, various microclimates on many roofs which may provide growing conditions different from those on a typical section of green roof.  One category of such microclimates is shaded areas.  The goal of this thesis was to explore the possibilities available in these areas to non-traditional green roof plant species.\n\tFifteen species of plants, twelve of which are native to the Northeastern United States, were chosen to be grown in both shaded an non-shaded conditions on a green roof with two sections, one being nominally four inches, and one being nominally six inches thick.  Four replicates were included in the resultant four treatment groups, with each plant being allotted a 75cm x 75cm area in which to grow for one year.\n\tPlants which were grown in the deeper media showed significantly better health and growth after one year than their counterparts in the shallow media, likely due in part to a deeper media\u2019s inherent larger water-storage capacity.  This trend has been seen in many previous experiments.  Testing of the roof\u2019s media and conditions, however, showed that the shaded areas in both media depth sections of the roof had significantly lower surface, plant, and subsurface temperatures, significantly higher water retention capabilities, and significantly higher humidity levels near the roof\u2019s surface.  It was most likely due in part to these factors as well that the plants in the shaded sections of the green roof in both the deeper and shallower sections showed increased growth and more robust health than their non-shaded counterparts.\n\tDifferences in performance between species were seen during the experiment.  Among the species tested, those which showed higher levels of aptitude for growth and survival in shaded areas on green roofs included Achillea millefolium, Dicentra eximia, Eurybia divaricata, Fragaria virginiana, Potentilla simplex, Scutellaria ovata, Sedum spurium, Viola sororia, and Waldsteinia fragarioides.  To a lesser degree, Geranium maculatum, Glechoma hederacea, and Iris cristata showed promise as potential candidates for inclusion in a shaded green roof plant community.  Three species used in this project which would not be recommended for green roofs are Ajuga reptans, which could not withstand the cold temperatures of a central Pennsylvania winter, Meehania cordata, and Pachysandra procumbens.\n\tDuring the course of this roof-top study, morphological changes such as etiolation were observed in many species in the shaded treatment groups.  Previous studies of non-Sedum plants on green roofs have found that due to differences in anatomy, they can increase the amount of water a green roof can retain, and the rate at which the roof loses water due to evapotranspiration, when compared to a roof planted with Sedums.  Two of the species from this study, Eurybia divaricata \u2018Eastern Star\u2019, and Sedum spurium \u2018Dragon\u2019s Blood\u2019, were grown in both shaded and non-shaded conditions in green roof media in greenhouse conditions to determine if morphological and physiological changes due to growing in a shaded environment affected the plants\u2019 abilities to retain and mobilize water.  Water loss over a two-week period without watering, as well as water retention levels before and after the drying-out period was measured.  In addition, plant root and shoot lengths were measured at the beginning and end of the experiment, as well as plant live mass and dry mass.  The E. divaricata plants used displayed no significant differences in root and shoot tissue amounts at the end of the experiment due to the shade treatment, and yielded statistically similar water retention and evapotranspiration rates in both treatments.  The S. spurium plants however, showed significant reduction in root and shoot production, water retention, and evapotranspiration capabilities when grown in the shaded treatments.\n\tThe results found in these studies suggest that by utilizing the benefits of shaded microclimates on a green roof, a wider, more diverse plant palette can be implemented on thinner green roofs.  Additionally, the potential benefits of including non-sedum species on a green roof were not seen to diminish in shaded areas.\u2003\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10768], "author_name_tesi": "Vanco, Peter David", "last_name_ssi": "Vanco", "middle_name_ssi": "David", "first_name_ssi": "Peter", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Berghage Jr.", "Eric Paul Burkhart", "Elsa Selina Sanchez"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Berghage Jr., Thesis Advisor", "Eric Paul Burkhart, Thesis Advisor", "Elsa Selina Sanchez, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["green roof", "shade", "native plants", "rainwater retention"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A POTENTIAL ROLE FOR GUT MACROPARASITES IN THE POPULATION DYNAMICS OF CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA WHITE-FOOTED MICE PEROMYSCUS LEUCOPUS\n", "id": "8623", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3448", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In an era of bio-terrorism and emerging novel pathogens including AIDS, Ebola, SARS and avian influenza, the need to more closely address disease dynamics is clear.  In the past 25 years, the world has seen an unprecedented increase in the number of emerging infectious diseases throughout the world, and this has implications for both human and animal health.  Wild animal populations can be very useful in investigating zoonotic diseases and human epidemiology.  Determination of the prevalence of macro- and microparasites in a wildlife model system could provide useful insight into how these pathogens flow through and persist in a natural population of animals. We can evaluate the demographics and try to address questions such as: Are there key hosts responsible for a disproportionate amount of the transmission? Are there hot spots of transmission? How does this pathogen flow through the population?  \n\tPeromyscus leucopus (the white-footed mouse) provides a unique opportunity to investigate these patterns in the wild because of its ease of handling, high trappability, and inter-annual population dynamics. This allows us to intensively monitor individual interactions between reservoir hosts, both spatially and temporally, and it is these interactions that are key in understanding transmission dynamics of directly transmitted diseases. Additionally, by trapping every two weeks we can closely monitor or track infection and determine any peak transmission periods.  These large and replicated monitoring areas we use encompass the home range of many individuals; thus, we can investigate our questions at both the individual and population level.  These characteristics make the system conducive to manipulations whereby we can perturb these populations away from equilibrium and disrupt transmission.\n\tThe goals of this thesis were to first identify the parasites and outline the seasonal demographics, distribution, and vital rates of the infected and uninfected hosts and we accomplished this with both intensive and extensive trapping efforts.  Then, in 2004, we sought to manipulate the populations to see the response to additional food in the form of periodical cicadas or sunflower seeds.  In the third year (2005) we investigated the influence of both habitat quality and helminth removal. The 2004 results indicated that P. leucopus does respond to a springtime pulse of protein rich cicadas by increasing in density, but they do not respond to the carbohydrate rich seeds as is typical in the autumn.  In 2005, parasite removal led to increased size, breeding, and body condition of animals and caused a reversal of the mid-summer breeding hiatus, while increased habitat quality did not appear to influence any vital rates or demographic characteristics.\n\tThere is growing evidence that parasites play an important role in shaping population dynamics, and that chronic parasite infection can influence host fitness by reducing breeding output or perhaps by shaping seasonal breeding strategies. We have shown that there are significant impacts of nematode worms on the body condition, mass, growth, and breeding of P. leucopus, and that parasites can account for the mid-summer breeding hiatus commonly observed in female mice.  These results imply that parasites may play a more important role in the vital rates and temporal dynamics of P. leucopus than resource abundance. We also show that the dominant parasite in the community (Pterygodermatities peromysci), exhibits a random distribution amongst the mouse population and this coupled with the impact upon summer breeding should lead to destabilization of the relationship between parasite and host.  Further studies are needed determine if and what role parasites play a role in the unstable dynamics of P. leucopus.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3435], "author_name_tesi": "Vandegrift, Kurt Jason", "last_name_ssi": "Vandegrift", "middle_name_ssi": "Jason", "first_name_ssi": "Kurt", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter John Hudson", "James Harold Marden", "Ottar N Bjornstad", "Eric Thomas Harvill", "Bryan Grenfell"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter John Hudson, Committee Member", "James Harold Marden, Committee Chair", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Member", "Eric Thomas Harvill, Committee Member", "Bryan Grenfell, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["periodical cicadas", "paradox of enrichment", "predator", "Peromyscus", "population dynamics", "macroparasite", "food addition", "population destabilization"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Characterizing the Supraglacial Hydrological Environment of Western Greenland: Investigating Lake and Channel Distribution, and Melt Channel Discharge Capacity", "id": "11487", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2644", "abstract_tesi": "The supraglacial hydrologic network is composed of lakes and interconnecting channels that transport water to, between, and from lakes. The spatial distribution of supraglacial lakes has been hypothesized to be dominantly controlled by the component of surface roughness influenced by basal topography. Basal topography and surface roughness profiles within the Jakobshavn Isbrae drainage basin in western Greenland, acquired from an ice penetrating radar echo sounder, were analyzed through Fourier and wavelet decompositions. Spectral analyses of basal-to-surface roughness transfer under a range of ice thickness were compared with the spatial distribution of lakes mapped from high resolution Landsat imagery. Fourier analysis identifies dominant signals in both the basal and surface profiles to be ranging between wavelengths of 1.25-12.5km. The strongest peaks of transfer of basal signals to the surface were identified at wavelengths ~11km and ~5km. Wavelet analysis identifies these peaks with thicker (1200 \u2013 1400m) and thinner (500 \u2013 700m) ice respectively, and also identifies surface frequencies not present in the basal signal indicating some influence from other forcings. Spatial autocorrelation analysis of supraglacial lake distribution identifies periodicities at spacings of 1.9km, 5.6km, 11km, 24km, and 30km, of which those at 5.6km and 11km correspond with the dominant frequencies present in the basal and surface profiles over thinner and thicker ice respectively. These ~5km and ~11km frequency components present in the basal topography, surface roughness, and lake distribution are within the theoretical transfer window of basal to surface transfer as a function of ice thickness.  Thus, basal topography influences surface roughness and lake distribution, but does not explain all the variation present in lake distribution.\nThe spatio-temporal distribution of supraglacial melt channels and their relationship to supraglacial lakes over the Jakobshavn Isbrae region of Western Greenland was analyzed using Landsat ETM+ panchromatic images during the 2007 melt season. A total of 1189 melt channels were delineated and show an increase in the number of melt channels throughout the season, reaching a peak on August 9. Melt channels are observed at elevations up to 1647m on August 9, and attain a minimum average slope of 0.009 on July 8. The hydrologic channel network demonstrates a progression towards terminal flow into moulins and crevasses through the melt season.

Reductions in sea ice are permitting increasing annual transits of the Northern Sea Route and expanded resource exploration throughout the Arctic Ocean. Additional infrastructure in the form of new and expanded ports and roads are required in order to utilize these emerging opportunities. The timing and location of physical changes allows for estimates of infrastructure development that will facilitate expanding Arctic accessibility, which it turn allows for utilization of emerging opportunities. \nThis dissertation establishes the Climate Infrastructure and Accessibility Model (CIAM) that explores the relationship between current physical constraints and economic development patterns, and projects how those patterns may change in response to anticipated changes. CIAM incorporates sea ice projections from the Max Planck Institute\u2019s Earth System Model (ESM) with infrastructure projections developed from literature-derived port citing criteria and theory-derived location factors, to project changes in Arctic accessibility throughout the 21st century. Accessibility change then identifies how the Arctic economy is likely to reconfigure under changed physical conditions.\nCIAM projects accessibility changes under four scenarios built on two physical pathways and two economic pathways, thus investigating a range of potential future conditions. The results suggest unequal impacts with Russia, Alaska, and western Canada emerging as the new Arctic development centers. Furthermore, CIAM projects that trans-Arctic shipping routes will become increasingly efficient, although not necessarily shorter through utilization of increasingly open coastal waters.

Following the Roman poet Virgil's renunciation of aesthetics over the waning hours of his life, it punishes the reader with harsh formal and stylistic challenges, enacting Broch's Rezeptions\u00e4sthetik der Resignation, a concerted attempt to have reading efface avant-garde literature's intervention in everyday life. To do so, Vergil perpetuates and expands on the avant-gardiste inner monologue, refocusing it from the cognitive to the existential. Instead of a coherent subject, Broch's reader must speculate a transcendent account of being out of the given story of one being. \nIn so doing, the text reorders the act of reading into a self-inquiry. Emphasizing the process of speculation over its result, the novel compels the reader to interrogate the putative certainty of reading itself. Vergil specifically subverts the narrative desire for resolution through discrete plot at both intra- as well as intertextual levels. Within itself, Vergil erects a semiotic counter-plot qua fate that digresses away from endings that offer final completeness, imposing an logic of eternal recurrence and incompleteness. At an intertextual level, Vergil situates itself in thematic, formal, and even geographical similitude with other \u201chellish\u201d labyrinthine texts such as The Aeneid and Dante's Divine Comedy, encompassing them together as unique instances within a larger trans-textual counter-plot of fate.\nBy undermining narrative unfolding, Vergil exposes the impossibility of reading to positively affect life. Allegorized in the unattainability of sexual desire, the failed promise of an ending serves as a dead end within the labyrinthine text. The self-inquiry involved in readerly speculation denudes prevailing readerly expectations to the point of nihilistic aporia, where the renunciation of reading itself becomes the ultimate epiphany. In so doing, Vergil reveals the immanent failure of the avant-garde. By denuding both Virgil and the reader, it demonstrates the moment where the avant-garde's critical self-awareness turns against itself, revealing its institutionalized fetishization. By succeeding in intvervening in the life of the reader, it renders itself void; the pinnacle of its receptivity demonstrating the impossibility of reception.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15881], "author_name_tesi": "VanderKolk, Jacob Allan", "last_name_ssi": "VanderKolk", "middle_name_ssi": "Allan", "first_name_ssi": "Jacob", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "German", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy", "Samuel Mark Frederick", "Sabine Doran", "Jonathan Paul Eburne", "Thomas Oliver Beebee"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Dissertation Advisor", "Daniel Leonhard Purdy, Committee Chair", "Samuel Mark Frederick, Committee Member", "Sabine Doran, Committee Member", "Jonathan Paul Eburne, Outside Member", "Thomas Oliver Beebee, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["German Studies", "Hermann Broch", "Der Tod des Vergil", "The Death of Virgil", "Reader Response", "Avant-Garde"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Investigation of fold growth in North Canterbury, South Island, New Zealand", "id": "27221", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11514", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-07-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The North Canterbury fold and thrust belt is seismically active and located at the southern end of the Hikurangi subduction zone on the South Island of New Zealand. The thrust belt is in a region where the Pacific plate transitions from subduction to transpression along the Alpine Fault leading to lateral migration of the edge of the Pacific plate. This lateral migration causes shortening beneath the South Island because basement normal faults related to Cretaceous-Paleocene rifting are reactivated as thrusts. These basement thrust faults generate folds within the North Canterbury thrust belt. In this region, the Montserrat Anticline is exposed along the coast where a spectacular flight of marine terraces records late Pleistocene tectonic uplift. The landward vergent Montserrat Anticline folds a Cretaceous to Pleistocene cover sequence. Paralleling the northwest limb, the Glendhu Fault thrusts Jurassic-Cretaceous basement rock against a Pliocene formation at the northeast end of the anticline and thrusts a Miocene formation against an early Oligocene formation at the southwest end. This juxtaposition reflects motion on a seaward dipping reverse fault rooted within the Jurassic-Cretaceous basement.  On the southeast limb of the anticline, the Happy Valley fault offsets the MIS 3 terrace by 10 m.  To constrain fault slip rate and fault ages, fault-related fold kinematics were modeled using the trishear fold model appropriate for basement faults that drive cover sequence folding. Batch inverse models were run to generate the bedrock geology and bedding attitudes and to develop probability density distributions for important variables such as ramp angle and slip. Marine terraces were dated using amino acid racemization and optically stimulated luminescence and constrain terrace ages to highstands MIS 3, MIS 5a, and MIS 5e.

Student psychopathology, of which anxiety and depression are the two most common clinical presentations (American College Health Association, 2013; CCMH, 2014), has been shown to significantly interfere with academic performance in indirect ways (Brackney & Karabenick, 1995). Therefore, identifying factors that support healthy normal development expected in college students, yet are effective at intervening with depression and anxiety could be helpful in guiding therapists\u2019 goals in psychotherapy.

The molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic loss and reduced plasticity with normal brain aging are unknown and identification of these pathways could provide targets for therapeutics to either prevent cognitive decline or slow its progression.  The major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) processing and presentation pathway was first described in the immune system and serves to detect viral antigens and destroy infected cells.  However, it has recently been discovered that MHCI is functionally pleiotropic, and plays important roles in the CNS including participating in activity-dependent structural remodeling processes, synaptic refinement, and synaptic plasticity.  Previously, we have demonstrated a significant increase in MHCI processing and presentation pathway transcript expression in hippocampal synapses of aged male rats.  Given that MHCI reduces glutamatergic and GABAergic synapse density, and under certain conditions, inhibits synaptic plasticity, aberrant MHCI regulation may be a mechanistic pathway in brain aging.    \nWith the recent discovery of these new functions of MHCI in the CNS, there is a paucity of data on the expression, localization, and regulation of the MHCI pathway in the CNS across the lifespan in both males and females.  This information is required in order to understand MHCI function in the CNS.  These studies sought to 1) characterize regional and cellular expression of MHCI across the CNS, 2) examine DNA promoter methylation as a regulatory mechanism underlying differences in MHCI expression across neural regions, 3) assess DNA promoter methylation as a regulatory mechanism underlying differences in MHCI gene expression across ages and sex, 4) determine changes in MHCI and inflammatory transcript expression with advanced age in both males and females across neural regions, and 5) test acute changes in sex hormones as a potential regulatory mechanism controlling MHCI and inflammatory gene expression.\nWe found that MHCI expression is ubiquitously expressed across neural regions but quantitative expression patterns vary significantly.  These differences in expression may be regulated through DNA promoter methylation as methylation levels of two classical MHCI isoforms, H2-D1 and H2-K1, differed between regions and were inversely correlated with expression levels.  MHCI expression is apparent primarily in neurons across all areas of the CNS examined with some expression in microglia as well.  Additionally, inductions in MHCI expression with advanced age were replicated in both male and female mice, with females demonstrating higher induction in inflammatory transcripts when compared to males, suggesting an influence by sex hormones in the regulation of MHCI and inflammatory factors.  DNA promoter methylation does not appear to regulate MHCI transcript expression changes with age.  When testing the hypothesis that sex hormones, specifically estrogen, control MHCI expression, we found that MHCI expression did not vary across the estrous cycle, however, inflammatory transcripts were significantly regulated across the cycle, with higher expression being evident in hypoestrogenic periods.  \nThe results of these studies demonstrate that differences in MHCI expression across CNS regions are likely regulated in part through gene promoter methylation.  Age-related induction of MHCI and inflammatory gene expression occurs across the CNS in both males and females, with females demonstrating higher expression when compared to age-matched males, suggesting a potential sex-hormone component to regulation.  However, MHCI expression does not appear to be regulated acutely by changes in circulating sex hormones in young females, but other inflammatory genes are.  The latter results provide an important new avenue of research examining changes in local neuroinflammation that may affect cognitive processes with acute alterations in circulating sex hormones.  These studies may also provide insight into age and/or sex related differences in stroke, learning and memory, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and CNS connectivity and plasticity given the expanding functional roles for MHCI in the CNS. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9263], "author_name_tesi": "Vankirk, Colleen Amanda", "last_name_ssi": "Vankirk", "middle_name_ssi": "Amanda", "first_name_ssi": "Colleen", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Pharmacology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr Willard M Freeman", "Kent Eugene Vrana", "Andras Hajnal", "Scot R Kimball", "Melvin Lee Billingsley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr Willard M Freeman, Dissertation Advisor", "Kent Eugene Vrana, Committee Member", "Andras Hajnal, Committee Member", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Melvin Lee Billingsley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["aging", "MHCI", "brain", "neuroinflammation"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Stimuli promoting the arrested development of gastrointestinal helminths in the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus): the role of climate, host immunity, and intensity of infection", "id": "14582", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7499", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Animal species have evolved a large variety of strategies to optimize fitness under multiple challenges from environmental constraints.

The relative role of three stimuli were examined; climatic conditions, host immune responses, and parasite intensity dependent processes in affecting the arrested development of two gastrointestinal helminths, Graphidium strigosum and Trichostrongylus retortaeformis, in their natural herbivore host the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). The gastrointestinal tracts from rabbits sampled monthly for 3 years were digested and parasites were extracted, identified and counted. For both helminths, the number of larvae collected exhibited strong seasonal and host age-related patterns, fewer larvae were recovered in the summer compared to the winter and more in adults than in juveniles. The arrested development of both helminth larvae was positively associated with the intensity of parasite infection and the antibody response while a negative relationship was found with mean air temperature. Host sex, reproductive status and co-infection with the second helminth affected such patterns. Overall, these findings indicate that arrested development was a common life strategy in the helminth species however, the relative contribution of the three stimuli differed between the two helminths and among host characteristics, i.e. age and sex. The relevance of these findings goes beyond the understanding of parasite life strategies and mechanisms of host-parasite interaction.

In particular, it addresses the symmetry of distortions.  Any parameterized path through configurational space is a distortion (distortion, distortion path, and pathway are used synonymously in this work).  This goes beyond just the typical use of the term distortion that describes a path connecting a high symmetry prototype structure to a lower symmetry distorted structure; for instance, the tetragonal PbTiO3 structure is commonly described as a distorted cubic PbTiO3 structure.  In this work, a distortion is any parameterized path through configurational space, including the paths that atoms takes when hopping between sites in a crystal lattice, the pathways taking reactants to product in chemical reactions and conformational changes, the paths taken in domain wall, dislocation, and grain boundary motion, and many other things.  Clearly, understanding these paths is very important for many physical problems, e.g. an example is given in Chapter 1 where ignoring the consequences of distortion symmetry could result in overestimating the activation barrier for diffusion by a factor of ~5X (see Sections 1.1.2, 1.2.3, and 1.3.2).  Fundamentally, distortion symmetry works because it recognizes the separation of the configurational space from the parameter of the pathway (herein referred to as the distortion parameter, \u03bb).  This separation is something like the separation between time and space in classical mechanics and so \u03bb is seen as a \u201ctime-like\u201d parameter.  Because of the distortion parameter\u2019s time-like nature, the time reversal operation has an analog that reverses the distortion parameter.  This operation is called distortion reversal.  Distortion symmetry comes from considering the conventional symmetry of the configurations along a pathway in conjunction with distortion reversal.  The content of Chapter 1 is mostly independent of the other chapters and is written to be of interest to a more general audience than the others.\n\tDistortion reversal and time reversal are independent antisymmetry operations and so motivate the listing of the types of double antisymmetry space groups described in Chapter 3.  The mathematical tools necessary to determine the types of double antisymmetry space groups are discussed in Chapter 2.

The\nperformance of a process adjustment technique, which indicates how\nto change the controllable factors of a process, depends on the\namount of information available about the relation between the\ncontrollable factors, or inputs, the noise factors and disturbances,\nand the responses, or outputs. This information usually results in\nan input-output, or transfer function, model. This dissertation\nconsiders problems related to the identification of these models,\nand proposes new process adjustment techniques when the amount of\ninformation available is limited (i.e. process runs are short) and\nnoise factors are present in a process.\n\nA specific problem addressed in this dissertation is how to identify\nthe input-output model of a process that is being adjusted. Such a\nclosed-loop identification method is necessary in industrial\nprocesses that cannot be left to run without control. Traditional\nsystem identification techniques assume open-loop (no control)\noperation.\n\nThe first part of this dissertation presents new methodology for the\nidentification of Box-Jenkins transfer function models under\nclosed-loop operating conditions. It is shown how the input-output\ndelay of the process represents crucial information and that, if\nknown a priori, it would facilitate the identification of the rest\nof the model.

The methods are based on Time Series change-point\ndetection techniques.\n\nIn the second part of the dissertation we study a system\nidentification problem frequently found in semiconductor\nmanufacturing. This is the so-called context-based model\nidentification problem, where different process models need to be\nidentified for different batches of products depending on the\nmanufacturing context under which the process data was obtained\n(e.g. the product type, operation, chamber, tool etc.). A model\nidentification method that uses categorical variable selection\nmethods is developed and applied to a real semiconductor\nmanufacturing data set.\n\nThe last part of the thesis presents new adjustment methods for\nprocesses that involve uncontrollable noise factors. In the\nstatistical process optimization literature, Robust Parameter Design\n(RPD) methods have been used for designing processes that are\ninsensitive against variation caused by noise factors. These\nmethods, however, are largely applied off-line; that is, they are\nnot process adjustment methods that recommend different controllable\nfactor settings depending on the on-line noise factors measured\nduring production. Instead, they determine the optimal process\nsettings before production starts and they do not alter the optimal\nsettings during production. In this research, new Bayesian process\nadjustment methods for on-line robust parameter design are proposed.\nThe proposed on-line RPD controllers are feedforward multiple\nresponse controllers that utilize on-line noise factor measurements,\nassumed available.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4787], "author_name_tesi": "Vanli, Omer Arda", "last_name_ssi": "Vanli", "middle_name_ssi": "Arda", "first_name_ssi": "Omer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Enrique Del Castillo", "M Jeya Chandra", "Tao Yao", "Murali Haran", "Nital S Patel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Enrique Del Castillo, Committee Chair", "M Jeya Chandra, Committee Member", "Tao Yao, Committee Member", "Murali Haran, Committee Member", "Nital S Patel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Statistical Process Control", "System Identification", "Time Series Analysis", "Robust Parameter Design", "Semiconductor Manufacturing", "Run-to-run Control"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "EVALUATION OF THE SOIL LAND INFERENCE MODEL IN BIG ELK CREEK WATERSHED, CHESTER COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA \n\n\n", "id": "8548", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5184", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-12-21T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Traditionally, soil maps are generated on an aerial photo by soil scientists as they traverse the  terrain. This is a tedious process and the  maps are generated only after sampling the soil within a small area. An experienced soil scientist will have valuable information about the soil-landscape relationships in the area. When a soil scientist retires, much of this valuable information is lost. Also, the mapunits generated using this method have discrete boundaries. The soils change abruptly from one mapunit to another.\nHowever, in nature, soils change gradually with changes in environmental properties. In order to capture this gradual change, the Soil Landscape Inference Model (SoLIM) was developed by A-Xing Zhu of the University of Wisconsin, Madison. SoLIM integrates expert knowledge, GIS and fuzzy logic and helps generate continuous soil maps. It\ngenerates a set of soil probability maps that represent the probability of occurrence of soils along different positions on the landscape.\n\nIn this study, SoLIM was used to develop continuous soil maps for Big Elk Creek Watershed in Chester County, Pennsylvania. The software was provided by the NRCS. Interviews were conducted with soil scientists, environmental variables required to map soils were developed and the soil-environmental variable relationship was described using membership curves. The membership curves were used to derive the continuous soil maps. Field validation of the resulting map was conducted. The agreement between the SoLIM generated hardened map and the field validation was found to be 37.5%. The agreement between the SoLIM generated hardened map and the published soil survey was found to be 37.4%. The soil models for all the soils need further refinement to improve the accuracy of the hardened map.\n\nThe maps generated using this model are only as good as the conceptual model of the soil scientist and the quality of the GIS data that are used in the mapping. Therefore, it is very important for soil scientists to have a good understanding of GIS and the data that can be used in mapping soils. This work showed that in studies where the time availability is very limited, SoLIM could be used effectively if field validation of the\nconceptual model is done before soil mapping is started.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5156], "author_name_tesi": "Varaghur, Ranjani ", "last_name_ssi": "Varaghur", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ranjani", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Soil Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Rick Lane Day"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Rick Lane Day, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["field validation", "knowledge base", "SoLIM", "fuzzy inference", "soil mapping"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Energy and Signal Cooperation in Competitive Wireless Networks with Energy Harvesting", "id": "14172buv113", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14172", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-08-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Energy harvesting is a green communications paradigm where the nodes harvest their energy from external and intermittent sources such as solar radiation and other wireless nodes' transmission. This green approach promotes an efficient utilization of the available resources, but also calls for careful management of these resources. Cooperation between energy harvesting nodes further improves network-wide performance and ensures a more balanced distribution of the network resources, notably, energy. This includes signal cooperation and energy cooperation. \n\nSignal cooperation in a wireless network entails nodes assisting other nodes by relaying their data. Thus, it requires the relaying nodes to take into account the data they receive and allocate their available energy accordingly. This introduces a data aspect to the optimization of energy harvesting networks which is often not addressed in studies that do not focus on cooperation. Energy cooperation improves network performance by letting nodes share their available energy with each other. This yields a fair distribution of energy in the network and counteracts energy starvation in the network. While the majority of works on energy and signal cooperation are built upon the assumption that all nodes will work towards a common goal in an altruistic fashion, this assumption may not be realistic in real world communication scenarios. In this dissertation, we study cooperation in energy harvesting networks and propose incentivization schemes where nodes can trade energy cooperation for signal cooperation and vice versa. \n\nWe start with signal cooperation in energy harvesting networks. The network models that we consider range from a simple network of an energy harvesting transmitter and a receiver, to an energy harvesting multi-way relay channel. We consider finite batteries and finite data buffers and formulate the (sum) throughput maximization problem in offline and online settings. We consider quality of service requirements such as delay constraints, and fading as well. We identify numerical and algorithmic optimal solutions to the (sum) throughput maximization problem. We show that we can decouple the problem into energy allocation and data allocation subproblems. We extend directional waterfilling to solve the former and propose an optimal solution for the latter that is based on induction. We extend this approach to larger networks including the two-way and two-way relay channels. In addition, we address the cases of continuous energy arrivals as well as energy harvesting cognitive radios.\n\nWe next bring energy cooperation into the picture and study a competitive scenario with selfish nodes that aim to maximize their own utilities only. We envision the nodes to offer signal cooperation in return for energy cooperation and vice versa, and take into account the impact of their actions on other nodes' utilities. We consider a two-hop network with energy transfer from the sources to the relays in exchange for the relaying of the sources' data. We study several game theoretical models such as noncooperative and Stackelberg games, and Vickrey auctions. We next study a network of transmitters and receivers where the transmitters can offer energy to the receivers. We consider one-to-one and one-to-many matching games where each transmitter can be matched with one or multiple receivers. For both cases, we identify stable matchings that maximize the sum rate and show the influence energy transfer offers on the matchings.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15561], "author_name_tesi": "Varan, Burak ", "last_name_ssi": "Varan", "first_name_ssi": "Burak", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Aylin Yener", "Aylin Yener", "Viveck Cadambe", "Chris Giebink", "Soundar Kumara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Aylin Yener, Dissertation Advisor", "Aylin Yener, Committee Chair", "Viveck Cadambe, Committee Member", "Chris Giebink, Committee Member", "Soundar Kumara, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Wireless networks", "Energy harvesting", "Cooperation", "Game theory", "Optimization", "Resource allocation"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "TWEETSIGHT: ENHANCING FINANCIAL ANALYSTS' SOCIAL MEDIA USE", "id": "13979rjv5174", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13979", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Social media usage in corporate work environments has increased tremendously in the last few years. Recent studies have explored various purposes which social media serves in these environments. However, research is still limited in understanding how this technology is used in work activities; specially in the sensemaking process. Financial analysts are an important part of this corporate community. They utilize information from heterogeneous sources (for example corporate filings, economic indicators, news, and tweets) to generate unique trade ideas. This thesis seeks to understand the role of social media in their work activity; specifically, sensemaking process. \n              For this purpose, I conducted a semi-structured interview and identified essential benefits and barriers for the primary social media platform used by the analysts -  Twitter. Analysts use Twitter as a query exploration tool, as a bellwether to understand sentiment, and to gauge knock-on effects. However, there are few key problems which prevent an analyst from using Twitter to the fullest potential. Based on these problems, I developed four scenarios to guide the design of TweetSight. In my second study, I evaluated the design of TweetSight by walking analysts through the prototype. Analysts responded positively to anchoring contextual tweets in news articles to facilitate discovery and exploration of Twitter. \n              My resultant findings and design implications can be applied more broadly in leveraging social media for various work activities, benefiting other corporate communities.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14288], "author_name_tesi": "Varanasi, Rama Adithya", "last_name_ssi": "Varanasi", "middle_name_ssi": "Adithya", "first_name_ssi": "Rama", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John M.
