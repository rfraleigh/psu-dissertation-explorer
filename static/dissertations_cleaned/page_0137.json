Chromatin plays crucial roles in regulating gene expression and recombination. There are multiple levels of chromatin folding, and current studies focus on primary chromatin structure\u2014positioning and occupancy of nucleosome across a genome. It has been shown that there is a general theme of nucleosome organization on the genes, and such patterns are conserved among several model organisms from yeast to human. Most of the current studies on primary chromatin structure have utilized unsynchronized cells during vegetative growth, meaning there is a gap in our knowledge regarding the changes of primary chromatin structure and histone modifications during meiotic cell cycle. \nTo study primary chromatin structure during the meiotic cell cycle, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on samples from several stages of yeast meiosis to study nucleosome, modified histones, linker histone (Hho1p), and a partial nucleosome called tetrasome. These results revealed a few general principles regarding meiosis and transcription regulation, which may also apply to plant and metazoan. 1) Nucleosome positioning and occupancy is largely maintained during the meiotic cell cycle; 2) Repositioning of the +1 nucleosome correlates with transcription regulation in subsets of stress response genes; 3) The histone modification data suggest that antisense transcripts repress meiotic specific genes during vegetative growth; 4) linker histone Hho1p is enriched at linker DNA and promoter regions; 5) Globally elevated incorporation of Hho1p into chromatin may contribute to chromatin compaction in mature yeast spores; 6) The majority of tetrasome dyads are shifted approximately 25-50 bp away from nucleosome dyads and may be mainly positioned by DNA sequence. Taken together, the work presented in this thesis shows multiple aspects of primary chromatin architecture during stages of meiosis, and such a dynamic and comprehensive picture of primary chromatin structure will be able to provide a framework to integrate results from other chromatin associated factors, thus revealing the interplay between cellular events and chromatin structure.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7081], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Liye ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Liye", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Cell and Developmental Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Joseph C.

However, prior research has failed to consider the potential negative effects of using an intimidating foreign language to describe the ethnic restaurant\u2019s menu items. In other words, language barriers, one of the fundamental issues in the context of ethnic dining, have been largely ignored.  \nThe purpose of the current study is to understand the impact of language barriers in the context of ethnic restaurants. We propose that language barriers will negatively influence preference fluency; that is, the subjective feeling of ease or difficulty experienced while constructing menu choices. In addition, we identify and empirically test three moderators that could potentially influence the fluency effect, attribution, power, and choice. \nOne pilot study and three main experiments have been conducted. The results of Study 1 support the hypothesis that a high language barrier leads to a lower level of preference fluency, thus resulting in a higher level of choice deferral, less liking of the choice, and lower anticipated satisfaction of the dish. However, once the feeling that making a choice is difficult can be attributed to a language barrier, the effect of preference fluency disappears. \nIn Study 2 and 3, we test the moderating effects of power and choice, and the timing of when power and choice are induced. The results indicate that power and choice increase individuals' reliance on meta-cognitive cues such as preference fluency, which leads to negative consequences. However, such an effect was only significant when power and choice are induced before menu processing. Conversely, when power and choice are induced after menu processing; the negative effect of the language barrier is attenuated.

The model specifies an independent regime switching process for the volatilities of each asset, and one process for the correlation matrix. It is\nthe first time that the volatility and correlation regimes are modeled simultaneously. From an in-sample perspective, it helps identify the relationship between the volatility and correlation dynamics. From a forward looking perspective, this model can potentially make good forecast of financial crisis where the market enters a high volatility and high correlation regime at the same time. Our model, along with the proposed Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, contributes to solving three important technical issues. First, we model the unobserved regime switching process by a jump chain and waiting times between jumps. We can use\nboth Exponential and Gamma distribution to describe the waiting time. This specification allows us to generalize the hidden regime process to be non-Markovian, which provides a better fit for empirical data that have seasonal switches in volatility levels. Secondly, we use a shrinkage model for the off-diagonal elements of the correlation matrix, which imposes an average correlation on each regime. This\nallows us to clearly represent and identify the latent correlation regimes. Third, since missing data is a challenge in real data analysis, we introduce a Bayesian imputation method which can accurately recover missing values, which can occur for example over different holidays for indices from different countries. \n\nBased on the structure of our model, we also introduce a portfolio allocation strategy where a portfolio manager re-balances portfolio weights whenever a switch in regime is detected. Such a strategy keeps a good balance between stock return and risk, and at the same time saves portfolio adjustment cost.

Hybrid algorithms that couple these two state-of-the-art data assimilation approaches are investigated in order to improve forecast skills. \nFirstly, an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is compared with both three-dimensional and four-dimensional variational data assimilation methods (3DVar and 4DVar) for the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model over the contiguous United States in the warm-season month of June 2003. The data assimilated every 6 h include conventional sounding and surface observations as well as those from wind profilers, ships, aircraft and cloud-tracked winds. The performance of these data assimilation methods are evaluated through verifying the 12- to 72-h forecasts (initialized twice daily from the analysis of each method) against the standard sounding observations. It is found that the 4DVar has consistently smaller error than that of the 3DVar for winds and temperature at all forecast lead times except at 60 h and 72 h when their forecast errors become comparable in amplitude. Two schemes have similar performances for moisture at all lead times. The forecast error of the EnKF is comparable to that of the 4DVar at 12-to-36-h lead times, both of which are substantially smaller than that of the 3DVar, despite the 3DVar fitting the sounding observations much closer at the analysis time. The advantage of the EnKF becomes evident at 48-to-72-h lead times.\t\n\tA hybrid assimilation scheme, called E3DVar, that couples EnKF with 3DVar of the WRF model is implemented. The performance of this three-dimensional coupled system is examined in comparison with that of the standalone EnKF and 3DVar. In the control experiments with a 40-member multiple-physics-parameterization ensemble, the 12- to 72-h WRF forecasts initialized by the E3DVar analyses have slightly but noticeably smaller root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) than those initialized from the default-configured EnKF, especially in the wind and moisture fields. Both ensemble-based methods (i.e., EnKF and E3DVar), which estimate flow-dependent background error covariance, substantially outperform the default 3DVar with static background uncertainty. A series of sensitivity experiments are conducted and lead to following conclusions: the E3DVar may have similar performance to the standard EnKF but with a much smaller-size ensemble; the hybrid system is less demanding for using a multi-physics ensemble as a treatment of model error; additive inflation is helpful both for EnKF and E3DVar, due to the potential underestimation of the ensemble-based analysis errors.\n\tCoupling between EnKF and 4DVar is next implemented. This coupled scheme (E4DVar) benefits from using the flow-dependent uncertainty provided by EnKF while taking advantage of 4DVar in preventing filter divergence. The 4DVar analysis produces posterior maximum likelihood solutions through minimizing a cost function globally under linear dynamical constraints, about which the ensemble perturbations are transformed, and the resulting ensemble analysis can be propagated forward both for the next assimilation cycle and as a basis for ensemble forecasting. The feasibility and effectiveness of this coupled approach are demonstrated in an conceptual Lorenz (1996) model with simulated observations. The E4DVar outperforms the standalone 4DVar and the EnKF under both perfect- and imperfect-model scenarios. The performance of the E4DVar is also less sensitive to ensemble size and the assimilation window length than EnKF and 4DVar implementations, respectively.\nThe E4DVar scheme is also implemented within the WRF model and again total on the warm season month of June 2003. In E4DVar, the ensemble-based multivariate background error covariance is incorporated into the 4DVar minimization via the alpha control transform, while the ensemble perturbations are updated in EnKF but their mean is replaced by the 4DVar analysis before the next forecast cycle. Therefore, the E4DVar can obtain flow-dependent information both from the explicit covariance matrix derived from ensemble forecasts and also its implicit counterpart modeled by the 4DVar trajectory. The capability of 4DVar in dealing with asynchronous and high-volume observations also makes the E4DVar more flexible and versatile. Based on the month-long statistical results, the E4DVar significantly outperforms the standalone assimilation methods; its 12-h forecast root mean square errors (RMSEs) that are consistently stay at a lower level than the others during the whole time period. The monthly mean results also demonstrate that the E4DVar leads to considerable forecast improvement against traditional data assimilation approaches up to a 60-h range, but becomes comparable to EnKF during the 60-72 h forecasts. The E4DVar is insensitive to tuning coefficients of background error covariance and has the capability to reduce sampling errors, which may make it more flexible for operational use. \n\tFinally, a case study exploring hurricane Katrina (2005) initialization and prediction is performed by 3DVar, 4DVar, EnKF and E4DVar via assimilation of Doppler radar observations into a high-resolution WRF model. The EnKF demonstrates great capability in delivering more accurate forecast at extended forecast-range up to 120 h. It is also shown a clear advantage of using the 4DVar method over the 3DVar both on improving the hurricane track forecast and resolving the dynamical structures. And the E4DVar method that couples the 4DVar and EnKF, is shown as a more robust and flexible data assimilation approach, which is insensitive to the quality of first-guess field. \n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4417], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Meng ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Meng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Meteorology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Fuqing Zhang", "Fuqing Zhang", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux", "Yvette Pamela Richardson", "Xiaolong Zhang", "Chris Snyder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Fuqing Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Fuqing Zhang, Committee Chair", "Eugene Edmund Clothiaux, Committee Member", "Yvette Pamela Richardson, Committee Member", "Xiaolong Zhang, Committee Member", "Chris Snyder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Data assimilation", "EnKF", "4DVar", "Hybrid"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Self-assemblies of Metal Cross-Linked Artificial Oligopeptides Substituted with Hydroxyquinoline Ligands", "id": "23604", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10520", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-10-01T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Nature utilizes self-assembly to create molecular machines that are capable of performing biological processes necessary for life, including information storage and processing, catalysis, and photosynthesis. A molecular machine is constructed by small units that are directed to assemble through non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, metal coordination and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking. Supramolecular chemistry based on metal-ligand coordination has evolved to create highly organized structures via molecular recognition, and the construction of structures is more programmable using biopolymers with repeating units (e.g., nucleic acids and peptides). This dissertation describes the synthesis and characterization of compounds that combine peptide coupling chemistry with metal-ligand coordination chemistry to design metallated oligopeptide self-assemblies. The factors affecting self-assembly of metallated oligopeptides are investigated in this dissertation, leading to more precise geometrical control and site-selectivity for potential application in molecular electronics, photo-induced catalysts, and artificial enzymes.\nArtificial tripeptides containing three pendant ligands, hydroxyquinoline (hq) and/or bipyridine (bpy), were synthesized with three different sequences, hq-hq-hq, hq-bpy-hq and bpy-hq-bpy. Separate reaction of these tripeptides with Zn(II) was quantitatively analyzed, and the formed Zn(II)-linked tripeptide duplex was confirmed by analysis with UV-visible spectroscopy, emission spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. Titrations monitoring formation of the Zn(II) hq tripeptide duplex had an equilibrium constant larger than the monomeric analogue, and a Hill coefficient larger than 1, indicating positive cooperativity. Comparison of the photophysical behaviors of these duplexes indicated sequence-dependent properties. A decrease of emission intensity was observed in Zn tripeptide duplexes containing bpy compared to the hq-hq-hq tripeptide. Electron transfer and/or Dexter energy transfer between metal centers is hypothesized to be the fluorescence quenching mechanism, and is supported by electrochemical, variable-temperature, solvent studies and DFT calculations. \nThe three artificial tripeptides mentioned above have been reacted with Cu(II) to form tripeptide duplexes with three Cu(II) coordinative cross-links. NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and mass spectrometry confirmed the identity of products. The stoichiometry of binding was examined using spectrophotometric absorbance titrations; positive cooperativity was observed during the binding and quantified using the Hill equation. Electron paramagnetic resonance data indicated coupling interactions between Cu(II) centers, and the  Cu-Cu distance was calculated to be ~ 5 \u00c5. A negative shift of the reduction potential of [CuII(bpy)2]2+ was observed in the cyclic voltammograms of [CuII3(hq-bpy-hq)2]2+ and [CuII3(bpy-hq-bpy)2]4+ compared to the Cu(II) bpy monomer duplex. We hypothesize that it is caused by the geometry change in reduced [CuI(bpy)2]+ : in the duplex, the close packing of Cu-ligand layers flatten the tetrahedral geometry of [CuI(bpy)2]+, increasing the energy level of the LUMO of the Cu(II). This hypothesis was supported by spectroelectrochemical experiments and DFT calculations. \nThe stabilities of these three tripeptides and their Zn(II) and Cu (II) duplexes were investigated using pH-dependent and sulfide spectrophotometric titrations, and equilibrium constants were calculated. The stability of tri-metallic complexes is higher compared to the monometallic analogues, confirming that the cooperative formation of multiple metal-ligand linkages results in a higher binding affinity. For the Zn(II) complexes of tripeptides containing bpy ligands, the data suggested that the protonation-induced dissociation is less favored because of the repulsion between protons and positive-charged metal-bpy centers. \nArtificial pentapeptide containing five pendant ligands was synthesized with a sequences hq-bpy-bpy-bpy-hq. The binding selectivities of the pentapeptide and tripeptide hq-bpy-hq with Cu(II) were determined with pH-dependent absorption spectroscopy. The reaction of partially Cu(II)-saturated peptides with Zn(II) was quantitatively analyzed with absorption titration, and the formed Cu(II)Zn(II) cross-linked duplex structures were confirmed by analysis with absorption spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. EPR and DEER data indicated coupling interactions between Cu(II) centers, and the Cu-Cu distance is calculated to be ~ 9 \u00c5 in the Cu(II)Zn(II) cross-linked tripeptide duplex, and ~ 22 \u00c5 in the Cu(II)Zn(II) cross-linked pentapeptide duplex.\nWe have expanded the choice of metal species and incorporated Fe(II), Co(II) and Cu(II) ions into tripeptide hq-bpy-hq to create heterometallic complexes. Spectrophotometric titrations suggested the formation of [Fe(bpy)2]2+ and [Co(bpy)2]2+ in the middle of two Cu(hq)2 centers, instead of the thermodynamically favored [Fe(bpy)3]2+ and [Co(bpy)2]2+ complexes.

Those effects include long-time transient periods due to ultra-low permeability, pressure-dependent permeability and exemplified large capillary pressure. Development of reliable analysis methods to successfully capture these complex effects demands the formulation of new solutions to the governing flow equations which consider these complex nonlinearities. It is the interest of this study to develop more rigorous performance models for these types of systems derived from fundamental governing flow equations. \nThis study presents a series of novel and rigorous semi-analytical solutions to the governing partial differential equations applicable to single-phase gas and multiphase flow in unconventional reservoirs. Focusing on early-transient periods, the proposed semi-analytical method utilizes similarity theory to transform the system of nonlinear PDEs to ordinary differential form, which is later solved via shooting method coupled Runge-Kutta numerical integration. The work starts with early-transient single-phase gas flow in linear and radial flow regimes under constant pressure and rate production conditions, followed by its direct extension to multiphase flow system using the black-oil fluid formulation.

We also demonstrate that the constant rate and constant BHP solutions given by the proposed density-based decline models for gas wells under BDF are interchangeable. We propose a density-based methodology that enables production data analysis of variable BHP/rate gas wells under BDF using density variables and dimensionless viscosity-compressibility ratios. The proposed model uses actual material-balance time and density variables and eliminates the need for the calculation of material balance pseudo-time. Convenient and reliable OGIP calculations are successfully achieved via harmonic decline type-curve or straight-line analysis. A number of field and numerical case studies are presented to showcase the capabilities of the proposed approach. We finally extend the applicability of the rescaled exponential and density-based decline models to high-pressure/high-formation-compressibility gas reservoir systems. We formally derive the density-based analytical techniques rigorously capturing formation compressibility effects during for the analysis of gas well BDF production data. The proposed formulation proves to provide reliable gas rate forecasting for gas well under constant pressure-drop specification and enable accurate calculation of OGIP by incorporating formation compressibility and the change of reservoir pore volume effects applicable to both constant BHP, variable flow-rate/pressure-drop, and constant rate systems.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9249], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Miao ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "first_name_ssi": "Miao", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["decline analysis", "natural gas reservoir", "density-based approach"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Brands all a Twitter: The influences of Twitter on brands and consumers \n", "id": "11297", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4563", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-09-02T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Local, national, and global commercial businesses continue to be increasingly interested in leveraging Twitter to present the brand, manage word-of-mouth communication, and interact with consumers.

This dissertation attempts to fill that gap by providing an in-depth analysis of word-of-mouth communications among consumers and businesses on Twitter and by uncovering Twitter community dynamics from a business perspective. I examined three aspects important to current and prospective business Twitter users, namely benefit (i.e., what can a business get from Twitter?), role (i.e., how active should a business be on Twitter?), and audience (i.e., who connects to a business on Twitter?).\n\nTo address my research questions, I collected approximately 2 million tweets pertaining to nine brands from May, 2008, to May, 2009. I performed bootstrap-based nonparametric analysis of variance to address the benefit question and found that following a brand or being followed by a brand has statistically significant main effect on the number of word-of-mouth messages consumers send out as well as the number of word-of-mouth conversations that consumers participate in with other consumers and the brand. I conducted path analysis to explore questions about a business\u2019 role and discovered that as an active participant in the word-of-mouth dialogue, a business can increase the engagement level of consumers in word-of-mouth communication. I carried out TwoStep cluster analysis to analyze audience makeup and identified five types of consumers in a brand\u2019s immediate social network.\n\nThis dissertation advances the understanding of the potential business value of Twitter deployment and brand management.

The objective was to create a harvester that could improve the feed value of corn silage for dairy cows by increasing the digestibility of both fibrous components and corn kernels and provide more effective fiber from corn silage.  The machine used two pairs of corrugated rolls which turn at different speeds to shred whole-plant corn.  Good particle size reduction was achieved with certain machine configurations; corn stalks were shredded and torn apart, kernels were damaged, and there were no large cobs.  \nMachine power usage and silage particle sizes were recorded for various conditions including combinations of roll speeds, the minimum clearance between the rolls within a pair, and the unit roll forces on the rolls.  Effects of machine configurations on power and energy consumptions were studied on dryer crop in 2000 while more moisture levels and various machine throughputs were examined in 2001.  A flail cutting mechanism was placed behind the shredding rolls during the 2001 testing.  \nAverage specific energy requirement for shredding ranged from 2.5 to 5.9 kW h/Mg DM.  Average specific energy requirements for shredding varied significantly among different roll speed treatments at unit roll force of 15 N/mm (front and rear) but no significant effect of roll speed configuration was found at other unit roll forces.  Minimum roll clearances of 10 mm (front rolls) and 1 mm (rear rolls), along with unit roll forces of 15 N/mm (front) and 45 N/mm (rear) produced more processed material with thinner stalks and shorter pieces than other minimum roll clearance and unit roll force configurations.  \nSamples of treatments and chopped samples were collected to make silage in laboratory scale silos for ensiling evaluation.  The shredded particles ensiled well in lab-scaled silos (approx: 9 kg) with pH values reaching after fermentation 3.8 to 4.1.  There was no significant difference in packed density among different roll speed configurations for 51% moisture content silage.  Silage harvested at 66% moisture content showed significantly higher packed density than silage harvested at 60 and 71% moisture content for both chopped and flail-cut samples.  Particle size distributions of flail-cut samples were similar with moisture of 60 and 66%; however, the 71% moisture crop was coarser.  Shredded samples produced fewer small particles (<8.98 mm) and more large particles (>8.98 mm) than chopped silage; while shredded and flail-cut samples had more small particles and more large particles than chopped samples.\nSystem simulation on dairy farms showed great potential of the novel harvester in increasing milk production and farm profitability.  When shredded corn silage was fed to high producing Holstein cows, milk production was increased up to 2.6% compared to chopping and up to 0.3% compared to kernel processing.  Annual profit increased by $74/cow and $27/cow compared to chopping and kernel processing respectively on the 250-cow farm; the improvement in annual profits were $100/cow over standard chopping and $86/cow over kernel processing for the 100-cow farm.  The simulation results were moderately sensitive to the assumption on silage density but insensitive to machine power requirement.  The simulation results were very sensitive to changes in stover digestibility, fill and roughage factors for large particles.  A great feed would have high stover digestibility, less filling large particles, yet a higher roughage effect.  The shredded silage is a move in this direction.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4528], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Min ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Min", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gregory Wayne Roth", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs", "C Alan Rotz", "Dr Dennis R Buckmaster"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gregory Wayne Roth, Committee Member", "Arlyn Judson Heinrichs, Committee Member", "C Alan Rotz, Committee Member", "Dr Dennis R Buckmaster, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["DAFOSYM.", "roll speed", "kernel processing", "Corn silage", "particle length", "corrugated rolls", "harvester", "roll clearance", "grain digestibility", "dairy cow nutrition", "system simulation", "shredding", "stover digestibility"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "MULTI-CRITERIA SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK DESIGN FOR FRESH PRODUCE", "id": "st74cq441", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12573", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-07-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Due to the numerous waste and disposal of food products and the high storage and transportation cost, the fresh produce market has a low profit margin.

First, a new nucleation model for carbon nanotubes is proposed.\nDetailed atomistic simulations indicate that this model agrees in several\naspects with experimental observations. The new\nmodel does not resort to the formation of energetically unfavorable\npentagonal rings, as other nucleation models do, to produce the required\ncurvature for a nanotube nucleus. Second, plastic deformation of carbon\nnanotube under high tensile stress is studied using a tight-binding total\nenergy model. The elastic limits of carbon nanotubes are found to be\nhigher than any other known materials and very sensitive to the so-called\nwrapping angle of nanotubes.

Understanding wave dynamics is very important and helpful to reveal physical principles. In this dissertation I consider three kinds of equations: Camassa-Holm equation, variational wave equation, and p-system. Camassa-Holm equation is an approximate model for the shallow water phenonmenon. Variational wave equation is derived from a physical model of liquid crystal, and p-system is for one-dimensional compressible gas dynamics. I mainly care about the analytical properties of weak solutions to these equations.\nIn the first project, I proved the uniqueness of conservative weak solutions for the (two-component) Camassa- Holm equations and variational wave equation by the method of characteristics. They all have H1 energy, so the characteristic equations have H \u0308older continuous right-hand-side. In general, the ODEs with Ho \u0308lder continuous right-hand-side do not have unique solutions. We resolve this difficulty by using an additional balance law, related to energy, which is a change of coordinate based on the fact of energy concentration. And we proved uniqueness by rewriting the quasilinear PDE into a equivalent semilinear system with Lipschitz continuous right-hand- side. The main difference for the variational wave equation is that it is a second-order equation. It has two families of waves and they may interact with each other. We show that the total amount of interaction is bounded on bounded time intervals. Then by carefully choosing new characteristic variables, we can reduce the PDE to an equivalent first-order semilinear system with Lipschitz right-hand-side. In this way, we obtain uniqueness of conservative weak solutions.\nI also proved the global well-posedness of cubic Camassa-Holm equation.\nIn the second project, we studied the generic singular behavior of these two equations. Here the \u2018generic behavior\u2019 refers to the properties which are true for all solutions starting from an open dense set of initial data.In particular, we showed that a generic solution is piecewise smooth. The proof mainly relies on Thom\u2019s transversality Lemma from differential geometry. We also calculated the detailed local asymptotic expansion of solutions near the singular points and found that the Camassa-Holm equation and the two-component Camassa-Holm equation produce\nvery different types of singularities.\nIn the third project, we studied solutions to one-dimensional conservation laws\nwith large BV data. Specially, we considered the p-system, modeling the isentropic gas dynamics. We consider two cases: when the density is uniformly away from zero and when the density may approach zero.

Subsequently, the activated CTL population undergoes activation induced cell death (AICD), resulting in final stabilization of a small antigen-experienced CTL population. This coupling of CTL activation and AICD ensures the delicate CTL homeostasis. However, the rapid clearance of activated CTL curbs the usage of CTL in anti-virus and anti-cancer therapies. \nWe explored factors that contribute to the long-term survival of CTL and their efficacies in cancer therapies using two model systems. First, we studied the potential regulators of human CTL survival in the context of a rare leukemia, T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia. T-LGL leukemia features a clonal expansion of antigen-primed, competent CTL. In order to understand the pathogenesis of T-LGL leukemia and key mediators that determine CTL survival, we constructed a signaling network with special interests in two known deregulated pathways in T-LGL leukemia: Ras pathway and Fas/FasL pathway. Surprisingly, we found that all known deregulations in T-LGL leukemia can be connected in a single signaling network. Subsequent network simplification revealed that most of the deregulated components were connected in the CTL activation-AICD signaling process.\nTo understand the survival mechanisms of leukemic T-LGL in the context of CTL activation-AICD, we constructed a T-LGL survival signaling network by integrating the signaling pathways involved in normal CTL activation and the known deregulations of survival signaling in leukemic T-LGL. This network was subsequently translated into a predictive discrete dynamic model. Our model suggests that the persistence of interleukin (IL)-15 and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) is sufficient to reproduce all known deregulations in leukemic T-LGL. This finding leads to the following predictions: 1) Inhibiting PDGF signaling induces apoptosis in leukemic T-LGL. 2) Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF&#954;B) are essential for the long-term survival of CTL in T-LGL leukemia. 3) NF&#954;B functions downstream of phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) and prevents apoptosis through maintaining the expression of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl-1). 4) T-box expressed in T-cells (T-bet) should be constitutively activated concurrently with NF&#954;B activation to reproduce the leukemic T-LGL phenotype. We validated these predictions experimentally. Our study provides the first model describing the signaling networks involved in maintaining the long term survival of competent CTL in human.\nIn the second model system, we studied the potential relationships between recognition of tumor-associated antigen (TAA), survival of tumor-specific CTL, and efficacy of tumor immunotherapy through modeling the immune responses against simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (Tag) in mice. Tag is a potent virus-encoded oncoprotein that can transform a variety of cell types. Transgenic mice expressing Tag under different promoters autonomously develop various tumors. Furthermore, Tag is capable to mount MHC I-restricted CTL activity similar to TAA. Tag can be processed into four different epitopes, which ignite CTL with different survival behaviors and tumor control activities. We integrated CTL response data obtained from both wild type mice and Tag-transgenic mice tumor models (including pancreatic cancer, osteosarcoma and choroid plexus tumor) into a unifying mathematical model. This model reproduced most of experimental observations. Our model predicted that prolonged survival rather than increased proliferation contributed to the different immune responses of CTL specific for different epitopes. We experimentally validated this prediction. This study offers a novel strategy though which different CTL parameters and their effects on successful cancer immunotherapy can be quantitatively analyzed in silico. \nTaken together, these studies initiated our understanding of CTL long-term survival and its application in cancer immunotherapy at a systematic level. This knowledge is important not only for identifying therapeutic targets of rare hematological disorders involving mature CTL, but also for generating long-lived CTL necessary for virus and tumor vaccine development.

Invasion can also interact with other elements of global change, such as human-mediated disturbances and climate change. Therefore, understanding the responses of invasive species to disturbance and climate change is crucial both for predicting future invasion risks, and in order to develop appropriate management strategies for the future. Using both experimental and theoretical approaches, I examined invasions of two congeneric thistles, Carduus nutans and C. acanthoides in the context of disturbance and climate change. I aimed to assess the invasion potential of these two species under different disturbance regimes (specifically, different levels of intensity, frequency, and timing of mowing) and under projected climates for the future (specifically, increased temperature and increased precipitation).\nMy disturbance results underline the importance of considering multiple aspects of disturbance in invasion studies, as interactions and interdependence of these aspects may lead to complex outcomes and potentially counter-intuitive conclusions (Chapter 2). Based on these empirical data, I demonstrate that the choice of management strategy may also depend on the time horizon of the management objective (Chapter 3). Strong tolerance of the two species to disturbance (i.e. regrowth ability after damage) is likely to contribute to their success in disturbed areas (Chapter 4). The two species also showed positive responses to climate change (Chapter 5). Besides enhanced demographic vital rates, dispersal of Carduus spp. was also enhanced under warming, mainly due to increased plant height. Consequently, population spread rates are expected to increase under future climatic scenarios. Phenology was affected by warming as well, altering both individual phenological dates, and durations of each developmental stage (Chapter 6). Uneven shifts in the phenological sequence of C. nutans led to extended growing duration, which contributed to increased plant height at the dispersing stage. However, increased height of C. acanthoides appeared to be due to faster growth rates under warming. Furthermore, I found that for C. nutans, plant structural defense (i.e. prickle density) was reduced under warming (Chapter 7) and maternal warming significantly affected germination and seedling emergence of the offspring (Chapter 8). Results from this thesis suggest that invasions of Carduus spp. are likely to increase both in local abundance and spatial spread to become more problematic with ongoing global change. \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5359], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Rui ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Rui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Katriona Shea", "Katriona Shea", "Eric S Post", "Ottar N Bjornstad", "David A Mortensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Katriona Shea, Dissertation Advisor", "Katriona Shea, Committee Member", "Eric S Post, Committee Chair", "Ottar N Bjornstad, Committee Member", "David A Mortensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Carduus acanthoides", "biological invasion", "climate change", "warming", "disturbance", "Carduus nutans"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF SOLID-STATE SINTERING OF METAL POWDER COMPACT DOMINATED BY GRAIN BOUNDARY DIFFUSION", "id": "6871", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5430", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-10-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The research effort is oriented towards the modeling of metal powder sintering to accurately predict the densification and distortion of a sintered part, which is mainly due to the differential shrinkage of a green compact. This research focuses on the study of the simulation of the sintering process that is dominated by grain boundary diffusion, which is recognized as one of the dominating sintering mechanisms. Specifically, a viscoelasticity model that accounts for the microstructural grain growth has been developed to simulate the thermal induced creep deformation in sintering. Sintering stress is treated as an equivalent hydrostatic pressure that links the microscale evolution to the macroscale deformation. To support that linkage, a grain boundary counting procedure has been modified to quantify the grain size distribution. The material resistance of viscous flow is included in the model as a thermally activated process using an Arrhenius-type temperature relation to represent the apparent viscosity. \nThe finite element method is used to implement the simulation. Results of the compaction simulation such as shape change, residual stress and density distribution data are transferred into the sintering simulation as initial conditions. Since no extra heat source is generated during sintering, the thermal analysis is independent of the creep analysis so that an uncoupled heat transfer analysis yields time-dependent temperature fields that are used to drive the sintering simulation. The simulation is performed in ABAQUS, and an in-house FEM code (SinSolver) is used as a supporting tool and verification.\nStainless steel 316L is chosen in this research due to its wide range of industrial applications and representative sintering mechanisms.

Yield losses up to 40% occur in some years. Plant protection by fungicide application is possible but planting a disease resistant cultivar would be preferable. A diploid hybrid family of 219 clones from Solanum phureja \u201ee Solanum stenotomum was evaluated for EB resistance over three years in Pennsylvania. Disease severity was assessed for each clone throughout the development of the epidemic and area under disease progress curves (AUDPC) were calculated. There were significant differences among the clones for AUDPC. Resistance to EB appears to be inherited quantitatively based on the distribution of AUDPC values. Broad-sense heritability of EB resistance in this family was estimated as 0.77 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.71 to 0.82. There were significant clone \u201ee year interactions. Further partitioning of the clone \u201ee year interaction revealed that 75 clones made significant contributions to this interaction, and therefore, their resistance to EB was not stable. In this family, a negative correlation (r \u0192\u00ad \u00a1V0.448, p\u0192\u00ac 0.0001) was observed between mean AUDPC and earliness in maturity, indicating that plant maturity explained about 20% of the variation in disease reaction. However, some clones were identified with considerable EB resistance and early or mid-season maturity, suggesting that resistance from the parental clones might be useful for breeding early-maturing as well as EB resistant cultivars. This partial resistance has been genetically characterized by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Fluorescence-based, semi-automated amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker techniques were used to generate a genetic map. 170 AFLP and 47 SSR polymorphic markers were developed and analyzed for this full-sib family and 15 linkage groups were identified. Thirty eight of common AFLP markers and 44 of SSR markers were used to anchor 12 of the 15 linkage groups to 12 potato chromosomes. The markers covered 925 centiMorgan (cM) of genome with an average distance of 4.5 cM between adjacent markers, and less than 15% of the genome lies more than 20 cM from the nearest marker. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for partial resistance to EB and for foliage maturity were mapped using the \"Multiple-QTL models\" (MQM) method with putative QTL markers from interval mapping as cofactors. Five QTLs on chromosome IV, V, IX, XI and XII were identified for EB resistance that collectively explained 62.2% of the total phenotypic variation. Three QTLs on chromosome IV, V and VI were identified for foliage maturity that collectively explained 97.5% of the total phenotypic variation. Two QTLs for EB resistance and foliage maturity on chromosome IV and V were mapped in the same or closely linked regions. The other three QTLs for EB resistance on chromosome IX, XI and XII, which accounted for 33.1% of the total phenotypic variation and were not linked to foliage maturity, have the potential to improve EB resistance using marker-assisted selection (MAS) in a breeding program.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5422], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Ruofang ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ruofang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Jane Christ", "John Ayers", "John Edward Carlson", "Frederick Eugene Gildow Jr.", "Seogchan Kang", "Kathleen Haynes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Jane Christ, Committee Chair", "John Ayers, Committee Member", "John Edward Carlson, Committee Member", "Frederick Eugene Gildow Jr., Committee Member", "Seogchan Kang, Committee Member", "Kathleen Haynes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Potato", "Early blight", "Resistance", "QTL mapping"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "cost-effectiveness of health care interventions", "id": "26233", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11665", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Over the past decade, cost-effectiveness analysis has increasingly gained popularity as a means to determine the allocation of scarce health resources. It is a tool that assesses the tradeoff between consumed resources and achieved health outcomes. The results provide information that help decision makers determine which policy best serves their programmatic and financial needs. In this dissertation, three examples that fall under the cost-effectiveness framework are modeled and addressed in details. The first example is to determine an optimal breast cancer screening policy in the presence of overdiagnosis. We examine the impact of overdiagnosis on quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and the expected number of mammograms.  We find screening intervals that range from 2 to 3 years outperform the current recommendations of annual screening. The second example is a cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for chronic hepatitis CHC. A series of new drugs recently approved for the treatment CHC are characterized with high cure rates.  However, there are corresponding high prices. Cost-effectiveness of these new treatments is determined in comparison with standard care regimens, based on which usage suggestions are provided. The third example is to reduce congestion issues of intensive care units (ICUs). Due to limited resources, it is critical to rationalize the use of medical units and maximize throughput from a cost-effective perspective. In this study, we assume that ICU patients in a less severe critical condition can be stepped down early and designated to lower level care units so that beds can be vacated to accommodate new arrivals. Optimal stepdown policies under different scenarios are analyzed and discussed.  We find that reserving capacity in the ICU can improve overall system performance.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11154], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Sai ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Sai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Griffin", "Guodong Pang", "Vittaldas V Prabhu", "Zhibiao Zhao"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Griffin, Dissertation Advisor", "Guodong Pang, Committee Member", "Vittaldas V Prabhu, Committee Member", "Zhibiao Zhao, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["health care", "cost-effectiveness", "breast cancer", "sofosbuvir"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Oral Cancer Induced by The Tobacco Carcinogen Dibenzo[a,l]pyrene in Mice", "id": "18930", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9094", "abstract_tesi": "Oral cancer is the most common type of head and neck cancer, which is the sixth most common cancer worldwide.  More than 90% of oral cancers are a type called oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Tobacco use is the most important risk factor. Chronic and/or heavy use of alcohol is another major risk factor. Early detection and prevention of oral cancer is very pivotal. Progress in the prevention and control of oral cancer has been hampered by the lack of appropriate animal models that could reflect human exposure. Therefore, experimental animal models that can accurately represent the cellular and molecular changes associated with the initiation and progression of human oral cancer are of crucial importance to better understand the mechanisms of oral carcinogenesis and to identify novel chemopreventive, as well as chemotherapeutic agents. We recently developed a novel mouse model to study oral carcinogenesis. We showed for the first time that direct application of DB[a,l]P into the oral cavity, induced SCC in oral tissues; (\u00b1)-anti-DB[a,l]PDE-diol epoxide, the ultimate metabolite of DB[a,l]P,  is a remarkably potent carcinogen in the oral cavity (both oral tissues and tongue). The mechanisms that can account for oral cancer-induced by this tobacco carcinogen are the focus of this dissertation. Our working hypothesis is that both genetic and epigenetic alterations induced by DB[a,l]P can contribute to the development of oral cancer. \nTo test our hypothesis, we focused initially on assessing the effect of this carcinogen on genetic alterations. We have developed a new stable isotope dilution HPLC-MS/MS method to identify and quantify DB[a,l]PDE-dA and -dG adducts in oral tissue of mice. Our method is sensitive enough to detect DNA adducts in vivo.  We detected (-)-anti-cis- and (-)-anti-trans-DB[a,l]PDE-N6-dA and (-)-anti-cis- and (-)-anti-trans-DB[a,l]PDE-N2-dG adducts in oral and tongue tissues of mice treated with DB[a,l]P; the results indicate that the levels of dA adducts are significantly higher than dG adducts and that DB[a,l]P is predominantly metabolized to (-)-anti-DB[a,l]PDE.   \nUsing immunohistochemistry (IHC), we have shown over-expression of p53 and COX-2 protein in OSCC and dysplastic tissues induced by DB[a,l]P and DB[a,l]PDE in mice. P53 protein overexpression detected by IHC may result from p53 gene mutation or exposure to genotoxic stress. To determine whether p53 over-expression is, in part, due to p53 mutations, Exons 5 to 8 of p53 from representative tumor tissues, were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction single-strand conformation polymorphisms (PCR-SSCP) and direct sequencing. G:C\u2192T:A transversion was detected in Exon 5, leading to mutation of codon 155 Arg to Leu;  A:T \u2192 T:A transversion was detected in Exon 7, resulting in mutation of codon 232 Lys to stop codon. \nTo further test our hypothesis, we examined the epigenetic effect of DB[a,l]P exposure. Methylation specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing were used to examine  methylation alteration of p16 and RAR-\u03b2 promoters. Promoter hypermethylation of both p16 and RAR-\u03b2 was detected in OSCC induced by DB[a,l]PDE; also in oral tissues of mice treated with DB[a,l]P at early stage, prior to the appearance of detectable tumors. \nEmploying our newly developed LC-MS/MS method, we tested the effect of alcohol on genetic damage-induced by DB[a,l]P in the oral cavity of mice. Our working hypothesis is that alcohol may deplete GSH in the oral cavity and in turn may increase the levels of the DB[a,l]PDE, that can enhance levels of genetic damage. The results support our hypothesis and indicate that alcohol can enhance DNA adduct formation induced by DB[a,l]P, through depletion of GSH.  \nEven with recent advances  in targeted therapies, it is still challenging to treat cancer including OSCC at late stage. The ultimate goal of cancer prevention is to reverse or prevent the development and progression of early stage disease before it becomes aggressive. Using our LC-MS/MS method, we tested the hypothesis that naturally-occuring agents that can alter the levels of phase I/ phase II enzymes in a manner that can reduce the formation of the active electrophilic metabolites derived from DB[a,l]P, will reduce the levels of DNA damage. Diets rich in fruits and vegetables can contribute to a lower risk of developing oral cancer. Resveratrol is a polyphenol present in grapes and berries. Kaempferol is a flavonoid found in tea, broccoli, grapefruit, berries and other plant sources. Both Resveratrol and kaemferol have been shown to inhibit the enzymatic activities of some phases I drug metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and CYP1A2, which are known to activate DB[a,l]P to its ultimate carcinogenic forms that can damage DNA. We have tested the chemopreventive potential of 5% Black Resberry, 0.025% of Kaempferol and 0.002% Resveratrol in our mouse oral cancer model. Our results indicated that these agents can inhibit DB[a,l]P-DNA adduct formation, and thus further studies in our laboratory will examine the chemopreventive efficacy of these agents against the development of oral cancer in our newly developed animal model.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8920], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Shang-min ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shang-min", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Karam E El Bayoumy", "Kristin Ann Eckert", "John Peter Richie Jr.", "Thomas E Spratt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Karam E El Bayoumy, Dissertation Advisor", "Kristin Ann Eckert, Committee Member", "John Peter Richie Jr., Committee Member", "Thomas E Spratt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Oral Cancer", "Tobacco Carcinogen", "DB[a", "l]P", "DNA adducts", "LC-MS/MS", "p53 mutations", "epigenetics", "alcohol", "chemoprevention"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Babel or Great Wall: Social Media Use in an Acculturation Context", "id": "15280", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7684", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The era of globalization is marked by communications penetrating national or cultural boundaries in all sorts of areas. Unprecedented levels of mobilization or migration, and the boom of information communication technologies (ICTs) such as social media, which free people from the limitations of space and time, have been two highly salient features that are rapidly and irrevocably changing the world. They brought many new opportunities for learning and exchange as well as social problems and challenges.\n\nIn the dissertation, I explored social media use in an acculturation context: Chinese students living in the United States. From an interview study of 20 participants, I collected 329 social media use activities. Based on these activities and existing use and gratification theories I developed a two-layer coding system of social media use, which evolved as the interview study went on. Furthermore, I explored these social media uses for acculturation processes. I identified two kinds of acculturation strategies: the Babel strategy, which refers to American identification efforts to get assimilated into new culture, and the Great Wall strategy, which refers to Chinese identification efforts to maintain their original self. I found that while social media helped students adapt to new culture through the uses such as maintaining weak tie and information surveillance, students extensively used Chinese social media to maintain their original self, through uses such as social bonding and social participation.\n\nBased on a questionnaire study of 253 Chinese students in America, I compared the use patterns among four kinds of social media: American SNS (e.g. Facebook), Chinese SNS (e.g. Renren), American microblogs (e.g. Twitter), and Chinese microblogs (e.g. Weibo). I further conducted a SEM model to explore how social media use would help cope with culture shock through different acculturation strategies: American identification, Chinese identification, and bicultural identity integration. \n\nThis study expands existing HCI work on inter-cultural communication and collaboration activities toward consideration of acculturation strategies, online support for identity, and designing for individual development.

In order to investigate the local accommodation of frustration, our group developed artificial frustrated arrays consisting of lithographically fabricated single-domain nanomagnets. These arrays are arranged in different geometries and lattice constants, allowing us to control the symmetry and strength of the magnetostatic interactions. Several geometries have been studied: a square lattice, which shows ice-like, short-range correlations analogous to the spin ice materials; a hexagonal (kagome) lattice, which shows large degenerate ground states and monopole-like elementary excitations; and a triangular lattice, in which we found that indirect interactions and those mediated by further neighbors can be tuned to be dominant over direct interactions. We have also studied frustrated arrays comprised of nanomagnets with magnetic moments perpendicular to the substrate plane. These perpendicular arrays exhibit striking similarity to their in-plane counterparts, indicating a universality in artificial frustrated systems independent of material realization or moment orientations.

In industry, primary Al is produced by the Hall-H\u00a8\u00a6roult process, through the electrolysis of the mixture of molten alumina and cryolite (Al2O3+Na3AlF6), the latter being added to lower the melting point. Therefore, Al inevitably contains some Na (>0.002%) without further treatment. The Na content in Al is influenced by the thermodynamics and kinetics of the electrolysis. Similarly, in the electrolytic production and subsequent processing of Mg, Mg is commonly in contact with molten salt mixtures of NaCl and MgCl2. Consequently, 2-20 wt. ppm Na is often found in Mg alloys. Besides originating from the industrial production process, Na can be introduced in laboratory experiments from alumina crucibles by the reaction between the molten Al-Mg alloys and the Na2O impurity in the alumina crucible. \n\n\tThe trace element K plays a similar role in Al alloys although it is seldom discussed.\n\n\tNo systematic theoretic research has been carried out to investigate the behavior of these impurities during the processing of aluminum alloys. The thermodynamic description of the Al-Ca-K-Li-Mg-Na system is needed to understand the effects of Ca, K, Li and Na on phase stability of aluminum and magnesium alloys.\n\n\tAs the first step of the thermodynamic description of the high-order system, the constitutive-binary systems were modeled in the present work using the CALPHAD technique combined with first-principles calculations. Then, ternaries and higher order systems can be modeled. For ternary systems without experimental data, the thermodynamic description is extrapolated by combining three constitutive-binary systems.\n\n\tAlkali-metal induced high temperature embrittlement (HTE) and loss of ductility were investigated in Al-Li, Al-Mg and Mg-Li alloys. It was discovered that the alkali-metal-rich liquid-2 phase is the cause of HTE and the loss of ductility is proportional to the mole fraction of the liquid phase and the grain size. The calculated results are consistent with experimental observations in the literature and were used to determine HTE safe and sensitive zones, maximum and critical hot-rolling temperatures and the maximum allowable Na content in alloys, which can be used to industrial processing of Al and Mg alloys.\n\n\tThe degree of HTE is proportional to the mole fraction of the liquid-2 phase and the grain size.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6032, 6033], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Shengjun ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shengjun", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu", "Long Qing Chen", "Earle Richard Ryba", "Robert Carl Voigt"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zi Kui Liu, Committee Chair", "Long Qing Chen, Committee Member", "Earle Richard Ryba, Committee Member", "Robert Carl Voigt, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mg alloys", "High temperature embrittlement", "alkali metal impurities", "Al alloys", "first-principles", "Thermodynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Virtualization-based Security Analysis of Production Server Systems", "id": "16158", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7183", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-07-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Production server systems are critical resources in the era of network-centric warfare. With the rapid prevalence of E-Commerce, on-line gaming, social networking, logistics, and Cloud Computing, the demand on service continuity and availability is increasingly crucial to production servers or data centres. Any downtime or malfunction caused by vulnerability exploitation leads to productivity and profit loss. For instance, drivers (accounting for more than half of most commodity operating system kernels),\nespecially third party drivers, could contain malicious code (e.g., logic bombs) and/or carefully designed-in vulnerabilities. Once got executed/exploited, such compromised\ndrivers render the attackers the opportunity of leveraging drivers\u2019 privilege to interrupt the intend-to-guard services. Hence, production server systems need undergo comprehensive\nsecurity analysis to be sufficiently resistant to attacks to guarantee continuous service and correct execution.\n\nIn this dissertation, I propose a set of automatic security analysis mechanisms\nto help commodity systems to be resilient to vulnerability exploitation. These mechanisms finally help server systems automatically preserve service continuity and correct execution upon vulnerability exploitation. Specifically, an intrusion harm analysis system has been built to comprehensively evaluate the damage caused by attacks to the production server systems. It allows \u201cimperfect\u201d or vulnerable software to be deployed in trustworthy enterprise production environment. By providing automatic checkpointing and intrusion analysis however, the protected systems can obtain precise knowledge of the damage that has been caused, which would enable the systems to do appropriate\navailability-integrity tradeoff in generating the recovery plan. As the significant increase of vulnerable drivers, a trustworthiness assessment of third party drivers is also proposed against kernel integrity manipulation, confidentiality tampering, and resource\nabuse. Then, only the outweighing drivers can be deployed in trustworthy production environment with the proposed operate-through system preserving the states of critical service applications against vulnerability exploitation.\n\nFirst, I propose PEDA (Production Environment Damage Analysis) system to\ncomprehensively analyze the harm of intrusion to production servers, by decoupling the onerous analysis work from the on-line execution. Once the system being compromised, the \u201chas-been-infected\u201d execution is analyzed during high fidelity replay on a separate\ninstrumentation platform. The replay is implemented based on the heterogeneous virtual machine migration. The servers\u2019 on-line execution runs atop fast hardware-assisted virtual machines (such as Xen for near native speed execution), while the infected execution is replayed atop binary instrumentation virtual machines (such as QEMU for instrumentation platform). From identified intrusion symptoms, PEDA is capable of locating the fine-grained taint seed by integrating the backward system call dependency tracking and\none-step-forward taint information flow auditing. Started with the fine-grained taint seed, PEDA applies dynamic taint analysis during the replayed execution to provide the most fine-grained intrusion harm analysis.\n\nSecond, I present a novel driver evaluation approach, Heter-device, to fully analyze drivers\u2019 trustworthiness before putting any trust on them. Heter-device relies on virtual platforms to emulate heterogeneous device (Heter-device) pairs (e.g., Intel 82540EM NIC and Realtek RTL8139) for guest operating system replicas. Each replica loads heterogeneous drivers corresponding to the devices it runs on. Heter-device approach stands on the assumption that heterogeneous drivers should not have the same exploitable vulnerability due to their separate developing procedures. Thus they provide an implicit and complete reference model for each other when trustworthiness assessment is conducted via fine-grained auditing. By deploying Heter-device as a high-interaction honeypot with the synchronization points and monitoring \u201csensors\u201d, I can closely compare the divergence of two replicas when the vulnerable driver is being compromised. Hence, multiple attack vectors of compromised drivers, including kernel integrity manipulation, resource abuse, and confidentiality tampering can be faithfully revealed.\n\nLast, I present DRASP (Diverse Replica based Application State Preserving), a\nmechanism that leverages Heter-device architecture to help protected systems operate-through vulnerability exploitation. Once the proposed virtualized device diversity is deployed, the system replicas need to load different drivers as loadable kernel modules for the diverse devices. Again, the idea is that different drivers should have different vulnerabilities, in terms of the location or the details of the vulnerability. Hence, one driver vulnerability exploitation can at most succeed in one replica, with the other replica surviving. Once the successful exploitation tampers the applications\u2019 code/data or compromises the applications\u2019 metadata for commercial benefits, it can be detected through\nthe proposed response or state validation. Afterwards, the application on the survival replica can immediately take over the workload to preserve the service continuity and accumulated state, while ensuring the correct execution.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7168], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Shengzhi ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shengzhi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peng Liu", "Sencun Zhu", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Dr Soundar Kumara"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peng Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar, Committee Member", "Dr Soundar Kumara, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Virtualization", "security analysis", "driver diversity", "heterogeneous virtual machine migration", "availability preserving"]}, {"year_isi": 2003, "title_ssi": "BROADBAND DIELECTRIC STUDY OF MISCIBLE POLYMER BLENDS WITH INTERMOLECULAR HYDROGEN BONDING", "id": "6162", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5754", "defended_at_dtsi": "2003-09-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The dynamics of miscible polymer blends with large differences in the components\u2019 Tgs and with strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding were studied using, principally, broadband dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. The role of intermolecular hydrogen bonding on segmental dynamics was identified by comparing the present results with those from blends with similar chemical structures but without strong intermolecular interactions. It was found that hydrogen bonding is able to damp concentration fluctuations, which is demonstrated by the composition-insensitive segmental relaxation time distribution observed in blends with appropriate compositions. \nIntermolecular hydrogen bonding is also capable of coupling components\u2019 segmental relaxations in blends with very large Tg difference, that would otherwise exhibit two segmental relaxation processes in the absence of strong intermolecular interactions. However, the coupling behavior is composition dependent and maximal coupling, resulting in a single segmental process, can only be achieved in blends dominated by inter-component interactions. Dynamic heterogeneity still exists in blends controlled by intramolecular interactions or with insufficient intermolecular hydrogen bonding. By comparing the dynamics of blends with various Tg differences, hydrogen bonding strengths and fractions, it was found that smaller dynamic asymmetry and stronger intermolecular interactions promote finer dynamic homogeneity. Whereas the above efforts are focused on the enthalpic contribution, increasing combinatorial entropy can also lead to dynamic homogeneity, as observed in polymer solutions with low molecular weight model compounds. \nThe local relaxation of the hydrogen-bonded side groups, on the other hand, can either remain unchanged, be retarded, or suppressed, depending on the interaction strength and the mechanism of the relaxation itself.\nFinally, the influence of hydrostatic pressure on segmental dynamics was also studied on a selected blend, and it was found that elevated pressure lead to reduced dynamic heterogeneity due to the additional mobility gained by the hydrogen-bonded segments compared with the unassociated ones.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5750], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Shihai ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Shihai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt", "Paul C Painter", "Ralph H Colby", "Qiming Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["James Patrick Runt, Committee Chair", "Paul C Painter, Committee Member", "Ralph H Colby, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["broadband dielectric spectroscopy", "miscible polymer blends", "hydrogen bonding", "segmental relaxation", "secondary relaxation", "dynamic heterogeneity", "concentration fluctuations", "glass transition temperature", "high pressure"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Exploring the metabolic diversity of cyanobacteria for green energy production", "id": "26269", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11404", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-04-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Cyanobacteria absorb and convert sunlight into chemical potential energy by oxygenic photosynthesis. The energy-rich compounds stored during the day provide the fuel to support growth and maintenance energy production at night. In the presence of oxygen, respiration occurs in most organisms, which allows the oxidation of energy-rich substrates for the production of proton-motive force for ATP synthesis and other biochemical work. This dissertation research focused on elucidating metabolic diversities and capacities in cyanobacteria, some of which have potential applications toward green energy and biomaterial production based on these newly defined metabolic pathways.\nTogether with glycolysis and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is one of the three most important pathways of central carbohydrate metabolism. It was long believed that cyanobacteria had an incomplete TCA cycle due to the absence of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH). Studies from this dissertation demonstrated that the TCA cycle in most cyanobacteria is completed in manner distinct from the classical TCA cycle through the action of two alternative enzymes, 2-oxoglutarate decarboxylase (2-OGDC) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). Some preliminary studies were also performed in metabolic engineering this newly discovered TCA cycle to produce poly-3-hydroxybutyrate and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-4-hydroxybutyrate from the newly identified intermediate, succinic semialdehyde.\nThough some previous studies of cyanobacteria reported enzyme activities of the glyoxylate cycle (i.e. isocitrate lyase and malate synthase), recent experimental studies found that these two enzymes are not detectable in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In this study, genes encoding isocitrate lyase and malate synthase from Chlorogloeopsis fritschii PCC 9212 were\niiiiv identified and characterized. Furthermore, when the two genes encoding isocitrate lyase and\nmalate synthase were expressed in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, the resulting strain was able to assimilate acetate at a higher rate than the wild type strain. Overall, this study demonstrated that the glyoxylate cycle exists in certain cyanobacterial strains, that it plays an essential role in the assimilation of C2 carbon sources (i.e., acetate) for growth, and that it may also be involved in balancing carbon and nitrogen metabolism.\nThe biogenesis of thylakoid membranes in cyanobacteria was also investigated in this study. Previous studies in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 reported that vipp1 (sll0617) was essential fro viability. By constructing a fully segregated null mutant in vipp1 (SynPCC7002_A0294) in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, we show that Vipp1 is not essential. Thylakoid membranes were still observed in vipp1 mutant cells and resembled those in a psaAB mutant that completely lacks photosystem (PS) I. When the vipp1 mutation was complemented with the orthologous vipp1 gene from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that was expressed from the strong PcpcBA promoter, PS I content and activities were restored to normal levels, and cells again produced thylakoids that were indistinguishable from those of wild type. This study shows that thylakoids are still produced in the absence of Vipp1 and that normal thylakoid biogenesis in Synechococcus sp.

At that time, the researchers noticed the diverging exponential increase in the performance of processor and main memory and thus claimed that the main memory would eventually become the bottleneck of the entire computing system. Furthermore, benefiting from the semiconductor process scaling, the number of transistors in a single chip keeps growing up. As a result, the processor enters multi-/many-core era and the instruction level parallelism (ILP) and thread level parallelism (TLP) have been extensively exploited. The improved parallelism requires the memory to provide low latency, high bandwidth and low power consumption. Unfortunately, as the de facto main memory technology, the evolution of DRAM is relatively slow due to the poor scalability and the extremely high sensitivity of design cost (cost per bit). To this end, we are hitting the \u201cMemory Wall\u201d.\nTo break the memory wall, enormous research work has been proposed to optimize the DRAM architecture so that a better trade-off among performance, power and area overhead can be achieved. Some of the previous proposals, however, are difficult to be implemented because of either the unaffordable design overhead or the unacceptable performance degradation. Moreover, certain new issues have shown up along with the evolution of DRAM. For example, the performance impact of refresh cannot be ignored anymore as it can significantly degrades the DRAM performance. The power consumption of DRAM is also critical as up to 40% power is consumed by the DRAM modules, which are massively populated in the data centers. Therefore, in the DRAM realm it still needs lots of research efforts to make sure DRAM can win the war against the \u201cMemory Wall\u201d. This is the motivation of this dissertation.\nIn this dissertation, the author proposes several novel DRAM architectures, which aims at a better trade-off among DRAM performance, power, and design overhead. Both traditional DRAM technologies and the emerging 3D-stacked DRAMs are covered in this work. To relieve the refresh penalty in the commodity DRAM, a concurrent refresh aware memory (CREAM) is proposed. CREAM allows refresh and memory access to be issued in parallel. On the other hand, a new precharge policy, Lazy Precharge, is introduced to minimize the precharge overhead. By leveraging the Lazy Precharge, multiple activations can share a precharge so that the number of precharge can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, Half-DRAM is proposed to achieve power reduction and performance improvement simultaneously. In Half-DRAM, a bank is redesigned so that it is able to activate only half of a row to reduce the activation and precharge power. In this way, Half-DRAM can easily eliminate the power constraints and thus unleash the performance. Meanwhile, two half-rows can be accessed in parallel to further improve the performance once the sub-array level parallelism is deployed. In addition to the traditional 2D DRAM, a novel 3D Wide IO DRAM architecture is proposed to increase the DRAM parallelism in Wide IO. To take advantage of the increasing wiring resource in the vertical dimension, a bank is further split into multiple sub-banks. Each sub-bank can provide the full cacheline. On the other hand, a 3D SoC chip has been taped out to demonstrate the feasibility of 3D-stacked DRAM. In the chip, a 3D-stacked DRAM directly stacks on a two-layer logic chip. The experimental results show that the proposed optimizations can either effectively improve DRAM performance or significantly reduce DRAM power with negligible area overhead.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9542], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Tao ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Yuan Xie", "Yuan Xie", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Zhiwen Liu", "Raj Acharya"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Yuan Xie, Dissertation Advisor", "Yuan Xie, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Raj Acharya, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["DRAM", "Memory Wall", "3D-stacked DRAM", "Wide IO", "Activation", "Precharge", "Refresh", "Sub-array Level Parallelism"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Examining Copyright Regimes in China's Digital Music Industry: History, Challenges and New Models\n", "id": "14090", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7184", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The traditional Chinese culture of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism and the theories from Marxism and Communism played an essential role during both the forming and modifying era of the intellectual property law regimes in the People\u2019s Republic of China.

As one of the largest markets for cultural products, China\u2019s digital music industry emerged at the end of twentieth century as promising but fledgling. Troubles and problems took root during the short booming era when pirated copies of music products were available free through both streaming and downloading and were all over the internet. Thousands of illegal sites, a variety of peer-to-peer file sharing software, and even search engines with high reputations were offering infringing and illegitimate mp3 download services. \nThis thesis also discusses the practices of how the P.

Some of the illegal copies on search engines were erased or replaced by thirty second previews, and hundreds of pirated sites were shut down or blocked by the Ministry of Culture. The long-existing tension between the needs of consumers and producers, however, proved that developing new technological and business models of digital music distribution is an urgent mission for all the players in the industry. Several new technological and business models which emerged in the industry recently are examined and reviewed in this thesis. \nAmong these new models, Xiami which ranks first presently among the competitors in the industry runs a new model of unique peer-to-peer systems, virtual currency, multi-platform clients, and strategic partnerships with record labels and independent musicians, which according to its goals announced on its site are beneficial to the industry in terms of intellectual property rights and copyright protections; but they could also challenge the dominance and power of the traditional regime of large record companies by satisfying the sharing and social needs of consumers in online music communities. This thesis demonstrates how Xiami and other similar new models work and how they challenge the traditional understanding with respect to copyright and intellectual property protection, and considers whether these patterns can close the gap between traditional music producers and distributors and consumers, and whether the new models disable or enable the dominant structure, in order to investigate the future and fate of China\u2019s digital music industry.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7169], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Tian Tiffany", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "Tiffany", "first_name_ssi": "Tian", "degree_name_ssi": "MA", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Arts", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Media Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Richard Denny Taylor", "Matthew Jackson", "Krishna Prasad Jayakar"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Richard Denny Taylor, Thesis Advisor", "Matthew Jackson, Thesis Advisor", "Krishna Prasad Jayakar, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Copyright", "Digital Music", "China", "Xiami", "Intellectual Property", "History"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "From Structure to Dynamics: Direct Visualization of Primary Plant Cell Walls by Atomic Force Microscopy", "id": "25031", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11138", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-03-03T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Macroscale properties of plant cell walls originate from the nano scale interactions beween microfibrils and matrix polymers, the details of which have not been settled, hampering our understanding of how the plant cell wall enables loosening during growth while maintaining its mechanical strength. To visualize the spatial arrangement of the most recently deposited cell wall components at the nm scale, we used multi-channel atomic force microscopy (AFM) in PeakForce Tapping\u00ae mode to map variations in the surface height, modulus and tip adhesion across the innermost surface of never-dried primary onion epidermal walls. Height maps and PeakForceTM error maps selectively visualized microfibrils and obscured the matrix polymers in hydrated primary walls whereas nanomechanical mapping reveals significant polymer heterogeneity in stiffness and adhesiveness at the nm scale. By selectively merging these maps, distribution of soft matrix polymers and stiffer microfibrils became evident. Individual microfibrils frequently emerged into and out of short regions of microfibril bundles, resembling the previously predicted structure of \u2018biomechanical hot spots\u2019, the load bearing sites for cell wall loosening. By time lapse AFM imaging of relaxed cell walls, microfibril dynamics (motion) were seen to increase upon incubation with Cel12A, an endoglucanase capable of inducing cell wall loosening, whereas xyloglucanase and EDTA had no effect. This confirms the role of Cel12A sites as biomechanical hot spots that stabilize and reinforce the microfibril network. By monitoring the nano scale microfibril motions during cell wall extension, we observed that microfibrils reoriented and compressed transversely during physical uniaxial extension, whereas they separated during Cel12A-induced creep. Physical extension also caused kinking of microfibrils, which was reduced by Cel12A treatment. Microfibril sliding as well as shearing was also observed during physical extension and Cel12A-induced creep.

The integration of reactive transport and the representation of fracture geometry and flow field complexity is critical for an accurate evaluation on wellbore cement integrity, while this integration is still missing in many numerical simulators. \nThe present work consists of a numerical study to investigate the influence of fracture geometry and flow field representation on the numerical prediction of chemical degradation of wellbore cement in the presence of a single, highly conductive, rough-walled fracture. The fracture structure and flowing conditions used are based on laboratory data of an eight-day core-flood experiment of carbonated brine through a fractured composite cement-rock core. The three-dimensional fracture structure was obtained from microtomography imaging and used in the calculation of the fracture flow field using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to honor the complex fracture geometry. Later, a series of reactive transport models of cement degradation were built with different simplifications of the fracture geometry and flow field to investigate the impact of the flow field complexity on the predicted cement degradation and property evolution. Results from this work demonstrate that fracture geometry and flow field complexity have a dominant impact on cement property evolution. In the model with the best representation of the fracture geometry and flow field, the total average porosity within cement zones increases from 15% to 20%, while the simplest model reaches a maximum average porosity of 16% with shallower acid penetration. Changes in CO2\u2013brine injection flow rate were found to shift the chemical degradation of cement from pore closure (fracture healing) to self-limiting gapping of apertures. Comparison of cement evolution predictions also suggests that two-dimensional reactive flow models of fractured cement with a smooth-wall, cubic law assumption for the fracture flow field are likely to underestimate cement degradation. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11519], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Tianji ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Tianji", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Mineral Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn", "Li Li", "Hamid Emami Meybodi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zuleima T Karpyn, Thesis Advisor", "Li Li, Thesis Advisor", "Hamid Emami Meybodi, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["cement", "CO2", "degradation", "chemical", "flow", "fracture"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "The structure  of solutions near a degenerate line for mixed type equations in gas dynamics", "id": "15256", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7695", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-04-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In two dimensional physical space, the Euler equations and the simplified model pressure gradient (PG) equations \nare mixed type equations, which change type from hyperbolic to elliptic across the sonic curve in the self-similar plane.

While \nenergy conscious design is obviously crucial for battery driven mobile and embedded systems, it has also \nbecome important for desktops and servers due to packaging and cooling requirements where power \nconsumption has grown from a few watts per chip to over 100 watts. Recent trends indicate that the \narchitecture and software techniques, in addition to low-level circuit techniques, can play a major role \nin power-efficient computer system design.\n\nVLIW architectures are increasingly used in systems where \nenergy-efficiency is an important consideration. In a VLIW architecture, compiler plays an important \nrole in achieving acceptable instruction level parallelism. The energy efficiency of \nVLIW processors is determined by the underlying hardware and compiler techniques. \nWhile many performance optimizations in VLIW architecture also bring energy benefits as a side effect, \nit is possible \nto achieve further benefits by explicitly focusing on energy. This thesis proposes three such compiler-directed energy optimizations for VLIW architectures. \n \nThe first optimization is based on the observation that ``slacks`` present in the CPU datapath in VLIW \nmachines due to the lack of available independent instructions, data dependence and schedule-specific \ndecisions. Therefore, an optimizing compiler can analyze the program to identify the slack for each \ninstruction. To exploit slacks, we can scale down voltage/frequency or turn off functional units. Therefore, energy consumption can be reduced by exploiting these slacks with no impact on performance or under a performance constraint. \n \nTo find larger slacks to benefit leakage energy control, our second optimization is built upon a \ndata-flow \nanalysis to identify the idleness of a particular functional unit across basic blocks. Collecting this \ninformation from all basic blocks in the code, it then inserts explicit activate/deactivate instructions \nin the code to set/reset a sleep signal which controls leakage current for functional units.\n \nOur third energy optimization targets at reducing leakage energy consumption in instruction caches. We \npropose \nand analyze two compiler-based strategies termed as ``conservative`` approach and ``optimistic`` \napproach. \nThe conservative \napproach does not put an instruction cache line into a low leakage mode until it is certain that the \ncurrent instruction in it is dead (i.e., it will not be accessed in the rest of the execution). In \ncomparison, \nthe optimistic approach places a cache line in low leakage mode if it detects that the next access\nto the instruction will occur only after a long gap. We \nevaluate different optimization alternatives by combining the compiler strategies \nwith state-preserving and state-destroying leakage control mechanisms. Our results indicate that \ncompiler-based cache leakage management can be very successful in practice.\n \nWhile leakage energy can be reduced significantly by applying leakage control mechanisms, the aggressive \nuse of such techniques can make the hardware circuits more susceptible to soft errors. Consequently, in \nthe final portion of this thesis, we \npropose a novel solution to enhance the reliability for caches without compromising on performance. The \nidea is to replicate hot cache lines in rarely-used ones to provide a better error resilience.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6516], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Anand Sivasubramaniam", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan", "Richard R Brooks"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Anand Sivasubramaniam, Committee Member", "Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Committee Member", "Richard R Brooks, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Reliability", "Dcache", "Compiler", "Low Power", "Icache"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE CONTROL OF ROTATIONAL HAND ACTIONS BY MULTI-DIGIT SYNERGIES ", "id": "8799", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6566", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The current dissertation is the first to systematically investigate finger coordination during multi-finger tasks that require accurate rotational actions. This series of studies has five main objectives: to quantify multi-digit synergies during actions with an explicit rotational component; to test the hypothesis that multi-digit synergies allow the stabilization of both total force (FTOT) and total moment of force (MTOT); to explore the effect of healthy ageing on multi-finger synergies stabilizing FTOT and MTOT; to describe the variance structure of elemental variables (finger modes) with respect to stabilization of FTOT or MTOT; and to examine hierarchies of multi-digit synergies during rotational actions performed with a hand-held object. A series of experiments within a range of tasks including isometric four-finger pressing tasks and free rotation of a hand-held object in 3D space resulted in several main conclusions. First, young subjects showed a strong moment-stabilizing synergy but not a force-stabilizing synergy in both stationary and non-stationary accurate moment-production tasks. The presence of multi-finger synergies stabilizing MTOT could be viewed as a default conditioned by everyday tasks. Second, flexible combinations of commands to fingers were found that satisfied both resultant force and moment of force constraints. Third, adding a secondary moment constraint did not interfere with the force stabilizing synergy. Two co-existing synergies stabilizing two performance variables simultaneously without an interaction confirmed the principle of superposition. These results emphasize a major advantage of using multi-finger synergies as compared to finding unique optimal solutions, namely the possibility to perform secondary tasks without detrimental effects on a primary task. During rotation of the hand-held object, the negative co-variation among elemental variables (forces produced by individual digits) stabilizing their combined output was observed at the hierarchically higher level (virtual finger and thumb level), but not at the lower level (individual finger level). At both levels, elemental moments of force negatively co-varied across trials, only during steady-states and this co-variation disappeared during the object rotation. These findings suggest that synergies at two levels of a control hierarchy can co-exist but that there is also a trade-off between synergies at the two levels. Finally, elderly persons showed significantly lower indices of synergies stabilizing the moment of force as compared to the young persons. These age-related differences might be causally related to the documented impairment of the hand function with age. This research line contributes to the current understanding of the hand control in healthy persons, the impaired hand function in the elderly, and has implications for hand rehabilitation following neurological disorders, trauma, or healthy aging.", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6564], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Latash", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky", "Stephen Jacob Piazza", "Joseph Paul Cusumano"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Latash, Committee Chair", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky, Committee Member", "Stephen Jacob Piazza, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rotational hand action", "multi-digit synergies", "finger coordination", "uncontrolled manifold hypothesis", "force stabilization", "moment of force stabilization"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "A General Class of Agreement Coefficients for Categorical and Continuous Responses\n\n", "id": "8610", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6567", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-05-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "We propose a general class of agreement coefficients for categorical and continuous\nresponses.

When large scale of eIF2-alpha is phosphorylated, global translation is repressed to alleviate ER stress; while moderate eIF2-alpha level may selectively induce a subgroup of gene expression. PERK is highly expressed in secretory cells such as pancreatic Beta-cells, which have elaborate network of ER and high protein load in the ER. Thus PERK is widely speculated to alleviate ER overload or stress and preserve exquisite ER function in those cells in particular. \nGenetic deletion of PERK in mice causes early onset of diabetes and other disorders, mirroring Wolcott Rallison Syndrome in human. Our lab demonstrated that Beta-cell hypoplasia and dysfunction contribute to hyperglycemia in PERK null mutant mice. Immunofluorescent assay revealed that disrupted proliferation and neogenesis rather than apoptosis cause Beta-cell hypoplasia, which disproves the popular perception that excessive Beta-cell death under ER stress being the main reason. Molecular evidence indicated that Beta-cell is trapped in G2 or late G1/S phase of cell cycle, while we failed to see the reduction of cyclin D and cdk4. Cyclin D and cdk4 was stated to be dispensable for Beta-cell duplication in the early developmental stage. The Proliferation defects since fetal stage, together with neogenesis degeneration illustrate impeded Beta-cell development. We speculate that maternal factors such as glucose may regulate Beta-cell proliferation and neogenesis via PERK, which will be exploited. For Beta-cell function, glucose stimulated insulin secretion is compromised in Perk -/- islets; Beta-cell marker, such as insulin, MafA and Pdx1 are downregulated.  In addition, insulin and GLUT2 are accumulated in distended ER, suggesting general ER dysfunction. ER stress markers, Bip, spliced Xbp1 and Chop are not induced. Thus, via eIF2-alpha substrate, PERK either directly or indirectly affect the development, expansion and function of Beta-cells. The mechanism is still under investigation, however it is not along ER stress induced canonical unfold protein response (UPR) pathway. Study of tissue specific knockout mice, including pcPKO, enPKO, BetaPKO, exPKO mice, and Beta-PERK:PKO mice (Perk transgenic mice) suggest deteriorated Beta-cells are cell autonomous effect. \n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6628], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Wei ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener", "Richard W Ordway", "Pamela Hankey Giblin", "Gong Chen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Chair", "Pamela Hankey Giblin, Committee Member", "Gong Chen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ER stress", "PERK", "eIF2-alpha", "Beta-cell", "hypoplasia"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE CHIRAL LIGANDS FOR CATALYTIC ASYMMETRIC HYDROGENATION", "id": "9308", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6565", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis summarizes the author\u2019s graduate research on catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation at Penn State.

However, no satisfying solution has been found with consideration of both accuracy and system complexity. Recently, research on visible light communications offers new opportunities on realizing accurate indoor positioning with relatively simple system configuration. This dissertation investigates several fundamental research topics of indoor positioning systems based on visible light communications (VLC) technology.\nFirst, we introduce a simulation method to generate optical wireless channel impulse response more efficiently and accurately, based on which a novel 2-D positioning algorithm is developed. Using basic framed slotted ALOHA (BFSA) protocol, it successfully addresses channel multi-access issue, removing synchronization requirement on the transmitters. The algorithm makes use of received signal strength (RSS) to calculate the ranges from receiver to light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, after which trilateration is performed to obtain estimation of the receiver\u2019s location. Simulation results show that, with over 95% confidence, the target receiver can be located with an accuracy of 5.9 cm, assuming indirect sunlight exposure and proper installation of LED bulbs. \nThe dissertation also explores one of the main digital signal processing techniques available: digital filters. Three filtering techniques are employed to improve the positioning accuracy: Kalman filter, sequential importance-resampling particle filter (SIR-PF) and Gaussian mixture sigma-point particle filter (GM-SPPF). Filtering techniques are used to form the trajectory of the receiver while rejecting wild values which are large deviations from correct measurements. Results show that filters help increase the positioning accuracy and Gaussian mixture sigma-point particle filter (GM-SPPF) outperforms other filters such as basic Kalman filter and particle filter (SIR-PF), at a reasonable computational cost. \n3-D positioning algorithm is then proposed to keep track of the receiver\u2019s height. Simulation results show that the height of receiver can be estimated as accurately as within ten centimeters. Results also show that the estimation is more accurate when light distribution from LED bulbs involved are uniform.\nFinally, sensor fusion technology is adopted as a solution to blockage problem and an option to further improve the positioning accuracy. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9934], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Weizhi ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Weizhi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad", "Mohsen Kavehrad", "Shizhuo Yin", "Zhiwen Liu", "Jian Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mohsen Kavehrad, Dissertation Advisor", "Mohsen Kavehrad, Committee Chair", "Shizhuo Yin, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Jian Xu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Light emitting diode", "visible light communications", "indoor positioning", "Kalman filter", "sensor fusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Predicting molecular properties and phase behaviors for conjugated polymers", "id": "14218wwz5031", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14218", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Conjugated polymers, though still outperformed by their inorganic counterparts, are promising materials for flexible electronics, including field-effect transistors and solar cells. The mechanical and electrical properties of this class of materials depend strongly on the morphological order. In order to design new materials and optimize existing polymers, establishing concrete links between fundamental molecular properties and structural order is necessary. As consequence, the ability to predict the properties of novel materials from their molecular structures is essential.\nThis dissertation focuses on predicting fundamental properties and phase be- haviors of conjugated polymers from molecular structures. We develop tools and methods, combining molecular simulations and analytical theories, to predict ma- terial parameters, including the chain stiffness, the nematic coupling constant, and the Flory-Huggins \u03c7 parameter, for conjugated polymers. These fundamental parameters govern the mesoscale structures and phase behaviors for chains in melts and solutions, in turn affect the mechanical and electrical properties of conjugated polymers in the final semi-crystalline state.\nUsing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we also investigate the role of thermal fluctuations in the performance of crystalline conjugated polymers. We show that thermal fluctuations can lead to cumulative lattice disorder in conjugated polymers, in turn enhance the inter-chain charge transport. Because the fluctuations of crystal shape are related to the mechanical properties of conjugated polymers, we can also obtain the elastic moduli for crystalline conjugated polymers by measuring the fluctuating box sizes in MD simulations.\nAltogether, this dissertation reports our progress on predicting the electrical and mechanical properties from molecular structures for conjugated polymers in both the precursor (melt and solution) and the crystalline states.

The large volume of sensing data coupled with the facts that the data are spread across the entire network, the sensor network is resource-constrained, and the sensor network is usually deployed in unattended and hostile environments, creates a demand for efficient and secure data collection and dissemination/access techniques to obtain useful and high-quality data from within the network.\n\n\nIn this thesis, we study the problem in a typical application scenario where a sensor network is deployed to monitor mobile targets in unattended environments and disseminate the obtained sensing data from dynamically changed detecting nodes to mobile sinks. We address the problem in three aspects.\n\n\nCollaborative Detection and Efficient Data Collection: Since sensor nodes have limited sensing/communication ranges and are not reliable, it is necessary for multiple sensor nodes to collaborate in detecting a target. Further, due to the mobility of the targets, nodes involved in the collaboration will change over time. We propose a dynamic convoy tree-based collaboration (DCTC) framework to facilitate the collaborative detection among a dynamic set of sensor nodes, and efficient collection of data for generating high-quality sensing results. In DCTC, sensor nodes surrounding a mobile target form a tree structure, which can be dynamically adjusted, to facilitate the collaborations among them and collect their sensing data. One big challenge in implementing DCTC is how to reconfigure the convoy tree efficiently. We formalize the problem as an optimization problem of finding a convoy tree sequence with high tree coverage and low energy consumption, and propose both an ideal scheme and several practical schemes to solve it.\n\n\nEfficient Data Dissemination: To facilitate users (static or mobile) in finding sensing data of interest from within a sensor network, we propose an index-based data dissemination scheme with adaptive ring-based index (ARI). This scheme is based on the idea that sensing data are collected, processed and stored at the nodes close to the detecting nodes, and the location information of these storing nodes is pushed to some index nodes. To tolerate failures and balance load, the index nodes for each type of targets form a ring surrounding the location which is determined based on the target type. To improve the performance, we further propose several mechanisms to optimize the ARI scheme.\n\n\nSecuring Data Forwarding: In data collection and dissemination, sensing data need to be forwarded in the network. To achieve authenticity and confidentiality in sensing data forwarding, innocent sensor nodes can share group keys for data encryption and authentication. However, the group key-based techniques will become ineffective if some nodes are compromised since the adversary may obtain group keys from these compromised nodes. To deal with node compromise, the innocent nodes should update their group keys to prevent the adversary from utilizing the captured keys. Because most previously proposed group rekeying schemes have high overhead and are not suitable for sensor networks, we design and evaluate a family of predistribution and local collaboration-based group rekeying (PCGR)schemes,\nbased on the idea that future group keys can be preloaded to nodes before deployment, and neighbors can collaborate to protect and appropriately use the preloaded keys.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6604], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Wensheng ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Wensheng", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Chitaranjan Das", "George Kesidis", "Tom F.

Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and pulsed laser vaporization (PLV) methods are used to synthesize alloy and heterostructured Si1-xGex nanowires. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) are used to investigate structural and chemical properties of these nanowires.\nThe first experiments investigate the size-dependent composition in Si1-xGex nanowires grown via Au-catalyzed CVD on Si (111) substrates or in nanoporous alumina (AAO) membranes. The Ge concentration in Si1-xGex nanowires is studied as a function of nanowire diameter by using quantitative EDS. The Ge concentration in Si1-xGex nanowires shows a strong dependence on nanowire diameter, with the Ge concentration decreasing with decreasing nanowire diameter below ~50 nm. The size-dependent nature of Ge concentration in Si1-xGex nanowires is strongly suggestive of Gibbs-Thomson effects and highlights another important phenomenon in nanowire growth.\nThe next set of experiments focus on the solid-sate diffusion of Ge in Si nanowires grown by PLV. Experiments are developed to study the effects of nanowire diameter and post-synthesis annealing temperature on the diffusion coefficient of Ge in Si nanowires. The activation energy calculated from the Arrhenius fitting suggests that a surface diffusion mechanism dominates in nanowires. \nThe third part is a theoretical analysis of solid-state diffusion of Ge in Si nanowires by taking into account the contributions from both surface and bulk diffusions. Computer simulation is employed to model the Ge concentration in Si nanowires by solving the differential equation of diffusion in a cylindrical coordinate system and an analytical solution is obtained. The validity of the solutions is demonstrated by comparing theoretical results with experimental measurements. Based on this model, the diameter dependence of the diffusion coefficient of Ge in Si nanowire is also discussed. \nFinally, thermal oxidation of Si1-xGex nanowires is investigated. Early stage experimental results are presented and future work based on our findings is also recommended. \n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6658], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Xi ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sarah Elizabeth Dickey", "Elizabeth C Dickey", "Joan Marie Redwing", "Suzanne E Mohney", "Mark William Horn"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sarah Elizabeth Dickey, Dissertation Advisor", "Elizabeth C Dickey, Committee Chair", "Joan Marie Redwing, Committee Member", "Suzanne E Mohney, Committee Member", "Mark William Horn, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["nanowires", "SiGe", "size effect diffusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "The Teachability Hypothesis and Concept-based Instruction:\ntopicalization in Chinese as a Second Language\n", "id": "22362", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10296", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Teachability Hypothesis (TH, Pienemann, 1984, 1987, 1989) claims that formal instruction cannot affect the route of acquisition of processing procedures predicted by Processability Theory (PT, Pienemann, 1998). Aligned with Piagetian theory, Pienemann argues that L2 instruction is subordinated to L2 development and therefore cannot override PT\u2019s universal developmental sequences. Vygotsky (1978) argued that psychological development is neither predetermined nor universal. It depends on the quality of cognitive tools and social relationships, most especially in educational settings. This thesis tests the central claim of the Teachability Hypothesis by investigating whether instructions that follow Gal\u2019perin\u2019s (1970) Systemic Theoretical Instruction (concept-based instruction) would change the L2 Chinese developmental sequence predicted by the Topic Hypothesis, an extension of PT (Pienemann, Biase, & Kawaguchi, 2005). According to the Topic Hypothesis, L2 Chinese learners must progress through three sequential stages: SVO, ADJ+SVO, OSV. Eight beginning L2 Chinese learners and two heritage speakers took part in this study. In the first experiment, six participants at the SVO stage were taught the OSV structure. It was found that these learners were capable of producing OSV structure before they could produce ADJ+SVO structure. In the second experiment, two participants at the SVO stage were taught the OSV and the ADJ+SVO structure in the same instruction session.  Results indicate that both the OSV and the ADJ+SVO structure were processable to the two learners. In the third experiment, it was found that the two heritage speaker could produce a higher stage grammar structure (the ba-construction, Gao, 2009; Wang, 2012) without the capability of processing a lower stage grammar structure (the OSV structure).

As web and mobile technology thrives, publishing, sharing and retrieving of geospatial information have become much easier and more common than before. People generate large amount of text contents containing geospatial information every day, such as travel blogs, reviews of interesting places to visit in a new city, human-generated route directions, etc. Such documents are rich in mentions of geospatial objects and accounts of movements. Meanwhile, the demand for efficient geo-spatial object retrieval under location-based constraints is growing fast. Digital maps, GPS on mobile devices are products under such in- creasing demand. However, even if geospatial information sources are plentiful and available, fulfilling the information need remains difficult because: (1) it remains a hard problem to identify and extract different types of geospatial information from text, and (2) building an accurate mapping between the textual mentions of landmarks, places to their unique latitudes and longitudes and recovering them on maps are very challenging due to the ambiguity in text. The absence of good solutions to the above-mentioned problems makes such geospatial information in text hard to use. In addition, there lacks efficient algorithms for geospatial infor- mation retrieval given various location-based constraints. Such retrieval tasks are even more challenging on mobile devices since they suffer from limited storage, battery, computational power and update issues. A system which automatically extracts, disambiguates and geo-tags geospatial information in text and provides efficient solutions to location-based services will greatly satisfy people\u2019s demand of sharing and retrieving of geospatial information. In this dissertation, we intro- duce our efforts towards this goal. We developed: (1) a solution for automatic route components and destination name extraction from text documents contain- ing human-generated route directions. We explored and designed a variety of machine learning features and utilized sequence labeling machine learning models to identify meaningful route information from text. (2) a noval road name disam- biguation algorithm specifically designed to work well in noisy environment, i.e., in the presence of inaccurate data and incomplete gazetteer. Although toponymn (place name) disambiguation has been studied extensively, existing methods fail to solve our problem. We creatively model the problem to be an exact-all-hop shortest path problem on a special type of graph, namely semi-complete directed k-partite graph, and developed a computationally-efficient algorithm to solve it. and (3) an efficient algorithm for a particular type of geospatial object retrieval task on mobile devices. The mobile device has the ability to access multiple broadcast channels simultaneously. Under this setting, we solved the transitive nearest neigh- bor query efficiently, which means to find two objects of different types so that the total traveling distance from the query point to these two objects is minimum.

To mimic autograft, a synthetic hydrogel that can sustainably release growth factors was integrated into decellularized tissue to create a semi-synthetic substitute. Because the semi-synthetic substitute can provide both physical and chemical support in tissue regeneration, it is expected to not only provide similar therapeutic outcomes as autograft, but also avoid the disadvantages of autograft, such as secondary surgery, limited material availability, and donor site morbidity.\n\nIn this study, an aptamer functionalized gelatin-PEG hydrogel was incorporated into decellularized intestine to create a semi-synthetic skin substitute as a model.

These networks enable direct communication between mobile devices by utilizing the short-range communication interfaces embedded on mobile devices, such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct. Since mobile opportunistic networks rely on peer-to-peer connections between mobile devices, the data access does not require support from network infrastructures (e.g., cellular towers or access points). Therefore, mobile opportunistic networks have been widely used to facilitate data access in circumstances where network infrastructures are not available, such as during natural disasters or military attacks. \n\nThe specific goal of this dissertation is to develop comprehensive solutions for providing efficient and quality-aware data access in mobile opportunistic networks. In particular, two research problems are addressed in this dissertation, i.e., realizing efficient data transmission between nodes and improving the quality of data received by those nodes. Due to the dynamic network topologies and the unexpected failure of mobile devices, data transmission in mobile opportunistic networks is extremely difficult. To address this problem, this dissertation explores the social behavior patterns of mobile users and proposes social-aware solutions to achieve efficient data transmission. In addition, the data received by mobile devices may suffer from quality-awareness problem. For example, the data may be of bad quality because of the existence of unreliable mobile users, who provide low-quality data due to their limited capability to provide data, or some other malicious or subjective factors. Solutions for addressing this quality-awareness problem are also provided in this dissertation.\n\nFirst, we propose a data transmission strategy by exploiting and utilizing a social structure called transient community, i.e., the community with associated temporal information. Most existing community detection methods fail to detect transient communities due to their aggregation of contact information into a single weighted or unweighted network. Therefore, we propose a novel clustering method to detect transient communities by exploiting the pairwise contact processes between mobile users. Then, we propose a transient community-based data transmission strategy by utilizing the detected transient communities as the data transmission unit.\n\nSecond, we design data transmission strategies by considering the diverse connectivity characteristics in mobile opportunistic networks. Previous works fail to consider diverse connectivity characteristics, since they neglect the ubiquitous existence of Transient Connected Components (TCCs), where nodes inside a TCC can reach each other by multi-hop wireless communications. Exploiting the special characteristics of TCCs can increase contact opportunities and significantly improve data transmission performance. \n\nThird, to improve the quality of data received by the destination, we provide solutions to adaptively collect data from mobile users through mobile opportunistic networks, especially when the existing data are not enough to ensure data quality or credibility. Considering the requirement on data credibility and the constraint of network resources, we propose two optimization problems to quantify the tradeoff between the enhanced data credibility and the increased network overhead. We then design resource-aware approaches for the proposed problems.\n\nFinally, we design an approach to improve data quality by considering the expertise of the mobile users, which is based on the fact that a user may only have expertise on some problems in some domains, but not others. The proposed expertise-aware approach relies on an optimization problem to maximize the probability that data are requested from users with the right expertise, while ensuring the work load does not exceed the processing capability of each user. A maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)-based method is further proposed to estimate the truth of data, so that data quality can be improved.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12192], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Xiaomei ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaomei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Guohong Cao", "George Kesidis", "Sencun Zhu", "Zhenhui Li"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Dissertation Advisor", "Guohong Cao, Committee Chair", "George Kesidis, Committee Member", "Sencun Zhu, Committee Member", "Zhenhui Li, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Mobile Opportunistic Networks", "Data Transmission", "Transient Community", "Truth Analysis", "Mobile Crowdsourcing", "Task Allocation", "Mobile Opportunistic Networks", "Social Networks", "Data Transmission", "Transient Community", "Truth Analysis", "Mobile Crowdsourcing", "Task Allocation"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "DEVELOPMENT AND APPLICATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS LIGANDS IN \nRHODIUM-CATALYZED HYDROFORMYLATION AND HYDROGENATION\n", "id": "11811", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6663", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Transition metal-catalyzed homogeneous catalysis is one of the key tools of modern synthetic chemistry. Generally, variation of the steric bulk and electronic properties of the ligands is one of the most efficient methods to improve catalytic performance of an organometallic complex. This dissertation mainly focuses on the design and synthesis of efficient phosphorus ligands and the exploration of their applications in rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation and asymmetric hydrogenation.\n\nAsymmetric hydroformylation has attracted much attention as an atom economic method to convert olefins into enantiomerically pure aldehydes. Although a number of chiral phosphorus ligands have been developed for this challenging transformation, only a few of them can give practicable enantioselectivities (> 90% ee). We report the synthesis of a new family of hybrid phosphine-phosphoramidite ligands. Their applications in Rh-catalyzed asymmetric hydroformylation afforded up to 99 % ee for styrene derivatives, 98 % ee for vinyl acetate derivatives and 96 % ee allyl cyanide, which represents the best result up to date. The relationship between the substituent and the enantioselectivity of the ligands was investigated by systematic variation on the ligand structure, which was successfully rationalized by Herrmann\u2019s theoretical model with CAChe MM2 calculation.\n\nThe further application of phosphine-phosphoramidite ligands family in the rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydroformylation of a variety of allylic substrates achieved very high enantioselectivities (up to 99 % ee) and reactivities (up to 9700 turnover number) under mild conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of applying N-allylamides and N-allylsulfonamides in asymmetric hydroformylation, which provides an alternative catalytic route to \u00e22-amino aldehydes, acids, and alcohols for pharmaceutical and synthetic chemistry.\n\nTo increase the linear-selectivity in hydroformylation of olefins, especially the more accessible internal olefins, a new strategy for ligand design was developed by using tetraphosphorus ligands with multiple chelating modes to enhance chelating ability and regioselectivity. Based on this concept, two types of tetraphosphorus ligands, tetraphosphoramidite ligands and tetraphosphine ligands, were designed and synthesized. With tetraphosphoramidite ligand, the highest regioselectivity ever reported in the hydroformylation of both internal olefins and terminal olefins were achieved. Tetraphosphine ligands exhibited remarkably improved high temperature performance in the hydroformylation of terminal olefins. \n\nAlthough P-stereogenic ligands have achieved excellent enantioselectivities in asymmetric hydrogenation, their development is still limited due to their synthetical difficulties. A new highly electron-donating, P-stereogenic bisphospholane ligand (named as ZhangPhos) was developed, which can be synthesized practically and highly enantioselectively from a commercially available chiral reagent. ZhangPhos exhibited extremely high enantioselectivities (up to 99 % ee) and reactivities (up to 50 000 TON) for rhodium-catalyzed hydrogenation of a wide range of functionalized olefin derivatives.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6660], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Xiaowei ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Xiaowei", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Professor Xumu Zhang", "Xumu Zhang", "Gong Chen", "Thomas E Mallouk", "Harry R Allcock", "Qing Wang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Professor Xumu Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Xumu Zhang, Committee Member", "Gong Chen, Committee Chair", "Thomas E Mallouk, Committee Member", "Harry R Allcock, Committee Member", "Qing Wang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Hydroformylation", "Phosphorus ligand", "Rhodium", "Catalysis", "Hydrogenation"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Analysis of Supply Chain Risk Vulnerability and Mitigation Strageties", "id": "26329", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11545", "abstract_tesi": "Based on a combined inventory and transportation model considering disruption risks for a four-stage global supply chain, this thesis focuses on supply chain network vulnerability and risk mitigation strategies.

The coordination is\nmediated by demand forecast sharing and component overage risk sharing. Three major problems are studied: (1) two-component newsvendor model in which the CM needs to make ordering decisions on two complementary components at two different stages with new demand information being revealed in between; (2) an OEM-CM joint\nplanning problem in which the CM makes its own purchasing decisions while the OEM can influence the CM's decisions through\ninformation-sharing or risk-sharing mechanisms; and (3) a two-mode problem in which a company can split its freight between a slow mode and a fast mode and needs to optimize its shipping decisions\nusing demand forecast updates.\n\nWe use a set of two related uniform distributions (U-U) to develop a new model for demand forecast updating. The U-U formulation models demand in the second stage as a uniform random variable\nwhose mean is unknown in the first stage, although its width is known in both stages. To capture risk sharing between the OEM and the CM, we propose a contract under which the OEM compensates the\nCM for unused components.\n\nUsing the U-U model, we first study the CM's planning problem in isolation and obtain an in-depth understanding of the CM's ordering behaviors. The CM tends to increase the order quantity of the component with a longer lead time if better information becomes available at the second stage. Then we investigate the\nOEM-CM joint planning problem based on different combinations of information sharing and risk sharing.

Bordetella pertussis and B. parapertussis are causative agents of this disease.  B. holmesii is a recently recognized Bordetella species that can also cause whooping-cough-like respiratory symptoms.  B. bronchiseptica infects a wide range of mammals, resulting in diseases of various severities.  These bordetellae are endemic in humans and animals, laying burdens on their health.  This dissertation investigated several aspects of vaccine-induced-immunity-mediated competition between endemic bordetellae as well as their interactions with host immunity.  Current whooping cough vaccines include only B. pertussis antigens and are ineffective against B. parapertussis and B. holmesii.  We demonstrated that efficient protection against B. parapertussis requires antibodies against O-antigen.  Moreover, addition of B. parapertussis LPS containing O-antigen to an acellular vaccine conferred protection against this bacterium.  O-antigen also enables B. parapertussis to avoid B. pertussis vaccine-induced immunity by inhibiting binding and functions of cross-reactive antibodies.  B. holmesii was found to be circulating in Massachusetts in recent years.  B. pertussis vaccine-induced antibodies did not efficiently bind to B. holmesii.  Vaccinated mice given B. holmesii-specific, but not B. pertussis-specific, antibodies quickly controlled B. holmesii challenge.  These data suggest that future vaccines targeting B. parapertussis and B. holmesii need to include their own protective antigens.  Engagement of B. pertussis LPS with TLR4 induces production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1 and IL-6.  Their roles in immunity against B. pertussis were investigated in this work.  Following B. pertussis infection, IL-1R-/- mice showed uncontrolled bacterial numbers in the respiratory tract, systemic spread, and dysregulated inflammation.  These mice survived the challenge with B. parapertussis or a B. pertussis strain lacking pertussis toxin, indicating a role of IL-1R-mediated effects in overcoming the effects of this toxin.  Mice lacking IL-6 generated less B. pertussis-specific antibodies, recruited fewer leukocytes to the lungs, produced decreased levels of cytokines, and delayed the clearance of B. pertussis.  Therefore, IL-1R and IL-6 are required for efficient control of B. pertussis.  A genetic module, sigE-BB3751(rseA)-mucB(rseB), bearing sequence homology to the E. coli rpoE-rseA-rseB system, is recently discovered in B. bronchiseptica strain RB50.  This system is involved in resistance to heat and ethanol stress, as well as cell envelope perturbations by SDS and some &#946;-lactam antibiotics.  Moreover, the mutant lacking SigE failed to cause lethal infection in RAG-/- mice.  The mutant lacking both RseA and RseA did not efficiently colonize murine hosts.  These findings suggest that SigE and its proper regulation are important during infection.  Combined, data contained herein demonstrated how B. parapertussis and B. holmesii evade B. pertussis vaccine-induced immunity, how IL-1R and IL-6 signaling contribute to host defenses against B. pertussis, and how SigE system is important for B. bronchiseptica stress responses and pathogenesis.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that phylogenetic clustering of cancer cell lines might reflect the functional similarities in cellular pathways. Molecular evolutionary analysis was applied to identify potential driver mutations that are causally implicated in oncogenesis.

With the support of peer-to-peer wireless communication, information can also be shared among vehicles beyond the infrastructure coverage. However, many unique characteristics of VANET, such as fast vehicle movement, rapid network topology change, etc, bring out new research challenges.\n\nThe specific goal of this dissertation is to provide comprehensive solutions for information sharing in VANETs. Different algorithms and protocols are applied based on different application scenarios and information sharing paradigms. First, we address the scheduling challenge of vehicle-roadside information sharing by proposing a few scheduling schemes, including a basic scheduling scheme called $mathcal{D*S}$, an enhancement with broadcasting, and a Two-Step scheduling scheme to provide the balance between serving download and update requests. Second, we study how to efficiently share information among vehicles through vehicle-vehicle communication. We propose a novel P2P information sharing scheme called Roadcast. Roadcast relaxes user's query requirement a little bit so that each user can have more chances to get the requested information\nquickly. Furthermore, Roadcast ensures popular data is more likely\nto be shared with other vehicles so that the performance of overall query delay can be improved. Finally, we study the ``vehicle platoon\" phenomenon in VANETs, and propose a vehicle-platoon aware information sharing solution called V-PADA. In V-PADA, vehicles contribute part of their buffer to replicate data for other vehicles in the same platoon and share data with them. When a vehicle leaves the platoon, it prefetches its interested data and transfer its buffered data to other vehicles in advance so that they can still access the data after it leaves. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6944], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yang ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yang", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Guohong Cao", "Guohong Cao", "Chitaranjan Das", "George Kesidis", "Carleen Frances Maitland", "Secun Zhu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Guohong Cao, Dissertation Advisor", "Guohong Cao, Committee Chair", "Chitaranjan Das, Committee Member", "George Kesidis, Committee Member", "Carleen Frances Maitland, Committee Member", "Secun Zhu, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks", "Information sharing"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Decentralized Interactions In Networks", "id": "19207", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9233", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "My dissertation concerns decentralized decision making of networked agents.

Typical applications include technology adoptions under network effects (coordination), and the supply of informational goods in peer-to-peer networks (free riding). \nIn Chapter 1, we find that both global and local networks impact coordination when agents have incomplete information about the network structure.

Kinesin-2 motors, involved in intraflagellar transport and Golgi trafficking, are unique among the kinesin superfamily in having two non-identical motor domains.  Because homodimeric kinesins rely on coordination between their two motor domains for long distance transport, this heterodimeric structure offers many potential functional advantages.  Our hypothesis is that the two heads are biochemically tuned to maximize motor function such as speed, strength, processivity and microtubule affinity.  To test this hypothesis, we focused on KIF3A/B, the mouse ortholog of Kinesin-2, and constructed two homodimeric KIF3 motors by fusing the head of one chain to the rod-tail of the other.  \n\nIn microtubule gliding assays the two homodimeric motors moved at 10-fold different rates.  Regarding the stepping rate of the wild-type KIF3A/B, the data are consistent with a coordinated head model in which detachment of the slow KIF3A head from the microtubule is accelerated roughly three-fold by the KIF3B head.  However, further experiments indicated that the bulk of the difference between the two heads is due to point mutations in the A head. \n\nFor higher resolution analysis of motor function, fluorescently labeled heterodimeric and homodimeric KIF3 motors were constructed by replacing the tail domains with EGFP.  The run length (processivity), dwell time, and velocity of motors moving along immobilized microtubules were characterized by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF) at the single molecule level.  The results showed that KIF3A/B is processive but less processive than conventional kinesin, and homodimeric KIF3A/A is slightly more processive than homodimeric KIF3B/B.\n\nUsing two dynamic fluorescence techniques, the kinetics of motor-microtubule interactions in solution were investigated.  On fast time scales, rapid rotational diffusion was measured using time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy, and while on slow time scales, the translational diffusion was measured using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). We successfully applied FCS in determining equilibrium dissociation rate constant of kinesin binding to microtubules by quantitating fractions of the rapid diffusing component (free motors) and slowly diffusing component (motor-microtubule complexes) at a range of microtubule concentrations.\n\n   The measured processivity and stepping rates were incorporated into kinetic schemes for the kinesin chemomechanical cycle, and were simulated using a Monte Carlo approach.  Simulation results supported the ATP Induced Detachment (AID) model, in which the intramolecular strain and conformation change induced by the binding of ATP to the front bound head is required for detaching the rear head from the microtubule.\n\nThis work provides the most detailed characterization of Kinesin-2 motors to date, enabling insights into how these motors are optimized for their specific cellular tasks.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6899], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yangrong ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yangrong", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["William O Hancock", "Peter J Butler", "Richard Cyr", "Cheng Dong", "Ahmed A Heikal"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["William O Hancock, Committee Chair", "Peter J Butler, Committee Member", "Richard Cyr, Committee Member", "Cheng Dong, Committee Member", "Ahmed A Heikal, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["kinesin-2", "molecular motor", "motility", "processivity", "total internal reflection fluorecence microscopy", "fluorescence correlation spectroscopy"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Maximum Entropy Modeling for Distributed Classification, Regression, and Interaction Discovery\n\n", "id": "9788", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6896", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The maximum entropy (ME) principle has been widely applied to specialized applications in statistical learning and pattern recognition. The concept of ME method is to find a probability distribution that satisfies whatever information is available from known data in the form of constraints. The ME solution is the unique Gibbs distribution that maximizes the likelihood of the training data. In this dissertation, we develop ME methods with applications to three important tasks, i.e., distributed classification, regression, and identification of feature interactions. \n\nIn the distributed classification paradigms, where common labeled data may be not available for designing classifier ensemble, traditional fixed decision aggregation such as voting, averaging, or naive Bayes rules could not account for class prior mismatch or classifier dependencies. Previous transductive learning strategies have several drawbacks, e.g., feasibility of the constraints was not guaranteed and heuristic learning was applied. We overcome these problems by proposing a transductive maximum entropy (TME) model for designing aggregation to satisfy the constraints in local classifiers. We augment the test set support to ensure the feasibility of the constraints and develop transductive iterative scaling (TIS) algorithm for optimal solution. This method is shown to achieve improved decision accuracy over the earlier transductive approaches and fixed rules on a number of UC Irvine data sets.\n\nTypically, ME models have been developed for classification on discrete feature spaces, i.e., both the output variable and input features are categorical or ordinal. We extend ME model for the regression problem, where the output variable and input features are mixed continuous-discrete valued. We propose a hierarchical maximum entropy (HME) model for regression in building a posterior model for the output variable, which encodes constraints involving hierarchical derived features that are obtained by agglomerative clustering of both input features and the output variable. We develop a greedy order-growing constraint search method to sequentially build constraints with flexible order into the HME model based on likelihood gain on a validation set. Experiments show the HME model for regression performs comparably to or better than other regression models, including generalized linear regression, multi-layer perceptron, support vector regression, and regression tree. \n\nIndividual variation in risk for complex disorders results from the joint effects of both environmental and genetic factors. There are statistical, computational, and methodological challenges associated with discovery of gene-gene and gene-environment phenotypic interactions. We propose maximum entropy conditional probability modeling (MECPM), coupled with a novel model structure search -- that makes explicit and is determined by the interactions that confer phenotype-predictive power. The model structure and order selection are based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which accounts for the finite sample in (fairly) comparing interactions at different orders and in determining the number of interactions. We develop a fast approximate search algorithm using cross entropy, achieving improved sensitivity and specificity of ground-truth markers and interactions when tested on real genotyped data with up to 1000 SNPs and 20 or less predisposing variants, including interactions up to fifth order. \n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6893], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yanxin ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yanxin", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Jonathan Miller", "David Jonathan Miller", "George Kesidis", "Nirmal K Bose", "Jose Antonio Ventura", "William Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Jonathan Miller, Dissertation Advisor", "David Jonathan Miller, Committee Chair", "George Kesidis, Committee Chair", "Nirmal K Bose, Committee Member", "Jose Antonio Ventura, Committee Member", "William Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["interaction discovery", "maximum entropy", "distributed classification", "regression"]}, {"year_isi": 2002, "title_ssi": "SCHEDULING AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FOR NEXT GENERATION CLUSTERS", "id": "5984", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6888", "defended_at_dtsi": "2002-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Clusters of workstations built with off-the-shelf hardware,\nare playing an important role in mainstream high performance\ncomputing.

ATRA regulates many physiological processes, such as embryonic development, cellular proliferation and differentiation, testicular function, and immune function. Clinically, retinoids have been demonstrated to be useful for cancer treatment and chemoprevention. Oral ATRA have been effective in the treatment of the patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).    \nATRA concentration in tissues is tightly controlled in a spatial and temporal manner, accomplished by a balance of synthesizing and metabolizing enzymes. Several retinaldehyde dehydrogenases have been characterized for the irreversible conversion of retinaldehyde to ATRA.  Metabolism of ATRA is mediated by cytochrome P450 activities, and is known to be induced by RA itself in many tissues. \nCYP26A1 (P450RA1) is a cytochrome P450 enzyme, and specifically catalyzes the conversion of ATRA to polar metabolites including 4-OH-RA, 4-oxo-RA, and 18-OH-RA. Moreover, CYP26A1 is remarkable for its strong inducibility by ATRA in vivo.  In the liver of intact ATRA-treated rats, CYP26A1 mRNA increased nearly 2000-fold within 10 hours and then declined rapidly. Loudig et al. have previously reported on one retinoic acid response element (RARE, referred as RARE1), proximal to the transcription start site, which cooperated with guanine-guanine-rich element (GGRE) in the induction of CYP26A1 promoter activation in F9 and P19 (murine embryonal or teratocarcinoma cells).  \n \tTo better understand the mechanism of the strong regulation of CYP26A1 gene expression in the liver, we have measured endogenous levels of CYP26A1 mRNA in ATRA-treated human liver cells (HepG2 cells), and further characterized the CYP26A1 promoter region extending 2.2 kb upstream from the translational start site. \nWhereas HepG2 cells expressed very little endogenous CYP26A1 mRNA prior to retinoid treatment, they responded rapidly and dose-dependently to 1-1000 nM RA, and therefore closely resembled intact liver.  Examination of the putative promoter of CYP26A1 extending 2.2 kb upstream from the translation state site revealed three additional potential regulatory elements: two 5-bp-spaced direct repeat  (DR-5) RAREs (RARE2, RARE3) and a nearby half-site (RARE4).  Sequence analysis shows that all three RAREs and the half site are highly conserved among mouse, rat and human.  Based on the human CYP26A1 nucleotide sequence, we prepared a series of luciferase reporter constructs that contained either nucleotide deletions or mutations within RARE1, 2, 3, and the half site, RARE4, of the full-length construct.  Relative luciferase activity for the full-length construct was dose-dependently regulated by RA in HepG2 cells, and correlated with the level of endogenously expressed CYP26A1 mRNA.  Comparative studies revealed that RA increased CYP26A1 promoter activity significantly more in HepG2 cells as compared to HEK293T cells, and that all three of the RAREs and the half site synergistically regulated RA-mediated CYP26A1 expression in HepG2 cells.  Cotransfection of each of the individual retinoic acid receptors (RARa, b, g) significantly increased relative luciferase activity.  Interestingly, in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, similar patterns of nuclear factor complex binding to RARE2 and RARE3 and to the RARE4 half site sequence in conjunction with proximal DNA were observed. RAR&#61537; was likely to play a major role in CYP26A1 expression in HepG2 cells. \n Together, these experiments demonstrate that additional RA-responsive elements upstream of the CYP26A1 coding sequence are both active and necessary for the strong inducibility of CYP26A1 expression in HepG2 liver cells.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6890], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yao ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yao", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A C Ross", "A Catharine Ross"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["A C Ross, Thesis Advisor", "A Catharine Ross, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["RARE", "CYP26A1", "all-trans retinoic acid", "promoter"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Mechanics in erythrocytes and multicellular structures", "id": "9593tv13c", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "13158", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the most virulent human malaria parasite, commits to either asexual or sexual development within the red blood cell (RBC). During its asexual development, the attendant increase in cell stiffness and cytoadherence leads to sequestration of infected RBCs in the microvasculature, which enables the parasite to evade the spleen, and leads to organ dysfunction in severe cases of malaria. During the sexual development, host RBCs sequester in the bone marrow and spleen cords due to their low deformability, thus avoiding clearance of the parasite during passage through splenic sinuses, and then reenter the bloodstream with increased deformability, allowing uptake of the parasite by mosquitoes. Despite the progress in understanding malaria pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the dramatic change in the deformability of Pf-infected RBCs have remained elusive. By recourse to a coarse-grained (CG) model, here we show that at the asexual blood stage, nanoscale surface protrusions, known as \u201cknobs\u201d, introduce multiple stiffening mechanisms through composite strengthening, strain hardening, and knob density-dependent vertical coupling. On one hand, the knobs act as structural strengtheners for the spectrin network; on the other, the presence of knobs results in strain inhomogeneity in the spectrin network with elevated shear strain in the knob-free regions, which, given its strain-hardening property, effectively stiffens the network. Our CG modeling further reveals that restructuring and constraining the spectrin network can fully account for the observed reversible changes in the deformability of sexual Pf-infected RBCs. In addition to providing a fundamental understanding of the stiffening mechanisms of Pf-infected RBCs, our simulation results suggest potential targets for antimalarial therapies.\nCellular forces (i.e. extracellular traction force and intercellular force) are crucial for various biological processes such as morphogenesis, cancer metastasis, and wound healing. Here cellular forces of multicellular structures were studied both experimentally and theoretically and their effects on cancer metastasis and cell morphology were examined. We measured the traction forces of epithelial HCT-8 (human colon tumor cell) colonies on polyacrylamide substrate and calculated the corresponding intercellular stresses. We found that traction forces quickly decay inside boundary layer along the inward radial direction, while intercellular stresses increase inside boundary layer along the inward radial direction and reach a plateau at the interior of colonies. An elastic model of epithelial colony is proposed to predict the spatial distribution of cellular forces. Our theoretical model suggests that the spatial distribution of extracellular and intercellular forces of cohesive epithelial colonies is attributed to the desire of cells to maintain an optimal and constant contractility.\nCancer metastasis has been commonly believed as a genetically programmed process. Here we show that cellular forces can also drive malignant transformation and in vitro metastasis of cancerous HCT-8 cell colonies cultured on hydrogels. We observe that the onset of metastatic-like dispersion into individual cells and malignant transformation of HCT-8 colonies depends on both gel stiffness and colony size: dispersion occurs for cell colonies on stiff gels but not on soft ones; on stiff gels smaller colonies disperse earlier than larger ones. Cellular force measurements, analyses, and manipulations converge to a force-driving dispersion model: there exists at the pre-dispersion stage a cellular force threshold above which the cell colonies disperse into individual malignant cells and below which the cell colonies remain cohesive. \nThe effects of cellular forces on bovine aortic endothelial cell (BAEC) morphology in multicellular structures were also investigated. BAEC alignment was observed in micro-patterned multicellular structures in the absence of fluid shear stress. Further analysis of traction force and intercellular stress shows that BAECs align with the direction of maximum principal stress, while traction force is not directly related to the BAEC alignment. It indicates that the geometry of multicellular structures can induce BAEC alignment via mediating the intercellular force.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12170], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yao ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Sulin Zhang", "Sulin Zhang", "Bernhard R Tittmann", "Patrick James Drew", "Peter J Butler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Sulin Zhang, Dissertation Advisor", "Sulin Zhang, Committee Chair", "Bernhard R Tittmann, Committee Member", "Patrick James Drew, Committee Member", "Peter J Butler, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["red blood cell", "deformability", "coarse-grained modeling", "traction force", "multicellular structures", "epithelium dispersion"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "RETINOIC ACID-INDUCED MAFB EXPRESSION DURING MYELOID CELL DIFFERENTIATION IN CULTURE AND BONE CHONDROGENESIS IN VIVO\n", "id": "12134", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13295", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-06-17T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Vitamin A and its active metabolite, all-trans retinoic acid (RA) regulate many physiological processes, such as skeletal development, cell differentiation, and immune functions. RA has been shown to induce monocytic cell differentiation and enhance phagocytic activity. Moreover, RA concentration is higher in hypertrophic chondrocytes, play an essential role in inducing chondrocyte terminal differentiation.  MafB, a basic leucine-zipper transcription factor, is involved in development and monocyte-macrophage differentiation. Microarray analysis conducted by our laboratory revealed that MafB was one of the most strongly regulated genes by RA in THP-1 human monocytic cells. Therefore, we have hypothesized that RA-induced MafB is a mediator in the differentiation of monocytic cells and chondrocytes. To address this hypothesis, my dissertation was divided into two parts. The first part was to investigate the role of MafB in RA-induced monocytic cells differentiation using THP-1 cells as a model. There were three aims under this part: 1) to clarify MafB expression under the condition of RA treatment in monocytic THP-1 cells; 2) to determine the downstream genes of MafB during RA- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) &#945;-induced monocytic differentiation; 3) to determine the requirement of MafB in the RA- and TNF&#945;-induced monocytic differentiation.  The second part of my dissertation was to clarify the roles of MafB in RA-induced chondrogenesis using rats as an animal model. Two aims was developed: 1) to investigate the alteration of MafB expression and other bone makers during the rat limb development under different maternal vitamin A status and oral vitamin A and RA supplementation; 2) to determine MafB expression and function during the RA-induced chondrocyte terminal differentiation. \nIn THP-1 human monocytic cells, MafB mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated by RA in a dose and time-dependent manner while, additionally, RA and TNF&#945; synergistically regulated MafB expression, mainly at the transcriptional level. SPOCK1, Blimp1 and CCL2 were indentified as target genes of MafB. Binding activity of MafB to the promoters of each of the target genes was increased in the RA- and TNF&#945;- treated cells. Conversely, reducing MafB protein by microRNA silencing significantly decreased the expression of SPOCK1, Blimp1 and CCL2. Moreover, the reduction in MafB resulted in decreased cell differentiation and phagocytic activity. Together, RA- and TNF&#945;-induced MafB may play a role in monocytic cell differentiation through transcriptional regulation of Blimp1, CCL2 and SPOCK1.\nIn a rat study, maternal dietary vitamin A (VA) intake was represented the range of VA in most human diet: VA marginal, VA adequate, and VA supplemented. Their offspring were studied at birth (P0) and postnatal day 7 (P7).  Half of the newborns received an oral supplement of VARA, or oil placebo. Maternal VA did not affect bone mineralization assessed by von Kossa staining; however, significantly differences (P<0.01) in the lengths of pups\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 femur and tibia were observed across different maternal VA diets. Only in the VA-marginal group, oral feeding with VARA significantly increased the length of the hypertrophic zone, close to the length in pups from VA-adequate group. Neither type X nor type II collagen mRNA was altered by maternal VA status, although VARA intake significantly enhanced type X collagen mRNA levels. However, one of the most important finding was that VARA-treated pup femurs from VA-supplemented dams decreased aggrecan, a major component of cartilage matrix, and increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)13 expression, which catalyzes degradations of aggrecan and collagens. This result suggests that maternal VA supplementation plus neonatal VARA treatment could potentially be unfavorable for early bone development.  Moreover, MafB was localized in both proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate. The expression in hypertrophic zone was stronger when maternal VA intake was higher. In cultured chondrocytes, RA dose-dependently increased MafB expression. MafB knockdown in chondrocytes resulted in an increase of aggrecan and a decrease of RA-induced MMP13. These results implicate RA-induced MafB as a regulator of chondrocyte gene expression and matrix formation via the control of aggrecan and MMP13 expression.\nIn conclusion, my study have provided a strong evidence that MafB was induced by RA, mediating RA-induced cell differentiation in both monocytic cells and primary chondrocytes.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12841], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yao ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["A.

Encryption is the process of doing so. In an encryption scheme, an encryption key and a decryption key are first generated. Given the encryption key and a message $m$, the encryption scheme generates the encoded message: the ciphertext $C$. Given decryption key and a ciphertext $C$, the encryption scheme can recover the original message.\n\nIn this thesis, we study some problems about security bounds and leakage-resilient models for encryption schemes, by showing tighter security bounds for encryption schemes, devising efficient constructions in the existing security models and proposing more powerful security models:\n\nPKCS \\#1 v1.5 is a long-standing and a widely used standard that defines a set of encryption schemes. Ciphertext Indistinguishability under Chosen Plaintext Attack (IND-CPA) is one of the most popular security definitions for public key encryption. In this thesis, first, we show the encryption scheme in PKCS \\#1 v1.5 is IND-CPA secure for messages of length roughly 8 times as long as in the previous work.\n\nSecond, we consider securely updating encryption keys in a security co-processor where information could be leaked to an attacker periodically. We devise a leakage-resilient key evolution scheme to address the problem. Our construction can update keys in a near-linear time in $n$, where $n$ is the length of key. Previous work on this problem updates keys in time $\\Theta(n^2)$. Our security analysis uses new results on the connectivity of random graphs.\n\nThird, we consider the \\emph{ auxiliary input model}, which captures settings where the attacker has some information about the decryption key. Previous work  only considered public-key encryption (PKE) in this model. In this thesis, we devise the first secure identity-based encryption (IBE) construction in this  model. IBE is more flexible than PKE in the choice of public keys. This makes it much more useful, but harder to achieve. We also extend the auxiliary model to a stronger model by allowing the attackers to have some information about the randomness that is used to generate ciphertexts. This new model is important as in some cases (e.g., cloud computing), the randomness used by encryptors (e.g., data owners) is weak. We devise secure IBE and PKE constructions in this new model.

As a result of these direct plant-to-plant connections with their host plants, parasitic plants have unique opportunities for horizontal gene transfer (HGT), the nonsexual transmission of genetic material across species boundaries.  There is increasing evidence that parasitic plants have served as the recipients and donors of HGT, but the long-term impacts of eukaryotic HGT in parasitic plants are largely unknown.\n\n\tThree parasitic plant genera from Orobanchaceae (Triphysaria versicolor, Striga hermonthica, and Orobanche aegyptiaca (syn. Phelipanche aegyptiaca)) were chosen for a massive transcriptome-sequencing project known as the Parasitic Plant Genome Project (PPGP).  These species were chosen for two reasons. First, the three parasites ranges from facultative hemiparasite to obligate holoparasite, which makes them excellent candidates for understanding the evolution of plants having heterotrophic capacities. Second, because they have destructively impacted important crops, especially Striga hermonthica and Orobanche aegyptiaca (syn. Phelipanche aegyptiaca), they are relatively well studied by scientists working on controlling these harmful parasites. The first half of Chapter 1 is a comprehensive introduction of parasitic plants.  The remainder of Chapter 1 is a detailed literature review on HGT studies on plants, particularly parasitic plants. \n\n\tChapter 2 introduces a gene encoding albumin 1 KNOTTIN-like protein found in Phelipanche aegyptiaca and related parasitic species of family Orobanchaceae that was likely acquired by a Phelipanche ancestor via HGT from a legume host based on phylogenetic analyses. Before our research, albumin 1 genes were only known in papilionoid legumes, where they serve dual roles as food storage and insect toxin.  The KNOTTINs are well known for their unique \u201cdisulfide through disulfide knot\u201d structure and have been extensively studied in various contexts, including drug design.  According to genomic sequences from nine related parasite species, 3D protein structure simulation tests, and evolutionary constraint analyses, the parasite gene we identified here retains the intron structure, six highly conserved cysteine residues necessary to form a KNOTTIN protein, and displays levels of purifying selection like those seen in legumes.  The albumin 1 xenogene has evolved through more than 150 speciation events over ca. 16 million years, forming a small family of differentially expressed genes that may confer novel functions in the parasites. Moreover, further data show that a distantly related parasitic plant, Cuscuta, obtained two copies of albumin 1 KNOTTIN-like genes from legumes through a separate HGT event, suggesting that legume KNOTTIN structures have been repeatedly co-opted by parasitic plants. \n\n\tChapter 3 summarizes the HGT findings in the PPGP utilizing a phylogenomic approach in identifying HGT events.  Twenty-two published plant genomes (Selaginella moellendorffii, Physcomitrella patens, Amborella trichopoda, Oryza sativa, Brachypodium distachyon, Sorghum bicolor, Phoenix dactylifera, Musa acuminata, Nelumbo nucifera, Aquilegia coerulea, Arabidopsis thaliana, Carica papaya, Fragaria vesca, Glycine max, Medicago truncatula, Populus trichocarpa, Thellungiella parvula, Theobroma cacao, Vitis vinifera, Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum tuberosum, and Mimulus guttatus), two asterid EST datasets (Lactuca sativa and Helianthus annuus), and four PPGP species (Lindenbergia philipensis, Triphysaria versicolor, Striga hermonthica, and Phelipanche aegyptiaca) were used in orthogroup classifications.  Phylogenies for each orthogroup were built and customized JAVA scripts were used to perform the initial HGT screening. Secondary manual screening was carried out using various criteria.  The final findings are presented in this chapter. With each finding, evidence from incongruent phylogenies, expression profiles for HGT genes, potential gene function, evolution constraint analyses, and genomic integration is discussed.  The majority of the transgenes show evidence of introns, indicating the HGT transfer happened at the DNA level, and not from a retroprocessed transcript.  We also identified two high confidence HGT transgenes in Striga hermonthica located adjacent to each other.  This is the first time a genomic integration of length greater than one gene has been identified in a parasitic plant, and suggests that a search for large integration fragments could be fruitful.  We are identifying HGT transgenes based on our EST datasets and this may be just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d of HGT in parasitic plants, as a lot of the HGT transgenes in parasitic plant genomes may be highly divergent pseudogenes and may not be expressed.  With more genomic data available in the future for the PPGP project, we would be able to tackle this question. We hope that our findings provide a rich pool for functional studies in the parasitic plants\u2019 research community.   \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9072], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yeting ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yeting", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Claude W De Pamphilis", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Tomas Carlo", "Naomi S Altman", "John Edward Carlson"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Claude W De Pamphilis, Dissertation Advisor", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Chair", "Tomas Carlo, Committee Member", "Naomi S Altman, Committee Member", "John Edward Carlson, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Horizontal gene transfer", "Parasitic plants", "Orobanchaceae"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "One-dimensional Fermi Gases with Rapid Control of Interactions: Toward the Observation of Dicke States and Exotic Superfluid Pairing", "id": "22661", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9756", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-03-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Mesoscopic systems with multi-partite entanglement have applications in quantum computing, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, and quantum enhanced metrology and can give insight into foundational questions of quantum mechanics. Systems in which entanglement develops naturally and persists in the steady state would allow a robust and simple means for creating high-fidelity, multi-partite entangled states.  This dissertation lays the foundation for creating highly-entangled Dicke states by such a process in a one-dimensional (1D) gas of fermionic atoms.  Toward this end, confinement of fermions in 1D and the rapid introduction of inelastic loss are demonstrated.  Rapid interaction control is achieved by driving Raman transitions to transfer atoms between two-component mixtures which exhibit either negligible or rapid inelastic loss.  Confinement to 1D is provided by a 2D triangular optical lattice potential.  Starting from this incoherent spin-1/2 Fermi gas in 1D, rapid inelastic two-body s-wave collisions should ultimately yield a fully-symmetric Dicke state in the steady state which is useful for multi-party cryptography and quantum enhanced metrology.\n\nStrong quantum correlations can also give rise to quantum collective phenomena such as exotic forms of superconductivity and magnetism. Dilute atomic gases are uniquely suited for their systematic investigation since system parameters can be independently tuned.  Such studies require the development of new probes.

This dissertation outlines how to definitively observe the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superfluid phase, an exotic form of superfluidity that coexists with magnetism, by observing quantum noise correlations in the momentum distribution.  Rapid transfer between strongly and weakly interacting mixtures, critical for faithfully reproducing the momentum distribution by ballistic expansion, has been demonstrated.  The choice of 1D confinement demonstrated here is motivated by the large parameter space anticipated for observing the FFLO phase in 1D.\n\nFinally, two new technical developments are presented: the use of molecular iodine transitions as a convenient frequency reference for the primary 6Li resonance and the generation of pure, high-order Laguerre-Gaussian laser beams to enable the study of spatially homogeneous Fermi gases of atoms.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9507], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kenneth O'hara", "David Weiss", "Jainendra Jain", "Lasse Jensen"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kenneth O'hara, Dissertation Advisor", "David Weiss, Committee Member", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Member", "Lasse Jensen, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["One-Dimensional Fermi Gases", "Entangled Dicke States", "Exotic Superfluid Pairing", "FFLO Phase", "Rapid Interaction Control."]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "An Optimization Protocol Applicable To Water Flooding Flow Rates On Pattern Based Field Development Studies", "id": "26222", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11232", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "  In view of various methods of depletion and relevant constraints, reservoir simulation is proved to be a reliable approach in estimating reservoir performance and production, and predicting the final recovery efficiency. Smart well control was initiated and developed in the 1970s, and predicted to be useful for enhancing field production efficiency for several specific cases. However there are scarce efforts in evaluating the influence of flow rates in optimizing the production of well patterned fields by reservoir simulation. Here a mathematical theory of oil production rate optimization was analyzed; the numerical module based on Jacobian matrix iterations was developed to provide solutions in field production simulation; an optimization algorithm based on Newton\u2019s method was developed and applied to the numerical module to find the optimized oil production rate and water injection rate to maximize production efficiency. The optimization process was applied to a five-spot well patterned field, with one production well in the center and four injection wells around it. Based on this approach in locating the optimum production schedule, the model allows estimating the ultimate maximum production rate locally by artificially controlling both the water injection and oil production rates, thus enhancing the production. The model is proved to be a useful tool to estimate well-patterned reservoir production by various tests. Sensitivity tests were also performed to accelerate the optimization process, which could substantially increase the feasibility of this model. It is evident that smart well real-time control of both water injection rate and oil production rate on the specified five spot well patterned black oil field within two months period will significantly enhance the recovery efficiency to the rate of 16%.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10775], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yi ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yi", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Turgay Ertekin, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["optimization", "water flooding", "flow rates", "well patteren"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "INVESTIGATION OF FUNCTION AND REGULATORY MECHANISM OF GENES CONTROLLING TISSUE GROWTH IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER", "id": "h702q637s", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12782", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-06-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tThe regulatory mechanism of tissue growth and organ size control in multicellular organisms is a long-standing question in developmental biology. It is known that proper organ size is determined by coordination of cell proliferation, cell apoptosis and cell growth, whereas how these processes are integrated and regulated is still under exploration. Previous studies have identified various genes and signaling pathways regulating tissue growth. In this dissertation, by using the well-established model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, I investigated the function and regulatory mechanism of different genes and pathways in controlling tissue growth in three different projects.\n\tIn the first project, the function of a novel gene, Drosophila defender against apoptotic cell death 1 (dDad1), in regulating tissue growth and cell apoptosis is discussed. Loss of dDad1 decreases organ size due to induction of cell apoptosis and suppression of cell proliferation. Our study reveals that two important signaling pathways, c-Jun kinase (JNK) pathway and UPR pathway, Perk-Atf4 branch in particular, are essential for cell apoptosis induced by dDad1 knockdown. Moreover, as a homologue of human DAD1, which is a subunit of oligosaccharide transferases (OST) complex, Drosophila Dad1 is also found to involve in N-glycosylation, and lack of dDad1 may lead to tissue growth defect through OST complex. In addition, cell compensatory proliferation was observed in our model and Perk-Atf4 signaling appears to play an essential role in promoting proliferation of neighboring cells to maintain the tissue homeostasis. Collectively, this study demonstrates the function and regulatory mechanism of a novel gene, dDad1, in cell apoptosis and compensatory proliferation, providing further insight in tissue growth and homeostasis regulation in Drosophila. \n\tThe second project aims to improve understanding of the role of microRNA bantam in growth control. In Drosophila, bantam has been identified as an important growth regulator through suppressing cell apoptosis and enhancing cell proliferation. Bioinformatics tools predict mats, which is a core component of growth suppressive pathway Hippo signaling, as a potential target of miRNA bantam. Since miRNAs are negative regulators of gene expression, the level of Mats is supposed to be downregulated by bantam. However, we found that microRNA ban upregulates Mats protein level in both developing tissues and cell lines of Drosophila. Further genetic experiment supports that bantam acts to enhance mats function. Our data suggest a model that miRNA bantam increases Mats protein level through an unidentified factor that may affect its protein stability.\n\tIn the third project, we found that protein kinase A (Pka), an important growth regulator, regulates Hippo pathway activity. In Drosophila, loss of Pka-C1, a catalytic subunit of Pka, promotes cell proliferation and induces supernumerary wing tissue, while overexpressing Pka-C1 stimulates cell apoptosis and decreases wing size. We found that Hippo pathway transcriptional activity is increased by loss of Pka-C1 and decreased by its overexpression. Our data suggest the potential importance of Hippo singling in Pka-regulated tissue growth and identify a new upstream regulator of Hippo signaling in Drosophila.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12153], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yifan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yifan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Zhi-Chun Lai", "Yanming Wang", "Robert Paulson", "Richard W Ordway", "Wendy Hanna-Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Zhi-Chun Lai, Dissertation Advisor", "Yanming Wang, Committee Chair", "Robert Paulson, Committee Member", "Richard W Ordway, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna-Rose, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["growth control", "cell apoptosis", "ER stress", "JNK signaling", "Hippo signaling"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "THE USE AND OPTIMIZATION OF STAINLESS STEEL MESH CATHODES IN MICROBIAL ELECTROLYSIS CELLS\n", "id": "10828", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6812", "abstract_tesi": "Microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) provide a high yield method for producing hydrogen from renewable biomass.

Stainless steel (SS) is very inexpensive, and cathodes made of this material with high specific surface areas can achieve performance similar to carbon cathodes containing a platinum catalyst in MECs. SS mesh cathodes were examined here as a method to provide a higher surface area material than flat plate electrodes. Cyclic voltammetry tests showed that the electrochemically active surface area of certain sized mesh could be three times larger than a flat sheet. The relative performance of SS mesh in linear sweep voltammetry at low bubble coverages (low current densities) was also consistent with performance on this basis in MEC tests. The best SS mesh size (#60) in MEC tests had a relatively thick wire size (0.02 cm), a medium pore size (0.02 cm), and a specific surface area of 66 m2/m3. An applied voltage of 0.9 V produced a high hydrogen recovery (98 \u00b1 4%) and overall energy efficiency (74 \u00b1 4%), with a hydrogen production rate of 2.1 \u00b1 0.3 m3 H2/m3 d (current density of 188 \u00b1 19 A/m3).

My dissertation aims to improve our ability to reliably identify cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in vertebrates. With the growing number of completed and high-quality draft sequences of several vertebrate genomes, comparative genomics and other bioinformatics methods have become first-line methods to predict and analyze CRMs. Recently, our lab has reported two large-scale investigations of Erythroid cis-regulatory modules, one of which used a systematic way to predict and test erythroid CRMs (RP-based computational predictions followed by report-gene assays), the other one used microarray coupled chromatin immunoprecipitation to identify in vivo occupied sites by GATA1.  The results were satisfactory; we successfully identified 42 functional CRMs and 63 in vivo occupied sites by GATA1. To improve the predictive power of the computational models and to investigate the power of motifs in predicting the occupancy, both conservation-based (ESPERR algorithm) and motif-based (direct enumeration of words) bioinformatic methods have been applied to current datasets for an attempt of decoding the genomic and bioinformatic signals that are associated with active DNA fragments.  ESPERR can distinguish known Erythroid CRMs from neutral DNAs, but it met its limitation when attempted to discriminate GATA1-occupied sites from unoccupied ones.  Direct enumeration of words can identify motifs that are predictive of occupancy given the presence of WGATAR, but we need additional signals to correct identify the one real binding sites from dozens of candidates. Repeated cycles of computational predictions and biological tests, with new knowledge being incorporated into each current model, should refine our ability to correctly identify cis-regulatory modules.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6802], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison", "Robert Paulson", "Ross Cameron Hardison", "Douglas Cavener", "Francesca Chiaromonte", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Ross Cameron Hardison, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Paulson, Committee Chair", "Ross Cameron Hardison, Committee Member", "Douglas Cavener, Committee Member", "Francesca Chiaromonte, Committee Member", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Cis-Regulatory Modules", "GATA1", "ESPERR", "Word Enumeration", "ChIP"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "An Analysis of Factors Predicting Click Through Rate During Web Searching Using Neural Networks \n\n\n", "id": "8169", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6950", "abstract_tesi": "In this research, I investigate the interactions between users and search engines during Web searching using Neural Networks (NNs) and data from two Web search engine transactional logs. The goal of this research is to identify factors that significantly affect the click through rate (CTR) of Web searchers. CTR, a metric for measuring customer satisfaction, is calculated by dividing the number of links that a searcher clicks by the number of the links that are delivered. The purpose of this research is to leverage user-system interaction data to improve CTRs and to design more efficient ranking and searching algorithms. The analysis in this research consists of two parts: basic data analysis and extended data analysis. Basic data analysis shows that users spend less effort on retrieving their information needs later in the day and on the weekend. Most people prefer using the Internet Explorer browser, selecting informational links, and searching the Web vertically. In the extended data analysis, two NNs are utilized: Multilayer Backpropagation Neural Network (MLPN) and Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFN). We investigate the characteristics and quality of these two kinds of networks by screening out the nonlinear behavior in the search logs. We then use the MLPN, by virtue of its higher efficiency compared with the RBFN, to detect the influence of significant information on the CTR. Our findings show that the number of organic links viewed, the type of vertical, and the type of user intent have a negative correlation with the CTR. However, we find that the number of queries reformulated by users, searching time, average query length, type of browser, and the rank of links sum is shown in the Searching Result Page (SERP). All are positively correlated with the CTR. Based on these results, some recommendations for improving the performance of the searching algorithms are provided. Implications of current research will present a new direction for future research. \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6947], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Ying ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Ying", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Industrial Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bernard James Jansen", "Enrique Del Castillo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bernard James Jansen, Thesis Advisor", "Enrique Del Castillo, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["RBFN", "MLPN", "transactional log", "neural network", "search engine"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "A Trade Space Exploration Process to Optimize Advanced Energy Retrofit Design for Buildings", "id": "18063", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8477", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-04-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Trade space exploration and multidimensional data visualization tools have been developed to facilitate design decision-making in an interactive environment.

The proposed non- parametric covariance regression model parameterizes the conditional covariance matrix of a multivariate response vector as a quadratic function of regression splines. The re- sulting conditional covariance matrix is positive definite for all explanatory variables and represents the conditional covariance as the summation of a \u201cbaseline\u201d covariance matrix and a positive definite matrix depending on the explanatory variables. The pro- posed approach provides an adaptable representation of heteroscedasticity across the levels of explanatory variable.

The asymptotic normality for the estimators is established and some numerical examples are used to illustrate the proposed procedure.\n\nTo cope with the high-dimensionality of the covariates, estimating the conditional covariance matrix through a modified Cholesky decomposition is proposed. The mod- ified Cholesky decomposition procedure associates each local covariance matrix with a unique unit lower triangular and a unique diagonal matrix. The entries of the lower triangular matrix and the diagonal matrix have statistical interpretation as regression co- efficients and prediction variances when regressing each term on its predecessors. It ensures that the estimated conditional covariance matrix is positive definite. To circum- vent the curse of dimensionality, a class of partially linear models are used to estimate those regression coefficients and local linear estimators are developed to estimate the nonparametric variance functions.

To understand the neural mechanisms governing the generation and learning of these complex motor sequences, the vocal system of songbirds has been used as an excellent model. Many studies have been focused on how the stereotyped song sequence is generated by the neural circuit of zebra finches. A more complex aspect of the birdsong, the syntactic organization of the vocal sequences that is common in both birdsong and human language, has not been well studied. The Bengalese finches sing variable songs that follow certain syntactic rules, and therefore can be used as a tool to study the syntax control of birdsong. This thesis progressively investigates where the song syntax is encoded in the Bengalese finch vocal system using various perturbation methods.\nThe first section of the thesis demonstrates that HVC, a premotor song control nucleus, plays an active role in encoding the syntax. Changing temperature in HVC strongly affects the length of the syllable repeats. In addition, the transition probabilities at several branching points are altered by temperature. In contrast, changing temperature in the downstream area RA does not affect song syntax. These findings suggest that the neural activity in HVC generates the syntax and is not instructed by inputs from higher order areas.\nAuditory feedback plays an important role in shaping the syntax of Bengalese finch songs. The second section explored how the real-time distorted auditory feedback (DAF) affects the syntax. The syllable repeats are reduced by DAF, which is similar to the effect of cooling HVC. This suggests that the auditory feedback influence on syntax may be mediated via HVC.\nSongbird singing is controlled by bilateral brain hemispheres. The third part of the thesis investigates the function of the two HVCs in timing and syntax control by unilaterally changing temperature in HVC. The left HVC is found to control the timing of the syllables, while both HVCs control the timing of the gaps. Most syllable repeats are controlled by only one hemisphere. The transition probabilities at the branching points are controlled by both hemispheres. \nThe final part of the thesis develops a method that can wirelessly stimulate the neural circuit in behaving small animals. The device is tested in a zebra finch whose song is altered by electric pulses during singing. Potential experiments are proposed for studying the neural mechanisms of syntax generation using this device.\nTaken together, all the four projects are dedicated to study the neural mechanisms of the syntactic sequence generation of birdsong.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9762], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yisi ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yisi", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Alexay Kozhevnikov", "Alexay Kozhevnikov", "Dezhe Jin", "Jun Zhu", "Christine Dolan Keating"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Alexay Kozhevnikov, Dissertation Advisor", "Alexay Kozhevnikov, Committee Chair", "Dezhe Jin, Committee Member", "Jun Zhu, Committee Member", "Christine Dolan Keating, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Motor sequence", "songbird", "neural circuitry", "syntax", "temperature", "auditory feedback", "hemisphere"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Regularization Parameter Selection for Variable Selection in High-dimensional Modelling", "id": "9543", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6806", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-24T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Variable selection is an important issue in statistical modelling.

This study concerns the low temperature oxidation chemistry of biodiesel-relevant compounds and the impact of fuel-bound oxygen in fatty acid esters on soot oxidation behavior.\n    Low temperature oxidation of biodiesel surrogates (i.e., C7, C8, C10 and C11 esters with both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic chains) was studied in a motored cooperative fuels research (CFR) engine under fuel-lean conditions. For each test series, engine compression ratio was gradually increased from the lowest point to the point where significant high temperature heat release (HTHR) occurred. At each test point, engine exhaust was sampled and analyzed via GC-MS and GC-FID/TCD. Within the test range of this study, all of the saturated esters exhibited strong cool flame behavior. Heat release results indicated that not only the presence of unsaturation in the aliphatic chain of fatty acid esters suppresses cool flame behavior, but also the suppression effect becomes more pronounced as the position of the double bond gets closer to the center of the aliphatic chain. Also, it was observed that cool flame behavior of fatty acid esters becomes stronger with the increase of the alkyl chain length.\n    Analyses of the intermediate species produced from low temperature oxidation of both saturated and unsaturated esters provided valuable insight into the major oxidation pathways of fatty acid esters at low to intermediate temperatures.  For saturated esters, in the low temperature regime, the aliphatic chain can experience a series of paraffinic low temperature oxidation steps leading to low temperature chain branching and producing various aldehydes, unsaturated esters and epoxy esters while the ester moiety remains largely intact. In contrast, within the test range of this study, the oxidation of unsaturated esters mainly follows the olefinic oxidation pathways. Furthermore, it is observed that the abstraction of H-atoms on the &#945;-carbon of the ester carbonyl group plays an important role in low temperature oxidation of saturated fatty acid esters. For unsaturated esters, under the current test conditions, the prominent feature of oxidation is the attack of radical species on the olefinic double bond. In addition, it was observed that a unique six-centered unimolecular elimination reaction channel may exist during the low temperature oxidation of fatty acid ethyl esters, yielding ethylene and alkyl acids.  \n    In this study, soots generated from the combustion of methyl crotonate (MC) and n-pentane (PEN) in laminar co-flow diffusion flames were analyzed via various analytical techniques to determine the impact of fuel-bound oxygen in fatty acid esters on soot oxidation behavior. \n    Thermogravimetric analysis of the soot samples collected from the diffusion flames showed that MC soot exhibits only slightly higher oxidative reactivity than PEN soot, which indicates that the fuel-bound oxygen in MC may not be able to help to enhance soot oxidative reactivity to any significant extent under the well-defined diffusion flame test conditions with the test fuels having the same number of carbon atoms. Therefore, the remarkable difference in reactivity observed between biodiesel-derived soot and Fischer Tropsch (FT) diesel-derived soot in diesel engines is likely due to the difference in combustion characteristics and soot formation process between biodiesel and FT diesel under diesel combustion conditions. \n    Furthermore, structural analysis was performed on both MC soot and PEN soot by applying X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (Raman) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Based on the analysis of the XRD patterns of the two soots at different stages of oxidation, there is no notable difference in crystallite structural parameters between MC soot and PEN soot. Also, the analysis of the first-order Raman spectra of the two soots revealed that there is no statistically significant difference in the  Id/Ig (i.e., the ratio of the integrated intensity of the D band relative to that of the G band) ratios between MC soot and PEN soot, indicating that MC soot is no more disordered than PEN soot. In addition, HRTEM images of the primary particles in unreacted MC and PEN soots showed that both PEN soot particles and MC soot particles exhibit a certain extent of graphitic structural arrangement. Moreover, there is no distinct difference in initial nanostructure observed between the two soots. Overall, structural analysis of the two soots via different analytical techniques consistently showed that there is no significant difference in structural arrangement between MC soot and PEN soot, which agrees with the lack of a notable difference in reactivity between the MC soot and PEN soot observed from the temperature-programmed oxidation experiments. To examine whether the fuel-bound oxygen from MC can remain in MC-derived soot as oxygen-containing complexes, XPS analysis was performed to the unreacted MC and PEN soots. It was observed that both soots have very similar surface O/C ratio (~0.11), indicating that it is unlikely that there are any appreciable amounts of fuel-bound oxygen from MC present in the MC-derived soot.\n    Overall, based on the experimental results obtained from the soot oxidation study, it is reasonable to consider that fuel-bound oxygen in the ester moiety of a fatty acid ester may not be able to have any significant contribution in enhancing soot oxidative reactivity under well-controlled diffusion flame test conditions.  \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6806], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yu ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yu", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman", "Andre Louis Boehman", "Harold Harris Schobert", "Angela Lueking", "Robert John Santoro"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Andre Louis Boehman, Dissertation Advisor", "Andre Louis Boehman, Committee Chair", "Harold Harris Schobert, Committee Member", "Angela Lueking, Committee Member", "Robert John Santoro, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biodiesel", "combustion", "low temperature oxidation", "autoignition", "motored engine", "soot", "diffusion flame"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Keeping Retailer's Cycle Service Level Under VMI Strategy -- A Regression Model", "id": "16039", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8076", "abstract_tesi": "As a product or service moving from supplier to the customer, it needs to go through many intermediate links, for example distributor and wholesaler.

Characterized by the high volume, velocity, and variety (3Vs) model, big data is valuable in many knowledge discovery applications, whereas requires new methodologies and technologies to manage and make use of the data. In this dissertation, a fundamental methodology and an emerging application of big data are presented. First, the parallel discrete distribution (PD2) clustering algorithm is designed and implemented. Discrete distributions are well adopted data signatures in information retrieval and machine learning, and discrete distribution (D2) clustering is a fundamental methodology. However, the high computational complexity of D2-clustering limits its impact on massive learning problems. PD2-clustering with substantially improved scalability facilitates unsupervised learning in many big data applications. Extensive analysis and experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of PD2-clustering. Second, satellite image analysis for storm forecasting is explored as an application of big data in meteorology. A large amount of historical satellite images and storm report archives are mined to predict storms. The proposed algorithm extracts visual storm signatures from satellite image sequences in a way similar to how meteorologists interpret them, and incorporates past meteorological records to model and classify the signatures. Such a big-data-driven approach aims at overcoming the intrinsic numerical instability of the conventional weather forecasting approach based on physical numerical models, and serves as a new component in a weather forecasting system.

These alterations in growth may also influence tolerance to other stresses, such as water stress. The objectives of this study were to examine the involvement of ethylene in phosphorus regulation of root hair density and length and basal root angle.  I also evaluated the effects of alumina-buffered phosphorus (Al-P), a novel phosphorus fertilizer that releases phosphorus at a much lower rate than conventional fertilizers, on growth and drought tolerance of woody plants and on seedling establishment of several tree species grown in containers with soilless media. \n\nLow phosphorus induced longer and denser root hairs in roots of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia.  The increase in root hair density partially resulted from increased number of cortical cells compared with roots grown in high phosphorus, which had eight large cortical cells. The increase in cortical cell number resulted in an increased number of trichoblasts. Ethylene manipulation affected root hair length and density, but not cortical cell number or trichoblast number. For example, the ethylene precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) added to high phosphorus medium could mimic the low phosphorus effect on the root hair growth, while ethylene synthesis and action inhibitors including aminoethoxyvinyl glycine (AVG), MCP (1-methylcyclopropene), or silver thiosulfate (STS) reduced root hair growth under low phosphorus conditions. Ethylene insensitive mutants, including ein4, ein2-1, ein3-1, ein5-1, ein6, ein7, and the mutant eir1-1, showed a reduced but still significant response to low phosphorus. However, results of root cross-sectioning showed that ethylene manipulation did not affect the number of cortical cells or trichoblasts in roots. Ethylene-insensitive mutants grown with low phosphorus produced more and smaller cortical cells, similar to wild-type plants. The pattern of trichoblast length change in response to phosphorus availability for both of the ethylene-insensitive mutants tested (ein2-1 and ein4) was similar to the wild type. These results suggest that low phosphorus and ethylene might operate via separate pathways to influence root hair density. \n\nThe genotype G19833 of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) had shallow basal roots that became shallower as phosphorus availability decreased, while DOR364 had deep basal roots that were affected by phosphorus availability to a lesser extent. These genotypes and recombinant inbred lines (RILs) produced from their F1 hybrid were used to study the role of ethylene in basal root gravitropic responses to low phosphorus. Basal roots grew shallower when ACC or gaseous ethylene was added to high phosphorus medium, especially the shallow genotypes. AVG and STS, on the other hand, prevented the change in basal root angle induced by low phosphorus. The extent of basal root growth angle change was proportional to the concentrations of ACC or AVG added to the media. A strong correlation was observed for the shallow genotype G198333 between basal root shallowness and the endogenous ethylene production rate. These results suggest that ethylene might mediate the response of roots to phosphorus availability and that genetic variation in ethylene responsiveness could be linked to basal root plasticity in response to phosphorus availability. \n\nAl-P reduced phosphorus leaching while improving plant drought tolerance. When plants were fertilized with Al-P prepared at a phosphorus desorption rate of 74 \u00b5M, vegetative growth of rhododendron (Rhododendron catawbiense Michx.), forsythia (Forsythia intermedia Zab.), Ohio buckeye (Aesculus glabra Willd.), and bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa Michx.), measured as plant height, stem caliper, and/or biomass, was as fast as, or faster than that observed with Osmocote or monoammonium phosphate fertilizer. Imposition of summer drought during the first growth season slightly reduced growth of rhododendron, with a stronger effect in the second year, while forsythia was more affected in the first season.  The drought effect on growth was mitigated by Al-P fertilization in forsythia but not in rhododendron.  When Al-P was used, more rhododendron plants produced flower buds in the first year, and at the lower desorption concentration, drought caused no reduction in the percent of plants producing flower buds.  \n\nThese results are important in understanding the regulatory mechanism of the responses of roots to low phosphorus limitation, and should be useful for breeders to develop crops with improved nutrient (especially phosphorus) uptake characteristics. The results can also provide information for agronomists and horticulturists to develop better cultural practices to reduce phosphorus fertilization and leaching.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6884], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yuan Ji ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuan Ji", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Horticulture", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch", "Kathleen Marie Brown", "Richard Craig", "Larry Judson Kuhns", "Simon Gilroy", "John Metzner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jonathan Paul Lynch, Committee Member", "Kathleen Marie Brown, Committee Chair", "Richard Craig, Committee Member", "Larry Judson Kuhns, Committee Member", "Simon Gilroy, Committee Member", "John Metzner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Phosphorus deficiency", "root response and ethylene", "root hair length and density", "basal root gravitropism", "woody plant establishment", "Arabidopsis thaliana", "Phaseolus vulgaris", "Rhododendron catawbiense", "Forsythia intermedia", "Aesculus glabra", "Quercus macrocarpa"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "CACHE-AWARE APPLICATION PARALLELIZATION AND OPTIMIZATION FOR MULTICORES\n", "id": "12153", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6810", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "All trends clearly show that multicore machines\nwill become the next generation mainstream  computer architecture. One reason for this is the fact that it is not possible to continuously increase clock frequency on single processor machines, since, beyond a point, power dissipation becomes a major bottleneck. In addition, with large numbers of transistors on microprocessor chips, it is becoming too costly to design and debug ever-larger and ever-more-complex processors in every two or three years.  Consequently, all major chip manufacturers have turned to multicore machines, which exhibit different architectural designs, in terms of the number of cores, on-chip cache topologies\nand interconnecting structures.\n\nOne of the critical issues regarding these multicores is the application software and system software support. In execution environments where the cores allocated (by the OS) to an application are managed by the application itself, without proper compiler support, it will not be easy to exploit the full potential of these emerging systems. Many parallel compilers and source-level code parallelizers have been developed to provide automatic parallelization and optimization. However, most of these techniques focus on the intrinsic parallelism and data reuse patterns exhibited by the application itself, while ignoring the underlying target multicore architectures. Being cache topology-aware is important for application parallelization and optimization, since cache topology determines the core connection and thus the data sharing between computations on different cores.\n\nMotivated by this, in this thesis research, we propose three different cache-aware  parallelization and optimization frameworks targeting multicores. While the first two frameworks focus on the computation and the data layout optimizations, respectively, for general multithreaded applications, targeting Network-on-Chip (NoC)-based multicores with Non-Uniform Cache Access (NUCA), the third one, optimizing both computation and data layouts, is designed for a domain-specific application, called the Non-Uniform FFT (NuFFT) data translation computation. In particular, our first framework takes a sequential program as input, applies tiling to each nested loop, and then employs a cache topology-aware tile mapping and scheduling strategy (for each nested loop). It considers temporal and spatial data reuses at the same time during mapping and scheduling, and generates a Pthread parallel code automatically for the user. Our experimental evaluation shows that, by applying cache topology-aware tile mapping and scheduling, application performance can be improved significantly, up to 21.6%, compared to a topology oblivious strategy. Our second framework takes an alternate view and optimizes the data layouts for arrays in an application. It includes three steps: array tiling, computation-to-core mapping and layout customization. The first of these tries to identify the affinity between data and computation taking into account parallelization information, with the goal of minimizing on-chip remote accesses. The second step maps computations (and their associated data) to cores with the goal of minimizing the average number of links traversed by remote accesses (distance-to-data), and the last step further customizes the memory layout taking into account the data placement policy adopted by the underlying architectures. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach improves, on average, data access latency and execution time by 24.7% and 18.4%, respectively, in the case of static NUCA, and 18.1% and 12.7%, respectively, in the case of dynamic NUCA. Compared to the first framework, which optimizes all parallel loop nests in an application at the same time, the second framework optimizes data layouts with respect to only one loop nest at a time, for example, the most time-consuming loop nest in an application. Combining these two frameworks into an integrated one is on our future research agenda. Our third framework, called NUDT, generates optimized parallel code for NuFFT data translation computation on multicores, which takes algorithmic and architectural descriptions as input, performs the data layout transformation, i.e., geometric tiling and binning, and then applies one of the two parallelization strategies we developed. These two parallelization strategies ensure load balance across the cores through dynamic task allocation, and guarantee mutual exclusion in data updates via different partitioning and scheduling schemes. They can be adapted to different target architectures as well as different input sample distributions. Our experimental evaluation shows that, our NUDT tool improves the NuFFT data translation significantly on multicores, and makes it no longer the bottleneck in the NuFFT computation, even for large data set sizes.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6808], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yuanrui ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuanrui", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Computer Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir", "Mary Jane Irwin", "Padma Raghavan", "Daniel Connell Haworth"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Dissertation Advisor", "Mahmut Taylan Kandemir, Committee Chair", "Mary Jane Irwin, Committee Member", "Padma Raghavan, Committee Member", "Daniel Connell Haworth, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["computation mapping and scheduling", "data transformation", "NuFFT data translation", "NUCA based multicore", "cache topology-aware", "parallelization"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "THE RECONSTRUCTION OF ANCESTRAL PLANT PROTEOMES REVEALS THE DYNAMICS OF EARLY LAND PLANT EVOLUTION\n\n\n", "id": "11984", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6897", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-03-14T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The conquest of land by embryophytes, and the evolutionary changes that accompanied this transition from an aquatic environment, required complex genomic and genetic changes that took place over hundreds of millions of years. The result of the genomic and genetic changes associated with land plant evolution was, among other things, a shift in gene content. Other important steps, such as lignified water conducting cells or the switch from gametophyte dominant to sporophyte dominant life cycles, seeds, and flowers also shaped the gene content of land plants and facilitated the evolutionary diversity and complexity of Kingdom plantae. The evolution of new categories of genes then contributed to plant diversity and phenotypic complexity.  Early land plant evolution and the reconstruction of Last Common Ancestors (LCAs) representing major steps in land plant evolution are of particular interest, because these ancestors allow us insight into what genomic changes accompanied each major evolutionary step. We report the reconstructed ancestral plant proteomes by using the sequenced genomes of 12 living plant species ranging from green algae to flowering plants. We used the MCL cluster algorithm to generate tribes and orthogroups and applied the Asymmetric Wagner algorithm to estimate the ancestral proteomic states at important nodes in the phylogeny of plants. We confirmed that, as the diversity and structural complexity of plants increased through evolution, proteome size correspondingly increased. By mapping previously identified whole genome duplication (WGD, polyploidy) events back to the land plant phylogeny, a possible linkage between polyploidy and proteome complexity emerges. However, we find that the rate of early plant evolution is not associated with WGD events. When we examine the functional classification of gene families in the ancestral proteomes, we see dynamic evolution in protein families with transcription factor activities, binding activities, and hydralase activities. Further quantitative analysis on transcription factor genes showed the different expansion patterns of sub gene families. We also find that the majority of newly gained orthogroups are originated within same super orthogroup. In general, the reconstruction of ancestral land plant gene sets illustrates the dynamics of ancestral plant evolution and can be used to identify directions for future research of plant biology.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6894], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yuchen ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuchen", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Claude Walker Depamphilis", "Webb Colby Miller", "Naomi S Altman", "Claude W De Pamphilis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Claude Walker Depamphilis, Thesis Advisor", "Webb Colby Miller, Thesis Advisor", "Naomi S Altman, Thesis Advisor", "Claude W De Pamphilis, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["ancestral proteomes", "reconstruction", "plant evolution"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Functional Genomics Of Theobroma Cacao Fatty Acid Biosynthesis:\nconvergence Of Fatty Acid Desaturation, Embryo Development, And Defense Signaling Responses\n", "id": "23518", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "10831", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-11-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Theobroma cacao L. (chocolate tree) is an important cash crop for 40-50 million farmers and their families in its tropical growing regions worldwide. Cocoa butter and cocoa powder extracted from cacao seeds provide the main raw ingredients for chocolate manufacturing, supporting a $80 billion global business. A unique fatty acid composition of cocoa butter makes its melting temperature close to the human body temperature, which is not only of particular importance for industrial uses, but also a valuable quality trait targeted by breeding programs. My Ph.D. dissertation focused mainly on the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in cacao seeds. I identified a key desaturase gene TcSAD1 from a large stearoyl-acyl carrier protein-desaturase gene family in cacao that plays a crucial role in converting stearic acid (18:0, saturated fatty acid) into oleic acid (18:1, unsaturated fatty acid). The expression of TcSAD1 was highly correlated with the change of fatty acid composition during cacao seed development. The activity of TcSAD1 rescued all the Arabidopsis ssi2 (a fatty acid desaturase) related mutant phenotypes, further supporting its in vivo functions. The discovery of the critical function of TcSAD1 offers a new strategy for screening for novel genotypes with desirable fatty acid compositions, and for use in breeding programs, to help pyramid genes for quality traits such as cocoa butter content. Moreover, because of the significance of fatty acid biosynthesis and lipid accumulation during cacao seed development, to further explore the regulatory mechanism, I functionally characterized of a master regulator, TcLEC2 gene, which controls both zygotic and somatic embryo development of cacao. Transient overexpression of TcLEC2 induced the expression of a variety of seed specific genes in cacao leaves. Furthermore, functions of TcLEC2 were explored during somatic embryogenesis, which is an in vitro propagation system for cacao. My results suggested that the activity of TcLEC2 determines the embryogenic capacity of the cacao tissue explants and correlated with embryogenic capacity of cultured cells. Transgenic embryos overexpressing TcLEC2 produced a significantly higher number of embryos compared to non-transgenic embryos; however, most of these transgenic somatic embryos exhibited abnormal phenotypes, and the development normally ceased at globular stage. This discovery may have future applications in increasing the efficiency of cacao mass propagation programs. Notably, in addition to major storage compounds in cacao seeds, fatty acids also function as signals involved in defense responses. I found that the endogenous level of 18:1 was modulated by exogenous glycerol application. Glycerol application on cacao leaves increased the level of glycerol-3-phosphate and lowered the level of 18:1 through an acylation reaction, which further triggered the defense responses. 100mM glycerol was sufficient to induce the accumulation of ROS, activate the expression of a variety of pathogen-related genes, and confer enhanced resistance against fungal pathogen Phytophthora capsici. My results demonstrated the potential of foliar glycerol application to become an environmentally safe means to induce the plant defense responses and fight important plant diseases in the field. \nTogether, my Ph.D. dissertation makes major contributions to three important research areas in cacao: (1) identification of the key gene regulating fatty acid composition in cocoa butter, (2) improvement of large-scale propagation system (somatic embryogenesis) of cacao, (3) enhancement of cacao foliar disease resistance. This thesis not only provides useful knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms of important quality traits at the molecular and genetic levels, but also demonstrates the potential of taking advantage of cacao genomic resources to accelerate cacao basic research and breeding programs.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10435], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yufan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yufan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Guiltinan", "Mark Guiltinan", "Siela Maximova", "Sarah Mary Assmann", "Ryan John Elias", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Guiltinan, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark Guiltinan, Committee Chair", "Siela Maximova, Committee Member", "Sarah Mary Assmann, Committee Member", "Ryan John Elias, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["cacao", "fatty acid biosynthesis", "fatty acid desaturation", "embryo development", "defense responses"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Microscopic Study of Statistics, Spin and Excitons in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect", "id": "14288yuz145", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14288", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-05-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is a marvelous physical phenomenon that arises in a two-dimensional electron gas subjected to a strong perpendicular magnetic field at low temperature. The microscopic origin of the FQHE for general filling factors is understood by the Composite Fermion theory, which explains FQHE of electrons as integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) of bound objects of electrons and an even number of vortices, known as composite fermions (CFs). Despite tremendous advances over the last three decades in our understanding of the FQHE since its discovery, many puzzles remain unsolved and many hypotheses remain untested. \n\nThe most interesting such hypothesis is probably the realization of certain exotic particles called ``anyons'', which interpolate between bosons and fermions. Anyons obey exotic braid statistics: fractional braid statistics refers to the property that braiding one particle around another produces a phase that is a nonintegral multiple of $2\\pi$; non-Abelian braid statistics means that braiding non-Abelian anyons not only produces a phase in the wave function, but also transforms the system to a topologically distinct state. Anyon is of great interest both for a demonstration of new physics and because of its potential application in fault-tolerant topological quantum computers. Despite tremendous efforts in the last three decades, anyons have not been definitely detected in experiments. We proposed to create and manipulate anyons by introducing auxiliary particles into a FQHE system. These auxiliary particles bind quasiholes of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state, and thus inherit the exotic braiding properties of the quasiholes. We showed that the braiding property of a pair of auxiliary particles is manifested through the density distribution of one particle when holding another particle fixed. This density distribution can be directly measured with existing experimental techniques in cold atom system.\n\nThe above demonstration of exotic braiding statistics, while still being at the level of a thought experiment, has the advantage that all the physics happens away from the edge of a FQHE system. Earlier proposals generally used interference of anyons moving along the edge of a FQHE system to reveal their non-Abelian braiding. The edge of a FQH state, however, may undergo a reconstruction due to edge exciton, and therefore lose its topological features. Motivated by certain discrepancies between theory and experimental measurements on the edge, we study in this thesis the edge physics of FQHE. We focus on the $\\nu = 5/2$ state, which is believed to realize the Moore-Read Pfaffian state that supports non-Abelian excitations, and the $\\nu = 7/3$ state, another state in the second Landau level that is studied in volumes of experiments. Using numerical simulations we find that the edge is unstable to a reconstruction for all experimental systems investigated so far, which must be taken into account when analyzing experimental results.\n\nApart from the topological properties of the FQHE systems, we have also been interested in pursuing the quantitative accuracy of the theory of FQHE and explaining various experimental results in a quantitative way. Previous theories usually considered the ideal limit in which all the electrons in a FQH state are in the lowest Landau level (LLL). In reality, however, some electrons are excited to higher Landau levels in order to lower their correlation energy. This behavior is called Landau level (LL) mixing which can make significant quantitative corrections for measurable physical quantities, and sometimes may even play a qualitative role. Other physical factors that can lead to quantitative changes include the finite thickness of an two-dimensional electron layer.\n\nWe study the transitions between differently spin-polarized states in the FQHE which provide a direct measure of the tiny energy differences between those states and thereby serve as an extremely sensitive test of the quantitative accuracy of the theory. Previous theoretical results for spin transitions were generally off by a factor of 2 or 3 compared to experimental data. We use a ``fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo'' algorithm to address the effect of LL mixing and also include finite-thickness effect based on realistic charge distribution. We find excellent agreement between our calculation and experiments. Our work demonstrates the most accurate comparison between theory and experiment in the FQHE field achieved so far, and also solves a long-standing puzzle about what the role LL mixing plays in breaking the particle-hole symmetry. \n\nIn addition to spin physics, we notice that a quantitative understanding of the tunneling transport in a bilayer FQHE system is lacking. We identify the interlayer exciton responsible for the peak tunnel current and provide a quantitative account of the bias voltage at the peak current (denoted as $V_{max}$). The excitonic attraction is shown to be quantitatively significant, and its variation accounts for the increase of $V_{max}$ with the application of an in-plane magnetic field. We have included the effect of finite thickness but not the LL mixing in this calculation because LL mixing does not affect the excitation gaps substantially. The excellent agreements with experiment also validate our calculation.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14858], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yuhe ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "first_name_ssi": "Yuhe", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain", "Jainendra Jain", "Chaoxing Liu", "Nathan David Gemelke", "Ismaila Dabo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jainendra Jain, Dissertation Advisor", "Jainendra Jain, Committee Chair", "Chaoxing Liu, Committee Member", "Nathan David Gemelke, Committee Member", "Ismaila Dabo, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["FQHE", "composite fermion", "braid statistics", "spin", "exciton", "microscopic study", "Monte Carlo"]}, {"year_isi": 2005, "title_ssi": "A MICROMACHINED THERMAL SENSOR FOR BIOCHEMICAL SENSING AND POLYMER CHARACTERIZTION", "id": "6712", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6890", "defended_at_dtsi": "2005-06-16T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This thesis presents a micromachined calorimetric sensor for the measurement of the molar enthalpy change of enzymatic reactions and their characterization using high resolution thermal conductivity measurements.

The results of the predicted thermal conductivity are compared to those available in literature for polyimide (~ 2%) and SU-8\u00ae (< 10%) polymers. \nThe device has also been used for monitoring real-time biochemical reactions as the thermal properties change with time due to the changing composition of the test fluid from reactants to products. Real-time enzymatic reaction for (glucose, urea) and antigen-antibody binding reaction (BSA, human fibrinogen) have been observed. This is the first demonstration of monitoring biochemical reactions in real-time using this technique.\nIn summary, a versatile thermal sensor for the study of thermal characteristics of various biochemical samples and reactions has been designed. The integrated microfluidic channel allow for continuous flow testing of various samples. In addition to the determination of the thermal properties of various polymers and biomaterials, the sensor platform can be easily implemented as a thermal fluid flow sensor and a hydrogen sensor.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6887], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Yuyan ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Yuyan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa", "Thomas Nelson Jackson", "Michael Pishko", "Qiming Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Srinivas A Tadigadapa, Committee Chair", "Thomas Nelson Jackson, Committee Member", "Michael Pishko, Committee Member", "Qiming Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["micromachined", "thermopile", "calorimeter", "biochemical", "polymer", "fluidic"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Design, test, and improvement of a low-cost apple harvest-assist unit", "id": "26275", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11524", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The U.S. is the second largest producer of apples in the world, with a wholesale value of $2.7 billion each year. Currently, apples are grown in 32 states in the U.S. However, the U.S. apple industry is in crisis mainly stemming from close dependence on a large seasonal workforce, coupled with a reduced labor pool and increased labor costs. Apple harvest is labor intensive, and currently, during apple harvest season, approximately 45,000 \u2013 50,000 pickers use buckets and ladders and pick each apple manually throughout the U.S. Apple harvest work includes considerable awkward postures, prone to causing occupational injuries. In addition, pickers are at risk of fall hazards when working on a ladder. In this project, a harvest-assist unit, aimed at fresh market apples, was developed and field tested.\nConsiderable research utilizing various concepts was conducted on mechanical apple harvesting since the 1950s, such as \u201cshake-and-catch\u201d harvesters, \u201ccombing fingers\u201d machines, \u201crod press\u201d mechanism, \u201cair jets\u201d machines, harvest robots, and harvest-assist systems. Based on literature review, the harvest-assist concept was selected to solve the U.S. apple industry issues. An apple harvest-assist unit was designed, fabricated, and field tested in 2013, during which the unit performed reliably. However, the unacceptably high apple bruising incidence of 48% was a main problem, especially considering this unit was targeting fresh market apples. The major component causing bruising was determined as the distributor for the following reasons: 1) the distributor itself caused 19% of the total apple bruising; 2) the distributor unsatisfactorily reduced apple speed, resulting in apples having high speeds when exiting the distributor, and the high apple speeds were prone to causing apple bruising. Two individual designs, the cone-shaped distributor and the brush mechanism, replaced the original distributor. Field tests demonstrated that the harvest-assist unit with the cone-shaped distributor and the brush mechanism mounted, resulted in 100% and 99% of harvested apples remaining in the Extra Fancy grade, respectively, after passing through the complete harvest-assist unit. \nWhile addressing the apple bruising issue, it was observed that padding was a key approach in decreasing apple bruising. Hence, research on establishing a model based on energy absorbed by one-layer and three-layer padding materials was established. The model was validated by the energy absorbed by a two-layer padding material. Correlation between predicted and actual absorbed energy yielded an r2 value of 99.17%, and slope and intercept of the predicted vs. actual absorbed energy linear regression curve were 1.0084 and 0.0210 Joule, respectively.\nApple harvest work was first categorized into 12 activities, and the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) method was used to analyze apple harvest activities and identify awkward activities that occurred during harvest. Awkward activities were determined as: ladder descending, dumping apples, picking high apples while standing on a ladder, picking low apples while standing on a ladder, picking high apples while standing on the ground, picking low apples while standing on the ground, and moving a ladder. It was also observed that pickers spent 63.5% of working time under awkward postures that needed to be changed soon or immediately. When working on the harvest assist-unit, awkward activities of ladder descending, moving a ladder, picking low apples while standing on a ladder and picking high apples while standing on a ladder were eliminated. Time percentage of awkward postures was decreased from 65.3% of the whole harvest time in conventional apple harvest approach to 43.3% of the whole harvest time using harvest-assist unit. In addition, this harvest-assist unit increased the overall apple harvest efficiency by 28.6%.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11033], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Zhao ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhao", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Jude Liu", "Andris Freivalds", "James Rawlinson Schupp"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Chair", "Jude Liu, Dissertation Advisor", "Andris Freivalds, Committee Member", "James Rawlinson Schupp, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA)", "apple harvest", "safety", "ergonomic analysis", "harvest assist-unit", "awkward postures."]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "New modeling Procedures for Functional Data in Computer Experiments\n", "id": "7537", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6997", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-02-26T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Along with the rapid development of computers, computer experiment becomes\nmore and more important in all the scientific research area.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevesiae, these genes are repressed by Crt1, which recognizes the DNA damage response elements (DREs) and recruits the global co-repressor complex Ssn6-Tup1. \n\nNucleosome positioning has been known to be important for gene repression for decades, but how it is achieved and maintained in vivo is still elusive. One factor, Ssn6-Tup1 has been identified and is believed to cause nucleosome positioning by binding to the tails of histones and spreading across the repressive chromatin domain. This is called the \u201cextended scaffold\u201d model.  Previous work from our lab has shown that Ssn6-Tup1 is responsible for nucleosome positioning at the DNA damage inducible gene RNR3. In an attempt to determine the mechanism of nucleosome positioning at RNR3, we first thoroughly characterizated the chromatin structure of the RNR3 locus using nuclease mapping strategies. We found that the entire RNR3 coding sequence and the upstream regulatory sequence (URS) (2.9 kb in length) is embedded in 19 well positioned nucleosomes, and DNA damage or deletion of CRT1 or TUP1 cause identical disruption of the positioning. Surprisingly, we, and others, have shown that Ssn6-Tup1 crosslinking is restricted to the upstream regulatory sequence (URS), yet nucleosome positioning extends far into the coding region. Thus, the extended scaffold model cannot explain how Ssn6-Tup1 positions nucleosomes at RNR3.  We investigated the role of known yeast chromatin remodeling factors in regulating the chromatin structure at RNR3 and found that the imitation SWItch (ISWI) family member ISW2 is required for the nucleosome positioning. In comparison with TUP1 deletion, ISW2 mutation causes equal nucleosome disruption from the TATA box to about +2 kb into the coding sequence, but the regions further upstream (where Crt1-Ssn6-Tup1 binds) or downstream (~+2.0 to +2.7 kb) of that resembles the wild type and are disrupted upon induction. We determined that Isw2p can be specifically crosslinked across the RNR3 gene using the ChIP assay. Interestingly, the crosslinking of Ssn6-Tup1 and Isw2 are independent of each other, suggesting collaboration of these two factors is necessary for the maintenance of the repressive chromatin structure. The Imitation SWItch (ISWI) chromatin remodeling factors have been implicated in nucleosome positioning in vivo.  In vitro, they can mobilize nucleosomes bi-directionally, making it difficult to envision how they can establish precise translational positioning of nucleosomes in vivo. It has been proposed they require other cellular factors to do so, but none have been identified thus far. By showing the dependency on Tup1 for ISW2 mediated nucleosome positioning at a subset of promoters, we revealed a novel collaboration between two nucleosome positioning activities in vivo. \n\nIn contrast to the dramatic increase in transcription observed in Dcrt1 or Dtup1 strains, only slight derepression was detected in an ISW2 deletion mutant, although the nucleosomes embedding the TATA box and the coding sequence were disrupted. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments demonstrated lack of TBP recruitment and preinitiation complex (PIC) formation. Thus, Tup1, which is localized to the URS independently of ISW2, can block PIC formation and repress transcription in the absence of nucleosome positioning. In addition to nucleosome positioning, HDAC recruitment and direct interference with activator or Mediator have been proposed for Ssn6-Tup1 repression. A clear analysis of the contribution of each repression pathway has not been described, however, mainly due to the challenge of separating the nucleosome positioning activity of Tup1 from the others. Our finding that in the absence of a functional ISW2 complex (and effective nucleosome positioning), Ssn6-Tup1 maintains the majority of the repression function over the DNA damage inducible genes, made it possible to specifically disrupt the nucleosome positioning ability of Ssn6-Tup1. We showed the remaining repression is mediated by histone deacetylase Hda1 and the Mediator complex subunits. Similar to ISW2 deletion, mutation of HDA1 or various Mediator subunit genes individually only slightly increased the transcription of the DNA damage inducible genes. Only in triple mutants simultaneously disrupted in ISW2, HDA1 and Mediator genes could significantly high levels of transcription be observed. We confirmed the association of Ssn6-Tup1 to the promoters in the various mutants. Thus multiple, redundant mechanisms are utilized by Ssn6-Tup1 in the regulation of the DNA damage inducible genes. Redundancy was also observed at other Ssn6-Tup1 target genes, with relative contributions of each mechanism varying. We propose that Ssn6-Tup1 has developed multiple mechanisms in order to function as a \"global\" co-repressor, and different groups of genes have developed different strategies to utilize Ssn6/Tup1 in repression.  \n\nWe further analyzed the function of the sequence specific DNA binding protein Crt1 in the regulation of the DNA damage inducible genes. Recruitment of Ssn6-Tup1 is mediated through a Crt1 N-terminal domain, which also interacts with the TFIID coactivator. The function of Crt1 C-terminus was unknown. We identified a Crt1 C-terminal repression domain which is, in contrast to the N-terminal domain, independent of Ssn6-Tup1 and histone deacetylases. We also further mapped the N-terminal repression domain and distinguished it from that required for TFIID interaction. Crt1 mutants were then constructed in an attempt to disrupt TFIID interaction but preserve Ssn6-Tup1 recruitment. All of the mutants repressed the DNA damage inducible genes, but most of them, called \u201cderepression-defective\u201d mutants, failed to release the repression upon DNA damage. Further characterization of the derepression defective mutants indicated that they are specifically blocked after corepressor release but before or during coactivator recruitment. These results imply a two-step activation model of the DNA damage inducible genes. The implications of this and the Crt1 conservation to its higher eukaryotic homologues, is discussed. \n\n \n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6995], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Zhengjian ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhengjian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Molecular Biology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Joseph C.

Both the position and composition of nucleosomes provide important roles during genome compaction and gene regulation.  MNase Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation followed by next-generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) allows scientists to investigate genome-wide nucleosome positions in a near base pair resolution.\n Chapter 2 summarizes principles, concepts, and philosophies in producing computer scripts, which I developed to process and analyze genomic MNase ChIP-seq data.  The resulting pipelines and script toolkits led to the successful analysis in Chapter 3, 4, and 5. \nFor example, while MNase ChIP-seq has revealed that the H2Av histone variant preferentially marks euchromatin promoter regions in fly, thus far no parallel study has been conducted on heterochromatic regions. In chapter 3 of this thesis, I compared the H2Av nucleosome patterns around same genomic features between euchromatin and heterochromatin.  I found that different genomic features have each have a unique H2Av nucleosome organization.  This study provided insight into the how nucleosomes are organized in the framework of the typically more compact and transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. \nHigh-throughput sequencing efforts in yeast also showed that nucleosomes are organized in a uniformly spaced array at 5\u2019 end of genes.  The mechanism underlying this array formation is far from understood and remains controversial.  In chapter 4 of this thesis, I investigated the contributions of DNA sequence, statistical positioning, and ATP-dependent trans-acting factors to genome-wide nucleosome positioning.  The genomic DNA sequence defines the thermo-dynamic landscape for nucleosome occupancy and this study shows that the position of the first nucleosome in the array is most dependent on DNA sequence. In collaboration with others I discovered a novel ATP-driven packing mechanism against a genomic barrier that drives nucleosome organization at the 5\u2019 end of most genes.  Poly (dA:dT) tracks in 5\u2019 nucleosome-free promoter regions (NFRs) generally excluded nucleosome binding, thereby forming one genomic barrier.  ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers pack nucleosomes against this barrier to form regularly spaced arrays.  The effect of chromatin remodelers lasts for about four nucleosomes into each genic array, after which the underlying DNA sequence directs nucleosome placement.  This new mechanism replaces three other prevailing mechanisms of nucleosome organization (DNA-encoded, statistical positioning, and transcription), and suggests that the packing mechanism creates nucleosome organizing centers that function to buffer nucleosome density and positioning against transient changes in nucleosome level that might occur during transcription and DNA replication.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7002], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Zhenhai ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Zhenhai", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh", "David Scott Gilmour", "Debashis Ghosh", "Yu Zhang"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Dissertation Advisor", "Benjamin Franklin Pugh, Committee Chair", "David Scott Gilmour, Committee Member", "Debashis Ghosh, Committee Member", "Yu Zhang, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Next-generation sequencing", "data mining", "ChIP-Seq"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Production Data Analysis of Naturally Fractured Reservoirs: A Density-Based Approach", "id": "26522", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9856", "defended_at_dtsi": "2014-06-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Significant amounts of oil and gas are trapped in naturally fractured reservoirs, a phenomenon which has attracted growing attention as the shale boom has evolved. The dual-porosity concept has been commonly used in modeling these naturally fractured reservoirs. In this model, the fluid flows through the fracture system in the reservoir, while matrix blocks are segregated by the fractures and act as the fluids sources for them. This model was originally developed for liquid in naturally fractured systems and therefore inadequate for capturing pressure-dependent effects in gas systems. \nThis study presents a rigorous derivation of a gas interporosity flow equation that accounts for the effects of pressure-sensitive properties. A numerical simulator using the gas interporosity flow equation is built and demonstrates a significant difference in system response from that of a simulator implementing a liquid-form interporosity flow equation. For this reason, rigorous modeling of interporosity flow is considered essential to decline curve analysis for naturally fractured gas reservoirs. \nState-of-the-art approaches to decline curve analysis have typically used pseudo-functions, yet these approaches remain limited in utility as demonstrated in many previous comparisons between analytical results and production data that revealed discrepancy. In this study, we show the gas interporosity flow equation eliminates the discrepancy at the decline stage and enables rigorous decline curve analysis for production at constant bottomhole pressure. We investigate the applicability of a density-based approach for decline curve analysis for production at constant bottomhole pressure in dual-porosity gas systems. This approach relates gas production profiles to their liquid counterparts by decoupling pressure-dependent effects from pressure depletion. This study further demonstrates the process of rigorous derivation for density-based decline curve analysis in dual-porosity gas systems. The interporosity flow equation for gas is used, and a deliverability equation for dual-porosity systems is rigorously derived in the process.\nIn light of density-based approach for production at constant bottomhole pressure in dual-porosity gas systems, a density-based, rescaled exponential model for variable pressure drawdown/variable rate production was developed for dual-porosity gas systems. We also explore straight-line analysis for convenient prediction of OGIP and production rate at variable pressure drawdown/rate production. This density-based model was tested in a variety of scenarios to showcase its validity. \nFurthermore, based on Warren and Root\u2019s model, a density-based exponential model for variable pressure drawdown/rate in dual-porosity liquid systems is proposed and verified. Then, a straight-line analysis is proposed to enable explicit OOIP prediction and convenient future production calculation. Aside from these, we develop a double-exponential decline model under constant BHP for liquid which is not only applicable to both decline stages but also convenient to implement.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9591], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Zhenzihao ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "first_name_ssi": "Zhenzihao", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Luis F Ayala H, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Gas", "Oil", "Naturally Fractured Reservoir", "Dual-Porosity", "Decline Curve Analysis", "Density-Based Approach", "Pseudo-Functions"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Predicting Petrophysical Properties From Rate-Transient Data: An Artificial Intelligence Application", "id": "13985zuz112", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13985", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-06-07T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Traditional methods to obtaining relative permeability curves and capillary pressure curves were expensive and time consuming.

An artificial neural network (ANN) can mimic any functional relationship with a finite amount of discontinuities. This study develops ANNs for predicting petrophysical properties for four different kinds of reservoirs-a circular black-oil reservoir, a rectangular black-oil flow unit, a circular volatile-oil reservoir, and a circular naturally fractured black-oil reservoir. The well setting for the black-oil rectangular flow unit is horizontal well while those for the other three types of reservoir are vertical wells.\nIn a very rapid manner, the developed ANNs infer characteristics of relative permeability for three phases, characteristics of capillary pressure curves for water-oil system and liquid-gas system, horizontal permeability and vertical permeability. With the predicted characteristics, relative permeability and capillary pressure data can be generated. The generated data as well as the predicted permeabilities can be applied in history matching and reservoir modeling.

The virtual entropy generation is a versatile concept that can be used in not only in measurement error, but also in quantifying defects in models or materials, numerical residual errors, etc.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [14989], "author_name_tesi": "Zhang, Zhifeng ", "last_name_ssi": "Zhang", "first_name_ssi": "Zhifeng", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science and Mechanics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Corina Stefania Drapaca", "Albert Eliot Segall", "Judith Todd Copley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Corina Stefania Drapaca, Thesis Advisor", "Albert Eliot Segall, Committee Member", "Judith Todd Copley, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Virtual entropy generation", "Reliablity and uncertainty control", "Second-Law of thermodynamics", "Heat exchanger"]}]
