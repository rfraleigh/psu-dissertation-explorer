The heat and electricity are produced at the point of use, avoiding the distribution losses associated with a centralized power plant. These appliances combine a conventional gas-fired condensing boiler with an electric power module capable of generating electricity from the heat of combustion. Currently, the leading power modules for micro-CHP appliances are free-piston Stirling engines (FPSEs) which can generate 1050 watts of electricity at a thermal-to-electric efficiency of 26%. These external combustion engines have been under development for the last 25 years, with FPSE micro-CHP appliances only recently being introduced to the commercial market. Publications by developers assert unlimited service life and high efficiency, with low noise and emissions; but despite these claims, the actual reliability and cost of manufacturing has prevented their successful mass-market adoption. A Thermoacoustic-Stirling Engine Generator or TaSEG is one possible alternative to FPSE's. A TaSEG uses a thermoacoustic engine, or acoustic heat engine, which can efficiently convert high temperature heat into acoustic power while maintaining a simple design with fewer moving parts than traditional FPSE's. This simpler engine is coupled to an electrodynamic alternator capable of converting acoustic power into electricity. This thesis outlines the design, construction, and experimental evaluation of a TaSEG which is appropriate for integration with a gas burner inside of a residential micro-CHP appliance. The design methodology is discussed, focusing on how changes in the geometry affected the predicted performance. Details of its construction are given and the performance of the TaSEG is then outlined. The TaSEG can deliver 132 watts of electrical output power to an electric load with an overall measured thermal-to-electric (first law) efficiency of 8.32%, corresponding to 14% of Carnot. The volumetric power density of this TaSEG is 8.9 kW/m^3. While the demonstrated overall efficiency is modest (for reasons that are largely understood), this TaSEG has moved the technology away from laboratory prototypes toward a commercially viable power module having a design configuration suitable for implementation in a micro-CHP appliance. Based on the TaSEG's measured experimental performance results, recommendations for future work that might improve the overall efficiency of the TaSEG are also presented.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15441], "author_name_tesi": "Wilcox, Douglas Alan", "last_name_ssi": "Wilcox", "middle_name_ssi": "Alan", "first_name_ssi": "Douglas", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Acoustics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Robert Keolian", "Thomas B Gabrielson", "Victor Ward Sparrow", "Martin Wesley Trethewey", "Philip Spoor"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Robert Keolian, Dissertation Advisor", "Thomas B Gabrielson, Committee Chair", "Victor Ward Sparrow, Committee Member", "Martin Wesley Trethewey, Committee Member", "Philip Spoor, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Thermoacoustic", "Cogeneration", "Micro-CHP"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Development and utilization of spectroscopic and chemical methodologies for investigating pKa shifting in nucleic acids", "id": "19229", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9251", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-07-31T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "RNA has historically been thought to play an intermediary role in the flow of genetic information between DNA and proteins. With its 2\u2019 hydroxyl, RNA is much less stable than DNA, which makes it amenable to a transitional role rather than one of storage. Proteins are equipped with 20 chemically diverse amino acid side chains, surpassing the functional potential of the four heterocycles that make up RNA. However, with the discovery of catalytic RNA (or ribozymes) in 1982, RNA was no longer limited to the transitional role it was once believed to have. The discovery of catalytic RNA shed light on RNA\u2019s potential to actively participate in biological processes.\nProteins can act catalytically as a result of an electrostatic contribution with pKa\u2019s of amino acid side chains far from neutrality to form a charged species at neutrality or with side chain pKa\u2019s near neutrality to allow for participation through proton transfer. However, the pKa\u2019s of single stranded nucleobases are far from neutrality, inhibiting participation in catalysis. Because Watson-Crick base pairing requires the formation of hydrogen bonds, the pKa\u2019s of the nucleobases are shifted even further from neutrality, significantly decreasing the potential for catalytic activity. The pKa\u2019s of the nucleobases must be shifted towards neutrality in order to act catalytically in a manner analogous to amino acid side chains.\nSome non-canonical interactions shift RNA pKa\u2019s towards neutrality, enabling the nucleobases to act catalytically. Interactions that facilitate protonation of nucleobases occur in both secondary and tertiary motifs and allow RNA to play a much more diverse role than the intermediary role once thought. Protonated nucleobases participate in many biological processes such as general acid-base catalysis of ribozymes, programmed ribosomal frameshifting, miRNA processing, and RNA editing. We hypothesize that RNA systems can contain protonated motifs that participate in biological processes but confirmation of protonation in these systems is limited by existing methods.\nTo determine the driving forces for pKa shifting, the development of a new method for determining pKa\u2019s was essential. Spectroscopic methods currently exist to quantify pKa shifting in nucleic acid systems; however, spectroscopic analysis by these methods requires high sample concentration, costly sample preparation and lengthy experimental time. Additionally, some existing spectroscopic methods such as UV-Vis spectroscopy and CD require a large conformational change to produce an observable signal change between protonated and deprotonated states, therefore limiting the size of systems that can be analyzed. I developed a new method using fluorescence spectroscopy to determine pKa\u2019s in nucleic acids. Development of this method utilized fluorescence quenching of 2-aminopurine (2AP), a fluorescent isomer of adenine, when stacked. Positioning the 2AP adjacent to the protonated base allowed for high fluorescence when the base pair wasn\u2019t formed and low fluorescence when the base pair was formed and the 2AP fluorescence was quenched due to stacking. The pKa\u2019s obtained with fluorescence spectroscopy agreed with those obtained with a previously developed 31P NMR method. The pKa of adenine in an A+\uf09fC wobble in a DNA hairpin was measured accurately with fluorescence at one-third of the cost and 10 percent of the required experimental time of 31P NMR. In addition to utilization of the technique on DNA secondary motifs, I also determined the pKa of a cytidine participating in a base quartet in the beet western yellows virus (BWYV) RNA. Protonation of C8 in the BWYV RNA enables pseudoknot formation and programmed ribosomal frameshifting.\nPrevious studies have been performed in the Bevilacqua lab to determine the salt, temperature, and context dependence of pKa shifting in DNA while the sequence remained constant. In nature, however, sequence can also contribute to pKa shifting. Using 31P NMR, I determined the pKa of adenine in an A+\uf09fC wobble in an RNA hairpin in various sequence and structural environments. Strengthening the base pairing of nearest neighbors from two weak A-U nearest neighbors to two strong G-C nearest neighbors enabled an additional pKa shift of 1.6 units, up to 8.1. A similar dependence on the melting temperature and free energy on the oligonucleotide sequence was found through thermal denaturation experiments as both parameters were more favorable with increased nearest neighbor base pairing strength, indicating that the addition of stability and more favorable interactions contributes to the stability of the construct as well as pKa shifting. The pKa\u2019s determined were between 6.5 and 8.1, suggesting that sequence could play a role in tuning pKa\u2019s near physiological pH. We hope that the trends presented in this study will serve as a model to aid in the determination of the roles protonated bases play in various dsRNA-mediated processes in biology.\nThe aforementioned studies use fluorescence and NMR spectroscopies to determine pKa\u2019s in nucleic acids. In those cases, systems were designed with a suspected protonated nucleobase whose identity was known before quantifying pKa shifting. Although spectroscopic methods are useful in determining the pKa of nucleobases with elevated pKa\u2019s to confirm protonation and quantify pKa values, many systems contain protonated nucleobases of unknown identity and spectroscopic methods are unable to readily identify the protonated nucleobase. In an effort to address this problem, I made significant progress towards the development of a chemical methodology to damage and map protonated bases in large RNA systems utilizing elevated reactivity of cationic over neutral nucleobases. Ultimately, the development of a reagent to map protonated bases in large RNA systems should be possible but significant efforts need to be made in the future to determine the optimal reaction and analysis conditions.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9061], "author_name_tesi": "Wilcox, Jennifer Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Wilcox", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Chemistry", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Philip C.

Chemotherapeutic agents often require large doses and are often not water soluble, which both lead to significant side effects.  The side effects of chemotherapeutics are related to the non-specificity of cellular uptake, so both healthy and cancer cells are affected.  Nanoscale materials are one of the possible options for limiting the side effects of cancer treatments and improving efficacy.  Calcium Phosphosilicate nanoparticles (CPSNPs) are one of the most promising subsets of nanomedicine.  At physiological conditions the CPSNPs are stable, and upon entering cancer cells (acidic pH) CPSNPs dissolve and deliver the therapeutic or imaging agents.  The objectives and chapter summaries are described in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 is a literature review of the nanomedicine design criteria and background of the CPSNP material system.\n\nAn optimized approach to van der Waals assisted microsphere laundering (VAML) process for the removal of Igepal\u00ae CO-520 from Citrate-CPSNP suspensions and is described in Chapter 3.  The parameters that were evaluated for their role in the VAML process were the mass of microspheres (Expancel 461 DE 20 d70), number of wash cycles, elution volume, and separatory funnel volume.  It was determined that microsphere mass did not affect the rhodamine WT (RhWT) CPSNP suspension concentration, but there was a significant difference in surface tension values between masses.  A mass of 2 mg/mL (mass of microspheres per mL of unlaundered Citrate-CPSNP suspension) was determined to reduce the surfactant concentration the most.  Next, the number of ethanol (pH adjusted) wash cycles was evaluated.  The number of washes showed a slight decrease in RhWT concentration as wash number increased, but also a significant decrease in surfactant concentration.  The optimal number of washes was five for a balance of RhWT and surfactant concentrations.  Elution volume is another factor to control with this process, and decreasing the volume of 70:30 ethanol-water increased the RhWT concentration without affecting surfactant concentration.  Furthermore, the volume or scale of the separatory funnel did not affect the final RhWT concentration, demonstrating a scalable process.  This chapter establishes a protocol for a highly scalable nanoparticle laundering process, increasing the feasibility of large scale in vivo studies and clinical trials.\n\nChapter 4 focuses on the applications and in vitro capability of the VAML processed CPSNPs.  The removal of Igepal\u00ae CO-520 to below cytotoxic concentrations was demonstrated with a cell proliferation assay conducted on MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells.  Citrate-RhWT CPSNPs at varied concentrations did not demonstrate any cytotoxicity with MDA-MB-231, confirming the removal of surfactant from suspensions.  The cytotoxicity of gemcitabine monophosphate (GemMP) and 5-fluoro-2\u2019-deoxyuridine 5\u2019-monophosphate (FdUMP), two metabolites of commonly prescribed chemotherapeutics, were evaluated as both free drug and encapsulated within CPSNPs on MDA-MB-231 cells.  Each of these drugs demonstrated cytotoxicity at lower concentrations when encapsulated, compared to free drug.  Additionally, a bioconjugation strategy was developed for the active targeting of metastatic breast cancer, utilizing anti CD71 (aCD71).  aCD71 is an antibody for the human transferrin receptor, which is overexpressed on the surface of cancer cells compared to healthy cells.  aCD71-RhWT CPSNPs demonstrated higher levels of uptake in MDA-MB-231 cells when compared to untargeted RhWT CPSNPs.  MDA-MB-231 was also co-cultured with MC3T3 human osteoblast cells to simulate the metastasis of breast cancer to bone, to evaluate the efficacy of aCD71 as a target within the bone microenvironment.  The aCD71-RhWT CPSNPs and untargeted RhWT CPSNPs did not show uptake in osteoblasts, but the aCD71-RhWT samples still demonstrated higher levels of uptake.  These in vitro studies lay the foundation for targeted delivery of chemotherapeutic loaded CPSNPs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [15434], "author_name_tesi": "Wilczynski, Zachary Ryan", "last_name_ssi": "Wilczynski", "middle_name_ssi": "Ryan", "first_name_ssi": "Zachary", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Bioengineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["James H.

Many of the private landowners living in affected areas turned to landowner coalitions as a tool for information sharing and collective bargaining. Landowner groups have played an instrumental role in shale gas development in the Marcellus region. In Pennsylvania alone, nearly forty landowner groups have formed to gain collective bargaining power in negotiations with industry representatives.  Little research has been done to evaluate the outcomes attained by landowner coalitions in Pennsylvania or explore how they have affected shale gas development in the region. Using primary data collected throughout a five-county region in Northeastern Pennsylvania, this research seeks to fill this gap. \n\nFindings reveal three main categories of landowner coalitions and outlines a typical timeline of the process from inception to signing leases. While landowner coalitions generally received better lease terms, bonus payments, and royalty percentages on average than did individuals operating within the same context, and ultimately provided benefits to the greater community, this research identifies situations in which the landowner coalition model would not be beneficial. Variables of coalition success, both internal group characteristics and external contextual factors, are also identified. Focusing specifically on the effects of landowner coalitions on Pennsylvania\u2019s farm operations, this research finds that participating in a landowner coalition helped farmers by enhancing an economic windfall used to maintain or reinvest in the farm, and procuring lease terms that were particularly advantageous for protecting farming operations. However, sometimes the additional income created unforeseen economic consequences and some land took a long time to be truly productive again after development. Research suggests that the landowner coalition model may prove promising in application to other land use issues on the rural landscape, and continues to be used in negotiations of natural gas and wind energy leasing. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16346], "author_name_tesi": "Wildermuth, Grace Amanda", "last_name_ssi": "Wildermuth", "middle_name_ssi": "Amanda", "first_name_ssi": "Grace", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Rural Sociology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kathryn Jo Brasier", "Leland Luther Glenna", "Carolyn Sachs"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kathryn Jo Brasier, Thesis Advisor", "Leland Luther Glenna, Committee Member", "Carolyn Sachs, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Marcellus Shale", "Community-based Natural Resource Managment", "Cooperatives", "Social Movements", "Lease Negotiations", "Shale Gas"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Targeted Liposomes for Treatment of ALS in Mutant SOD1-G93A Mouse Model", "id": "8464", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4671", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-06-03T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurological disease characterized by the selective death of motor neurons.  There is substantial evidence that degeneration is propagated by activated microglia and accompanying inflammation.  To this end, several therapeutic agents have aimed to curb microglia activation, albeit with little success.  The present study aimed to increase site-specific concentration and thus drug efficacy with the use of an osmotic intracerebroventricular (ICV) pump by delivering minocycline contained in liposomes with a targeting moiety specific to microglial cell surface markers.  It was hypothesized that attenuating microglial activation would delay the kinetics of disease progression.  The potential therapeutic efficacy of this approach was shown in both in vitro models with mouse microglia-derived BV-2 cells as well as an in vivo model involving mutant SOD1G93A mice.  The in vitro results indicate that targeting the TLR4/LPS complex significantly increases (p<0.05) the uptake of drug by 29% compared to non-targeted liposomes.  In the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS, both targeted and non-targeted minocycline treatment significantly increased (p<0.05) latency to endpoint stages compared to control mice receiving no treatment.  Although, targeting treatment to microglia only slowed later disease progression with statistical significance.  The results of this study provide evidence for a greater role of microglia in disease progression, and not disease onset, and suggests targeting microglia provides a viable therapeutic target for slowing progression after initial clinical diagnosis.

Among the various neutron detection technologies, 3He detectors combined with moderating materials still serve as a benchmark. Costs associated with the use of 3He have become prohibitively expensive, as a result of the scarcity of this isotope, which precipitates the need for the development of cost effective and efficient alternative technologies. A critical design feature of any replacement technology includes the ability to effectively detect and separate neutron and gamma events for independent analysis. Active and passive interrogation techniques result in SNM exhibiting various modes of decay, giving off a spectroscopic fingerprint for detection and identification. Harnessing the signatures of both gamma and neutron emissions reduces the limitations associated with the shielding effects of the surrounding media, and inherent to the penetrability of each type of radiation. Additionally, ascertaining the incident neutron energy spectrum would further enhance detection capabilities by helping to determine the type of radioactive material in question.\nIn this work, the design, construction, and operation of a detector capable of both separating neutron and gamma events to a high degree and performing fast neutron spectroscopy is reported. Pulse shape discrimination (PSD), by way of charge integration, provides excellent neutron/gamma separation. Furthermore, use of the capture-gated technique identifies neutron thermalization events occurring within the detector for further spectroscopic analysis.

Though the magnitude of this effect can vary based on age, gender, and neurological conditions, the effect is present in any multi-finger force production.  However, the relation between enslaving and handedness has not been thoroughly explored.  The dominant hand is known to be more dexterous and is given wider use in most tasks.  Since enslaving effects are an indication of finger individuation, it is hypothesized that the non-dominant hand will have higher enslaving effects than the dominant hand.  Twenty-two, male, right-handed subjects were tested with the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory, the Grooved Pegboard test, and the Jebsen-Taylor test to assess their levels of handedness.  They also completed maximum voluntary contractions (MVC) with all fifteen single, double, triple, and quadruple finger combinations for both dominant and non-dominant hands.  These MVC results were used to construct a neural network model of force production, which was used to obtain an interfinger connection matrix (IFC).  From the IFC, overall enslaving indices for each hand were calculated, as well as individuation and stationarity indices for each individual finger.  The dominant hand was found to be stronger than the non-dominant hand.  In addition, the individuation patterns of the fingers followed the general patterns observed in previous studies of enslaving and finger individuation.  However, enslaving indices were not found to be significantly different between the dominant and non-dominant hands.

Thornton first theorized over forty years ago that the perception of brightness could be increased by placing energy in the spectral regions at and near 450, 530 and 610 nm, which he called the prime color spectral regions. He further identified the areas at and near 495 and 575 nm as having deleterious effects on color preference and termed these anti-prime color regions. Hurvich\u2019s opponent signal sensitivity curves have a relative sensitivity of zero where the sensitivity switches between blue and yellow at 500 nm and switches between red and green at 480 and 580 nm. This dissertation focused on removal of optical radiation near anti-prime spectral regions, where the opponent signal relative sensitivity is zero, and resulting perceptions of brightness and color preference.\n\nThis dissertation examined brightness and preference differences between a reference spectrum and three test spectra that had less optical radiation in the spectral regions near 500, 580, or 500 and 580 nm. Two experimental methodologies were employed, forced choice discrimination at fixed illuminance levels, and brightness matching. Energy was removed from the regions of 500 and 580 nm, with some energy added to other regions of the visible spectrum as necessary to maintain consistent chromaticity. Brightness discrimination and brightness matching experimental methodologies were both employed in order to examine if these methodologies would produce comparable results.\n\nThe research aimed to answer the following questions:\n\n1.\tDo spectra with energy reallocated from the regions of either 500, 580, or 500 and 580 nm appear brighter than a nearly continuous reference spectrum?\n2.\tDo the experimental methodologies side-by-side brightness matching and side-by-side brightness discrimination (forced choice) produce comparable results?\n3.\tDoes the reallocation of energy from the regions of 500, 580, or 500 and 580 nm change preference for a person\u2019s own skin tone?\nThe test spectrum with energy reallocated near the spectral region of 500 nm (SPD500) and the test spectrum with energy reallocated near the spectral region of 500 and 580 nm (SPD500,580) appeared brighter than the reference spectrum (SPDRef) at equal illuminance, reaching statistical significance for both the brightness matching and brightness discrimination experiments. No statistical difference in brightness was found between the test spectrum with energy reallocated near the spectral region of 580 nm (SPD580) and SPDRef. \n\nThe side-by-side brightness matching experimental methodology and the side-by-side brightness discrimination experimental methodology produced comparable results. The rank order of the reference and test spectra was similar for both experimental methodologies. The illuminance ratio of SPD500,580 versus SPDRef at equal perceived brightness was 94.2% for the brightness discrimination experiment and 95.6% for the brightness matching experiment. The ratio of  SPD500 versus SPDRef was 95.5% and 98.1% for the discrimination and matching experiments, respectively. The ratios from the two experiments were both found to be significantly different from each other. The SPD580 versus SPDRef ratios resulting from the two experiments were not significantly different. The brightness matching ratios were closer to unity, unity indicating no difference, for every spectrum comparison versus the brightness discrimination ratios.\n\nSPD580 was preferred versus SPDRef for 72.8% of the comparisons between the two spectra. Similarly, SPD500,580was preferred versus SPDRef for 70.0% of the comparisons between the two spectra. SPD500,580  and SPD580 were both significantly different than SPDRef at an alpha level of 0.01.  The rank order resulting from the preference experiment matched the rank order of the following metrics: Gamut Area Index, Color Quality Scale 9.0 Qg, Farnsworth Munsell Gamut, Color Preference Index, Color Discrimination Index and Feeling of Contrast Index. SPD580 had the highest preference rank, however it had the lowest CIE Color Rendering Index and R9 rank.\n\nThe results of all three experiments show that SPD500,580 is the superior spectrum in comparison to SPDRef, SPD500 and SPD580. SPD500,580 appeared brighter at equal illuminance than SPD500 and SPD580 when compared to SPDRef.

However, farmers are not able to maximize yield potential due to pests and plant diseases that destroy as much as 10- 80% of annual production. The arrival of devastating insect related diseases like black pod (Phytophthora megakarya) and cocoa swollen shoot (Badnavirus) means yield losses can approach 100%. Both diseases are influenced by ant communities. Cocoa ant species form mutualistic networks with honeydew producing mealybugs that supply the majority of their energy food source. In order to safeguard their food source, ants transport soil onto cocoa trees and build tent-like structures to shelter mealybugs. The virus-vector mealybugs are either transported around the cocoa tree by ants, which also protect the mealybugs as they feed. The water mold infects the tree after the ants have transported soils containing infectious spores to the developing pods. The ants do this to form soil tents over the colony of mealybugs feeding on the plant. The transport of disease agents means that ant attendance directly effects cocoa plant fitness. While the occurrence of tent building ant genera, Camponotous, Pheidole and Crematogaster, has a detrimental impact on yields, the presence of a different ant genus, Oecophylla, reduces pod damage by defending trees against pest prevalence. In order to control insect-related decline, farmers should be cognizant of insect dynamics and make decisions based on observations and availability of pest management resources. The ability to manage pests and aid the proliferating of beneficial species is contingent on the farmers\u2019 ecological understanding of the cocoa ecosystem. 90% of farmers correctly implicated pests as responsible for causing holes, dark legions soil on cocoa pods. In addition to having awareness of major cocoa diseases and damage, 61% of farmers were correctly identified pests and beneficial insects. My approach includes testing the efficacy of pesticide alternatives, developing technologies to accurately detect pests and damage, and conduct sociological examinations to uncover the farmers\u2019 ecological knowledge of cocoa insects. Recognizing the shortage of entomological experts to help farmers I also explored the application of machine learning to provide an AI assistant that could automatically identify pests of cocoa. Results from field interviews revealed that 66% of farmers make pest management decisions at the farm level and the majority are cognizant of major yield limiting constraints. Field experiments have shown that cocoa insect populations change overtime and between plantations. The farmers\u2019 perception of cocoa insects directly impacts their management decisions, therefore it is imperative to equip farmers with management alternatives that are less toxic yet as effective as synthetic chemicals. High pressured soapy water has proven to be an effective pesticide replacement that does not require personal protective equipment and reduced the recolonization of virus transmitting mealybugs on 10 cocoa plantations. As a result of these efforts, I aspired to increase the agricultural knowledge and pest management artillery of low yielding cocoa farmers to encourage the adoption of sustainable alternatives to toxic chemicals inputs.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16900], "author_name_tesi": "Wilkerson, Megan Michaela", "last_name_ssi": "Wilkerson", "middle_name_ssi": "Michaela", "first_name_ssi": "Megan", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Hughes", "David Hughes", "Edwin George Rajotte", "Nicole Sheree Webster", "Shedra Amy Snipes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Hughes, Dissertation Advisor", "David Hughes, Committee Chair", "Edwin George Rajotte, Committee Member", "Nicole Sheree Webster, Committee Member", "Shedra Amy Snipes, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Ghana", "Cocoa", "Entomology", "International Agriculture"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Intentions to Revisit Public Golf Courses: The Role of Past Experience, Perceived Value, Satisfaction, Motivation, Constraints, and Negotiation Strategies\n\n\n\n", "id": "9203", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2029", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-08-20T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The aim of this study was to use the theoretical frameworks of intention to revisit (Petrick, Morais, & Norman, 2001) and perceived constraints and constraint negotiation (Hubbard & Mannell, 2001) to examine the role of past experience, perceived value, satisfaction, motivation, perceived constraints, and negotiation strategies on golfers\u2019 intentions to revisit a public golf facility.

Despite what most people think, female serial homicide is a distinct criminal phenomenon accounting for perhaps as many as 30% of all serial murders.  These killers are women who murder secretly over the course of months or years and claim on average more victims than their male counterparts do.  They are successful for three reasons:  First, cultural mythology holds that serial murder is a crime committed only by men.  Second, female killers use traditional gender stereotypes to conceal their crimes.  Third, American culture seems to have a great deal invested in believing that, by virtue of their gender, women are simply not capable of committing the crime.  \t\nFor the most part, the materials used for this project are available in the public record.  They derive from interdisciplinary research into theoretical and empirical criminology and sociology, print and broadcast journalism, and true-crime, literary and cinematic treatments of the topic in American culture.  This dissertation suggests that female serial killers in American culture are good wives, good mothers, faithful, submissive girlfriends and lovers, competent nurses and healthcare professionals, good babysitters, responsible landladies, vulnerable hitchhikers--ordinary women who pervert the gender stereotypes they seem to exemplify.  Like their male counterparts, they violate cultural standards not only for appropriate social behavior, but also for appropriate gendered behavior.  Stories which account for their criminality reflect a divisively gendered cultural ethics which is defined by the ideals of agency.  These women are criminals, but the agency they might exercise\u2014erotic, powerful, enraged\u2014is subsumed by the more compelling issue of how they have violated the cultural understanding of womanness.  Stories about female serial killers are based on an ethics which holds the murderers juridically responsible for their crimes and, perversely, finds them damningly irresponsible as women.  \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4438], "author_name_tesi": "Wilkins, Melinda Page", "last_name_ssi": "Wilkins", "middle_name_ssi": "Page", "first_name_ssi": "Melinda", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Special", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Philip Jenkins", "Alan M Sica", "Anne Carver Rose", "Michael Walter Anesko", "Barbara White Pennypacker"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Philip Jenkins, Committee Chair", "Alan M Sica, Committee Member", "Anne Carver Rose, Committee Member", "Michael Walter Anesko, Committee Member", "Barbara White Pennypacker, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["serial murder", "women and homicide", "female offenders", "women and crime"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "THE INFLUENCE OF REINFORCEMENT HOMOGENEITY ON THE DEFORMATION AND FRACTURE OF A DISCONTINUOUSLY REINFORCED ALUMINUM MATRIX COMPOSITE\n", "id": "8014", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2030", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-06T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Deformation processing (extrusion) has been used to homogenize reinforcement distribution in a discontinuously reinforced aluminum matrix composite (DRA 6092/SiC/25p). Reinforcement distribution after three conditions of varying extrusion reduction has been quantified using the homogenous length scale technique. Results indicate that deformation processing positively influences reinforcement homogeneity\u00a1\u00aaincreasing deformation asymptotically leads to an increasingly uniform reinforcement distribution. After heat treatment to peak age, the compressive flow behavior both along and transverse to the extrusion axis has been determined for each condition. Using chevron notch short rods, the fracture toughness behavior in several orientations has also been assesed. Variations in flow behavior with deformation processing are mainly rationalized in terms of matrix texture with the combined effect of particle alignment along the extrusion axis and reinforcement homogenization being relatively small. Regardless of orientation, toughness is shown to increase with reinforcement homogeneity; in a particular transverse orientation, chevron notch fracture toughness (KIv) demonstrates a nearly two-fold increase (10.8 MPa\u00a1\u00ccm to 19.3 MPa\u00a1\u00ccm) as a result of reinforcement cluster breakdown. Qualitative fractography indicates a generally ductile fracture process. Quantitative fractography indicates a strong positive relationship between fracture surface average roughness (RA\u00a1\u00aaa measure of out-of-plane crack deflection) and toughness (KIv), while a fractal technique used to characterize the fracture surface indicates a decrease in fractal dimension with increasing toughness. Using a simple model, the trend of increasing average roughness is interpreted as an increase in the fracture process length scale, while the decrease in fractal dimension is interpreted as a subtle decrease in the mean angle of crack deflection\u00a1\u00aaa result expected with reinforcement homogenization. The increase in toughness is rationalized as a combined effect of decreasing crack deflection (leading to slower strain accumulation during crack blunting) in addition to a nominal improvement in plastic strain that can be supported by the interparticle ligament after reinforcement homogenization. Such a change in local ductility is qualitatively validated with SEM fractography.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2012], "author_name_tesi": "Wilks, Garth Barrett", "last_name_ssi": "Wilks", "middle_name_ssi": "Barrett", "first_name_ssi": "Garth", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Donald Albert Koss", "Paul Raymond Howell", "Christopher L Muhlstein", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii", "Jonathan E Spowart"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Donald Albert Koss, Committee Chair", "Paul Raymond Howell, Committee Chair", "Christopher L Muhlstein, Committee Member", "Clifford Jesse Lissenden Iii, Committee Member", "Jonathan E Spowart, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Homogeneity", "Deformation", "Fracture", "Aluminum", "Metal Matrix Composite", "DRA", "Clustering"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "A GENERAL COMPOSITIONAL RESCALED-EXPONENTIAL MODEL FOR MULTI-PHASE, BOUNDARY-DOMINATED PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ", "id": "14428rxw5156", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "14428", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-07-10T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Hydrocarbon reservoir performance forecasting is an integral component of the resource development chain and is typically accomplished via reservoir simulation using either numerical or simplified analytical models.

Due to this limitation, a popular research interest for many individuals has been to transform the equations governing flow through porous media for more complex reservoirs in such a way as to express reservoir decline in an exponential form analogous to the decline of incompressible liquids reservoirs.  The works of the likes of Fraim and Wattenbarger (1987), Fetkovich (1993) and Zhang and Ayala (2014a) clearly indicated such transformations are possible.

This work demonstrates that, by the introduction of a new pseudo-variable, partial pseudo-pressure, it is possible to predict the decline behavior of individual fluid constituents of a variety of reservoir systems ranging from single-phase gas and oil to multi-phase gas condensate and volatile oil reservoirs.  Additionally, preliminary work is presented with regard to applying the proposed model for production data analysis, although more work is needed in this area.

Odor samples were collected and presented to both the electronic nose and the human panelists.  The human panelists were required to rate the odor samples on a hedonic scale.  After calculating the average rating from the human panel for each odor sample, the hedonic rating was matched with the 32 electronic nose sensor readings from the corresponding sample.  Once the hedonic ratings had been matched to the corresponding sensor readings, the data were then used to develop and train an artificial neural network.  \nTwo artificial neural networks were developed from these training data.  The first artificial neural network was developed using Ward Systems Neuroshell 2.  This neural network used 10 of the electronic nose sensor readings to predict the hedonic rating of the sample odor.  This artificial neural network produced predictions with an r2 of 0.95. \nThe second artificial neural network was developed using Ward Systems Neuroshell Predictor.  This neural network used all 32 of the electronic sensor readings to predict the hedonic rating of sample odors and was examined in two modes.  The first mode of operation was termed Non-Enhanced Generalization; in this mode the artificial neural network attempted to fit the data tightly.  In the Enhanced Generalization mode, the neural network predictions were not as tightly fit; this method is generally used for new inputs for which the neural network had not been trained.  In Non-Enhanced Generalization mode, an r2 of 0.95 was determined.  In the Enhanced Generalization mode, the predictions were a bit more relaxed; an r2 of 0.89 was determined.\nThe results obtained from the electronic nose data and the developed neural networks prove promising in the area of hedonic rating.   It should be emphasized that this type of modeling or simulation is very specific and that any developed neural network is only as good as the data on which it is was trained.  There are many considerations that need to be addressed when taking on a matter of this magnitude.  First, a small change in chemical composition can radically affect the odor of a compound.  Secondly, the intensity of an odor can affect the perception of an odor.  For example, some odorants at small quantities are perceived as pleasant, but at higher concentrations they can become offensive.  The first two considerations would require the collection of an infinite amount of data to represent all of the possible combinations.  Third, in a subjective matter such as this, life experiences, cultural differences, etc., contribute to each panelist\u2019s perception of an odor.  Carefully choosing and training the human panel can help minimize the third consideration.  Fourth, it is well known that the human nose is much more sensitive than any electronic nose to subtle changes in an odorant.  Until advances are made in the electronic nose area, this technology may not be sensitive enough to simulate human perception except for very specific and limited applications.  This research may be small step toward much larger research and applications.\n\n\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [245], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Archie Lamar", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "Lamar", "first_name_ssi": "Archie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Meigs Beyer", "Robert Edwin Graves", "Dr Charles Wysocki", "Paul Heinz Heinemann", "Eileen Wheeler"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Meigs Beyer, Committee Member", "Robert Edwin Graves, Committee Member", "Dr Charles Wysocki, Committee Member", "Paul Heinz Heinemann, Committee Chair", "Eileen Wheeler, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Electronic Nose", "Human Olfaction", "Mushroom Substrate Odors", "Neural Networks", "Biological Simulation", "Agricultural Engineering", "Artificial Neural Networks", "Odor Assessment"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "'Living in the Light': Examining Contemporary Homeplace Narratives", "id": "11589", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "940", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-30T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines five contemporary memoirs as homeplace narratives and thereby, considers the function of the texts as advocacy for the disempowered and dispossessed.

The asymmetric distribution of proteins, along the plasma membrane and within the cells, is vital to proper cellular function as mis-localization or lack of these molecules often leads to diseases and sometimes death. Proteins such as Bazooka, Crumbs, Cadherins, Catenins, Scribble, and Lethal giant larvae are but a few conserved molecules (with homologues found in many species) that have been shown to play important roles in generating cell polarity. The role of the actin and spectrin cytoskeleton underlying these important protein complexes has yet to be elucidated. Thus, my investigations focused on determining the function of the spectrin based membrane skeleton (SBMS).\nMy research has focused on the role of the SBMS in cell polarity and the maintenance of junctional integrity, and specifically on how the ?Heavy-spectrin protein contributes to these processes, using Drosophila melanogaster as my model organism to study. The asymmetrically localized Drosophila spectrins: ?, ?, and ?Heavy-spectrin (?H) form (??)2 and (??H)2 hetero-tetramers that are restricted to the basolateral and apical domains in epithelia, respectively.  These proteins are not unique to Drosophila; homologues have been found in vertebrates and invertebrates and are thought to act as molecular scaffolds since they contain various motifs that facilitate protein-protein interaction and membrane association. Data from several other labs have shown that these molecules are essential.\nThis dissertation details my investigation of ?H\u2019s role during Drosophila melanogaster development focusing on: (i) how and where ?H interacts with the apical determinant Crumbs; (ii) the dependence of ?H on DMoesin for membrane association; (iii) whether the pleckstrin homology (PH) containing C-terminal domain of ?H is responsible for membrane association and (iv) how ?H might be associated with Drosophila melanogaster protein Annexin B9 (Anx B9). The first, and collaborative, investigation shows that in Drosophila Schneider 2 (S2-embryonic cell line), transfected with the cytoplasmic tail of Crumbs, ?H interacts with the FERM binding domain of Crumbs. Genetic studies of the interaction between these two proteins show that removing crumbs dominantly enhances the lethality seen in the absence of karst (gene encoding ?H). Mosaic clonal analysis was conducted to address the second component, where DMoesin ovary clones show that in the absence of DMoesin, ?H was still associated with the apical plasma membrane, suggesting that ?H does not depend on DMoesin for its membrane association. Third, using C-terminally derived deletion constructs, my studies show that the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is not solely responsible for ?H membrane association. Over-expression of these constructs caused increased membrane area and bi-membrane structures that were extensively co-localized with the endocytic protein Dynamin, suggesting that ?H might be involved in regulating membrane turnover. The final aspect of my investigation was concentrated on the possible association between ?H and Annexin B9 (Anx B9). Thus, I generated an antibody to Drosophila Annexin and for the first time show that Drosophila Anx B9 is localized to the cytoplasm and on the plasma membrane. My results also show that Anx B9 co-localizes with the bi-membrane structures generated by the over-expression of the C-terminal domain of ?H. Anx B9 loss-of-function analysis (RNAi) studies show that a decrease in the amount of Anx B9 causes a reduction of membrane-associated C-terminus and leads to a decrease in the number of bi-membrane structures, suggesting that Anx B9 is at least partly responsible for tethering ?H to the plasma membrane.\nThe culmination of this work shows that, while the underlying spectrin based membrane skeleton (?H in particular) may not be essential for generating cell polarity, it does play an important role in regulating membrane turnover by interacting with molecules such as Crumbs, Dynamin and Annexin B9.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2541], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Janice ", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Janice", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Genetics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Scott Gilmour", "Graham Hugh Thomas", "Richard Cyr", "Andrew Paul Han", "Wendy Hanna Rose"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Scott Gilmour, Committee Chair", "Graham Hugh Thomas, Committee Member", "Richard Cyr, Committee Member", "Andrew Paul Han, Committee Member", "Wendy Hanna Rose, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["dynamin"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "UNIVERSAL FEW-BODY PHYSICS IN A\nTHREE-COMPONENT FERMI GAS", "id": "11299", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2993", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-08-19T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This dissertation reports on experimental studies of universal three-body physics\nin an ultracold Fermi gas.

Participants included non-Hispanic white women in central Pennsylvania recruited as part of a longitudinal study. Data were collected across an 8-year period, with 2-year intervals between assessments. Height and weight were measured in triplicate. Dietary restraint and disinhibition were assessed using the Eating Inventory. Global reports of dieting and specific weight control strategies were assessed by the Weight Loss Behavior Scale. Energy density was calculated from energy content of all foods (excluding beverages) at each occasion from three 24-hour recalls. A series of mixed effect models were used to examine the influence of several factors on weight change over time. Results revealed that (1) self reported dieting was associated with weight gain; (2) increases in dietary restraint may be protective against long-term weight maintenance by moderating the positive association between dietary disinhibition and weight gain among dieters; (3) assessing patterns of use of specific weight control strategies discriminated among women using different approaches to control weight; (4) different patterns of weight control use were predictive of differences in weight gain: use of healthy plus unhealthy weight control strategies was associated with greater weight gain; whereas only using healthy weight control strategies may promote weight maintenance; and (5) decreasing dietary energy density by increasing intake of water rich foods such as fruits and vegetables may be an effective weight maintenance strategy.

Soil profiles along this transect are interpreted to have developed from a uniform parent material, the Peoria Loess, with pedogenesis commencing between 13 \u2013 10 14C ka.  We examined mineral evolution in these soils using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) mineralogical analysis.  Results indicated quartz, feldspars, and clays dominate the loess and soils.  In each pedon the Na concentrations generally decrease from the deepest collected sample to the surface, defining depletion profiles.  These depletion profiles document the chemical weathering of plagioclase.  Consistent with this interpretation, kaolinite and illite concentrations are greatest in the surface horizons and decrease with depth.  In addition, the montmorillonite concentrations are observed greatest with depth, consistent with primary mineralogy inherited from the source region.  \nIn order to interpret the concentration versus depth profiles as a function of climate variation along this transect, we simulated climate at 10 ka and 6 ka, as well as for modern day using the GENESIS v2 Global Climate Model (GCM).  The GCM calculated annual averages for surface air temperature, precipitation, and downward flux of soil pore water.  Uniform soil texture was assumed to be constant throughout this transect from 28\u00ba to 50\u00ba N latitude and 94\u00ba to 88\u00ba W longitude along the Mississippi River valley.  The Na profiles were fit to mathematical model equations for profile development using the GCM outputs to determine values of a kinetic parameter for each pedon.  The fraction of albite dissolved (f) varied from approximately 0% in the north to 26% in the south as determined through integration of the model equations.  Variation in f is observed to largely depend upon the variation in annual rainfall from north (0.5 m / y) to south (1.2 m / y).  The kinetic parameters were corrected for porefluid advection along the transect and plotted against 1/T.  From these plots, the best estimate of the apparent activation energy for Na-plagioclase dissolution is observed to be 95 \u00b1 24 kJ/mol.  Such quantitative interpretations of soil profiles can provide ways to understand and predict the effects of climate on soil chemistry.   \n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3278], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Jennifer Zan", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "Zan", "first_name_ssi": "Jennifer", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Susan Louise Brantley, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["mathematical modeling", "sodium depletion", "activation energy of dissolution", "albite weathering", "climosequence", "soils", "Global Climate Model"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Multi-Objective Optimization for Unmanned Surveillance Networks Using Evolutionary Algorithms\n", "id": "8268", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2994", "defended_at_dtsi": "2008-04-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The existing literature contains many control systems for wireless sensor and\nsurveillance networks.

The immobility of plants and the physical proximity of male and female organs can result in a propensity for inbreeding, making it especially crucial for bisexual plants to develop strategies to prevent this from occurring. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an interspecific reproductive barrier which allows flowering plants to recognize and reject self-pollen (genetically identical) and accept non-self pollen (genetically distinct). Using Petunia inflata (Solanaceae) as a model, this distinction between self vs non-self pollen is determined by the highly polymorphic S-locus; if the S-haplotype (denoted S1, S2, S3, etc.) of the pollen is identical to either of the S-haplotypes of the diploid pistil, this pollen is rejected. The S-locus houses both female and male determinant genes responsible for this specificity. The female determinant gene, encoded by a single S-Ribonuclease gene (S-RNase), is specifically expressed in the transmitting cells of the pistil. S-RNase is taken up by both self-pollen and non-self pollen, after pollen tubes have penetrated the stigma, arresting self-pollen tube growth in the upper two-thirds of the style; the cytotoxic effect of S-RNase in self-pollen is more than likely due to the degradation of cytosolic RNAs. In stark contrast, the male determinant genes are encoded by multiple pollen-specific S-locus F-box genes (named SLF1, SLF2 \u2026 SLF17). Like other F-box proteins, Petunia SLFs are members of a conventional E3-ubiquitin ligase complex, termed the SCF complex. In the conventional SCF complex, the F-box confers target specificity for the polyubiquitination of a substrate protein, marking it for degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway. The SCFSLF complex is thought to work in a similar way, with each SCFSLF acting to collaboratively interact with and ultimately detoxify, all non-self S-RNases as the substrate proteins. Achieving an in-depth understanding of self-incompatibility, means discerning the biochemical basis for these SLF/non-self S-RNase interactions. \n    At the start of my dissertation research, only 10 paralogous SLF genes had been discovered in Petunia, however the total number of SLF genes required for pollen specificity was unknown. Before being able to characterize the interaction relationships between SLF/non-self S-RNases, the total suite of SLF genes involved in SI must first be known. Historically, many methods have been used to incrementally discover new SLF genes, however a more comprehensive method was desired. Using a pollen-specific next-generation sequencing approach, the transcriptomes of S2 pollen, S3 pollen, and S3S3 leaf (as a control) were analyzed. Chapter 2 describes the results of this transcriptomic approach which lead to the discovery of seven additional SLFs in both S2 pollen, S3 pollen, raising the total number of paralogs of SLF to 17.\n    Determining the biochemical basis of SLF/non-self S-RNase interactions is predicated not only upon knowing all types of SLF, but also which SLFs interact with which non-self S-RNase(s). Additionally, by determining the interaction specificity of a given SLF confirms its role in SI. To determine these interactions, a well defined in vivo transgenic approach is used. For example, if S2-SLF1 expressed in S2S3 transgenic plants causes the breakdown of SI, this shows us that S2-SLF1 must breakdown SI in S3 pollen, meaning S2-SLF1 interacts with the non-self S3-RNase. Chapter 3 describes the results of using this in vivo transgenic approach to test the non-self S-RNase interaction specificity of S3-SLF1, S3-SLF5, S3-SLF6, S3-SLF9, S3-SLF10, S2-SLF2, S2-SLF7, S2-SLF9, S2-SLF12, S2-SLF14, S2-SLF16, and S2-SLF17 in SI.   \n    Previous unpublished work has indicated that the difference of interaction specificity between S2-SLF1 and S3-SLF1 with S3-RNase is in the last of three functional domains (FDs), termed FD3. These three FDs were delineated by equally dividing the length of SLF1 into thirds, placing the F-box domain in FD1, and the SLF C-terminal domain (CTD) in FD2 and FD3. The role of FD3 was ascertained by generating a series of chimeric SLF1 genes by swapping FD1, FD2, and FD3, and observing the breakdown of SI via in vivo transgenic functional assays. Based upon alignments between S2-SLF1 and S3-SLF1, there are a total of sixteen amino acid differences in FD3. To narrow down the amino acid positions responsible for this difference of interaction specificity, FD3 was further divided into four mini-domains each containing four of the sixteen amino acid differences, termed FD3-A, FD3-B, FD3-C and FD3-D. In another series of chimeric experiments by constructing five chimeric genes between S2-SLF1 and S3-SLF1 via domain swapping, the number of amino acid positions involved in this differential interaction was reduced to eight, shown in Chapter 4. Additional testing of the original FD1, FD2, and FD3 chimeric SLF1 proteins also indicates that these domains interact in a similar manner with non-self S-RNases other than S3-RNase.\n    Chapter 5 describes another experiment aimed at further understanding SI by sequencing the S2-locus, which until recently, has for the most part only been described genetically.  Using the sequences of 17 SLF genes to screen the S2-haplotype BAC library (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome), we can identify large portions of genomic DNA which contain these SLF genes. In collaboration with another graduate student, Lihua Wu, we have isolated and purified these SLF-containing BACs, as well as BACs from a previously identified 881-Kbp region surrounding the female determinant gene S2-RNase, and male determinant gene S2-SLF1. Using a hybrid approach by combining two different sequencing technologies (PacBio SMRT and Illumina MiSeq sequencing), I have successfully designed a pipeline to leverage the long, yet error-prone reads from PacBio and the relatively short, yet high-quality reads of MiSeq (combining software programs ABySS and AHA) into scaffolds containing these 17 SLF genes. Thus far, over 3 Mbp of sequence data has been assembled, and analyzed. \n    In summarization of these results, Chapter 6 details the main findings of my dissertation research, including the discovery of seven additional types of SLF (SLF11-17) in five different S-haplotypes (totaling 42 novel genes), and the molecular characterization of the S2-locus by sequencing and assembly of SLF-containing BACs.

This coupled environment fracture model (CEFM) incorporates the natural laws of the conservation of charge and the differential aeration hypothesis to predict the amount of stress corrosion crack growth as a function of many external environmental variables, including potential, stress intensity, solution conductivity, oxidizer concentrations, and various other environmental parameters. Out of this approach came the concept of the coupling current; a local corrosion current that flows from within cracks, crevices, pits, etc\u2026 of a metal or alloy to the external surface. Because of the deterministic approach taken in the mentioned research, the coupling current analysis and CEFM model can be applied to the specific problem of SCC in aluminum alloy 5083 (the alloy of interest for this dissertation that is highly sought after today because of its corrosion resistance and high strength to weight ratio). This dissertation research is specifically devoted to the experimental verification of the coupling current, which results from a coupling between the crack\u2019s internal and external environments, by spatially resolving them using the scanning vibrating probe (SVP) as a tool. Hence, through the use of a unique fracture mechanics setup, simultaneous mechanical and local electrochemical data may be obtained, in situ.\n\nThe SVP is an alternating current device designed to obtain highly localized potential gradients (with a best resolution of microns) in a solution conductivity of 100s of \u03bcS/cm. In order to enhance resolution of the SVP maps as much as possible, without being too far away from the desired test conditions of 0.6M saltwater (utilized in the lab as a substitute for seawater), dilution of the saltwater by an order of magnitude (0.06 M) was used throughout all experiments unless otherwise noted. Initial experiments of localized corrosion events from 10s of micron to mm-sized galvanic couples were first mapped in order to obtain confidence in the ability to map the current flowing through the solution above a stress corrosion crack. Furthermore, because of these feasibility studies, the current density that flows between an alloys matrix to or from an intermetallic compound can be spatially mapped as well.\n\nStandard fracture mechanics of AA5083-H116 bend bars were performed in diluted saltwater (0.06M) to obtain the critical fracture toughness for cracking in air and in saltwater. During loading in a bending test setup, standard load and crack mouth opening signals were obtained until the sample broke, or until the crack arrested. It was discovered that when the data was analyzed by plotting the load as a function of crack mouth opening displacement, the critical stress intensity (air), or threshold stress intensity (electrolyte) could be determined by identifying the decreasing of unload/reload slopes from a constant value. Transitions to and from different characteristic zones of cracking (different characteristics for different environments) are observed in the provided light and scanning electron microscopy images.\n\nThe posited existence of the coupling current provides a different and more convenient marker for analyzing stress corrosion cracking, corrosion fatigue, and other forms of localized corrosion attack involving applied loads. For the first time, through the research in this dissertation, the positive current flowing from a crack were mapped, in situ, providing the changes in the anodic current density through the solution as a function of position. A collage of SVP maps were constructed on a grand scale according to their observed location with the light microscope by using features (such as the notch, or the growing crack) from the larger SVP maps taken at lower fracture toughness values with less resolution. These larger maps were then lined up with the extremes of the same features in smaller, SVP maps taken at a later time with a new location and higher resolution to keep up with the advancing crack tip. From that collage, a crack length vs. time graph was plotted to examine the characteristics of the crack growth. Finally, a crack growth rate vs. fracture toughness trend was constructed to compare with the CEFM and other studies on stress corrosion cracking of AA5083.\n\nIn order to accommodate the expansion of the CEFM to predict crack growth in heavily sensitized AA5083 specimens, more electrochemical data (i.e., polarization scans taken from recent literature and compiled in this dissertation) was needed.

This has led to advantages in many areas, including education, disaster management, science, and community development. However, along with these advantages, several challenges have arisen, such as those related to data redundancy, query construction, the ethical use of the Web, and the design of appropriate evaluation methods. This dissertation focuses on two general problems in information retrieval: similarity and satisfaction.\n\nNear duplication is common in document collections and refers to the case where a large amount of similarity exists among documents. This dissertation focuses on near duplicate detection in scholarly big data and state of the art methods from the Web are shown to be effective at detecting near duplicate scholarly documents. These findings are used in the design of an information extraction Web service that was designed to be scalable and efficient when processing scholarly big data. The Web service includes a near duplicate matching backend to avoid redundant information extraction and is shown to lead to an 8.46% decrease in the amount of time required to extract metadata and citations from 3.5 million academic documents.\n\nSimilarity search is similar to near duplicate detection; however, instead of identifying all near duplicates, the goal is instead to find documents that are similar to a given query document. This is especially useful in situations where it is challenging to construct keyword queries for complex information needs. A similar document search engine that receives whole documents as queries and automatically finds similar files is proposed. The search engine is scalable and works with multiple similarity functions and document collections. It includes a recursive search algorithm that produces a search result tree that is used for ranking and that leads to a significant improvement in search performance.\n\nThere are many uses for similarity search on the Web. In this dissertation, a method for using similarity search to detect candidate sources of plagiarism from the Web is proposed. A single document is received as a query and potential sources of plagiarism are returned. The method achieves F-1 scores of 0.54 and 0.47 in offline and online evaluations, respectively. Similar methods are presented for detecting synthetic scientific articles and achieve precision and recall scores of 0.96 and 0.99, respectively.\n\nFinally, evluation is an important topic underlying much of information retrieval. Methods for measuring good abandonment in mobile search are presented, where good abandonment refers to users being satisfied in search without the need to click on results. Using gestures as signals, an accuracy of 75\\% is achieved when differentiating between good and bad abandonment. Furthermore, is it shown how good abandonment is driven by mobile answers, snippets, and images on the results page.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [12250], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Kyle Mark", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "Mark", "first_name_ssi": "Kyle", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Information Sciences and Technology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C.

Nutrient transport during the winter is a complex process and depends on the infiltration, runoff, and erosion processes that are sensitive to whether the air temperature is above or below freezing. A simple and inexpensive soil thermal cycling system was developed, which was able to reproduce a soil temperature profile representative of field conditions. The system was used to examine the effects of winter manure application on nutrient losses via surface runoff and subsurface leachate. Specifically, the placement of manure with respect to snow and the soil temperature at the time of manure application were addressed in this research.\nThe findings of this research show that nitrogen and phosphorus losses vary depending on both the manure\u2019s location with respect to snow and the soil temperature at the time of application. The use of the soil thermal cycling system provided a way to study processes that occur throughout the soil profile in a laboratory setting. Removing the soil from its natural environment, however, likely changed or altered processes that are typically observed in the field. The results of this research should therefore be used in combination with other plot- and field-scale experiments to develop empirical models. These models are useful first steps in developing a more detailed understanding of manure management and associated nutrient loss under winter conditions.

Emergent groundwater-fed seeps have been identified as a potentially significant source of water and NO3-N to streams in headwater catchments, yet few studies have evaluated NO3-N transport in seeps and their influence on downstream water quality. To address this need, four studies were undertaken to better understand the role of seeps in FD36 and RS, two small (0.40 and 0.45 ha, respectively) agricultural headwater catchments located in the Ridge and Valley physiographic region of central Pennsylvania. \nThe first study (Chapter 2) examined spatial and temporal variations in NO3-N concentration and transport potential in shallow groundwater of three seep and adjacent non-seep areas in the riparian zone. Results showed that NO3-N concentrations within the seep areas were significantly greater than NO3-N concentrations in the non-seep areas. Water table depth was also more spatially variable in the seep areas compared to the non-seep areas, which indicated less uniform flow, shorter residence times for groundwater, and greater potential for NO3-N delivery to the stream from seep areas. \nThe second study (Chapter 3) used electrical resistivity imaging (ERI) to visualize seep zone formation in order to enhance our understanding of the chemical-hydrologic interactions in the riparian zone. ERI data showed large, localized decreases in resistivity within a seep area following a series of three precipitation events, which suggested that groundwater was upwelling through discontinuities in the fragipan. The non-seep area showed no such response. The changes in resistivity within the seep area coincided with increased NO3-N concentrations. Results showed that seeps were highly dynamic and responsive to precipitation events compared to non-seep areas, and subsurface hydrologic processes in seep zones could significantly affect NO3-N concentrations in the groundwater being delivered to the stream. \nThe third study (Chapter 4) was intended to improve our understanding of spatial patterns in stream NO3-N concentrations during baseflow and stormflow conditions, and to determine if seeps contributed to the patterns observed in stream chemistry. Semi-variogram analysis showed that stream NO3-N concentrations were spatially dependent during baseflow conditions. Spatial patterns in stream NO3-N concentrations were positively correlated with the number of flowing seeps in the monitored reach. Additionally, stream reaches with seep inputs had increased stream NO3-N concentrations relative to areas with no seep inputs. These results suggest that seeps are an important source of NO3-N in headwater agricultural catchments and play a key role in determining stream NO3-N concentrations. \nThe final study (Chapter 5) was undertaken to quantify factors that influenced seep NO3-N concentrations, such as NO3-N retention and/or removal along seep surface flow pathways and N application rates throughout the catchment, and to determine the relationship between seep and stream water quality. Results showed that in FD36, NO3-N concentrations generally decreased downseep and that NO3-N retention within these seeps varied seasonally, with most of the retention occuring during in the summer. Only minimal NO3-N retention was observed in seeps within the RS catchment. Seasonal variation in seep NO3-N retention was related to both discharge and air temperature in FD36. However, the effects of N application rates throughout the catchment played a more significant role in determining NO3-N concentrations in seep water in both catchments. In both FD36 and RS, seep NO3-N concentrations were significantly correlated with stream NO3-N concentration at the catchment outlet. \nThe results of this research highlight the need for management practices that decrease NO3-N concentrations in seep discharge (i.e., changes in N application rates) or enhance NO3-N retention and/or removal within seep surface flow paths (i.e., riparian zone wetlands or bioreactors) in order to improve stream water quality in agricultural streams. Future studies are needed to improve our ability to identify seepage inputs to streams, as well as to predict where seepage zones are likely to occur on the landscape. Seeps should be considered critical source areas for NO3-N delivery to streams since they have been shown to contribute higher fluxes of water and nutrients to streams relative to the surrounding riparian zone. Overall, the four studies in this dissertation demonstrated that seeps exert a strong influence on streamflow generation and NO3-N fluxes in headwater catchments. Dissertation results also showed that an improved understanding of seep formation, hydrology, and biogeochemistry is necessary for evaluating the potential effectiveness of management practices aimed at improving stream water quality in headwater catchments.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8584], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Mark Robert", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "Robert", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott", "Curtis James Dell", "James Michael Hamlett", "Kamini Singha", "Anthony Buda"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Herschel Adams Elliott, Dissertation Advisor", "Curtis James Dell, Committee Member", "James Michael Hamlett, Committee Member", "Kamini Singha, Committee Member", "Anthony Buda, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nitrate", "Fragipan", "Seep", "Groundwater flow", "Hydrology", "Riparian zone", "Agriculture"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Essays on Two Sources of Market Imperfections: Consumer Search Costs and Consumer Myopia.", "id": "19230", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9246", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The dissertation comprises three self-contained essays in the general field of industrial organization, and focuses on two sources of market imperfections: Consumer search costs in the automobile insurance industry and consumer myopia in the banking industry. The first two essays analyze the interaction between consumers' search behavior and firms' advertising decisions. Both papers are motivated by the observation that advertising spending has exploded in the auto insurance industry over the last two decades, while simultaneously consumer search costs have arguably fallen equally dramatically. The overarching goal of these two papers is to provide a cogent, coherent link between increased advertising and decreased consumer search costs in a market where firms produce a homogeneous product. Establishing such a connection is an important step in extending our understanding of the role of consumer search costs in shaping the competitive landscape of various industries.\n\nTo fully appreciate the intricate interplay between consumers' search behavior and firms' advertising decisions, we must have an acute understanding of how the pricing decisions of firms are influenced by changes in consumer search costs. Chapter 2 provides a thorough discussion of the pricing implications of such changes. Chapter 3 analyzes firms' pricing decisions when consumers are faced with a different type of limitation \u2013 consumer myopia. I investigate the factors that influence how banks price overdraft services, an add-on good, in the presence of myopic consumers.\n\nIn Chapter 1, Estimating the Effects of Non-informative Advertising when Consumers Search Sequentially,'' I use the auto insurance industry as a case study to establish that consumer search costs have fallen significantly, at least in some industries. The advent of the Internet has allowed consumers in many industries to now access product information much easier and much more efficiently than in previous decades. Specifically, in the auto insurance industry, as more firms increase their online presence and with increased Internet penetration, consumers increasingly are able to obtain multiple quotes for insurance products in a much shorter time. Though this assertion is non-contentious, it does not necessarily imply that consumer search costs have fallen, because other changes, such as increased value for time, could outweigh the reduction in search time.\n\nIn chapter 1, I rigorously establish that search costs have been falling over the last two decades in the private passenger auto insurance industry of California, while I simultaneously estimate the sensitivity of the probability that a firm is visited to the advertising levels of that firm and of its competitors. This requires that I estimate the consumer search costs distribution function. The challenge is to undertake an estimation procedure that generally requires detailed consumer-level data, when we only have highly aggregated firm-level data. I make use of Hortacsu and Syverson's (2004) model, which addresses this problem. Consistent with a priori expectations, I find that overall consumer search costs have been falling over time, especially between 2005 and 2010. The results also confirm that consumers are more likely to visit a firm that advertised in the past, and that this advertising effect is increasing over time.\n\nChapter 2, \u201cDynamic Choice of Non-informative Advertising when Consumers Search Sequentially: A Numerical Approach,\u201d builds on the findings of chapter 1 by providing a theoretical model that shows how decreasing consumer search costs can lead to increased advertising activity, when firms produce a homogeneous product. This result is an exception to the results of traditional advertising models, which directly or indirectly posit that consumer search and advertising are substitutes. In these models consumers' incentives to search fall as firms provide more and better advertising messages. Similarly, firms' incentives to advertise decrease as consumers search more intensely. This implies that advertising should fall as consumer search costs fall. In chapter 2, I establish reasonably weak conditions under which firms actually choose optimally to increase advertising in response to a decrease in search costs. \n\nI do so by showing that the relationship between advertising and search costs is not monotone because the relationship between search costs and the firms' profitability is first not monotone. I use a dynamic model, where firms choose advertising to affect their market exposure, the state variable; and choose prices in a product market, where consumers with heterogeneous search costs search sequentially. In short, I embed a version of Carlson and McAfee's (1983) demand model into Doraszelski and Markovich's (2007) dynamic advertising framework. The results of chapter 2 have significant policy implications, as they suggest that though markets may ultimately become very competitive at very low levels of search costs, markets may first have to pass through stages of being highly concentrated as search costs fall. \n\nChapter 3, \u201cOverdraft Pricing and Myopic Consumers,\u201d investigates whether the presence of myopic consumers impacts how banks choose the prices of bank overdraft services. The pricing of bank products has long been a focus of empirical researchers. But in recent years overdraft services have received additional attention because banks and credit unions routinely earn an annual percentage rate (APR) of over 1,000 percent on these products. Such abnormally high returns in an arguably competitive industry require explanation. Gabaix and Laibson (2006) propose a model where banks optimally choose to suppress information on the price of add-on services, and charge prices that are substantially higher than marginal cost. They argue that firms are able to do so because some consumers are myopic, in the sense that they do not consider some add-on services when choosing the base product. The authors also show that no firm has an incentive to ``educate\" the myopic consumers if the fraction of myopic consumers is sufficiently large. \n\nIn chapter 3, I test the applicability of Gabaix and Laibson's (2006) model to the pricing of overdraft services using a repeated cross-section of U.S. banks and credit unions. I use three demographic characteristics to serve as proxies for the fraction of myopic consumers in each market, and find that two of the three proxies are significant and have the predicted signs. These results, though not conclusive, suggest that structural estimation of Gabaix and Laibson's model may add substantially to our understanding of pricing decisions in aftermarkets.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [9056], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Marlon L", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "L", "first_name_ssi": "Marlon", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Economics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts", "Edward James Green", "Mark John Roberts", "N Edward Coulson", "Lisa Lipowski Posey", "Edward James Green"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark John Roberts, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward James Green, Dissertation Advisor", "Mark John Roberts, Committee Chair", "N Edward Coulson, Committee Member", "Lisa Lipowski Posey, Committee Member", "Edward James Green, Committee Chair"], "keyword_ssim": ["Consumer search cost", "advertising", "non-informative advertising", "dynamic advertising", "overdraft services", "myopic consumers"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Modeling the Interaction of Transport Mechanisms through Bedded Manure to Evaluate the Effects on Ammonia and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\n\n", "id": "11107", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4229", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-06-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the foremost contributor to global warming is the release of greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases have been found to warm the Earth by trapping the heat associated with the sun\u2019s rays.  This causes an increase in the Earth\u2019s temperature and affects the well being of the world\u2019s population and the environment.\n\nAlthough ammonia is not a greenhouse gas, it has been observed that excess ammonia can be harmful to the environment.  Aerial ammonia can travel long distances before being re-deposited on the landscape, where it can leach into the groundwater or be directly carried into bodies of water through surface runoff.  Ammonia also contributes to haze, which is a combination of fine particulate matter and can cause respiratory illnesses.  It is estimated that 40% of global emissions of ammonia are primarily from livestock manures.  Therefore, the focus of this research was to quantify and reduce ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions from heavily-bedded farm manure (urine and feces) handling and storage practices.  The primary agricultural gases of concern in this study were carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3).  \n\nUnderstanding the characteristics of dairy farm manure and the interrelationship between mass transport mechanisms (diffusion and convection) contributing to the release of gaseous emissions is imperative to reducing the gas emissions from these sources.  The major goals of this study were to characterize compacted dairy farm manure with various bedding materials (woodchips, sawdust, and hay mix), to measure ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions from the bedded manure while evaluating the effectiveness of compaction as a treatment for reducing emissions, and determine the rates of diffusion responsible for the release of ammonia and greenhouse gases.  \nThe results of this study indicate that the permeability values for all bedding types pattern permeabilities between clean gravel and peat, 10-7 \u2013 10-13 m2.  This result also proved that the sawdust-bedded and hay mix-bedded manure samples followed Darcy\u2019s Law of permeability.  The woodchip-bedded samples followed a modified Darcy\u2019s Law (Dupuit-Forcheimer) because of a lack of water absorbency.  In terms of using compaction to reduce the permeability, the results revealed that the permeability was reduced for the sawdust-bedded samples but not for the woodchip and hay mix-bedded samples.  Using compaction, the air-filled porosities of the bedded samples were significantly reduced for all bedding types.  The woodchip-bedded manure had the lowest air-filled porosity of all bedded manures (within a range of 0.26 \u2013 0.43 m3 m-3 before compaction and 0.24 \u2013 0.40 m3 m-3 after compaction) because of the low water absorbency of the material.  The hay mix-bedded manure had the highest air-filled porosities (0.73 \u2013 0.90 m3 m-3 before compaction and 0.57 \u2013 0.88 m3 m-3 after compaction).  \n \nThe effects of compaction were inconclusive as a treatment for reducing ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions and compaction is not recommended as a treatment for reducing ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions.  Specifically, the sawdust-bedded samples exhibited a decrease in gas emission rates for NH3, N2O, and CH4 after compaction, and N2O and CH4 gas emission rates exhibited a greater change from the uncompacted samples when compacted at an applied stress of 6522 N m-2 (75 lbs).  Statistically, there was no significant affect of compaction in decreasing NH3, CO2, and CH4 emission rates.  However, N2O emission rates were significantly reduced by compaction.  For the hay mix and woodchip-bedded samples, compaction caused an increase or insignificant change in CH4, NH3, and CO2 production.\n \n The rate of diffusion was measured for each bedding type and the results indicated that for all bedding types the range of diffusion coefficients was the same magnitude throughout the trials with a slight trend of the diffusion coefficient decreasing with increased compaction.  This trend was not consistent throughout the trials and for all the gases.  The hay mix samples had higher overall range of O2 diffusion coefficients than the sawdust or woodchip-bedded samples because of the higher porosities within the samples before and after compaction.  The resulting oxygen diffusion coefficients seem to reflect the theory of passive airflow even at high levels of compaction within the system.  The determined effective diffusion coefficients in this study were compared to reference values of the diffusion coefficients of the gases, exposed to air and water.  Based on the referenced diffusion coefficients, for all of the gases, the diffusion coefficients calculated through the bedded manure samples decreased with compaction to levels below the diffusion of each gas in air, but remained higher than the levels for diffusion of each gas in water.  \n \n Lastly, a parameter estimation was performed to determine whether diffusion conditions were truly maintained within the reactors, throughout the study.  The results revealed that there was a presence of convection within the hay mix-bedded samples and that the error in the convection term was roughly between 10 \u2013 30%.  This study also developed a methodology for determining the rates of non-diffusive processes within bedded manures from experimental data.  The larger implications of the results of this study is an increased understanding of the physical properties and mass transport mechanisms of biologically active porous medias such as bedded manures and their impact on ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4201], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Marlyse K.", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "K.", "first_name_ssi": "Marlyse", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Eileen Wheeler", "Eileen Eilzabeth Fabian", "Thomas Lehman Richard", "Robert Edwin Graves", "Jason Philip Kaye"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Eileen Wheeler, Dissertation Advisor", "Eileen Eilzabeth Fabian, Committee Chair", "Thomas Lehman Richard, Committee Member", "Robert Edwin Graves, Committee Member", "Jason Philip Kaye, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["greenhouse gas", "gas emissions", "bedded manure", "diffusion"]}, {"year_isi": 2008, "title_ssi": "Temporal and Spatial Variations in Varroa Mite Levels, Influence of Apiary Density on Mite Fall Rate, Exploring New Methods to Measure Honey Bee Drifting for a Two-Concentric Circle Apiary Design.\n", "id": "8286", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4375", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-11-28T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Honey bees are an important agricultural asset to both honey production and pollination.  The health of honey bee colonies is an essential factor contributing to the success of these two agricultural sectors.  Ever since the introduction and dispersal of the ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor, colony damage and increased likelihood of death has become common.  Therefore Integrated Pest Management strategies should be implemented to reduce direct and indirect damages.  This thesis exhibits four experiments directly and indirectly relating to problems and solutions of varroa mites in colonies.\n\tIn 2006, the spatial distributions of varroa mites falling on sticky boards were evaluated according the 1) spatial distribution of mite population centers and 2) spatial clustering of mites falling about population centers.  It was found that mite drop centers were normally distributed through time, although the degree of centralization varies.  Also, spatial clustering of mite drop increases with increasing mite drop rate.  These results have implications in increasing the effectiveness of monitoring and reduction of the varroa mite levels.\n\tIn 2006, an experiment was carried out to analyze the relationship between hive spacing and variable [and increased] levels of mite drop.  Two apiaries separated by 8 miles were given two different hive spacing criteria.  At the High-Density apiary (HD) hive bodies were space closely together at  , whereas the Low-Density apiary (LD) had colonies spaced farther apart at  .  Our analysis showed no difference in mite drop between the HD and LD apiaries.  However, overall mite drop from the HD apiary was more variable than that of the LD apiary.  This result has huge implications in effective monitoring while minimizing the number of colonies monitored per apiary.\n\tIn spring 2007, a couple alternative methods used to mark and count foragers were tested and analyzed according to efficiency.  PVC pipes with funnel apparatuses were tested for both passive marking and counting.  This method was deemed ineffective since foragers were reluctant to be marked and counted.  Forager counts using PVC pipes were extensive and took four hours per sampling round, yielding 2 sampling periods per day.  Two methods for marking and counting were deemed efficient for my work.  First, it was determined that onsite entrance marking was most efficient for marking hundreds of bees.  Second, onsite-counting using five-observations were deemed most efficient while eliminating sampling.\n\tIn summer 2007, drifting experiments were carried out using the successful marking and counting procedures found previously.  Two concentric circles, each containing eight colonies, were spaced   and   from a centralized colony used for marking.  Three weather stations were set up equal distant from each other and placed   from the outer circle of colonies.  Foragers from the central colony were marked using onsite entrance marking.  During each subsequent day after initial marking native foragers and drifters were counted using five-minute entrance observations.  Throughout the summer it was determined that no correlation exists between drifting direction and wind direction.  Also, there was no difference between the amount of drifting between the inner and outer circles.  In general, the level of drifting was very low.  In addition, our mark recapture data was used for forager population estimation.\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4347], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Michael ", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Michael", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Entomology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Nancy M Ostiguy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Nancy M Ostiguy, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Drifting", "Varroa Mites", "Honey Bees", "Spatial Statistics"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Using Numerical Optimization Techniques and General Perturbation Equations to Find Optimal Near-Earth Orbit Transfers", "id": "9593", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4958", "abstract_tesi": "With recent developments in low-thrust optimization techniques, several methods of trajectory optimization can be implemented across various transfers. Much recent work has focused on performing methods of optimal control on low-thrust, near-Earth orbit transfers, achieving maximum efficiency in both energy use and time-of-flight. However, the use of optimal control relies on the exploitation of a satellites\u2019 equation of state, which becomes problematic if optimization is to be performed through a \u201cblack box\u201d venue, where state equations cannot be manipulated. This situation is particularly evident when attempting to perform trajectory optimization through a commercial off-the-shelf satellite mission modeling software package. Thus, a robust optimization method must be chosen to produce competitive results comparable to optimal control in these types of situations. However, the formulation of an objective function, as well as which type of optimization method to chose is important, since some formulations or algorithms may lead to better or faster convergence when compared to others. To address this issue, several non-linear constrained numerical optimization methods, including classical algorithms and evolutionary strategies, are implemented on simple low-thrust trajectories modeled using Satellite Toolkit\u2019s Astrogator\u00ae, to determine what methods perform better when applied to these transfers. Once a suitable algorithm is selected, an appropriate objective function and problem formulation based on general perturbation equations is created, which can construct a time-varying thrust vector without manipulating a satellite\u2019s equation of state. The objective function is then optimized within the selected algorithm in an attempt to obtain an optimal LEO to Molniya trajectory which can produce results on par with those found using a method of optimal control. Initial testing has shown that when an evolutionary strategy is applied to the objective function created in these studies, the resulting optimal trajectories are in fact competitive with those found using optimal control.

While various sensors can provide observations of object characteristics (range, azimuth, elevation, etc), the large amount of objects compared to the limited sensors available to track them results in measurements occurring infrequently. These potentially long periods of either inability to make observations (due to line-of-sight access) or unavailability of sensors (due to scheduling constraints) necessitates the need to intelligently determine which objects should be observed and which should be ignored at various times, a process known as sensor tasking or sensor network management. In order to make these tasking decisions, it is necessary to create some form of utility metric to determine which sensors should observe which objects at a particular instant of time. The process of evaluating these utility metrics is intrinsically tied in with state and uncertainty estimates provided by a nonlinear filter. That is, each utility metric requires estimates provided by the filters in order to be calculated, creating a coupling effect between the estimation and tasking components of the satellite tracking problem. While much recent research has been focused on investigating specific methods of either sensor tasking or nonlinear estimation, there is yet to be any studies which investigate the coupling of the two, as it is related to overall tracking performance. The investigation of this coupling demonstrates that the use of more accurate filters leads to better overall estimates, not only due to the advantages within the estimation methods, but also from the improvement in tasking decisions due to selection of these estimators.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8090], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Patrick  ", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Patrick ", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["David Bradley Spencer", "Robert Graham Melton", "Jacob Willem Langelaan", "Joseph Paul Cusumano", "Karl Martin Reichard", "Richard Lee Erwin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["David Bradley Spencer, Dissertation Advisor", "Robert Graham Melton, Committee Member", "Jacob Willem Langelaan, Committee Member", "Joseph Paul Cusumano, Committee Member", "Karl Martin Reichard, Special Member", "Richard Lee Erwin, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Nonlinear Estimation", "Sensor Tasking", "Space Situational Awareness", "Satellite Dynamics"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "A NOVEL METHOD FOR THE SEPARATION OF HYDROCARBONS FROM OIL SANDS AND OTHER SAND CONTAINING MATERIALS USING IONIC LIQUIDS\n\n\n", "id": "10738", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4957", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-04-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Bitumen is a complex hydrocarbon with components that have a broad range of molecular weight, from low to polymeric.  The extraction and separation of bitumen from tar sands for the purpose of processing fuels is relatively expensive and poses several environmental challenges.  Roughly two tons of tar sands are required to produce a barrel of oil and the separation of the bitumen from sand and clay requires significant amounts of energy and the use of large quantities of water.  It is shown that bitumen from samples of Canadian and Utah tar sands can be recovered using ionic liquids (ILs) and an organic solvent.  Essentially, a multiphase system\u2014consisting of a sand and clay slurry, an ionic liquid layer, and an organic layer containing the bitumen\u2014can be formed by simply mixing the components at ambient (~25\u00b0C) temperature.  Effectively all of the bitumen is released from the sand.  Water is not used in this stage of the separation, but relatively small amounts are used to separate entrained IL from the sand and clays.  Because both the IL and water can be recycled through the system and used repeatedly, this process has the potential to ameliorate many of the environmental problems associated with current extraction methods.  \nThis technology can also be employed to solve many other drilling and refinery issues.  Crude oil recovered from drilling wells often contains what is referred to as sand, but more specifically is a mixture of various minerals and silt.  This oil-coated sand must be cleaned before disposal.  In another drilling operation, large amounts of rock or drill-cuttings are produced and are similarly contaminated with oil, particularly if oil based \u201cmuds\u201d have been used in drilling.  Another example is the treatment and disposal of large amount of so-called oily sludge generated in refinery operations.  Finally, this same idea can be employed directly to the clean-up and removal of crude oil which would wash up on beaches after disastrous oil spills like the Exxon Valdez incident.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4934], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Phillip S", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "S", "first_name_ssi": "Phillip", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Materials Science and Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Paul C Painter", "Paul C Painter"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Paul C Painter, Thesis Advisor", "Paul C Painter, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["FTIR", "tar sands", "oil sands", "bitumen extraction", "ionic liquids"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "WOMEN TRANSLATORS IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY FRANCE: GENRE,GENDER,AND LITERARY CREATIVITY\n\n", "id": "10483", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5258", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-11-12T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The goal of this dissertation is to examine the importance of translation in the history of women\u2019s writings in nineteenth-century France and the ways in which it not only contributed to the development of women\u2019s intellectual activities, but also afforded access to literary production. I therefore explore how translation, when conceptualized as a women\u2019s literary activity, both reinforced existing roles for women in literature and at the same time allowed them access to other forms of creativity.  For, contrary to the opinion of many scholars of literary genre and gender who do not discuss translation in this context, translation was intimately related to varied forms of textual production.  In order to demonstrate this relationship and the enormous impact of translation on women\u2019s conceptions of their creative capacities, I examine translations, as well as the prefatory discourse that often accompanies them, autobiographical statements by women translators, and fiction by women translators with texts from Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Bentzon, Victorine de Chastenay, and Mme Lesbazeilles-Souvestre.  I first address how literary creativity was a gendered activity in the nineteenth century, with women limited to certain secondary modes of literary production.  I then examine the relationship between translation and the modes of textual creation named above in order to demonstrate the fundamental related-ness of these writings and, finally, I demonstrate the creative aspects of translation through a close reading of several translations in comparison to their source texts to show how translation was not only a creative activity, but a gendered one as well.  Despite the widespread dismissal of translation in consideration with issues of gender and genre in nineteenth-century France, its inclusion opens important new areas of research and allows for a fuller understanding of what it meant to write as a woman in the nineteenth century.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5236], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Rachel Lynn", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "Lynn", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "French", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat", "Jean Claude Vuillemin", "Kathryn Marie Grossman", "Adrian Johannes Wanner"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Dissertation Advisor", "Benedicte Marie Christine Monicat, Committee Chair", "Jean Claude Vuillemin, Committee Member", "Kathryn Marie Grossman, Committee Member", "Adrian Johannes Wanner, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Madame Lesbazeilles-Souvestre", "Victorine de Chastenay", "Therese Bentzon", "women translators", "French women writers"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Investigating satiating properties of foods", "id": "18729", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8849", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-06-11T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "     The current rates of overweight and obesity indicate that dietary strategies are needed to help individuals moderate energy intake in an eating environment that encourages overconsumption. Research has shown that dietary approaches such as reductions in food energy density (kcal/g), consumption of pre-portioned entr\u00e9es, and consumption of satiety-enhancing foods can decrease energy intake. There are still questions that need to be explored, however, in order to provide effective recommendations for individuals seeking approaches to curb energy consumption. First, reductions in energy density decrease energy intake, but it is not known if the effects depend on the way that energy density is reduced. Secondly, pre-portioned entr\u00e9es are  commonly consumed to help control portion size and limit energy intake, yet the influence of their characteristics on energy intake has not been well studied. Lastly, foods that enhance satiety can reduce overconsumption, but the availability of large portions of energy-dense foods in the current food environment may counter their benefits. Examination of these issues will lead to better dietary strategies to help decrease energy intake.\n\tThe first study examined whether three commonly used methods of reducing energy density (decreasing fat, increasing fruit and vegetables, and adding water) differed in their effects on energy intake across the day. In a crossover design, 59 adults (29 men and 30 women) consumed breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the laboratory on one day a week for four weeks. Across conditions, the entr\u00e9es were either standard in energy density or were reduced in energy density by 20% using one of the three methods. Each meal included a manipulated entr\u00e9e along with unmanipulated side dishes; all foods were consumed ad libitum. It was found that reducing the energy density of entr\u00e9es significantly decreased daily energy intake compared to the standard energy density entr\u00e9es (mean intake 2667\u00b177 kcal/day; p < 0.0001). The mean decrease was 396\u00b144 kcal/day when fat was reduced, 308\u00b141 kcal/day when fruit and vegetables were increased, and 230\u00b135 kcal/day when water was added. Comparison of the three methods of energy density reduction showed that daily energy intake was lower when fat was decreased but was not significantly different between increasing fruits and vegetables or adding water. \n\tThe second study determined how variations in the energy content and energy density of pre-portioned entr\u00e9es combine to influence daily energy intake. In a crossover design, 68 non-dieting adults (28 men and 40 women) were provided with breakfast, lunch, and dinner once a week for four weeks. Each meal included a manipulated pre-portioned entr\u00e9e that was compulsory, followed by a variety of unmanipulated discretionary foods that were consumed ad libitum. Across conditions, the entr\u00e9es were varied in both energy content and energy density between a standard level (100%) and a reduced level (64%). The results showed that in men, reductions in the energy content and energy density of pre-portioned entr\u00e9es acted independently and added together to decrease daily energy intake (both p < 0.01). A 38% reduction in energy content led to an 11% decrease in energy intake (291\u00b175 kcal), and a 38% decrease in energy density led to a 6% decrease in energy intake (154\u00b146 kcal). Simultaneously decreasing the energy content and energy density reduced total energy intake in men by 16% (445 \u00b1 47 kcal/day; p < 0.0001). In women, the entr\u00e9e factors also had independent effects on energy intake at breakfast and lunch, but at dinner and for the entire day the effects depended on the interaction of the two factors (p < 0.01). Simultaneously decreasing the energy content and energy density reduced daily energy intake in women by 14% (289 \u00b1 35 kcal/day; p < 0.0001). \n\tThe third study tested the influence on meal energy intake of varying the energy density and portion size of food consumed after a preload shown to promote satiety. In a crossover design, 46 adult women were served lunch on six days. On four days they ate a compulsory salad (300 g, 0.33 kcal/g). Unlike previous studies, instead of varying the preload, the subsequent test meal of pasta was varied between standard and increased levels of both energy density (1.25 or 1.66 kcal/g) and portion size (450 or 600 g). On two control days a salad was not served. Following consumption of the salad, the energy density and portion size of the test meal independently affected meal energy intake (both p < 0.02). Serving the higher-energy-dense pasta increased test meal energy intake by 153 \u00b1 19 kcal and serving the larger portion of pasta increased test meal energy intake by 40 \u00b1 16 kcal. Compared to having no salad, consuming the salad decreased test meal intake by 123 \u00b1 18 kcal. \n\tThese three studies provide useful information concerning dietary strategies that can be used to moderate energy intake and how the eating environment may influence their effects. Findings from the first study indicate that a variety of diet compositions can be recommended to reduce overall dietary energy density in order to moderate energy intake. Reductions in energy density by decreasing the fat content, increasing the proportion of fruit and vegetables, and adding water can all decrease energy intake over the day. The second study highlights the importance of considering the characteristics of pre-portioned entr\u00e9es. Variations in the energy content and energy density of these foods affect daily energy intake and could influence the effectiveness of such foods for weight management. Results from the third study emphasize the importance of considering the environment in which satiety-enhancing foods are consumed. The effects of these foods can be influenced by the energy density and portion size of other foods at the meal. Collectively, these studies highlight the beneficial effects of reducing energy density by various methods and in the context of pre-portioned entr\u00e9es, but suggest that an environment with large portions of energy-dense foods may oppose the effects of satiety-enhancing foods.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8695], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Rachel Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Rachel", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Nutrition", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Barbara Jean Rolls", "Terryl Johnson Hartman", "Sharon Nickols Richardson", "Leann L Birch", "John E Hayes"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Barbara Jean Rolls, Dissertation Advisor", "Terryl Johnson Hartman, Committee Member", "Sharon Nickols Richardson, Committee Member", "Leann L Birch, Committee Member", "John E Hayes, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["energy intake", "adults", "weight management", "energy density", "food intake", "satiety"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Media and the Construction of the Arab-American Women's Identity  ", "id": "13941", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7446", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-03-12T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "                       Abstract\n\tThe purpose of this qualitative action research study was to explore how a group of Arab American women have constructed their identities living in the U.S. and their perceptions of the role of media and popular culture in that process. The theoretical framework of the study was informed by critical media literacy, critical and feminist theory, and media studies, particularly related to the construction of identity. The study began with interviews with the seven Arab American women participants.  Sources of data included these transcribed interviews, field notes of data collected from four learning sessions that were part of a facilitated critical media literacy pedagogical process of viewing, discussing, and analyzing films relating to Arabs and Arab Americans, and transcripts of a final interview exploring their learning and its effects on their ongoing construction of Arab American identity.\n\tThe findings of the initial interviews at the outset of the study in regard to participants\u2019 identity and experience of media focused on: the experience of being \u201cother; the backlash of 9/11; frustration with Western media images; and the complexity of having an Arab and American female identity.  Their awareness and analysis of media messages grew with each learning session, and findings from final interviews indicated that participants: came to the realization that media largely reflects hegemonic interests; that media had an effect of transmitting ideology that affected their identity construction; began to deal with the lack of representation in the media by giving voice to others and in beginning forms of social action. The study ends with a consideration of findings in light of the theory, and offers implications for adult education and media literacy practice and offers suggestions for further research. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7393], "author_name_tesi": "Williams, Rahima A", "last_name_ssi": "Williams", "middle_name_ssi": "A", "first_name_ssi": "Rahima", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell", "Robin Redmon Wright", "Ilhan Kucukaydin"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Dissertation Advisor", "Elizabeth Jean Tisdell, Committee Chair", "Robin Redmon Wright, Committee Member", "Ilhan Kucukaydin, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Identity", "Arab American", "Woman", "Critical Media Literacy", "Culture", "Islam"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Validation of Cobra-tf Using the Monde Critical Heat Flux Experiments", "id": "21852", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9897", "abstract_tesi": "The process of nuclear reactor design uses several computer codes in order to calculate conditions within the reactor for given situations.

While the study of these types of offenses is certainly important, the majority of juvenile offending is of a much less serious nature.  I propose that a more complete picture of juvenile offending trends should incorporate a more broad range of juvenile behaviors including a substantial focus on minor offending.  \nThe Uniform Crime Reports are virtually the only source of official information on long-term trends in officially recorded juvenile crime in the United States. Perhaps the most important advantage of these data, in terms of this project, is the ability to compare arrest rates of juveniles over approximately the last 40 years. Although arrest data have been used to study trends in violent offending, they also provide longitudinal information on more minor offending such as runaway, curfew violations, drunkenness and vandalism.  In comparison, self-reports of delinquent behavior have been underutilized in the study of national crime trends due to a lack of nationally representative samples as well as a focus on more minor offending.  Since it is important to study crime trends with as many methods as possible, this study will also examine estimates of time trends in self-reported offending based on the Monitoring the future Survey, an annual national survey of high school seniors.  Like the UCR the MTF survey measures range of serious offending, but its main strength lies in its measurement of minor offending including many forms of drug use, truancy, and traffic tickets.

Elevated nitrogen levels in water are deleterious to both aquatic organisms and humans.  The reduction of nitrogen inputs to streams can be achieved through the protection and restoration of riparian zones, including headwater wetlands.  Management of riparian zones for the function of nitrogen removal requires understanding the factors that control the process.  At least two factors hinder this management in Pennsylvania and nationally.  First, although headwater streams, their associated wetlands, floodplains and terrestrial habitats often account for approximately two-thirds to three-quarters of the total drainage basin for larger rivers of Pennsylvania, there is a lack of knowledge regarding their functions.  Second, there is a gap in the understanding of how nitrogen cycling rates vary in headwater wetlands that differ in disturbance level.  Therefore, our goal was to provide a relative index of nitrogen availability and potential nitrogen loss along a headwater wetland disturbance gradient in Pennsylvania.  Thirteen forested headwater wetland sites within the Upper Juniata watershed were selected based on a previously described disturbance gradient.  The sites were selected to ensure that a range of disturbance levels, from pristine to highly disturbed, were equally represented.  The questions asked were: 1) How are cover (vegetation and ground cover) and soils (% moisture, % organic matter, and pH) governed by relative soil nitrogen availability and stream and ground water nitrate concentrations; 2) How are mean soil nitrogen availability and stream and ground water nitrate concentrations, cover and soil variables related to increased wetland disturbance; and 3) How are mean soil nitrate, the range of mean soil nitrate, and the coefficient of variation of mean soil nitrate related to the ranges and coefficients of variation of cover and soil variables?  Readily available nitrogen at each site was collected with free ion exchange resin bags and analyzed with a Lachat autoanalyzer for ammonium and nitrate.  Regression was used to characterize the relationship between these nitrogen pools and cover and soil variables.  Our results indicate that an increase in disturbance severity in headwater wetlands is linked to increased nitrate levels in soil, groundwater, and potentially streamwater.  These results aid in identification of the controls over nitrogen availability in headwater wetlands.  Knowledge of these controls can be used to properly manage headwater wetlands for the function of nitrogen removal.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4313], "author_name_tesi": "Williams-Tober, Michelle Rene", "last_name_ssi": "Williams-Tober", "middle_name_ssi": "Rene", "first_name_ssi": "Michelle", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Erica A H Smithwick", "Erica A H Smithwick"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Erica A H Smithwick, Thesis Advisor", "Erica A H Smithwick, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["DISTURBANCE GRADIENT", "HEADWATER WETLANDS", "UPPER JUNIATA WATERSHED", "PENNSYLVANIA"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Opting Out of Parole: The Other Side of the Revolving Door", "id": "9966", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "980", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-26T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "This study examines characteristics and reentry outcomes for a unique group of criminal offenders: those who choose to remain incarcerated rather than apply for parole release, so that they may be released unconditionally after serving their maximum sentence length.

A comprehensive strategy to combat infectious disease must address the problem at multiple levels, including: 1) pathogen adaptation to the host niche, 2) vaccination strategies to achieve protective adaptive immunity, and 3) transmission and ecological persistence of the pathogen. This dissertation involves studies at each of these three levels for the Tier 1 select agent Francisella tularensis. In the first study, a hypothetical protein required by F. tularensis for successful adaptation to the pH of the host niche is identified and characterized. Bacteria lacking this protein exhibit a pH-dependent growth defect in media and host cells, are highly attenuated in mouse models of tularemia, display aberrant morphology with inner-outer membrane separation at pH 7.4, and display an altered metabolic profile at pH 7.4. This study demonstrates that bacterial pH-adaptation strategies are relevant even at the near-neutral physiological pH of mammals. The second study focuses on antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses to vaccination strategies with the F. tularensis Live Vaccine Strain. Vaccination via the intranasal route, which can protect from respiratory challenge with highly virulent strains, elicits more antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph node compared to non-protective scarification vaccination. An intranasal booster of scarification-primed mice overcomes this deficiency while avoiding the morbidity associated with primary intranasal vaccination, suggesting a novel safe and effective vaccination strategy for the prevention of respiratory infections. The final study involves identification of a mechanosensitive channel that is required for contamination of fresh water by F. tularensis. This is the first study to directly demonstrate the relevance of these channels in contamination of fresh water by infected host animals. The channel protects from osmotic downshock despite lacking much of the C-terminal vestibule domain found in prototypical mechanosensitive channels, and likely contributes to the thousands of cases of oropharyngeal tularemia that have result from water contamination by F. tularensis subsp. holarctica.", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16735], "author_name_tesi": "Williamson, David Ross", "last_name_ssi": "Williamson", "middle_name_ssi": "Ross", "first_name_ssi": "David", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Immunology and Infectious Diseases", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Girish Soorappa Kirimanjeswara", "Girish Soorappa Kirimanjeswara", "Na Xiong", "Mary J Kennett", "Reka Z Albert", "Margherita Teresa-Anna Cantorna"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Girish Soorappa Kirimanjeswara, Dissertation Advisor", "Girish Soorappa Kirimanjeswara, Committee Chair", "Na Xiong, Committee Member", "Mary J Kennett, Committee Member", "Reka Z Albert, Outside Member", "Margherita Teresa-Anna Cantorna, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Francisella", "tularemia", "pH", "mechanosensitive channel", "T Cell", "CD8"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Monitoring Wild Ring-necked Pheasant Population Restoration in Pennsylvania", "id": "14770lkw5184", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14770", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-16T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) are a non-native species that has become naturalized and a popular game bird in the United States. The population in Pennsylvania has been declining since the 1970s despite stocking and habitat restoration efforts. One of the management objectives of the Pennsylvania Game Commission is to provide quality pheasant hunting which requires restoration of the wild pheasant population so that it is naturally reproducing and able to withstand hunting pressure. The current best potential habitat for pheasants within the state was identified and 4 wild pheasant recovery areas (WPRAs) were created to monitor pheasant restoration efforts. At these areas, it was illegal to release stocked pheasants, hunt and harvest either sex, or train dogs. Wild-trapped pheasants from South Dakota and Montana were released at the study areas to ensure there would be an adequate founding population for restoration purposes. The Pennsylvania Game Commission set objectives for a density of 3.86 female pheasants/km2 and that would be adequate for maintaining a sustainable population with hunting pressure. To assess the success of the project and aid in future management decisions, we explored methods of estimating the density by incorporating multiple detection probabilities and a model for predicting potential female pheasant density based on micro-habitat data. \nAs opposed to requiring multiple years of monitoring to obtain population trends using indices of abundance, we used crowing counts and adjusted for detection probabilities to estimate density at each of 12 study areas from 2013 to 2016. Our density estimates were adjusted for the probability a male pheasant crowed in a 3-minute survey period, the probability an observer was able to detect a pheasant given that it crowed, and the probability of flushing a male pheasant. We found the probability a male crowed in the survey period to decrease linearly during the breeding period (21 April\u201323 May) from 0.659 to 0.464. The probability of detecting a crowing pheasant at 0.80 km was >0, indicating that there was no distance at which it was reasonable to assume no birds could be detected. Instead, the effective area was used and is robust to choice of radius. Because the male pheasants are recorded during the crowing counts and female densities are required to meet objectives, we estimated the probability of flushing a male pheasant to be 0.495 yielding an almost 1:1 sex ratio. Only one of 12 study areas achieved the female density goal of 3.86 females/km2 from 2013 to 2016. The methods used to obtain these density estimates simplified the crowing count protocol and can easily be used and adjusted for other species, detection probabilities, or survey areas to estimate density.\nTo assess habitat or landscape composition at the WPRAs, we conducted a micro-habitat analysis by identifying all vegetation types within a 0.56 km radius of the survey point (hereafter referred to as survey circle) resulting in digitized maps of micro-habitat within a survey circle. Our objective was to create a model that would be able to predict potential female pheasant densities based on proportion of habitat type in a survey circle. We had 37 vegetation types that were combined into 8 habitat types a priori and used these as independent variables in our predictive models. We used our methods of estimating pheasant densities (Chapter 2) to estimate female density at the survey circle to be used as the dependent variable. For the model, we used 2 years of micro-habitat data (2013\u20132014) and density estimates (2014\u20132015). We estimated that female pheasant densities were influenced most by the proportion of idle grasses and forest. We found the proportion of idle grass to positively influence pheasant densities, while forest had a negative influence. This model will be important for improving habitat to meet a desired pheasant density goal by allowing managers to make recommendations for quantity and proportions of habitat needed to achieve desired pheasant density goals. \nOnly one study area, Washingtonville West, was successful in meeting the density goal of 3.86 female pheasants/km2, while all other study areas did not exceed a density of 2 females/km2. Washingtonville West had the lowest average proportion of forest in a survey circle of any study area. From 2013 to 2015, the average proportion of forest ranged from 4.3% to 9.3% at Washingtonville West, compared to an overall average at all the WPRAs ranging from 15.6% to 17.6%. Given that roughly 60% of the overall landscape in Pennsylvania is forested, the WPRAs represent a small section of the state that is potentially suitable pheasant habitat. Even at this suitable habitat, we only achieved a self-sustainable pheasant population that can withstand hunting pressure at one study area which had <10% forest. Because forest has a negative effect on pheasant densities and so much of the Pennsylvania landscape is forested, it will be difficult to locate enough suitable habitat to support sustainable pheasant populations in order to provide hunting opportunities across the state.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16047], "author_name_tesi": "Williamson, Lacey Taylor", "last_name_ssi": "Williamson", "middle_name_ssi": "Taylor", "first_name_ssi": "Lacey", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["W.

Under this initiative, park units across the nation have been grouped into 32 separate networks, organized to support the development of integrated park resource inventory and monitoring.  This study focused on the Eastern Rivers and Mountains Network (ERMN), which includes nine park units in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and West Virginia.  \nThe Vital Signs monitoring program was initiated by the NPS to provide the framework for networks to identify and implement long-term monitoring of a set of key attributes.  These attributes are used to track the condition of park natural resources and to identify early warning signs of situations requiring management intervention.  Due to the importance of water resources within the ERMN, the network ranked benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) monitoring as one of its most important vital signs.\nA challenge to the widespread use of BMI for biomonitoring within the ERMN is the associated cost of the methods used, specifically laboratory processing of samples.  Reducing the number of samples or the volume of each sample can reduce costs; however, the merit of reducing physical sample size in the field has not been evaluated for the ERMN BMI monitoring protocol.  Therefore, the goals of this study were to evaluate the effect of reducing BMI sample size in the field on the outcome of BMI bioassessment, and to evaluate the effect of stream condition on the outcome of BMI bioassessment.\nWadable stream sites within ERMN parks were chosen for sampling.  Focus was placed on 15 sites within the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area (DEWA).  Four additional sites were selected from Fort Necessity National Battlefield (FONE), the Friendship Hill National Historic Site (FRHI), and the Johnstown Flood National Memorial (JOFL) to provide a contrast to the DEWA sites which were generally in better condition (i.e., rated higher on the Macroinvertebrate Biotic Integrity Index).  \nBMI were collected from DEWA during October 2008 and from FONE, FRHI, and JOFL during November 2008.  BMI samples were collected from the richest targeted habitat (i.e., riffle habitat) within each established stream reach using a Slack sampler (500 \u00b5m mesh net) in conjunction with a 0.25 m2 area template to delineate the sampling area upstream of the net.  The length of each reach was 40 times the wetted stream width (minimum allowed length = 150 m; maximum = 500 m).  Five sub-samples were collected from each stream reach resulting in a total sampling area of 1.25 m2 for each study site.  Samples were spaced as evenly as possible throughout the reach and were collected by placing the net downstream of the 0.25 m2 template and carefully disturbing all substrate within the template to remove BMI.  The area within the grid was then raked with a hand cultivator rake to a depth of 10 cm to disturb the substrate below to dislodge additional BMI.\nOne half of each of the five sub-samples was preserved separately to serve as the five individual sub-samples (replicates) for each site.  The other half of each replicate sample was composited and preserved in a separate container (field composite).  All replicate and field composite samples were processed separately in the laboratory using the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s semi-quantitative method.  Organisms were identified to genus using standard dichotomous taxonomic keys.  The data were used to calculate seven metrics and the Macroinvertebrate Biotic Integrity Index (MBII). \nSites were placed into one of two groups based upon the un-scaled 5-replicate laboratory composite MBII scores to evaluate of the effect of stream condition on BMI bioassessment.  Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling ordination revealed that replicate samples collected near each other were not more similar to each other in composition; which indicated that replicate samples should continue to be distributed as evenly as possible throughout the reach.  Species accumulation plots of the high and low scoring groups appeared to be approaching their asymptotes, no plots reached an asymptote within a sample size of &#8804; 1.25 m2 (5 sample replicates).  Therefore, those interested in discerning the true taxonomic composition of sites should increase the sample size collected from each site regardless of stream condition.\nThe accuracy of metric results increased and variability decreased with increasing sample size.  Accuracy and variability varied among sites and metrics, except for the metric % Dominant 5 Taxa and the Macroinvertebrate Tolerance Index which retained high precision and accuracy across all sites.  Therefore, those interested in the precision and accuracy of the metrics used to calculate the MBII, should not reduce the number of sample replicates collected for the majority of the metrics.  Calculation of the percent error of reduced sample sizes to the reference sample demonstrated that even the full 5-replicate composite samples only yielded mean index scores that were &#8804; 10 % different from the field composite index score at 11 of 19 sites.  In other words, investigators cannot reduce sampling effort without suffering a substantial loss in accuracy of the BMI bioassessment.  However, composite sample sizes of half of the original volume yield MBII scores similar to those produced from full composite samples, even when extremely large numbers of organisms are identified from the halved samples.  Therefore, in the field it should be necessary to only retain and preserve half of each replicate sample while generating the composite sample.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4588], "author_name_tesi": "Williamson, Neihl Adam", "last_name_ssi": "Williamson", "middle_name_ssi": "Adam", "first_name_ssi": "Neihl", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Wildlife and Fisheries Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Paola Ferreri", "C Paola Ferreri"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Paola Ferreri, Thesis Advisor", "C Paola Ferreri, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["National Park Service", "Macroinvertebrate", "Sampling Effort", "Bioassessment"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Strong-field Photoionization of Sputtered Neutral Molecules for Chemical Imaging and Depth Profiling", "id": "10140", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1403", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-08-27T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Photoionization of molecules sputtered from molecular thin films and biological cells has been achieved using laser radiation in the short-wavelength/low-intensity and the long-wavelength/high-intensity regimes.

Raman scattering techniques have been employed to detect and identify materials in both a laboratory and field settings; however, Raman scattering processes have an extremely small scattering cross section; however, which limits its utility.  Through the use of the resonance enhancement it is possible to extend the utility of the Raman scattering technique.  \nThis dissertation presents a novel Raman scattering experiment that was designed and developed in collaboration with the research group of Professor Hans Hallen and performed at The North Carolina State University Optics Lab.  Measurements of resonance-enhanced Raman scattering were made on multiple samples.  In particular, this dissertation reports an investigation of the phenomenon of resonance-enhanced Raman scattering in two aromatic hydrocarbons: benzene and toluene.\nAlgorithms were developed for the analysis of the Raman data that included removing the noise background and normalizing data to remove fluctuations in laser power and detector efficiencies.  An algorithm for calculating the resonance gain was developed and applied to both benzene and toluene.  The resonance-enhanced Raman scatter of benzene and toluene was found to be 100-10,000  larger than their normal Raman scattering spectrum when the molecules are excited by radiation at peaks in their respective electronic resonance excitation bands.  Further analysis of the resonant Raman spectra of benzene was performed, and the Raman scattered lines observed were assigned to the modes of vibration.  The resultant spectra are in good agreement with the earlier work performed by Zeigler and Hudson[1981] and Asher [1984].\nThe original goal of the investigation of the resonance enhancement was to seek seek improved capability for lidar based on the experiments.  It can be argued that the absorption of energy in the energetic double bonds of carbon which form the benzene ring can be used for resonance Raman enhanced scatter, and future investigations should result in demonstrations of our ability to remotely detect a number of interesting species.\n\nSeveral achievements from my research described in this dissertation include:\n1)\tA new experiment has investigated resonance-enhanced Raman scattering for the first time using small steps in excitation wavelength [~ 0.12 nm]. \n2)\tExcitation at wavelengths in the ultraviolet spectrum resulting in resonance-enhanced Raman scattering in both benzene and toluene occur over extremely narrow wavelength bands.\n3)\tA high resolution (fine-tuning) of the ultraviolet excitation has been used to investigate the enhancement, and to isolate the gain region for resonance-Raman scattering in benzene.\n4)\tThe peak resonance enhancement is found to correlate with the vapor-phase absorption peaks of both benzene and toluene, when the experiments were performed in liquid phase.  \n5)\tThe resonance Raman spectra of benzene has been analyzed and vibrational modes associated with the scattering have been assigned.\n6)\tAn algorithm is described for use in the analysis of the Raman spectra, including noise removal and normalization corrections for source and detector wavelength dependence, and it is applied in analyzing the data collected.\n7)\tAn algorithm was developed for the calculation of the resonance enhancement to determine the gain factor for the resonance Raman scattered signals.\n\n\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [135], "author_name_tesi": "Willitsford, Adam Henry", "last_name_ssi": "Willitsford", "middle_name_ssi": "Henry", "first_name_ssi": "Adam", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Electrical Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["C Russell Philbrick", "Kultegin Aydin", "Sven G Bilen", "Zhiwen Liu", "Hampton Nelson Shirer", "Dr Hans Hallen", "Stewart Kendall Kurtz", "Kenneth Jenkins"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["C Russell Philbrick, Committee Chair", "Kultegin Aydin, Committee Member", "Sven G Bilen, Committee Member", "Zhiwen Liu, Committee Member", "Hampton Nelson Shirer, Committee Member", "Dr Hans Hallen, Committee Member", "Stewart Kendall Kurtz, Committee Member", "Kenneth Jenkins, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["ultraviolet", "uv", "benzene", "toluene", "spectroscopy", "raman", "resonance"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "Relevance of the P3b event-related potential to children's self-regulation and academic performance: Findings from a developmental cascade model", "id": "18908", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "8929", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-05-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Children\u2019s ability to regulate their attention, emotions and behaviors at school entry is critical for setting the stage for positive school adjustment and optimal academic performance.

This paper uses a developmental cascade model to examine how individual differences in the amplitude of high-risk kindergarten (KG) children\u2019s P3b event-related potentials, measured following target stimuli in a Go/No-Go task, predict their behavioral self-regulation and academic performance in KG, 1st, and 2nd grade. This study provides evidence that higher P3b amplitudes are associated with better behavioral self-regulation in the kindergarten classroom, which mediates a positive indirect effect of P3b amplitude on academic performance in 1st grade. Given that P3b amplitude indexes selective attention processes, these findings build on the scientific justification for interventions targeting young children\u2019s attention skills in order to promote their self-regulation and academic achievement. P3b amplitude, or a closely-linked neurocognitive assessment, may also prove useful as a tool for identifying children to target for specific interventions and for assessing the potential impacts of interventions on the functioning of neural networks subserving selective attention.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8769], "author_name_tesi": "Willner, Cynthia Jean", "last_name_ssi": "Willner", "middle_name_ssi": "Jean", "first_name_ssi": "Cynthia", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa Michelle Kopp"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa Michelle Kopp, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["event-related potentials", "P3b", "self-regulation", "selective attention", "academic performance", "learning engagement", "early childhood"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms: Developmental dynamics and neural indices of social threat processing biases", "id": "fn106x93g", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12745", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-06T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Emotional and behavioral problems in childhood can generally be accounted for by two overarching factors: externalizing problems, including aggression and hyperactivity, and internalizing problems, including anxiety and social withdrawal. Comorbidity between internalizing and externalizing problems is surprisingly common and is associated with particularly severe and chronic maladjustment, yet little is known about when and why internalizing-externalizing comorbidity emerges. This dissertation consists of two studies investigating the development of internalizing, externalizing, and comorbid problems in young school-aged children. Both studies drew on a sample of 336 children from an urban school district who were over-sampled for aggressive/oppositional behavior problems and followed longitudinally from kindergarten to 2nd grade. \n\nIn Study 1, an exploratory latent transition analysis was conducted to explore the developmental dynamics of aggression/oppositionality, hyperactivity/inattention, anxiety, and social withdrawal in kindergarten through 2nd grade. Four latent profiles were identified: comorbid (48% of the sample in each year), internalizing (19-23%), externalizing (21-22%), and well-adjusted (7-11%). High continuity was observed in symptom profiles across years, particularly for the comorbid profile. Additionally, internalizing children had a 20% probability of remitting by the following year, whereas externalizing children had a 25% probability of transitioning to the comorbid profile. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a common vulnerability factor contributes to developmentally stable internalizing-externalizing comorbidity, while also suggesting that some children with externalizing symptoms are at risk for subsequently accumulating internalizing symptoms.\n\nStudy 2 explored associations between 1st-grade children\u2019s joint internalizing-externalizing symptoms and neural indices of social threat processing biases, measured as event-related potential amplitude differences to threatening versus neutral facial expressions. The results suggested that high-externalizing/low-internalizing children exhibit deficient automatic attentional capture by fearful faces and blunted biases toward sustained perceptual processing of threatening versus neutral faces. In contrast, high-internalizing/low-externalizing children exhibited greater automatic attentional capture by fearful faces. Finally, children with comorbid internalizing-externalizing symptoms exhibited more normative patterns of social threat processing. This suggests that social threat processing biases act as differential risk factors for externalizing versus internalizing problems, and they do not explain internalizing-externalizing comorbidity.\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11964], "author_name_tesi": "Willner, Cynthia Jean", "last_name_ssi": "Willner", "middle_name_ssi": "Jean", "first_name_ssi": "Cynthia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lisa Michelle Kopp"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lisa Michelle Kopp, Dissertation Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["developmental psychopathology", "internalizing", "externalizing", "latent transition analysis", "emotional face processing", "event-related potentials", "attention biases"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "FUSARIUM HEAD BLIGHT DISEASE DEVELOPMENT AND MYCOTOXIN ACCUMULATION IN WHEAT\n", "id": "9815", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3410", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-06-15T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Fusarium graminearum, causal agent of Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) of wheat, causes yield losses and contaminates grain with mycotoxins, most commonly deoxynivalenol (DON).  FHB is one of the most destructive and economically important plant diseases and is found in all wheat-growing regions of the world.  DON is the most widely encountered mycotoxin by humans in the world.  This toxin binds to eukaryotic ribosomes and inhibits protein synthesis in wheat, humans and animals.  During acute exposure DON can cause cell death, vomiting and suppress the immune system. Annual FHB epidemics and DON levels are extremely influenced by the environment.  The effects of environment on the relationships between fungal growth, disease development and DON accumulation are not fully understood.  Without this basic knowledge, FHB and DON prevention, control and mitigation will continue to be a problem for all involved in the wheat industry and consumers.  The purpose of this dissertation was to characterize FHB disease development and mycotoxin accumulation during the grain development stages in wheat.  \nA two-year field experiment was designed to study the effects of infection-timing and cultivar on disease severity, kernel damage and accumulation of DON.  Three winter wheat cultivars, with different degrees of susceptibility to FHB, were planted in a split-plot design.  Misting treatments were designed to facilitate infections during anthesis and/or late-milk stages.  All plots were inoculated with F. graminearum macroconidia prior to each misting treatment to ensure the presence of the pathogen.  Disease severity of each subplot was assessed during the dough stages, while Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK) and DON accumulation were measured post-harvest.  Misting treatment, cultivar and their interactions were significant factors for severity, FDK and DON.  This study confirmed that infections during both anthesis and grain-fill contributed to symptoms and DON levels.  Infections during grain-fill alone contributed to DON accumulation (> 2ppm) and had little effect on symptoms.  Response to infection-timing was found to be cultivar-specific.  Infection-timing and host genotype interactions play significant roles in disease development and mycotoxin contamination of wheat.  Future work should incorporate a wider range of wheat cultivars so as to gain more information on the effect of infection-timing.  \nThe second objective of this work was to develop a method to simultaneously detect DON and fungal biomass in wheat heads, as the relationship between toxin production and fungal growth is not fully understood.  By analyzing single wheat florets from infected wheat heads, infection and toxin accumulation patterns could be studied.  Deoxynivalenol was extracted from FHB-affected single florets with acetonitrile-water.  Ergosterol, a fungal-specific sterol found in the cell membrane, was used as a biomarker for fungal biomass.  Ergosterol was removed from the same wheat florets through saponification and extraction with hexane.  Toxin and ergosterol extracts were combined and analyzed via gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD).  This method was also designed to detect deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside (DON-gluc), a conjugated mycotoxin, which forms in planta.  Retention times were confirmed with analytical standards and standard curves were created to estimate concentrations of these in floret samples.  The limits of quantification were 0.005, 0.050 and 0.100ng/\u00b5l for DON, ergosterol and DON-gluc, respectively.  The extraction protocols and GC-ECD method are tools with the potential to study trichothecene accumulation and fungal colonization of many important agricultural commodities.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3398], "author_name_tesi": "Willyerd, Katelyn Tilley", "last_name_ssi": "Willyerd", "middle_name_ssi": "Tilley", "first_name_ssi": "Katelyn", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Plant Pathology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gretchen Anna Kuldau", "Gretchen Anna Kuldau", "Douglas D Archibald", "Erick D De Wolf", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco", "Gary William Moorman", "Henry K Ngugi"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gretchen Anna Kuldau, Dissertation Advisor", "Gretchen Anna Kuldau, Committee Chair", "Douglas D Archibald, Committee Member", "Erick D De Wolf, Committee Member", "Maria Del Mar Jimenez Gasco, Committee Member", "Gary William Moorman, Committee Member", "Henry K Ngugi, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["electron capture detection", "masked mycotoxin", "gas chromatography", "deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside", "ergosterol", "vomitoxin", "DON", "deoxynivalenol", "Fusarium damaged kernels", "disease severity", "infection-timing", "Fusarium graminearum", "plant pathology", "epidemiology", "mycotoxicology"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Application of the Radical Law in Generalization of National Hydrography Data for Multiscale Mapping\n", "id": "11359", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "3112", "abstract_tesi": "The mere process of making a map requires one to generalize the features that are being depicted.  There are many processes involved in generalization that are captured in various models and operations.  These models attempt to encapsulate the decision-making process of cartographers so others may learn from their expertise.  Regardless of the model used, feature selection is the first step in any generalization project.  The Principles of Selection (T\u00f6pfer & Pillewizer, 1966) provide a guideline cartographers may turn to in determining how many features should be shown on a smaller-scale map.  Also known as the Radical Law, the Principles of Selection utilize a square root relationship between the scale denominators of a source map and derived map to inform how many features should be retained at the smaller scale.   This thesis contributes to on-going efforts by the USGS to automate the generalization process of topographic data in support of The National Map.  Its focus is on hydrographic feature selection for multiscale mapping of the USGS National Hydrography Dataset.  Four primary scales are utilized: 1:4,800; 1:24,000; 1:100,000; and 1:2,000,000.  Existing data are compared to expectations provided by the Radical Law, and a new constant, the Constant of Flowlines (Cf) is proposed to address variations from the expected numbers at various scale ranges.  The new constant is employed to guide hydrographic network refinement, called flowline pruning.  Pruning is accomplished based on density measured by flowline length per square kilometer of area.  Additional factors are introduced to the density pruning process to account for post-selection generalization operations.  A test case is presented based on findings and suggestions.\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3101], "author_name_tesi": "Wilmer, James Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Wilmer", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "James", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Geography", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Cynthia Ann Brewer", "Cynthia Ann Brewer"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Cynthia Ann Brewer, Thesis Advisor", "Cynthia Ann Brewer, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["generalization", "Radical Law", "hydrography", "multiscale"]}, {"year_isi": 2017, "title_ssi": "Extremophiles in Built Environments", "id": "14715rlw272", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "14715", "defended_at_dtsi": "2017-11-15T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A significant fraction of Earth\u2019s microbial diversity derives from species living in extreme environments. On Earth life is generally found wherever liquid water exists, including extreme habitats built by humans. Understanding how communities function in such environments is critical for understanding the full extent of the biosphere and setting guidelines for the search for life on other planetary bodies. Extremophile communities have been known to inhabit the built environment since the 1970s, when Brock and Boylen discovered thermophiles in industrial water heaters similar to those growing in natural hot springs. There is public interest in understanding the ecology and functional diversity of those microorganisms which occupy the spaces that now serve as the primary human habitat in the developed world.\nIn this dissertation I investigate microbial life in two human-impacted extreme environments: a deep subsurface mine, and domestic water heaters. I begin with a study of in situ growth of halophilic bacteria in boreholes 2.4 km deep inside a base metal mine in the Canadian Shield. Biosampler units were deployed into hydrogen-rich boreholes, recovering halophilic microbes growing in situ on geologically derived gases and ancient fracture water. Genetic and microscopic analyses reveal an ecosystem that supports microbial growth via lithoautotrophy despite being disturbed by human activity.\nThe focus then moves away from the deep subsurface and into the extreme thermal environment of household water heaters. I present the results of a citizen scientist survey of thermophiles growing in domestic water heaters across the United States. Community level 16S sequencing, cell culture, and single species genome sequences are used to examine the distribution of thermophiles in domestic water heaters, particularly from the genus Thermus. Hot tap water is dominated by genetic signal from mesophilic organisms with a smaller but significant signal from thermophiles. Only one species, Thermus scotoductus, was recovered from cultures. This species was found in diverse water heaters across the United States and was by far the most prevalent member of the genus Thermus recovered from the water heater ecosystem. Finally, I explore the genetic makeup of these cultured strains in more detail, investigating the role of natural competence and phage transduction in shaping the pan-genome of Thermus scotoductus in the built environment.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [16008], "author_name_tesi": "Wilpiszeski, Regina Leila", "last_name_ssi": "Wilpiszeski", "middle_name_ssi": "Leila", "first_name_ssi": "Regina", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Geosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Howard House", "Christopher Howard House", "Jennifer Macalady", "Julie Genevieve Cosmidis", "Istvan Albert"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Howard House, Dissertation Advisor", "Christopher Howard House, Committee Chair", "Jennifer Macalady, Committee Member", "Julie Genevieve Cosmidis, Committee Member", "Istvan Albert, Outside Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Extremophiles", "Built environment", "Subsurface", "Astrobiology", "Microbial ecology", "Thermus scotoductus"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "BIRD POPULATION RESPONSES TO \nCONSERVATION GRASSLANDS IN PENNSYLVANIA", "id": "9390", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "305", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-02-17T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Grassland obligate birds have been in precipitous decline across North America for several decades. One of the principal mechanisms for stemming these declines is farmland conservation programs, among which the Conservation Reserve Program has been particularly successful in delivering millions of acres of new grasslands. Evidence of the efficacy of such programs for grassland bird conservation in the eastern United States is lacking. In 2000 the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) was established in Pennsylvania with the provision of grassland wildlife habitat one of its key aims. I show that within Pennsylvania, grassland obligates species showed sustained declines from the 1960s onwards. I use several bird survey data sources to assess the population-scale effects of CREP on a range of species within the state.\n\nA bird monitoring program was established in 2001 to assess farmland and grassland bird population trends in southern Pennsylvania. Trends for the period 2001 to 2005 provide scant evidence of population-scale changes in bird numbers; most grassland obligates continued to decline, but declines for some species were slower in areas with high rates of CREP enrollment. Eastern meadowlark was the only songbird for which I could demonstrate a strong response to higher rates of CREP enrollment, results for grasshopper sparrow and bobolink suggest that these species may have benefited, but the results are more equivocal. My analysis was hampered by the short time-series \u2013 fields were still being planted when the monitoring was curtailed. Further, the study coincided with the emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) in Pennsylvania, which further complicated the analysis. I show that WNV caused significant decreases in seven common bird species, notably corvids and cavity nesting songbirds.\n\nA survey of winter raptor numbers initiated in 2001 provided an ideal opportunity to test the hypothesis that CREP also provides habitat for wintering birds of prey. I show that at broad spatial scales there were increases in raptor numbers in areas where there was the most CREP, the results being particularly pronounced for northern harrier. Although these relationships are merely correlational, they do suggest that the new habitat provided by CREP has been sufficient to cause a significant shift in the wintering populations of this species.\nI use point count data from the 2nd Pennsylvania Breeding Bird Atlas to estimate grassland songbird populations and assess the relative importance of farmland for these species. I show that although densities are often low, farmland supports the majority of the populations of most grassland songbirds in Pennsylvania. I suggest that management, enrollment and re-enrollment of CREP fields could be better targeted. Large CREP fields in south central Pennsylvania should be managed specifically for eastern meadowlarks and grasshopper sparrows, while in the west of the state; further research could allow a targeting of CREP toward populations of the threatened Henslow\u2019s sparrow. Small fields, which may be less suitable for grassland obligates, should provide habitat for species characteristic of early successional habitats, including the declining Field Sparrow. Population estimates show that CREP fields support only a small proportion of the population of most grassland songbirds. This highlights the importance of conservation efforts in known areas of high population density, such as reclaimed surface mines. Better targeting and careful management of CREP fields could potentially increase their value for grassland birds, but more research is needed if this is to be realized.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [301], "author_name_tesi": "Wilson, Andrew Mark", "last_name_ssi": "Wilson", "middle_name_ssi": "Mark", "first_name_ssi": "Andrew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Ecology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham", "Margaret Brittingham", "Duane R Diefenbach", "Murali Haran", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Margaret Brittingham, Dissertation Advisor", "Margaret Brittingham, Committee Chair", "Duane R Diefenbach, Committee Member", "Murali Haran, Committee Member", "Walter Matthew Tzilkowski, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["grassland bird", "conservation", "CRP", "Pennsylvania", "CREP"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Energy Management and Battery Testing for the Analysis of a Diesel-electric Hybrid Locomotive Powertrain", "id": "28807", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "12462", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-03-28T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Development of optimized control strategies to coordinate the internal combustion (IC) engine and battery system in series hybrid locomotives allow the advantages of the hybrid system to be fully realized.

Moreover, as these machines grow in computational power, the magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs) they rely upon to store data to and retrieve data from double in capacity roughly every 18 months.  These facts considered in concert provide a foundation for the recent data-driven revolution in the way both scientists and businesses extract useful knowledge from their increasing datasets.\n\nHowever, while computation and capacity potential for these machines is growing at a breathless rate, a disturbing but oft-ignored reality is that the ability to access the data on a given HDDs is shrinking by comparison, doubling only once every decade.

Some suggestions for policy and practice include (1) establish stakeholders with clearly outlined parameters from the onset of the partnership, (2) implement effective strategies for successful partnership building and program implementation, (3) develop and sustain consistent and continuous communication for the duration of the partnership, (4) set incremental stages of evaluation of the partnership and program and allow for midstream adjustments based on the results.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1953], "author_name_tesi": "Wilson, Felicia Renee", "last_name_ssi": "Wilson", "middle_name_ssi": "Renee", "first_name_ssi": "Felicia", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Educational Leadership", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Dr John Tippecconnic", "John Tippeconnic", "David Post", "Nona Ann Prestine", "Constance A Flanagan"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Dr John Tippecconnic, Dissertation Advisor", "John Tippeconnic, Committee Chair", "David Post, Committee Chair", "Nona Ann Prestine, Committee Member", "Constance A Flanagan, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Girls Education", "south Africa", "UNICEF", "Violence in Schools"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "EXCHANGE AND CRYSTALLINE ORIENTATION STUDIES OF THE III-V FERROMAGNETIC SEMICONDUCTOR (Ga,Mn)As\n\n", "id": "11293", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4204", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The prototypical dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As has been extensively studied in the field of spintronics, where both the electron charge and spin are exploited.  The origin of ferromagnetism in this material is in the exchange of itinerant holes with localized Mn moments allowing for a direct coupling of both electronic and magnetic properties.  Research on (Ga,Mn)As has focused on three areas:  1) the enhancement of Curie temperature, 2) the study of phenomena using this unique material class, 3) development of \u201cproof of concept\u201d devices. This thesis explores each of these three areas.  \n\nSignificant progress has been made in raising the Curie temperature by increasing both the Mn and carrier concentration, but defect structure plays an ever increasing role as doping is increased.  Recent theoretical models and scanning spectroscopy experiments have suggested a novel way of enhancing Tc by exploring the relative microscopic positions of Mn atoms.  This thesis discusses work on digital superlattices grown on various crystalline orientations to test this prediction.  The unexpected discovery that defect structure is intimately connected to growth direction will also be covered.  \n\nExchange engineering of (Ga,Mn)As is crucial in fabricating certain devices such as low resistance magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs).  This thesis explores exchange biasing with the hard ferromagnetic metal MnAs and shows the coupling can quantitatively be understood in the context of a partial domain wall model.  Utilizing this new coupling technique, MTJs were fabricated to explore phenomena such as the metal-insulator transition and temperature dependent tunneling magnetoresistance.  Sub-micron sized MTJs were produced for spin transfer torque devices with smaller critical currents than traditional metal based junctions and higher conductances than previously fabricated non-biased semiconductor devices.\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [4177], "author_name_tesi": "Wilson, Mark Jeffrey", "last_name_ssi": "Wilson", "middle_name_ssi": "Jeffrey", "first_name_ssi": "Mark", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Physics", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Peter E Schiffer", "Peter E Schiffer", "Nitin Samarth", "Ying Liu", "James Hansell Adair"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Peter E Schiffer, Dissertation Advisor", "Peter E Schiffer, Committee Chair", "Nitin Samarth, Committee Member", "Ying Liu, Committee Member", "James Hansell Adair, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["gallium manganese arsenide", "Mn)As", "(Ga", "GaMnAs", "spintronics", "magnetic semiconductor", "spin torque", "magnetic tunnel junction"]}, {"year_isi": 2006, "title_ssi": "IMPROVING INTERGROUP RELATIONS THROUGH PROGRAMMED INTERGROUP CONTACT: A MODEL PROCESS AND ITS EFFECTS", "id": "7017", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "4071", "defended_at_dtsi": "2006-03-27T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Demographic trends and advances in technology have increased proximity and interdependence of diverse and historically separate races and cultures worldwide, leading to more frequent intergroup contact.  Such contact can lead to mutually beneficial relationships, or to misunderstandings, discrimination, and conflict.  The available current research on intergroup contact indicates that simply bringing groups into contact with each other is not enough to ensure positive outcomes.  The purpose of this research study was to examine one specific programmed intergroup contact effort by looking at four major areas identified in the intergroup contact literature as warranting further attention.  Specifically, this study attempted to (1) research the effects of one model programmed intergroup contact intervention program, (2) examine the impact of intergroup contact on both majority and minority participants simultaneously, (3) explore the interactions between majority and minority participants from a phenomenological perspective, and (4) examine the role of empathy in influencing the outcome of the contact experience.\nFor this study, both quantitative and qualitative data were collected and analyzed.  The quantitative portion of this study was a quasi-experimental field study employing a pretest-posttest control group design.  Pretest and posttest assessment instruments were identical and included the CoBRAS, M-GUDS, and QDI.  There were three experimental conditions.  First was the control which included participants that had no exposure to any form or portion of the nine-week intervention program.  Participants in the other two conditions were exposed to the same nine-week intervention program with one variation; the assigned readings were experimentally manipulated so that half the participants were assigned readings identified as \u201cfactual,\u201d and the other half readings that were identified as \u201cpersonal,\u2019 and intended to evoke greater levels of empathy.  In addition, qualitative data were collected following each weekly session in the form of the Session Evaluation Questionnaire (SEQ) and a critical incident report.  Also qualitative data were collected posttest in the form of a course evaluation sheet from all participants, plus semi-structured individual interviews with 12 participants.\nAnalyses of the pretest/posttest quantitative data included an ANOVA and two MANCOVA using the pretest scores as a covariate.  A phenomenological approach to analyses of the qualitative data was employed, including thematic categorization of the weekly critical incident reports.  Findings were then compared and reported based on patterns over time, experimental condition, and race.  Mean scores on the four scales produced by the SEQ were also compared and reported by patterns over time, condition and race.  Finally, quantitative findings were compared to qualitative findings to help gain greater understanding and generate additional hypotheses.\nThe results from analyses of the quantitative data found no significant differences between any of the conditions (i.e. \u2013 control, intervention with factual readings, or intervention with factual readings) at the .05 significance level for any of the seven scores or factor scores produced (i.e. \u2013 one M-GUDS score, plus three factor scores each for the CoBRAS and QDI), with the exception of the CoBRAS factor III.  Participants in both of the experimental conditions were found to have improved significantly in regard to awareness of blatant racial issues compared to those in the control, as measured by the CoBRAS factor III.  There were not significant differences found on any of the measures between participants in the two experimental conditions (i.e. \u2013 those exposed to factual versus personal readings).  \nUnfortunately, data from the posttest interviews were not of sufficient quality to properly analyze (i.e. - the tapes could not be transcribed).  However, analyses of the remaining qualitative data revealed five themes:  focus on Self, Other, Topic, Group Process, or Structured Exercise.  Further, analyses of this data indicated that minority participants may attend to different factors at different times than majority participants.

This scheme has the advantage that the time step error incurred in the use of the DQMC method is minimized since it only applies to the correction to the energy, rather than the entire energy.  \n\tThe simulation for neon validated the use of the scheme in correctly calculating the ground state energy of an atom.  In this case, the scheme obtained 97% of the difference in energy between the VQMC and DQMC energies.  The simulation for H2 was done to reproduce results of a simple, well-known system for various bond lengths.  Again, in this case, the correction scheme succeeded in correcting the VQMC energy to close to the DQMC values.  Finally, for cyclical C10, the scheme was run for a number of geometries in which either the bond angles or bond lengths were varied at different ring sizes.  It was found that for smaller rings, a more symmetrical geometry is preferred, while for larger ring sizes there tend to be at least a local minimum energy for rings distorted by either their bond angles or bond lengths.  \n\tAlso included are DQMC calculations of the potential energies of interaction of helium atoms in helium dimers and trimers.  Statistical errors are lower by a factor of two to ten than for earlier diffusion calculations.

Few studies have analyzed the resource utilization in terms of length of stay and costs as they relate to procedural volume.   This study estimates the effects of surgeon and hospital volume and the potential interaction between the two on mortality, length of stay and costs after colectomy.  \nMethods: Using the HCUP National Inpatient Sample data from 2004-2008, surgeon and hospital volume were stratified into tertiles based upon the sample distribution.  Covariates included demographic factors and patient comorbidities.  Multiple logistic and linear regression was used to assess the impact of hospital and surgeon volume on mortality, length of stay and costs while controlling for covariates and patient risk factors.  A propensity score matched cohort was used to compare the same outcomes between low volume and high volume surgeons.  \nResults: Unadjusted analysis showed lower costs, length of stay and mortality among high volume surgeons and high volume hospitals.  No evidence for interaction between surgeon volume and hospital volume was found.  Propensity score analysis found no significant difference in mortality by surgeon volume (6.71%, vs. 6.54%, p=0.751), but significantly shorter length of stay (11.2 vs. 12.9 days, p<0.0001) and lower costs ($26,621.38 vs. $28,967.47, p<0.0001) for high versus low volume surgeons.\nConclusions: Hospital and surgeon volume do not contribute to mortality outcomes when controlling for patient risk.  However, higher volume surgeons incur lower costs and shorter lengths of stay than lower volume surgeons. \n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8566], "author_name_tesi": "Wilson, Matthew Z", "last_name_ssi": "Wilson", "middle_name_ssi": "Z", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Public Health Sciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Christopher Hollenbeak"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Christopher Hollenbeak, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Colectomy", "Outcomes", "National Inpatient Sample"]}, {"year_isi": 2015, "title_ssi": "Castling The King: Institutional Sequencing And Regime Change", "id": "25721", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "11329", "defended_at_dtsi": "2015-05-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The question that this dissertation seeks to answer is the following: What conditions\ndetermine the timing of political institutions in authoritarian regimes? An increasing\nfocus in the comparative research on modern autocracies is on the institutions\nby which di\u000berent forms of authoritarianism govern. In terms of formal political\ninstitutions{the rules and expectations by which politics is conducted and society\noperates{non-democracies have displayed a remarkable diversity and survivability. The\nthesis attempts to explain the relative bene\fts of authoritarian institutions{particularly\nthe legislature{in situations with high uncertainty. Recent work has highlighted major\ndi\u000berences between modern autocratic institutions, such as parties and legislatures, which\nseemingly \\go together.\" In contrast, this study addresses antecedent conditions that\npredict the turn to neither, to one, or to both. I argue that historical patterns of state\nbuilding show a common trend in which contestation precluded participation, and that\nthis trend helps to explain the timing and success of institutions in authoritarian regimes.\nNoting that a majority of non-democracies have legalized legislatures but are not\nbased on a political party, and that leaders who adapt institutions are more likely to\nallow a legislature than to encourage parties, I draw on a real-world example in which\na dictator confronted issues of power-sharing to better understand the attractiveness of\nan authoritarian legislature. A prime example of power-sharing problems is nineteenth century Mexico, during which a federal government was being forged out of protracted\npost-independence con\nict between multiple parties with di\u000berent ideologies. The\nadministration of Por\frio D\u0013\u0010az{roughly, 1876-1911{maintained relative stability in the\nabsence of modern political parties and with a regularly meeting Congress. I demonstrate\nthat regional bosses emerged after Independence and Reform as a consequence of local\nviolence patterns, and that their capacity to contain regional politics earned them a\nsay in the formation of law. The problems facing Por\frio D\u0013\u0010az therefore di\u000bered from\nthose facing post-Revolutionary leaders, which explain the timing of legislative and party\ninstitutions in Mexico.\nUsing a cross-national dataset on levels of executive recruitment and political\ncompetition for 1800-2013, I examine whether there are `modal' patterns of institutional\ndevelopment. I \fnd that transitions that \frstly involved regularizing contestation\ncharacterize the bulk of countries in my sample. In turn, this state positively predicts\nregime type, ethnic diversity in party leadership, and the survival of authoritarian regimes.\nThe results suggest that the emergence of modern authoritarian institutions is conditioned\nby con\nict and unrest, and that particular institutional arrangements provide distinct\nsolutions to di\u000berent problems related to governance. Though applied to a modern\nsample, the historical case and the tested logic encourage scholars to further consider\nwhether there exist distinct paths of institutional development. The research supports\ncomparative research by considering the long-term temporal dimension of institutional\nchange, utilizing the richness of experiences in Latin America to explain political\ntransitions, and adding nuance to the study of authoritarian parties and legislatures.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [10866], "author_name_tesi": "Wilson, Matthew Charles", "last_name_ssi": "Wilson", "middle_name_ssi": "Charles", "first_name_ssi": "Matthew", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Political Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Gretchen G Casper", "Gretchen G Casper", "Joseph Wright", "James A Piazza", "Melissa Hardy"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Gretchen G Casper, Dissertation Advisor", "Gretchen G Casper, Committee Chair", "Joseph Wright, Committee Member", "James A Piazza, Committee Member", "Melissa Hardy, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Authoritarianism", "Sequencing", "Institutions", "Latin America", "Mexico", "Statebuilding"]}, {"year_isi": 2013, "title_ssi": "KNOWLEDGE, COMMUNICATION, AND ADVOCACY OF CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE PARENTS AT INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM MEETINGS", "id": "19614", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "9282", "defended_at_dtsi": "2013-08-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Semi-structured interviews using Cognitive Interview method techniques were conducted with nine Culturally and Linguistically Diverse parents of students with disabilities in this exploratory study.

Participants in Study 1 were 28 alumni from a graduate school psychology program, who were employed outside of Pennsylvania.  In Study 2, participants were 272 school psychologists from the Association of School Psychologists of Pennsylvania (ASPP).  All participants were certified in school psychology and had either a Master\u2019s or Doctoral degree.  For both studies, a post-test only analogue design was used.  Three student summaries, embedded with assessment data, were systematically manipulated to vary in complexity level (Learning Disability, Normal, and Complicated) and either randomly or systematically assigned to be reviewed by participants.  The Decision-Making Questionnaire, developed by the author, was used to gather data about the use of the representativeness heuristic and assessment data by school psychologists.  The representativeness heuristic was measured in four ways based on the research design of previous studies.  Descriptive statistics, t-tests, contingency tables, ANOVAs, and MANOVAs with descriptive discriminant analysis were used to answer a total of eight research questions.  Overall, findings suggested that the representativeness heuristic played a role in the decision-making of school psychologists, although depending on how it was measured, its use varied with the complexity of the student data summary.  The findings also indicated that school psychologists were relatively consistent in rating the following data important in making eligibility decisions: achievement scores, IQ score, response-to-classroom modification, state criteria, and assessments of behavior.  Additionally, focus on progress-monitoring data and referral information appears to influence the propensity to make classification errors.  Lastly, the theory of bounded rationality is supported by results regarding the use of the representativeness heuristic and assessment data.  Future research is needed to extend the generalizability of findings and to assess reliable ways of measuring heuristics.  \n \n\n\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5710], "author_name_tesi": "Wilson, Sharise M.

Results from Study 2 suggest daily empathic spouse responsiveness promotes long-term improvement of patient physical function.\nTogether, the current studies illustrate the proximal and distal health consequences of couples\u2019 daily interaction patterns for patients and spouses.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [11684], "author_name_tesi": "Wilson, Stephanie Joy", "last_name_ssi": "Wilson", "middle_name_ssi": "Joy", "first_name_ssi": "Stephanie", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Human Development and Family Studies", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Lynn Margaret Martire", "Lynn Margaret Martire", "Martin John Sliwinski", "David Manuel Almeida", "Rachel Annette Smith"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Lynn Margaret Martire, Dissertation Advisor", "Lynn Margaret Martire, Committee Chair", "Martin John Sliwinski, Committee Member", "David Manuel Almeida, Committee Member", "Rachel Annette Smith, Special Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["social relationships", "social interaction", "pain communication", "physical health", "couples", "chronic pain"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "FACTORS AFFECTING WOOD PELLET DURABILITY\n\n", "id": "10594", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6256", "abstract_tesi": "Densification increases the bulk density of biomass, thereby increasing the efficiency of its transport and improving its competitiveness with low-cost fossil energy.  The method of densification investigated herein is pelleting.  The research examines factors affecting the durability of fuel pellets produced from various tree species.  Pellet producers often observe differences in pelleting behavior depending on species mix.  By isolating tree species, differences within wood fibers can be observed.\n\nThe Pellet Fuels Institute recently revised standards for pellet quality.  One of these quality metrics is pellet durability.  According to the literature, the melting of lignin is responsible for the lignin solid bridges that largely contribute to pellet durability.  By producing pellets from tree species displaying a range of lignin contents and reproducing these lignin contents by mixing two feedstocks, the effect of lignin on pellet durability is isolated.  \n\nNo impact on pellet durability due to lignin content is observed.  In the absence of a clear lignin effect, bulk material properties of individual species are investigated.   While lignin content varies within tree species, it was not observed to have an impact on pellet durability; however, significant differences in bulk material properties between pellet feedstocks that produced the highest and lowest durability values are observed.  By looking at the bulk modulus and elastic response of densification feedstocks, among other bulk material properties, the biomass densification industry may gain insight into densification behavior.  This is of particular importance as the industry looks to expand to feedstocks beyond woody biomass.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6256], "author_name_tesi": "Wilson, Thomas O.", "last_name_ssi": "Wilson", "middle_name_ssi": "O.", "first_name_ssi": "Thomas", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Agricultural and Biological Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jim Shortle", "Dennis Elvin Buffington"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jim Shortle, Thesis Advisor", "Dennis Elvin Buffington, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["pellet durability", "densification", "biomass", "elastic response", "compressibility", "lignin"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "Life Cycle Emissions and GHG Abatement Costs of Densified Switchgrass for Heat and Power\n\n", "id": "11026", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "13287", "abstract_tesi": "Renewable portfolio standards have emerged as the preferred method for incorporating renewables into the US energy mix.

For example, age-related decreased functioning of the kidneys and liver may be compounded by alcohol use; and risky drinking in older adults is linked to very high rates of major depression in the prior year. Although theory-based psychological factors such as increased perceived stress, positive alcohol outcome expectancies, injunctive drinking norms, and drinking to cope motives are associated with risky drinking in younger populations, there is a dearth of literature examining the relationships between those psychological factors and risky drinking behaviors in older adults. This dissertation examined the associations between perceived stress, positive alcohol outcome expectancies, injunctive drinking norms, drinking to cope motives, and risky alcohol use [i.e., heavy drinking (HD) and heavy episodic drinking (HED)] in a sample of older males and females. Aim 1 focused on the associations between psychological constructs and risky drinking behaviors.  Aim 2 examined whether there are sex differences in the relationships between psychological constructs and risky drinking behaviors.  A sample of 97 adults aged 65 and older (27 males, 70 females) completed a series of surveys on perceived stress, positive alcohol outcome expectancies, injunctive drinking norms, drinking to cope motives, and risky drinking behavior. Hypotheses for both aims were tested using path analysis, with the latter aim using multiple group analyses. Aim 1 analyses revealed partially support for all of the hypotheses. Only feeling like difficulties were piling up so high they could not be overcome emerged as being positively associated with risky drinking (i.e., HED). For positive alcohol outcome expectancies, feeling more energetic and enjoying the buzz when drinking were positively associated with HD and HED, respectively.  Of the IDNs reference groups, only the friends group was positively associated with HD and HED. Regarding drinking to cope motives, drinking because it helps when feeling depressed or nervous was the only motive positively with risky drinking (i.e., HED). The hypotheses for injunctive drinking norms were not supported. Lastly, analyses for Aim 2 also revealed partial support for the positive alcohol outcome expectancy hypothesis. There were significant sex differences only in the positive association between enjoying the buzz while drinking and HED, with the association being stronger in males than females. Future work should examine possible mediators of the relationships between perceived stress, positive alcohol outcome expectancies, injunctive drinking norms, drinking to cope motives, and risky drinking behavior. Also, examine how specific facets of stress and stressors (e.g., chronicity and controllability) affect daily drinking behavior.

Chromosomal sex determination is such an efficient mechanism of determining sex that it has arisen, independently, in multiple lineages, spanning species as diverse as plants, animals and fungi. Sex chromosomes can be either male or female heterogametic, and the heterogametic sex can be different between closely related species. Mammals have a male-heterogametic sex chromosome system where both males and females have two copies of each autosome (non-sex chromosome), males have a single X chromosome and a single, degenerating, Y chromosome, and females have two X chromosomes. Since the sex chromosomes diverged from an ancestral autosomal pair, the X has remained relatively gene-rich, while the Y has lost most of its genes through the accumulation of deleterious mutations in its nonrecombining regions. Curiously, I found that genes on the X and Y acquired distinct evolutionary rates immediately following the suppression of recombination between the two sex chromosomes. The Y-linked genes evolved at higher rates, while the X-linked genes maintained the lower evolutionary rates of the ancestral autosomal genes. These distinct rates have been maintained throughout the evolution of X and Y. Specifically, I found that in human, most X gametologs and, curiously, also most Y gametologs evolved under stronger purifying selection than similarly aged autosomal paralogs. The unique mRNA/protein expression patterns and functions acquired by Y (versus X) gametologs likely contributed to their retention. My analyses of X-linked genes that do, or likely did, have homologous Y-linked sequence suggests that most features of X-linked genes investigated do not have the power to determine which Y-linked genes will be lost or retained over time. Specifically, I concluded that there are no significant differences in the expression, association with disease, or selective constraints of X-linked genes, whether they do or do not have functional Y-homologs. In contrast, I discovered that the X-inactivation status of an X-linked gene is remarkably successful in predicting whether an X-linked gene has Y-linked sequence (68% success rate) or whether its homologous Y sequence has been completely lost (92% success rate). Lastly, because they spend different amounts of time in the male and female germlines, I compared differences in the substitution rates on the X chromosome and autosomes to approximate the ratio of the male mutation rate to the female mutation rate, &#945;. In mammals, although &#945; varies, I confirmed that it is generally greater than 1, indicating a male mutation bias (i.e., that there are more mutations incorporated into the male germline than the female germline). By correlated variations in life history traits with &#945;, and, separately, with genome substitution rates, I showed that variations in predictors of generation time are the strongest predictors of variations in both &#945; and sex-averaged substitution rates at unconstrained sites. I found that variation in predictors of metabolic rate are secondarily important to predicting variation in both &#945; and substitution rates, losing their significance when included in multiple regression models that include predictors of generation time. Finally, contrary to many expectations, I showed that variations in sperm competition, which occurs when sperm from multiple males must compete to fertilize the eggs of a single female, does not have significant predictive power of the variation in &#945; or substitution rates across mammals.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [3974], "author_name_tesi": "Wilson Sayres, Melissa Ann", "last_name_ssi": "Wilson Sayres", "middle_name_ssi": "Ann", "first_name_ssi": "Melissa", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova", "Webb Colby Miller", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer", "Eddie Holmes", "Laura Carrel"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Dissertation Advisor", "Kateryna Dmytrivna Makova, Committee Chair", "Webb Colby Miller, Committee Member", "Stephen Wade Schaeffer, Committee Member", "Eddie Holmes, Committee Member", "Laura Carrel, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["evolution", "genomes", "evolution", "sex chromosomes", "mammals"]}, {"year_isi": 2011, "title_ssi": "Loop Quantum Cosmology: Anisotropies and Inhomogeneities\n", "id": "11649", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1883", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-12-02T10:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "In this dissertation we extend the improved dynamics of loop quantum cosmology from the homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker space-times to cosmological models which allow anisotropies and inhomogeneities.

The participants in this study took the same secondary education course for preservice teachers which focused on critical consciousness raising experiences in order to promote teaching for social justice in classrooms. My participants took this course when they were working on their undergraduate degrees in education. This course was the one course in the education program that brought together students in each of the content specific discipline areas of the program\u2014mathematics, science, social studies, language and literacy, and world languages (Bullock, 2004). The course was taken the semester prior to student teaching and occurred during the first 10 weeks of the semester followed by a five-week practicum (Bullock, 2004).\nIn order to conduct my research project I solicited sixteen secondary education teachers, who were previously enrolled in the same undergraduate teacher education program (mentioned above) at a major university in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States to volunteer to participate in this study. The inservice teachers all took the same secondary education course as preservice teachers which focused on teaching for social justice. \nThere were many factors that influenced the participant\u2019s perspectives about teaching for social justice as well as the degree to which they taught for social justice. All these factors\u2014the undergraduate course rooted in critical consciousness raising experiences, sociocultural structures, political structures, contextual influences, hidden curriculum, teaching stance, teaching praxis\u2014connected to power, privilege, and oppression through issues such as race, ethnicity, class, culture, sexual preference, language, ability, etc.\nBoth participants self-admittedly teach for social justice, however, the degree to which this takes place varies depending on their respective perspectives on what it means to teach for social justice. Jim does not teach for social justice and is less inclined to trouble and challenge dominant perspectives because he is uncomfortable with difference. He also does not understand the sociocultural mechanisms that reproduce hegemony and is part of the complicit process rather than part of the solution. Neil teaches for social justice to a certain degree and is more inclined to trouble and challenge the status quo and hegemonic mechanisms. However, he does this by teaching for the other (Kumashiro, 2002) and teaching about the other (Kumashiro, 2002) but does not teach in a manner that is critical of privileging and Othering (Kumashiro, 2002). \nThis study suggests that more research is needed in order to explore and understand how teachers who have an awareness of teaching for social justice actually teach for social justice. This exploration and understanding needs to look at the broad scope of the influences on teachers and how these influences impact teaching for social justice. In addition, teacher education programs must emotionally and structurally embrace curricula rooted in social justice in order to promote teaching for social justice in a way that preservice teachers can also embrace and incorporate in to their teaching praxis. If preservice teachers are to do this they need to understand approaches like education for the Other, education about the Other, education that is critical of privileging and Othering, and education that changes students and society (Kumashiro, 2002) in order to teach for social justice. \n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [702], "author_name_tesi": "Wilt, Brian James", "last_name_ssi": "Wilt", "middle_name_ssi": "James", "first_name_ssi": "Brian", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Curriculum and Instruction", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Debra M Freedman", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto", "John Daniel Marshall", "Edgar Paul Yoder"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Debra M Freedman, Committee Chair", "Miryam Espinosa Dulanto, Committee Member", "John Daniel Marshall, Committee Member", "Edgar Paul Yoder, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Social Justice", "Antioppressive Education", "Critical Multiculturalism", "Diversity", "Power", "Privilege", "Oppression"]}, {"year_isi": 2014, "title_ssi": "Effective Csr Strategies:  Lessons Learned from Selected Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award Winners", "id": "22844", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2824", "defended_at_dtsi": "2011-07-08T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a business construct and management method is on the rise.  In the US, governmental regulations mandating measurement of CSR, beyond the normal legal, regulatory responsibilities do not exist, nor are there any legislated reporting requirements.

Photovoltaic (PV) cells attached to the edges of an LSC can harvest the concentrated irradiance and reduce the cost of harvesting solar power. A robust and user-friendly Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulation was developed for this thesis to study the efficiencies, loss mechanisms, and costs of LSC systems employing a wide variety of different fluorescent materials and PV cells.  Specifically, the simulation software was used to study the performance of infrared emitting PbSe quantum dot LSCs, estimate the efficiencies of non-conventional PV cells in LSC designs, assess the present capabilities of conventional LSC systems to harvest solar power at reduced cost, and investigate the viability of building-integrated LSC systems.  \n\nInfrared emitting PbSe QD LSCs that employed Ge PV cells were found to suffer from severe self-absorption and down conversion losses, resulting in relatively poor device performance.  The power conversion efficiencies of simulated PbSe QD LSCs in AM1.5 solar illumination were estimated to be on the order of 1%, with flux concentration factors of about 4.  Tandem PbSe QD LSC layers were found to improve the net power conversion efficiency of visible-harvesting LSC systems employing Si PV cells by 10 to 20%.  However, greater efficiency enhancement can be obtained by simply adding a back-surface reflector to the visible harvesting LSC.  \n\nSimulation results suggest that LSC systems employing CdTe and organic PV cells will perform very well due to their low cost, high voltage output, and high quantum efficiency within the emission spectrum of Red305, which is a high efficiency organic dye commonly used in LSC research.  Cost optimization studies of simulated LSCs suggest that optimal LSC thickness is very thin, on the order of 1mm or less regardless of the chosen material system.  Due to the fact that cost-optimized LSC designs were obtained at very thin dimensions, and the use of back-surface reflectors can further reduce cost and improve efficiency, a new idea was proposed in this research to use thin, high aspect ratio LSCs with back-surface reflectors as solar harvesting window blinds and shutters for building-integrated LSC applications.  Both window and window blind LSC configurations can effectively reduce the cost of harvesting solar power to less than $1/W, but power conversion efficiencies are limited to about 3 or 4% with presently available fluorescent materials and PV cells.  Tandem LSC systems can be used in place of double or triple-pane windows to improve the power conversion efficiency of LSC systems without significantly increasing effective cost, but more research needs to be done to find optimal, high-efficiency fluorescent materials with relatively non-overlapping absorption spectra to improve the efficiency of tandem LSC systems.  \n\nAlthough LSCs are capable of reducing the cost-per-watt of harvesting solar power, their efficiency is still too low to be competitive with conventional PV technology.  The future outlook and commercial viability of LSC systems beyond niche application is dependent upon the development of improved waveguide structures and/or highly efficient, non-self-absorbing fluorescent materials.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [7055], "author_name_tesi": "Wilton, Samuel Richard", "last_name_ssi": "Wilton", "middle_name_ssi": "Richard", "first_name_ssi": "Samuel", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Jian Xu"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Jian Xu, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Luminescent Solar Concentrator", "LSC", "Photovoltaics", "Solar Concentrator", "Solar Energy", "Monte Carlo", "Ray Tracing", "Optical Waveguiding", "Flourescence", "Dyes", "Quantum Dots", "PbSe", "Cost Optimization", "GoldSim Pro", "Building Integrated Photovoltaics", "BIPV"]}, {"year_isi": 2016, "title_ssi": "Nanostructured Transition Metal Sulfide Catalysts for Electrochemical Water Splitting", "id": "29616", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "12721", "defended_at_dtsi": "2016-05-05T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "With the world\u2019s population steadily on the rise, there will continue to be an ever-increasing demand for energy.  However, fossil fuels, which currently supply the world with an overwhelming portion of its energy needs, are quickly becoming depleted at a much faster rate than they are being generated.  Most people use fossil fuels for their everyday energy needs, namely because compared to other alternative energy sources, it is cheaper and much more readily accessible.  However, if one is looking to invest in a sustainable, long-term solution to the energy crisis that we currently face, these non-renewable energy sources are less than ideal.  One possible solution to this problem is to begin using hydrogen as a fuel source instead.  Hydrogen is an ideal alternative for a number of reasons, namely because it possesses the largest energy density by mass of any element, and that burning it produces no harmful byproducts, only water.  The current industry standard for hydrogen production is primarily limited to production via steam-methane reformation and the water-gas shift reaction.  However, these processes are not ideal for large-scale hydrogen production, and are detrimental to the environment because of the large amounts of CO and CO2 that are produced.  One potentially cleaner alternative is proposed through electrochemical water splitting, whereby water is decomposed in hydrogen and oxygen.  However, materials that catalyze these reactions are often quite rare and expensive, examples being Pt and IrO2.  For this reason, the work hereafter aims to seek out new Earth-abundant materials, with a focus on transition metal sulfide systems, which can be used as catalysts to help catalyze the decomposition of water.  Our work begins by investigating the catalytic activity of CuCo2S4 nanoparticles for the oxygen evolution reaction.  Much of the focus insofar has been primarily concerned with transition metal oxide-based materials, however, metal sulfide systems are slowly gaining momentum.  Those that do exist and have been tested for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), often show moderate activity.  By introducing additional elements into the system, we hope to further enhance the material\u2019s OER activity.  Highly crystalline and nonagglomerated colloidal CuCo2S4 nanoparticles, which were previously inaccessible in the literature, were synthesized using low-temperature, solution-based synthetic routes.  The CuCo2S4 nanoparticles were found to be highly active for OER under strongly alkaline conditions.  Surface studies of the material suggest that mixed-metal sulfides, such as CuCo2S4, may in fact serve as precursors to oxides and/or hydroxides, which are likely the catalytically active species in solution.  In addition to the work on the OER half reaction, a number of cobalt (Co3S4, CoS, Co9S8) and nickel sulfide (Ni3S2, \u03b1-NiS, Ni9S8, Ni3S4) nanoparticle systems were investigated for use as potential hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts.  These materials were the target of this study because of their relatively low cost and high abundance within the Earth\u2019s crust, as well as because they are know hydrodesulfurization (HDS) catalysts.

This is why it is strange that his two final publications, The Use of Pleasure and The Care of the Self, have received little systematic treatment.  My dissertation builds on Foucault\u2019s final two works to answer longstanding questions raised by his thought surrounding the relation of modern social and political institutions to the history of moral thought.\nFoucault\u2019s final two works returned to antiquity in order the study primogenitors of the moral ideas that would shape and guide the development of certain prevalent contemporary social and political institutions.  Unfortunately, Foucault died before he could carry his moral researches forward to their contact point with the birth of the contemporary social and political institutions that he studies in Discipline and Punish and S\u00e9curit\u00e9, Territoire, Population.  \nI follow up on his research by gathering together the nascent lines of thought that Foucault left in interviews, articles, and the Foucault Archive in France.  I extend these thoughts on the morality of antiquity forward in time through an original examination of medieval Christian thought, specifically that surrounding coenobitical monasticism and pastoral life.  Through this extension, I am able to tie together the moral line of thought that Foucault began in antiquity with his analyses of the disciplines and governmentality, which were both highly influenced by coenobitical monasticism and the pastoral.\nThese studies reveal the complex contemporary interlinking of many areas of politics (the government of others) and morality (the government of the self).  The result of this complex and deep intertwining is that many of the problems facing social and governmental institutions cannot be solved without also addressing basic moral issues as well.  For example, Christian morality, as laid out in the Rule of St. Benedict and Pastoral Care by Gregory the Great, emphasizes man\u2019s sinful nature through a focus on the Fall and the crucifixion.  These texts conclude that, as a result of man\u2019s indelibly sinful and limited nature, man requires guidance by God or one of his lieutenants (priests, bishops, saints, etc.) in order to properly carry out a moral life.  The effect of this insight on moral life is that self-governance becomes focused on obediance and submission to moral superiors as central values.  In the dissertation, I draw on Foucault to show that many of the basic social institutions of the West inherit this understanding that people are generally incapable of their own self-governance without expert guidance.  To begin to see this, one can look to the powerful need that people feel today to consult experts in order to carry out \u2018proper\u2019 career, family, fashion, financial, health, sexual, and political decisions.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1085], "author_name_tesi": "Wimberly, Cory Michael", "last_name_ssi": "Wimberly", "middle_name_ssi": "Michael", "first_name_ssi": "Cory", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Philosophy", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Charles Edward Scott", "Nancy A Tuana", "Dennis Schmidt", "John Philip Christman", "Jeffrey Nealon"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Charles Edward Scott, Committee Chair", "Nancy A Tuana, Committee Chair", "Dennis Schmidt, Committee Member", "John Philip Christman, Committee Member", "Jeffrey Nealon, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["foucault", "morality", "benedict", "freedom", "final"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "Experimental Evaluation of Fluidic Flexible Matrix Composite Actuators", "id": "16355", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7851", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-05-24T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A unique quality of composites made with a stiff reinforcement fiber and soft matrix material is that they are able to deform in complicated ways when stresses are applied due to highly directional stiffness properties. When this ability is employed in a tubular structure filled with fluid, interesting shape and stiffness changes can occur as a function of the pressure applied to the fluid.  These tubes, called fluidic flexible matrix composites (F2MCs), are a new type of adaptive material.  Until recently, most research and experimentation on F2MCs has been with simple thin walled filament wound tubes. There is currently a push to develop different variations of this concept suitable for a variety of applications. For example, some applications call for embedding the F2MC tubes into stiffer materials and others might need smaller and lighter tubes than those that can be made by filament winding. The objectives of this investigation are to investigate the performance filament wound F2MCs embedded into stiffer media and the performance of small-diameter braided F2MCs. Three main ways were employed to evaluate the performance of F2MC\u2019s:  free axial strain versus pressure; axial force versus pressure in the blocked condition (no  axial strain); and the axial modulus of elasticity without any internal fluid. Some key results obtained from these test include large underperformances of F2MC actuators versus predictions, especially in several of the blocked force tests. As can be expected, large drops in performance accrued when F2MCs were placed into a stiff medium.  It was also found that small diameter braided F2MCs could be made and used as actuators. It is suggested that more research into the three dimensional properties and states of deformation of the various composites might improve correspondence between theory and experiments. Factors such as interlaminar shear deformation, viscoelasticity, and end effects due to the grip fittings should be further explored, as well.

The processing of increased amounts of sour crude oils has yielded higher levels of sulfur in the available decant oil feedstocks. High levels of sulfur in decant oils (DO), typically greater than 0.5 weight percent, can result in unacceptable levels of sulfur (>0.5 wt%) in the needle coke. During subsequent graphitization of the needle coke for electrode production, the sulfur is released through a process called \u201cpuffing\u201d which reduces the quality of the electrode. The overall objective of this thesis study was to investigate the possible use of hydrodesulfurization (HDS) for decreasing the sulfur content of the starting decant oils, including the effect of hydrodesulfurizing conditions and catalyst type on sulfur removal, chemical composition of the DO, and the effect on mesophase formation and final coke properties.\n     Three decant oils containing different concentrations of sulfur were chosen to represent low-, medium-, and high-sulfur feedstocks. These DO were analyzed for their elemental composition. The GC amenable portion of the low- and medium-sulfur DO was also quantitatively analyzed by GC/MS to determine their molecular composition. The GC/MS analysis revealed that the DO consisted of normal alkanes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The PAH included 2-ring (naphthalens), 3-ring (phenanthrenes), and 4-ring (pyrenes, and chrysenes) PAH and their alkylated analogs. Significant differences were observed in the molecular composition between the low- and medium-sulfur decant oils. The medium-sulfur DO contained greater amounts of n-alkanes, 2- and 3-ring PAH, while the low-sulfur DO contained greater amounts of 4-ring PAH. A detailed analysis of the sulfur-containing PAH was also performed on the GC amenable portion of each DO using the GC/MS. Approximately equal amounts of dibenzothiophenes (DBT) and benzonaphthothiophenes (BNT) were contained in the low-sulfur decant oil. However, roughly 2/3 of the sulfur compounds contained in the medium-sulfur decant oil were heavier BNT. The medium-sulfur DO also contained low concentrations of benzothiophenes (BT).\n     The HDS of DO was performed in a bench-scale reactor using different types of catalyst, catalyst bed temperatures, H2 pressures, and liquid hourly space velocities (LHSV). Using the high-sulfur DO as feedstock, the HDS results clearly show that a traditional CoMo catalyst achieved greater sulfur reduction than a NiCoMo catalyst containing larger pores. Additional HDS experiments demonstrated that the goal of 0.5 wt.% sulfur could be achieved in the low-sulfur decant oil at relatively low temperatures and H2 pressures at a LHSV of 1.0 h-1. While the target of 0.5 wt.% sulfur could also be achieved in the medium-sulfur DO, higher catalyst bed temperatures and/or H2 pressures were required.\n     Under relatively mild reaction conditions the HDS catalyst showed significant reactivity for BT, DBT, and BNT. The most refractory sulfur species to the CoMo catalyst are the dimethyl-, trimethyl DBT and methyl-, dimethyl- and trimethyl- BNT. These alkylated sulfur compounds are assumed to be those with methyl group-induced steric hindrance to the catalyst such as 4,6-DMDBT. The catalyst also demonstrated activity for the hydrogenation of aromatic compounds and hydrocracking of alkanes in the decant oils. Slight changes were exhibited in n- alkanes, while more significant hydrogenation of PAH were observed in both DO. Reductions of naphthalenes, phenanthrenes, and chrysenes were observed, with chrysenes being the most prone to hydrogenation. Pyrene was observed to be the most resistant PAH to hydrogenation during HDS. Some evidence was also seen for the hydrocracking of the HDS hydroaromatic compounds.\n     Subsequent carbonization of the parent decant oils and several HDS products clearly showed that HDS of decant oils can result in an improvement in the quality of mesophase development, as measured by an optical texture index (OTI), with increasing severity of HDS. However, with additional sulfur reduction, the quality of mesophase was observed to decrease. This decrease may be attributed to the presence of additional hydroaromatics and biphenyls formed during HDS.", "semester_ssi": "Summer", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8496], "author_name_tesi": "Wincek, Ronald Thomas", "last_name_ssi": "Wincek", "middle_name_ssi": "Thomas", "first_name_ssi": "Ronald", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Energy and Geo-Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Semih Eser"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Semih Eser, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Decant Oil", "Needle Coke", "Hydrodesulfurization", "Delayed Coking", "Mesophase"]}, {"year_isi": 2012, "title_ssi": "A Phase-field Investigation of Domain Structures in Ferroelectric Bismuth Ferrite Thin Films", "id": "16260", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "7816", "defended_at_dtsi": "2012-06-25T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The ferroelectric domain structure of multiferroic BiFeO3 thin films are strongly affected by the electrical boundary conditions. We employ a Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire phase-field model to investigate the effects of the electrical boundary conditions on domain structure in BiFeO3 thin films. We examine the domain structure under short-circuit and under open-circuit boundary conditions with varying levels of compensation. As the degree of compensation changes, we find a smooth transition between the two types of domain structure. In the open-circuit case, we note small triangular nanodomains at the surface/wall interfaces that may be useful in nanoelectronic applications. \nThe ferroelectric domain structures of epitaxial BiFeO3 thin films on miscut substrates were studied using a phase-field model. The effects of substrate vicinality towards (100) are considered by assuming charge-compensated surface and film/substrate interface. The predicted domain structures show remarkable agreement with existing experimental observations, including domain wall orientations and local topological domain configurations. The roles of elastic, electric, and gradient energies on the domain structures were analyzed. It is shown that the substrate strain anisotropy due to the miscut largely determines the domain variant selection and domain configurations. \nWe employ phase-field modeling to explore the elastic properties of artificially-created 1-D domain walls in (001)p-oriented BiFeO3 thin films. The walls are composed of a junction of the four polarization variants, all with the same out-of-plane polarization: a \u201cvortex\u201d is comprised of polarization variants rotating around the junction, and an \u201canti-vortex\u201d is comprised of two polarization variants pointing towards the junction and two pointing away. It was found that these junctions exhibit peculiarly high electroelastic fields induced by the neighboring ferroelastic/ferroelectric domains. These fields may contribute to the segregation of charged defects and charge carriers to the vortex and anti-vortex cores. \nWe use a Ginzburg-Landau-Devonshire model to explore localized switching in epitaxial BiFeO3 thin films. We considered switching under a PFM tip for a range of misfit strains as well as in the proximity of a 71\u00b0 domain wall. We find a strong correlation between the mismatch strain and coercive bias, in good agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results.

However, the neural underpinnings of these spontaneous hemodynamic signals are not clear.\nWe tested how well spontaneous hemodynamic signals correspond to local neural activity by making simultaneous cerebral blood volume (CBV) and electrophysiological measurements from the somatosensory cortex of awake, head-fixed mice during periods of rest, sensory stimulation, and volitional movement. Large spontaneous CBV changes in the absence of sensory input were primarily driven by volitional whisker and body movements, indicating that unmonitored behaviors could contribute to hemodynamic variance in resting state neuroimaging studies. We then quantified neurovascular coupling as the transfer function between measured neural activity and CBV. We showed that the temporal dynamics of the vascular response to increased neural activity were similar across behavioral states.\nHowever, individual CBV changes were weakly predictive of the corresponding local neural activity during periods of rest. To discern the origin of resting state CBV, we perturbed local neural activity and observed that spontaneous fluctuations in CBV and vessel diameter persisted when local neural spiking, glutamatergic input, and noradrenergic modulation were blocked.

In this study, sources of occupant information are used to demonstrate the decision process. \nThe decision process begins with agents formulating context specific opinions using a method that is derived from Bayesian Networks and probabilistic graphical modeling. From there, agents convey their preferences using conditional game theory, setting up the group of agents for action. While there are a variety of action procedures that could be used, the process was developed with Nash equilibriums in mind. The Nash equilibriums, however, were not yet successfully implemented due to the early stages of the social influence modeling. Instead, a basic social welfare function was employed to demonstrate the decision process for a setpoint decision context. \nA three zone, variable air volume simulator was developed in MATLAB to represent a physical environment and to act as a reference case for typical PI control. The simulator is then used for exploring and describing the decision process implementation, which is run in parallel to the basic system simulator.

The test fixture applied pure rotations to the mobile plate of the platform and did not permit the mobile platform to translate.\nAn orientation sensor, which incorporated a dual-axis inclinometer and a rotary encoder, was designed to interface with the test fixture to directly and accurately measure the orientation of the platform. The modular orientation sensor was designed to be easy to install and remove. Furthermore, the attachment plate of the orientation sensor was given a simple design so that the sensor could be used to calibrate nearly any Stewart platform. A calibration algorithm was developed which minimized the error of the orientation angles calculated from the linear displacement sensor measurements by updating the positions of the embedded displacement sensors relative to their as-designed values. The calibration was shown to reduce the maximum error in the predicted orientation angles by a factor of 10 to 0.5\u00b0 or less. The average errors in the predicted orientations were all less than 0.1\u00b0 after calibration.", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [8158], "author_name_tesi": "Winslow, Anna Tatum", "last_name_ssi": "Winslow", "middle_name_ssi": "Tatum", "first_name_ssi": "Anna", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Aerospace Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward A Smith", "George A Lesieutre"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward A Smith, Thesis Advisor", "George A Lesieutre, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["Stewart platform", "sensor", "Gough platform", "orientation", "calibration"]}, {"year_isi": 2009, "title_ssi": "Bacterial Adhesion to Metal Oxide Surfaces in the Presence of Natural Organic Matter\n\n", "id": "9617", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "1026", "defended_at_dtsi": "2009-05-29T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "An understanding of the interaction between natural organic matter and metal oxides is critical to predicting bacterial adhesion in natural systems. The objective of this research was to examine bacterial adhesion to various metal oxide surfaces in the presence of humic acids using nanoscale atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments. AFM was used to measure the adhesion force between standard silicon nitride AFM probes (i.e. bacterial surrogates) and various surfaces before and after humic acid adsorption as a function of residence time. Five surfaces were analyzed in this study, including three metal oxide surfaces (Fe2O3, Al2O3, and TiO2), a glass microscope slide (SiO2), and freshly-cleaved muscovite mica. Adhesion to each surface was quantified in terms of both the overall interaction between the AFM probe and the surface (i.e. the average force or Favg) as well as the localized interaction between the AFM probe and the stickiest five percent of the surface sites (i.e. the sticky force or F5). Spectral force analysis (SFA) was introduced as a useful tool for analyzing the distribution of adhesion forces on a surface by simultaneously providing insight into the effect of humic acid adsorption, residence time, and the small number of highly sticky surface sites. \n\nAdhesion force to the uncoated surfaces increased in the order SiO2 < mica < TiO2 < Al2O3 < Fe2O3, irrespective of whether the average (Favg) or sticky (F5) forces were analyzed. Increasing the tip-surface residence time resulted in an overall increase in adhesion force but not a change in the relative stickiness of the five surfaces. At short residence times (i.e. zero seconds) humic acid adsorption resulted in an increase in adhesion force on all surfaces except mica and Fe2O3, irrespective of whether the average forces or sticky forces were analyzed. At long residence times (i.e. ten seconds) humic acid adsorption resulted in an increase in adhesion force on all surfaces except mica and Fe2O3 when considering the average forces. When considering the sticky forces at long residence times, humic acid adsorption resulted in an increase in adhesion force on all surfaces except Fe2O3.\n \nNo consistent explanation could account for the observed results, although arguments based on electrostatics and surface roughness could explain the tip-surface interaction in certain instances. It was concluded that standard silicon nitride AFM probes are not ideal bacterial surrogates, so further work with colloid AFM and bacteria is needed to better understand bacterial adhesion to metal oxides in the presence of natural organic matter.\n\n\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [1016], "author_name_tesi": "Winslow III, Charles John", "last_name_ssi": "Winslow III", "middle_name_ssi": "John", "first_name_ssi": "Charles", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Environmental Engineering", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan", "Bruce Ernest Logan", "William D Burgos", "James David Kubicki"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "Bruce Ernest Logan, Thesis Advisor", "William D Burgos, Thesis Advisor", "James David Kubicki, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["natural organic matter", "metal oxides", "atomic force microscopy", "AFM", "bacterial adhesion"]}, {"year_isi": 2001, "title_ssi": "OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS TO AVOID PHOSPHORUS LOADING ON A PASTURE-BASED PENNSYLVANIA DAIRY FARM", "id": "5879", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2991", "defended_at_dtsi": "2001-05-18T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "\tExcessive phosphorus accumulation in the soil poses a threat to water quality.

The percentage of feed nutrients that are imported onto the farm is shown to play an important role in maintaining a soil phosphorus balance.  A multi-objective feeding strategy is shown to have no effect on phosphorus excretion for a management-intensive grazing system at the milk production levels modeled.

Future integration of silicon nanowires into commercial devices requires the development and further refinement of methods for synthesizing and assembling these nanowires into densely packed rational structures with high accuracy and repeatability. Current methods have two broad classifications: \u201cgrow-and-place\u201d and \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d. The former procedure involves forming the nanowires away from their final orientation, harvesting them from this growth area, and finally placing them in desired positions. The latter procedure sidesteps the problems associated with the harvesting and placement steps of the \u201cgrow-and-place\u201d method by forming the nanowires in their final preferred arrangement.\nIn this thesis, we propose a novel self-assembling variation of the \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d approach for SiNW growth where the interfacial area of the nanochannel template interface can be formed out of various materials. This research has improved on our group\u2019s previous in-template \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d approach by growing SiNWs with smooth morphology and good electrical properties upon partial exposure while still retaining the benefits of the original \u201cgrow-in-place\u201d approach, including good control of the SiNW size, number, orientation, position, and shape. The SiNWs grown using this approach were found to be morphologically smooth, composed of crystalline silicon and exhibited good electrical characteristics.\nAdditionally, in this thesis we explore the use of a metal adhesion layer as a means of controlling SiNW electrical characteristics. Specifically, this thesis compared\niii\nelectrical characteristics of SiNWs grown using aluminum or titanium as an adhesion layer versus SiNWs grown without an adhesion layer and found that the SiNWs grown with aluminum or titanium as an adhesion layer were, on average, 6 or 9 times, respectively, more conductive than the SiNWs grown without an adhesion layer.\nFinally, this thesis presents evidence that nanowires grown using built-in platinum contacts form in a dual-material structure. This evidence is in the form of high- magnification FESEM images. It is suggested that, in the inter-contact region, the platinum silicide grew as the \u201cshell\u201d of the nanowire structure and that the core remained silicon because of the physical configuration of the nanochannel.\n", "semester_ssi": "Spring", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [933], "author_name_tesi": "Winter, Christopher Aylwin", "last_name_ssi": "Winter", "middle_name_ssi": "Aylwin", "first_name_ssi": "Christopher", "degree_name_ssi": "MS", "degree_description_ssi": "Master of Science", "degree_type_ssi": "Master Thesis", "program_name_ssi": "Engineering Science", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Stephen Fonash", "Stephen Joseph Fonash", "Jun Huang", "Jerzy Ruzyllo"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Stephen Fonash, Thesis Advisor", "Stephen Joseph Fonash, Thesis Advisor", "Jun Huang, Thesis Advisor", "Jerzy Ruzyllo, Thesis Advisor"], "keyword_ssim": ["silicon nanowire", "growth"]}, {"year_isi": 2010, "title_ssi": "The Regulation of mTORC1 Signaling Through Multiple Simultaneous Stimulatory Inputs To The TSC1/2 Complex\n", "id": "11094", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "2918", "defended_at_dtsi": "2010-07-09T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein kinase exists in two distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  The mTORC1 signaling pathway is involved in numerous cellular processes, including cell growth and protein synthesis, as well as various physiological and pathophysiological conditions, including muscle hypertrophy, inflammation, cancer, and diabetes.  Upstream of mTORC1 the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), comprised of TSC1 and TSC2, functions to inhibit mTORC1 signaling.  This inhibition can be relieved by hormonal and lipid inputs, which induce the phosphorylation of TSC2 resulting in the inhibition of the TSC1/2 complex.  In fact, the activation of mTORC1 is tightly regulated by nutrients, hormones, and lipids, particularly the branched chain amino acid (AA) leucine, insulin, and phosphatidic acid (PA) respectively.  While the insulin-mediated activation of mTORC1 is largely elucidated, the mechanism through which PA and AAs function is not currently understood.  Additionally, although the individual effect of each agonist on mTORC1 signaling has been studied, further research is required to identify the relative contribution of each input.\n\nTherefore, the first aim of this work was to identify the mechanism through which PA functions to stimulate mTORC1 activity.  The present studies demonstrate that PA functions through a receptor based mechanism that stimulates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade.  The inhibition of ERK signaling blocked the PA-mediated stimulation of mTORC1 signaling, clearly demonstrating that the primary mechanism utilized by PA to stimulate mTORC1 is activation of the ERK cascade.  Additionally, AAs and PA signal to mTORC1 through parallel pathways, as mTORC1 signaling increased additively in response to leucine and PA treatments.  This is significant since the literature suggests that AAs signal to mTORC1 through the production of PA.  \n\nThe second aim examined mTORC1 signaling in response to the activation of two signaling cascades that are involved in muscle hypertrophy, the ERK and protein kinase B (PKB) pathways.  It was demonstrated that ERK and PKB, also called Akt, increased mTORC1 signaling through parallel pathways.  The inhibition of either pathway reduced mTORC1 signaling partially in response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and insulin treatment, which activate ERK and Akt respectively.  The inhibition of both pathways completely blocked mTORC1 signaling in response to either agonist.  Further, in the absence of TSC2, neither ERK nor Akt regulated mTORC1 signaling.  This suggests that a functional TSC1/2 complex is required for the ERK- and Akt-mediated regulation of mTORC1 signaling.\n\nOverall, the data presented herein demonstrate that the combination of multiple stimulatory inputs increase mTORC1 signaling in an additive fashion.  This is due to both TSC1/2 dependent and independent mechanisms, as LPA and insulin signal to mTORC1 through the inactivation of TSC1/2 while it is known that the leucine-mediated stimulation of mTORC1 signaling does not require TSC1/2.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [2912], "author_name_tesi": "Winter, Jeremiah Nathanael", "last_name_ssi": "Winter", "middle_name_ssi": "Nathanael", "first_name_ssi": "Jeremiah", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Integrative Biosciences", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr.", "Scot R Kimball", "Ralph Lauren Keil", "David Antonetti, Ph D"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Dissertation Advisor", "Leonard Shelton Jefferson Jr., Committee Chair", "Scot R Kimball, Committee Member", "Ralph Lauren Keil, Committee Member", "David Antonetti, Ph D, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["lysophosphatidic acid", "TSC", "ERK", "Akt", "protein kinase B", "leucine", "phosphatidic acid", "PLD", "mTORC1", "LPAAT", "PLA", "Rag proteins"]}, {"year_isi": 2007, "title_ssi": "THE IN VIVO EXPRESSION OF THE FORCE-LENGTH RELATIONSHIP\nAND ITS EFFECT ON SUSTAINED ISOMETRIC FORCE\n", "id": "7726", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "5672", "defended_at_dtsi": "2007-06-21T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "A fundamental property of muscle is the relationship between muscle fiber length and the force it produces. In vivo this relationship is expressed when isometric muscle actions are produced. In this study two aspects of the force-length properties of muscle will be examined. Firstly the source of expressed section of the force-length curve in vivo will be examined, and secondly the fluctuations in force during isometric muscle actions will be examined.\n\nA generalized model of a mono-articular muscle-tendon complex was used to examine the effect of various model parameters on the section of the force-length relationship operated over for a 90 degree joint range of motion. Key architectural properties of muscle were identified and then were systematically varied in the model to examine their influence on the expressed section of the force-length curve. It was shown that the ratio of tendon resting length to muscle fiber optimum length was important in determining the amount of variability in the expressed section of the force-length curve. The effect of this ratio was modulated by the ratio of muscle fiber optimum length to average moment arm. These results indicate there is scope for inter-individual variation in the expressed section of the force-length curve.\n\nIn groups of young (19 to 28 years old) and young-old females (66 to 71 years old) isometric knee extensions were performed at 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of maximum effort. The fluctuations in the moment records were quantified using standard statistical techniques (e.g. standard deviation and coefficient of variation) and methods from statistical physics (e.g., signal complexity, and signal fractal properties). There was no difference between age groups or effort levels in the coefficient of variation. The young females demonstrated more complexity in the knee joint moment signal at all effort levels. There was also different fractal like scaling behavior over shorter and longer timescales, suggesting that two or more different processes may be responsible for the fluctuations in the joint moment during isometric contractions. Young-old females generally demonstrated scaling characteristics that indicated more slowly repeating processes. To investigate to what extent these differences were influenced by strength levels a similar group of young and young-old females participated in a ten week program of strength training. Strength training produced a small decrease in the coefficient of variation but not in the standard deviation of the moment record in both the young and the older age groups. The complexity of the joint moment record and the fractal like scaling remained unchanged due to training, this suggests that these measures reflect a training resistant factor that deteriorates with age, a possible candidate is the calcium kinetics at the level of the sarcoplasmic reticulum.\n\nIn the final experiment a single muscle was examined, which was the first dorsal interosseus. By using this muscle the length and potentially the expressed section of the force-length curve could be manipulated. Subjects produced isometric contractions at long, medium and short muscle lengths and at 5%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of maximum in three finger positions corresponding to short, medium, and long muscle lengths. The fractal like properties of the signal indicated that two or more different processes may be responsible for the fluctuations in the force produced during isometric contractions. The magnitude of the coefficient of variation was greatest at short muscle lengths, and the fractal like properties were also altered at these lengths; there was no indication of any influence of expressed section. Different motor unit firing characteristics required to achieve full activation at short muscle lengths may explain these results. The differences in the results for this muscle compared with the quadriceps muscle may be due to differences in the relative contributions of motor unit recruitment and rate coding to force gradation in these muscles.\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5668], "author_name_tesi": "Winter, Samantha Lee", "last_name_ssi": "Winter", "middle_name_ssi": "Lee", "first_name_ssi": "Samantha", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["John Henry Challis", "Philip Martin", "Robert Barry Eckhardt", "James Landis Rosenberger"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["John Henry Challis, Committee Chair", "Philip Martin, Committee Member", "Robert Barry Eckhardt, Committee Member", "James Landis Rosenberger, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["force-length relationship", "biomechanics", "steadiness"]}, {"year_isi": 2018, "title_ssi": "The Role of White Matter Integrity in Age-Related Language Production Differences", "id": "15205sow5180", "access_level_ss": "restricted_to_institution", "db_id": "15205", "defended_at_dtsi": "2018-03-13T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "Despite having equal comprehension ability, older adults have more language production difficulties than younger adults (Diaz, Johnson, Burke, & Madden, 2014).

This study explored the relationship between white matter integrity and age-related language deficits using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) to test hypotheses generated by the Transmission Deficit Hypothesis and the Inhibition Deficit Hypothesis. Findings supported the Transmission Deficit Hypothesis; white matter integrity declined across the brain but the relationship between white matter integrity and outcomes only manifest in phonological behaviors and phonological-task activation.

Good work, which stems from Harvard University\u2019s Good Work Project, is work that is excellent, personally engaging, and serves a broader social need. In this project, I position good work, education, and democratic citizenship as the conceptual framework of democracy. Each can be considered important elements of an enlightened democratic community. Each has been the object of considerable bodies of scholarship. Each carries assumptions and obligations for individuals and publics. Yet in many ways, good work, education, and democratic citizenship lie outside of a unified consideration of their interactive nature. By focusing on the role of the Enlightenment in defining the principles that are most cherished by modern democracy, I hope to stimulate deep reflection among citizens, journalists, and journalism educators about those principles that ought to guide our understandings of our roles and responsibilities as citizens and professionals. When good work can be leveraged in this way, journalists and educators are better able to fulfill their duty to build democratic capacity among citizens.

Part of this growing proportion is attributed to contracting the disease later in life. Older adults continue to date and have sex well into their 80s. Online dating has gained popularity with adults age 50 and older as a means for finding potential romantic partners. There is a gap in the science related to what older adults who date online know about HIV prevention as well as the factors that might put them at risk for contracting the disease.\n\nPurpose: This study explored the feasibility of conducting online research regarding HIV prevention factors (i.e., risk perception, sexual risk behaviors, and self-efficacy to take action to prevent HIV) in older adult online daters. Also, this research sought to modify and test instruments related to HIV prevention factors in an older adult population.\n\nMethods: A cross-sectional, descriptive correlational design was employed. Adults age 50 and older who had used online dating sites within the past year were recruited online to complete a survey. The study instrument included HIV prevention scale items that had undergone two rounds of expert panel review. Based on the expert panel review, the HIV prevention scale items overall were comprised of (a) original items, (b) modified items, and (c) new items from both the Condom Use Self-Efficacy Scale and Sexual Risks Scale. The data were analyzed using descriptive and correlational statistics. The 31 items from the HIV prevention scale underwent exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to determine factor structure and model fit.\n\nResults: A total of N = 280 older adults participated in the study. SurveyMonkey Audience and Facebook were the best recruitment sites in terms of numbers of participants recruited. Participants were not able to be recruited from online dating sites. Most of the participants (72.8%) desired a relationship that included sex and 64.6% (n = 181) had at least one sexual relationship in the past year. Of the sexually active participants, only 29% used a condom with every sexual encounter, 45% never used a condom, and 26% had inconsistent condom use. Participants\u2019 risky sexual behavior and low perceived susceptibility to HIV were incongruous with their agreement that they would take precautions to reduce their risk of contracting HIV. Higher self-efficacy had moderate to strong associations with the intention to take action to reduce the risk of HIV. In CFA, the HIV prevention items loaded on eight different factors in three different models. The factors for Model 1 (Mechanics, Advocacy, Intoxicants), Model 2 (Attitudes, Normative Beliefs, Perceived Susceptibility), and Model 3 (Intention, Expectations) had adequate to excellent model fit. \n\nConclusions: This study was the first to examine HIV prevention factors in older online daters as well as attempt to adapt instruments that measure HIV prevention factors in older adults. Older adults are dating online and have risky behaviors related to sex. Conducting an online survey examining HIV prevention factors in older online daters was both feasible and acceptable. The finding of participants with high levels of sexual risk behavior but low levels of condom use and low HIV risk perception suggests the critical need to target older online daters for HIV prevention interventions.

Hence, the profession becomes gendered due to the persons who primarily engage in the work and the characteristic that is primarily associated with the profession \u2013 caring. When men enter the profession, they are challenging the gendered image of the profession. Those individuals who socialize men to the profession are primarily females. Research informs us that males have special needs when being socialized into what are considered the \u201cfemale\u201d professions.\n\tTo date, although there have been studies on males who enter female professions from the male\u2019s perspective; there have been no studies which explore the females who socialize men to these professions. This study used the theoretical lens of symbolic interactionism to study the interactions of female nursing instructors as they socialize men to the nursing profession. \n\tBasic qualitative was the research type used to guide the study. Methods of observation and semi-structured interviews where employed to unearth the symbolic nature of interactions. Participants were observed while interacting with male students within a patient care area. Results were coded and themes emerged from the data that identified instructors view male students having special needs that, to some extent, set them apart from their female counterparts. Notably, most of these perceived needs of male students involve assisting the male to cope with role strain experienced when socializing to the nursing profession as well as assisting the male in learning how integrate and navigate in a female dominated profession. \nThe instructors in this study utilized strategies which they have learned via experience. Based on the findings, a discussion regarding the impact of gender on professional role socialization of men to a female-dominated profession with implications for educational practice is presented.  \n\n", "semester_ssi": "Fall", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [5144], "author_name_tesi": "Wise, Rita Ellen Mullen", "last_name_ssi": "Wise", "middle_name_ssi": "Ellen Mullen", "first_name_ssi": "Rita", "degree_name_ssi": "DED", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Education", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Adult Education", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Edward W Taylor", "Edward W Taylor", "Patricia Angelica Cranton", "Kamini Grahame", "Raymonde Ann Brown"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Edward W Taylor, Dissertation Advisor", "Edward W Taylor, Committee Chair", "Patricia Angelica Cranton, Committee Member", "Kamini Grahame, Committee Member", "Raymonde Ann Brown, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["Symbolic Interaction", "Nursing Education", "Gender", "Male Nurses", "Female Occupations"]}, {"year_isi": 1999, "title_ssi": "SPINE MECHANICAL RESPONSE TO STATIC AXIAL COMPRESSION LOAD:  AN MRI STUDY IN VIVO", "id": "5806", "access_level_ss": "open_access", "db_id": "6516", "defended_at_dtsi": "1999-08-04T08:00:00Z", "abstract_tesi": "   Spine pathology, in particular, low back pain syndrome (LBPS), is one of the most prevalent medical problems in western societies.  The estimated incidence rate is as high as 75-80% of all adults.  Biomechanical factors are important in the pathogenesis of LBPS, yet little is known about the mechanical function of the spine (lumbar or otherwise) in vivo.  \n   A spine compression unit (SCU) made of non-metallic materials was constructed and calibrated to apply specified loads on the spine.  Axial compression is the dominant load component in most activities because torso muscles create large internal compression loads on the lumbar spine, but torso musculature was relatively inactive during pilot loading experiments, and the total spine compression force was estimated to be equal to the external force of the SCU.  \n   Magnetic resonance images of subjects' lumbar spines were acquired in relaxed and loaded (1.0 BW axial compression) states to characterize spine mechanical function in vivo.  Subjects' spines shortened 3.9\u00b11.2 mm during a ten minute loading.  Segment compression, bending, and rotation of the lumber region were contributing factors, but bending was the dominant influence on lumbar shortening in five of eight subjects.  Lumbar rotation dominated the shortening in two subjects and shared equal influence with compression in one subject.  Those three subjects had distinctly different shaped spines compared to the other five (and compared to each other; especially one spine).  Pure compression was insubstantial in most cases, but five individual segments compressed more than 1.0 mm.  Changes opposite to the passive direction in all three components of shortening suggested the presence of an active component(s) in the overall response.  \n   Flexion and posterior translation of the disc at the lumbosacral joint, and posterior sacral translation described the most common response pattern of the lumbosacral joint.  Still, only four subjects underwent that exact aggregate response pattern.  There were changes opposite to each of those trends, and the subjects did not group according the initial spine shape as they did with regard to the shortening mechanism.  \n   Posterior sacral rotation and lumbosacral flexion represented changes that would require muscle activity.  Gluteal muscles were probably recruited to control spine posture and help support the load, but their activity was not measured.  Thus, the spine did not act as a passive continuum beam, but rather as a mechanical system driven by actuators (muscles).  \n   The present results characterize the deformation response patterns of the lumbar spine during loading, and they serve as a reference point for further investigation at different scales (e.g. the thoracolumbar spine or the intervertebral disc).\n", "read_access_group_ssim": ["public"], "final_submission_file_isim": [6515], "author_name_tesi": "Wisleder, Deric ", "last_name_ssi": "Wisleder", "middle_name_ssi": "", "first_name_ssi": "Deric", "degree_name_ssi": "PHD", "degree_description_ssi": "Doctor of Philosophy", "degree_type_ssi": "Dissertation", "program_name_ssi": "Kinesiology", "committee_member_name_ssim": ["Mark Latash", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky", "Michael Smith", "John Henry Challis"], "committee_member_role_ssim": ["Mark Latash, Committee Member", "Vladimir M Zatsiorsky, Committee Chair", "Michael Smith, Committee Member", "John Henry Challis, Committee Member"], "keyword_ssim": ["biomechanics", "kinesiology", "intervertebral disc", "spine mechanics", "lumbar spine", "magnetic resonance"]}]
